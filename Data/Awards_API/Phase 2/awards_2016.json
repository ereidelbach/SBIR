        "abstract": "NanoSD, Inc. with its partners will develop a transparent, nanostructured thermally insulating film that can be applied to existing single-pane windows to reduce heat loss. To produce the nanostructured film, the team will create hollow ceramic or polymer nanobubbles and consolidate them into a dense lattice structure using heat and compression. Because it is mostly air, the resulting nanobubble structure will exhibit excellent thermal barrier properties. The film can be transparent because the nanostructures are too small to be seen, but achieving this transparency needs processing innovations for assembling the film. The film should also be lightweight, flexible, fire/chemical resistant, soundproof, and condensation resistant. The nanobubble film will be integrated with a low emissivity layer to achieve the final insulating performance. The team will use cost-effective processing and assembly technologies to manufacture its window coating at a cost less than $5 per square foot.",

        "abstract": "Ricin is a category B toxin due to its ease of acquisition, dissemination, and the high potential for morbidity and mortality after exposure. Ricin in semi-purified or purified form is extremely toxic to humans following injection, inhalation, or ingestion and has been used as an agent of bioterrorism. Ricin was recently detected in U.S. government facilities. There are currently no methods of preventing or treating ricin exposure  this represents a major unmet need for protection of civilians and warfighters. Passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has been shown to be effective against a wide variety of infectious agents and toxins. We have identified a highly potent anti-ricin mAb, mPB10. This mAb was shown to protect mice when administered prior to and after ricin challenge. The purpose of this Phase 2 proposal is to prolong the effectiveness of the PB10 mAb to six months after a single injection. This will be accomplished by introducing mutations into the PB10 sequence that are known to increase serum half-life by five-fold. Evaluation of the mAb half-life will be in non-human primates (NHPs). A challenge study where NHPs are administered the PB10 mAb prior to exposure to aerosolized ricin will be conducted.",

        "abstract": "The high-level radioactive nuclear waste resulting from mankind\u2019s usage of nuclear fuels is extremely hazardous to the health and safety of people and living organisms, demanding long-time storage in a remote, yet benign, environment. The disposal of spent nuclear waste in deep crystalline basement rocks has been discussed and promoted in the public domain as a long-term solution to the permanent disposition of these materials. At proposed depths approaching 5 km, the desired physical environment must entail an essentially vertical borehole, very low formation porosities and permeabilities, the presence of either no or highly-saline formation water, and the absence of fracture zones. The Proposed Solution: The company has developed a steerable borehole drilling tool and has successfully shown in field tests its capability to steer a vertical borehole. During Phase 1, feasibility studies and functional and system architectural requirements will be generated to incorporate a natural gamma radiation sensor- to provide information concerning the presence of fracture zones - and a mud resistivity sensor to provide measurements of groundwater salinity. A communications system will also be developed that will enable real-time transmission of the borehole inclination and formation properties to the surface. During Phase II, the system will be designed and prototypes built and tested. Commercial Applications: The resulting commercial product has market applications beyond the drilling of nuclear waste disposal boreholes, including oil and gas exploration and development, groundwater studies, geothermal installations, and geophysical analyses of active fault zones.Key Words: Steerable drilling tool, borehole inclination, formation sensing, downhole communications, real-time data transmission, natural formation gamma radiation, formation water salinity",

The disassemblers send circuit boards to refiners/smelters for precious metals recovery. E-Waste disassemblers remove parts from these circuit boards, so only certain parts are smelted. As such they are the key market for our depopulator. Refiners also have an incentive to remove the parts so that only certain parts are smelted. Both are therefore potential ARR customers.\n\nThe D2000 depopulator removes parts from circuit boards without using chemicals. The precious metals parts go to the smelter as opposed to the whole circuit board. The weight reduction factor is 5:1 which reduces smelting-based pollution by 5:1.\n\nWith the high quality Phase I drawings, the depopulator can/will be assembled shortly after contract award. Phase II funding will allow the assembly of a depopulator which will serve as a basis for product refinement and demonstration to potential customers. This is a key to commercialization as customers wish to see the depopulator.\n\nAs a risk reduction effort, ARR will team with Roboshop, a Syracuse-based company that specializes in the design/fabrication/test of conveyor systems.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II proposal provides a sustainable solution for two major environmental challenges in the agriculture and building industry. In the agriculture industry, swine manure treatment is a major problem, both environmentally and economically. Currently, more than 120 million hogs being produced in the US per year, generating more than 6 billion gallons of swine manure that must be treated. More than 90% of swine manure is stored in lagoons \u2013 resulting in health and environmental problems \u2013 the remaining is being sold to farmers as fertilizers \u2013 with added costs to the hog farmersto store and deliver it. From the construction industry, approximately 10 million tons of Post-Consumer Tear-Off Scrap Shingles (TOSS) and 1 million tons of Manufactured Waste Scrap Shingles (MWSS)are being generated in the United States annually, around 9 million tons of which are being disposed of in landfills every year. Our technology addressed these problems by producing a bio-based rejuvenator to revitalize the oxidized roofing shingles. This allows using scrap roofing shingles as a supplementary source of asphalt binder. The BR2S is a revitalized form of scrap shingles which is palletized and can be introduced to asphalt. The palletized nature of the BR2S will further eliminate the spread of dust and fibers cause by current application of shingles in asphalt plants",

These explosive experiments are lengthy, costly, and non-repeatable: they generate a few hundred bytes of data per dollar of cost. Much counter-proliferation seismic and some infrasonic experimentation can be done more rapidly and dynamically, at dramatically lower cost.

In response to this problem, RadiaBeam Systems proposes to design and build a new, more stable and reliable gun with optimized electromagnetic performance, improved thermal engineering and more robust cathode mounting technique. These tasks will be performed with cutting edge numerical modeling, multi-physics and beam dynamics simulation tools, and also using a proven design methodology developed by the company. This project is proposed as a Fast Track, since there is an immediate need to upgrade the thermionic injector at the Advanced Photon Source, where RadiaBeam and Argonne have jointly developed a tunable THz source. In the Phase I we will develop a prototype RF gun cavity with the improved RF contacts and exchangeable cathode back-plate, build the dummy cavity and RF stand to test the performance of the back-plate, frequency sensitivity, and tuning capability, using the available high power sources. In Phase II, a prototype thermionic RF injector will be fully engineered, fabricated, tested and integrated into the RadiaBeam/APS Terahertz radiation source. Synchrotron light facilities are critical part of the high impact scientific research infrastructure in the US. This project will provide a major upgrade for RF guns, which are used to drive this facilities, as well as emerging compact THz sources. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The goal of this project is to build an instrument that will be immediately used by Argonne National Laboratory in their work on improving stable and reliable operation of the Advanced Photon Source. This project also has an immediate impact on an existing joint APS-RadiaBeam THz radiator program, allowing increasing its power and frequency. In addition, a number of the light source facilities worldwide would be interested in replacing their thermionic RF injectors with an updated and improved version.\n",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research project proposes the design, construction and testing of a   tunable   focusing   quadrupole   and   defocusing   permanent   magnet   system   for   particle accelerators. The main application of the proposed system will be the new concept electron accelerator proposed to be constructed for electron ion collision research. The new concept is a non-scaling Fixed Field Alternating Gradient (NS-FFAG) accelerator, and the use of the permanent magnets instead of electromagnets will drastically reduce the cost of building the accelerator, the operational costs, and allow for a more compact design. Phase I part of the Fast\u2013Track project will be focused on the magnetic design optimization, mechanical stress and cost analysis of a doublet cell consisting of a focusing quadrupole and defocusing magnet. Based on the results from Phase I effort and down-selection of the most optimum design, the full scale prototype of the cell will be constructed during Phase II, with a rigorous feedback process between the magnetic field strength test data, the field gradient mapping and subsequent design changes in order to reach the desired magnetic field and dimensional parameters. After testing of full scale prototype, a series of cells will be constructed, to test the possible field interactions between them. Non-scaling Fixed Field Alternating Gradient accelerators have the potential to bring a paradigm change in accelerator technology, replacing both cyclotrons and synchrotrons for many existing applications in science, and allowing the development of applications in completely new areas. Due to the compact design and low cost enabled by the permanent magnet based system, these potential applications include: X-ray sources, industrial high power Free Electron Laser as a source for EUV lithography, detection of special nuclear materials, astrophysical measurements, important physics experiments including dark matter and dark energy searches. Similar NS- FFAG systems could be also used for hadron therapy in cancer treatment. This Small Business Innovation Research Fast-Track project is to design, construct and test a focusing quadrupole and defocusing permanent magnet system for a new particle accelerator concept. The technology will result in a drastic manufacturing and operational cost reduction, with cutting-edge applications in science, industry, cancer therapy and more.",

We will leverage and expand the SBIR-derived OptDef simulation optimization and analysis tool for testing, and UQ methods and algorithms that prove effective will be added to OptDef for use by MDA and DOD analysts.  The proposed approach to UQ treats the simulation model as a black box, requiring only that simulation inputs can be updated, the model can be executed, and simulation outputs can be collected programmatically.

However, despite the highly promising quantum structures of SLS, its performance is currently limited by high reverse leakage current, attributed to the discontinuity in the periodic crystal structure caused by mesa delineation.

Operational targets for the interceptor third-stage rocket motor (TSRM), and for other next-generation multi-pulse motors for MDA, Air Force, and Navy missile applications, require decreased inert mass to increase velocity at burnout. In the Phase I project, Ultramet established the feasibility of utilizing aerogel-filled open-cell foam for divert and attitude control system (DACS) valve manifold insulators. Analysis showed that the insulator would reduce the valve body temperature and system weight significantly when used as a secondary insulator behind a primary insulating material. Based on those results, a more immediate and direct application for the material system was identified for Phase II development, specifically within a 21-inch tactical boost motor under development by Orbital ATK for the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Future Naval Capability (FNC) TSRM. In the Phase II project, aerogel-filled foam will be utilized behind carbon/phenolic ablator-filled foam as a hybrid ablator/aerogel TSRM exit cone insulator.

The proposed project involves collecting data on all of patients actions in the online treatment system along with their ratings of each activity and their symptom improvement over time. The research and development team will use this data to create a machine learning system that will make suggestions for best next steps in therapy based on what thousands of other users experienced.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is for the development of scaled processes for the industrial manufacture of end-user moldable advanced composite materials for use in protective athletic equipment. Currently, protective athletic equipment and accessories must be produced using industrial manufacturing techniques that have high tooling costs. As a result, manufacturers produce a small range of predetermined sizes and shapes, which do not provide a custom fit for end users. In the case of athletic gear, there is a growing market for hard-shell protective equipment which can be custom molded for a better fit. Polyimine polymers and advanced composites offer a compelling blend of strength and malleability in order to create more user-friendly lightweight and durable advanced composites that may be shaped by the end-user. In addition to creating greater user customization, both the virgin polyimine polymer, and advanced composites that incorporate polyimines, are intrinsically recyclable in a closed-loop, low-energy, solution-based system. The total U.S. composite materials market is $25 billion, representing 36% of the global composites sector. Polyimine polymers and advanced composite derivatives will reduce environmental waste and increase manufacturing efficiencies across a broad range of vertical markets in the composites sector including personal protective equipment, aerospace, automotive, and infrastructural materials. The intellectual merit of this project derives from the development of the unique chemistry of polyimine polymers. Polymers can be broadly grouped into two categories, thermosets and thermoplastics. Thermosets are strong due to the chemical characteristics of the plastic. However, once cured, thermosets cannot be reshaped. As a result, thermosets are neither repairable, nor are they efficiently recyclable. In contrast, thermoplastics, which are weaker than thermosets, may be molded and remolded. However, remolding requires very high temperatures. Polyimine polymers represent a new class of moldable and remoldable thermoset materials. Importantly, these polymers combine high rigidity and tough mechanical properties with mild molding temperatures. This Phase II research project will include scaled processes for the industrial manufacture of end user moldable composite materials that are a maximum of one-quarter inch in thickness and meet industry standards for limb joint protective equipment. The Phase II effort will also include a variety of types of material and mechanical testing, both in-house and at certified laboratories, in addition to extensive efforts at proving out manufacturability, as well as pilot production.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further develop and commercialize an innovative coating which minimizes the accumulation of mineral fouling on industrial heat exchanger surfaces. Heat exchangers are used to heat or cool fluids in industrial processes, such as chemical manufacturing, oil refining, power generation, food processing, electronics manufacturing, and many more. Air conditioning for factories and large commercial buildings also represents a significant use of heat exchangers. Fouling occurs when naturally dissolved minerals in water, often called \"hard\" water, precipitate out of the water when it contacts a hot surface. This fouling can be seen in a typical home on the surface of a teakettle or showerhead. The resulting mineral crystals adhere strongly, and form an insulating layer that materially reduces the thermal efficiency of industrial heat exchangers. Mineral fouling is estimated to cost U.S. industry $40 Billion per year, and waste $3 Billion of energy, representing upwards of 1% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to wasting energy, this worldwide, never-ending problem increases factory downtime and maintenance costs, causes industry to spend large amounts on chemical treatment of water supplies, and decreases the useful life of heat exchanger systems. An effective coating will result in substantial environmental benefits including the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the wasted energy, and a reduction of the water treatment chemicals, which eventually enter community wastewater streams. The coating material is a low surface energy, self-assembling hydrophobic material which is a composite of a host polymer and a nanoparticle. The low surface energy of the coating impedes the attachment of the minerals to the coated heat transfer surface. Phase I results showed that any fouling accumulation on a coated surface exhibits low adhesion strength, which allows any fouling that does occur to predominantly be dislodged by the force of the water flowing over it - a phenomenon call \"self-cleaning.\" The coating is very thin - less than 500 nm - which minimizes impedance of heat transfer due to the presence of the coating itself. Phase II research will focus on optimizing the properties of the coating, including substrate adhesion, surface energy, and toughness to ensure a useful life under industrial conditions. This will be accomplished by changing the host polymer chemistry to facilitate self-assembly, and also by changing the chemistry of the nanoparticle to obtain a covalent bond between the host polymer and nanoparticle. Work will also be performed to design the application process for industrial scale, and validate lab results with field trials at industrial sites.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project is to produce economically the next generation of sustainable, renewable, clean burning, high energy density, transportation biofuels. The proposed technology once successfully developed will enable existing biofuel producers to reduce their costs while increasing the value and diversity of their byproducts. It will convert their industrial waste products into tailored fatty acids suitable for biodiesel. The technology will be compatible with and complementary to cellulosic ethanol producers, and it could potentially double the amount of biodiesel produced in the U.S. today. The 227 domestic ethanol plants range in size from less than 50 to more than 150 million gallons, and they have a total annual capacity of 15 billion gallons. Every gallon of ethanol also yields 1.9 pounds of soluble organics that must be evaporated or disposed. Xylome?s technology has the potential to convert half of this stream into biodiesel and to expand biodiesel production further with cellulosic feedstocks. By converting a larger fraction of the soluble cellulosic and hemicellulosic sugars along with fermentation byproducts, Xylome will increase the efficiency of existing ethanol plants and increase biofuel production. The objectives of this Phase II research are to increase the rates of production, modification and release of fatty acids from non-conventional lipogenic yeast. Fatty acids have much higher energy density than ethanol, but similar specific energy yields. Fermentation of organics to lipids can potentially occur with efficiencies equivalent to ethanol production. Lipids normally accumulate under nitrogen limiting conditions after replication has stopped. They are not excreted from the cells so recovery does not require distillation. In Phase I, Xylome scientists identified and over expressed genes that increase lipid accumulation by 1.2- to 2-fold under high nitrogen conditions. In Phase II, they will use mating, selection, screening and evolutionary adaptation to combine the best of these modifications. Xylome scientists have also targeted additional genes to modify and release fatty acids from the cell. Xylome plans to optimize lipid production both from a cellular level with metabolic engineering and from an engineering perspective through bioprocess design and cultivation conditions. Xylome will also engineer cells to use rapidly the complex mixture of soluble oligosaccharides, hemicellulosic sugars and fermentation byproducts. By applying advanced molecular techniques and synthetic biology, Xylome will open up new opportunities for sustainable biofuel production.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to improve and expand the technology of recyclable thermosets by creating a new class of higher temperature performance, multivalent polyamines that retain a cleavable bond. If successful, this effort will lead to a new class of high-performance composite resins which can be recycled. Increased emphasis on energy efficiency is driving the adoption of lightweight, thermoset composites in the transportation sector. But the intractability of traditional thermosets limits the value and therefore adoption of recycled composites. Industry composites recycling experts estimate the overall scrap cost for the composites industry is between $500 and $750 million a year. Post-manufacturing scrap can account for up to 50 percent of the input materials. Carbon fiber composites for automotive applications represent an emerging and high-growth potential area for epoxy thermosets. A small volume, composite car line represents roughly 400 metric tons of polyamine curing agent. In the Phase II effort, novel, recyclable polyamine structures will be designed and synthesized, and further formulated with various epoxy resins to meet the glass transition temperature (Tg) requirements for transportation composites manufacturing. Doing so will help composite manufacturers lower costs and meet regulatory compliance for recyclability and manufacturing waste disposal. The intellectual merit of this project will be an expanded knowledge base and chemistry platform for synthesizing and formulating recyclable thermoset resins. Multivalent amines, by nature, provide higher structural rigidity of a matrix. Multivalency, by nature, translates to an overall higher cross-link density of a thermoset epoxy material. For example, composites of higher glass transition temperature, and faster cure speed can be achieved. New multivalent structures will complement the initial generation of recyclable aliphatic diamines, and enable applications previously unattainable by recyclable aliphatic structures alone, such as transportation composites. Pre-screened target cyclic scaffolds have been identified and targeted for synthesis. Successfully synthesized molecules will be further screened for physical properties and recyclability. Candidate molecules will then be formulated into full resin systems and optimized for a high-pressure resin transfer molding (HP-RTM) process, to meet the processing and cost needs of automotive manufacturers. Partners in the automotive industries will aid in testing and evaluating the performance of the formulated material. By creating new recyclable molecules that \"mimic\" other major industrial classes beyond aliphatic amines, the addressable market for these materials will be expanded and the adoption of recyclable thermoset composites will be accelerated.",

As an example, Rotavirus is a major cause of severe gastroenteritis among young children and lack of vaccination results in 450,000 deaths annually. A thermostable rotavirus vaccine would create cost-savings for vaccine manufacturers, national governments, and non-profit vaccine buyers and enable market access in areas of the world that lack sufficient cold-chain capacity. Successful development of a stable rotavirus vaccine would not only have significant positive impact on global rotavirus immunization efforts, but may also revolutionize the general approach to vaccine delivery and distribution. This Phase II project will advance towards commercialization a novel platform technology that both stabilizes vaccines and enables novel delivery formats. This technology has significant commercial potential in that it can be broadly applied to numerous emerging and existing vaccines in the $24 Billion global market. The proposed project seeks to leverage the unique properties of silk to meet the global need for robust, thermostable vaccines. Thermal instability is a long-standing problem in vaccine development. Despite efforts to improve stability, current formulation approaches do not allow product storage under ambient conditions. Temperature excursions during shipment and storage are common and result in wastage or administration of suboptimal vaccines. The use of silk fibroin, a low-cost biomaterial, represents a novel approach to vaccine stabilization. The goal of the proposed research is to advance the silk-stabilization platform towards commercialization of vaccines that do not require cold storage. Building upon successful Phase I results, advanced formulation optimization studies will define a final product formulation for rotavirus that is compatible with scaled manufacturing and achieves all storage and in vivo attributes necessary for a commercial product. Through process optimization studies, fabrication of a dissolvable thin strip for oral delivery of rotavirus will be translated into a scalable manufacturing process that provides an attractive alternative to traditional drying methods. Evaluation of stabilized rotavirus vaccine films in an improved animal model will enable validation of in vivo immunogenicity and offer insight into vaccine stabilization and oral film delivery more broadly.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and commercialize a breakthrough suite of probes and probing platforms for the imaging and probing of semiconductor devices and thin film materials at scales below 100 nm, where conventional techniques are challenged. The resulting products will allow customers to perform a rich range of tests at the nano-scale at costs and times that are a small fraction of those required for conventional platforms such as scanning electron microscopes (SEM), scanning probe microscopes (SPM), and a range of automated test equipment (ATE) based on these technologies. Miniaturization across a range of sectors is driving the development of devices and materials at increasingly minute length scales. Multiple large-scale trends including mobile devices and the internet-of-things are driving an unprecedented volume of engineering at the nanoscale. Much of this is now dependent on the single-tip SPM that has evolved into a broad array of instruments for the analysis of physical, chemical and electrical properties, and to detect and isolate flaws. The Multiple Integrated Tips (MiT) technology that is the focus of this effort takes a radically different approach to enable an even richer range of tests at length scales below one micron, with a faster, simpler and much more cost-effective platform. Given a large install-base of capital equipment, we are focused on probes coupled with adapters that plug into the most popular SEMs and SPMs. These probes significantly expand the functionality of existing systems, and do this with low barriers to acceptance given modest price points and seamless integration into standard industry platforms. A portfolio of probes will be developed to address high-volume needs across the semiconductor and thin film markets, starting with 4-tip devices for the electrical characterization of thin films, and configurable or non-configurable 3-4-tip devices for probing integrated circuits. These will be offered in a variety of sizes and geometries, currently from hundreds of nm to 65 nm, and extending below 10 nanometers within a year. In Phase II, probe functionality will be enhanced to enable coupled imaging and probing with design to operate in AFM mode. The portfolio of products will be continuously expanded to additional two- and three-dimensional geometries via co-development with lighthouse customers.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a robust, in-line plasmonic sensor for the detection of mercury in natural gas. Mercury naturally contaminates natural gas at the parts per million levels and can corrode critical aluminum components in processing facilities. Heat exchangers at Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) plants have failed catastrophically due to mercury corrosion, costing hundreds of millions of dollars of damage and injuring workers. Current monitoring methods cannot operate at the high pressures found in the process gas lines, leading to inaccurate measurements and unreliable instruments. LNG is a growing share of global energy as natural gas replaces more carbon intensive fossil fuels. By 2020, 30 LNG plants will be operating world wide, for a total mercury monitoring market of $136 million. Mercury monitoring at petrochemical facilities broadly is a $216 million per year market. Mercury itself is a neurotoxin and a global pollutant; our sensor has the potential to aid in efforts to detect and remove mercury before it can impact human health. Beyond mercury, plasmonic sensing is a novel technology with applications for a variety of chemical and biological species. The intellectual merit of this project derives from the utilization of a novel sensing platform based on the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of a gold nanoparticle film. It will build upon the success of the Phase I project, which demonstrated the suitability of LSPR sensors for the detection of elemental mercury vapor. This Phase II project will proceed along two objectives. The first objective will be to adapt the sensor for operations at high pressure; included in this objective is the redesign of key components of the system and the construction of a high-pressure test bench. The second objective is testing the LSPR sensor in a natural gas matrix; preliminary results indicate that LSPR mercury sensors response well in methane, but the full range of response and lifetime performance will be investigated in this project. Upon completion of these two objectives, field trials will commence. The full system will be certified for use in a gas plant and demonstrated at a suitable natural gas plant. A commercial prototype LSPR based natural gas mercury monitor will be realized upon completion of this project.",

The new instruments will pair ruggedized, miniature photomultiplier tubes with silicon photodetectors to create so-called hybridnamic detectors, featuring 14 decades of linear dynamic range. The new radiometers will be suitable for making optical measurements of the atmosphere and ocean in low-light regimes wherein high-quality optical data are rarely available. Anticipated uses include improved calibration and validation data collection for next-generation NASA satellite missions emphasizing turbid atmospheres and waters.  Basic research uses include twilight and nighttime diurnal or polar winter studies (e.g. aerosol optical depth from shadow band irradiance instruments), and other moon-lit measurements including airborne ocean color missions. While Phase 1 moved the prototype from a technology readiness level (TRL) of 3, to 4, the Phase 2 effort will advance the TRL of the new technology from a value of 4 to a value of 6 over the period of the SBIR Phase 2. This technology, known as LOLUX (Lowest Observable Light Upgraded XTRA class instruments), with irradiance (LOLUX-E) and radiance (LOLUX-L) sensors, will be supported with a portable, stabilized LED-based light source to insure that the sensors exhibit the desired stability during extended deployments.

This lack of a hyper-effective and safe alternative leads to wide spread use of toxic cryoprotectants.  Preventing ice remains a physical and chemical problem and innovative cryoprotectants can be realized using new chemistries. In Phase I, we developed a fundamentally different approach to cryoprotectant discovery and our first low-toxicity biomimetic antifreeze that is chemically stable at a variety of temperatures (-196C to 250C), hundreds of times more effective, and far less toxic at effective concentration.

Systems designed and tested on dedicated high-speed networks are unsuitable for the dynamic, low-bandwidth nature of a tactical network where mission needs must take priority. Based on a successful SBIR Phase I prototype, ATC-NY will develop TELTAN (TELemedicine over a TActical Network) to bring real-time, interactive remote medical assistance to units in the field. TELTAN is a multi-platform VIPAR system that can run on soldiers existing mobile devices using low-bandwidth tactical networks.",

        "abstract": "Ocular injuries have constituted approximately 13% of all casualties from Operation Enduring Freedom/Iraqi Freedom. Of 76 patients that sustained open globe injuries and underwent surgery at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to restore vision, 38% ultimately went blind.  In many cases, severely scarred corneas preclude adequately visualizing the retina and other intraocular structures to allow optimal surgical repair. DHP is seeking to develop a novel tool that will provide the surgeon an intraocular view that will permit state-of-the-art, sophisticated intraocular surgery and is compatible with contemporary ophthalmic surgical techniques and requirements. To address this DHP need, Hedgefog Research Inc. proposes to continue the development of a stereo microendoscope for intraocular visualization for ophthalmic surgery. In the course of Phase I we evaluated several technologies and down-selected the most promising solution, that can be integrated into an ophthalmic surgical environment, and can provide surgeons with an ability to visualize intraocular structures without the use of temporary keratoprosthesis. In Phase II we will continue the development of the stereo microendoscope technology. Our collaboration with eye surgeons from UCLA Jules Stein Eye Institute will allow us to develop an intraocular visualization system that can be naturally adopted by ophthalmologists.",

Approaches exist to reduce severity of disease impact to operational forces by detecting, monitoring, and treating infected personnel after exposure, but this does not effectively maintain and sustain force health. Force medical personnel need support to predict and analyze the risk a particular disease will present in an area of operations (AO) to inform decision makers. To provide this support, we conducted a Phase I effort to demonstrate a system to Predict and Analyze Novel and emerging Diseases Enabled by Models of Infection Conditions (PANDEMIC). Based on our success, we propose a Phase II effort to develop and evaluate PANDEMIC. PANDEMIC provides disease outbreak prediction support via four key components: (1) a library of individual infectious disease conditions; (2) model development and management capabilities that define relevant conditions and refine their underlying conditional probabilities to match novel AOs; (3) visualization support aids that foster appropriate trust in a disease models results, enabling users to review predictions based on relevant contextual data; and (4) a mitigation prioritization tool enabling users to compare preventative strategies and their anticipated impact.",

Working together with the correct software, they can be used for navigation and orientation measurements in a wide range of applications. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) inertial (motion) sensors are now used for a wide range of consumer, industrial and automotive applications, but cant be used for higher performance applications because of their extreme environmental sensitivityespecially to temperature. In particular, the measurement (bias) stability of consumer grade gyroscopes can be up to 80 degrees per hour per degree Celsius. This means that even with small outside temperature changes, these sensors cannot maintain bias repeatability of under 20 degrees per hour required for many tactical navigation applications. The proposed environment resistant inertial measurement unit (eIMU) addresses this by applying a stress isolation and thermal control package around a MEMS IMU in order to: 1) maintain a constant temperature during operation and 2) isolate it from humidity and outside stresses in the environment. The technical challenges include: i) choosing the optimal IMU for packaging in order to address military applications; and ii) improving the package design for better stress/thermal isolation and better stress repeatability.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: There is a critical need to provide new methodologies that more reliably determine what satellite orbital events are most critical to monitor and how such methods can be made scalable to a growing catalog of up to 500,000 objects. To support these endeavors, in Phase I, Numerica developed and tested two software tools for space object conjunction assessment (CA) to support the future needs of the space situational awareness (SSA) mission, namely the Sensor Level Assessor of Track Errors (SLATE) and the Kollision Risk Assessment Tool in Orbital Element Spaces (KRATOS). SLATE provides higher quality sensor tracks with more realistic states and covariances in order to improve reliability of downstream SSA functions such as CA. KRATOS provides an innovative approach to computing the probability of collision (PC) between space objects that rivals the accuracy of Monte-Carlo methods but with little added computational cost relative to the traditional linearization (Foster) method. In Phase II, Numerica will mature the SLATE and KRATOS software, transition them to the ARCADE environment, and demonstrate an end-to-end solution to the multi-faceted CA problem beginning with the ingestion of sensor data and ending with the key CA metrics displayed in a risk assessment visualization tool.; BENEFIT: SLATE sends more reliable input to downstream CA algorithms by generating improved orbital estimates and more realistic covariances directly from sensor observations. KRATOS helps to better inform courses of action by reducing collision false alarms and misdetections by virtue of computing a more reliable probability of collision. Together, SLATE and KRATOS provide plugs-in for an end-to-end capability for space object CA that provide the analyst with advanced tools needed to support CA screening on a growing space catalog and ultimately to serve the future needs of the SSA mission.    The primary transition path of SLATE will be to ARCADE for use as a pre-processor to the Continuous Orbital Situation Determination (CAOS-D) system (and other ARCADE services) that require realistic VCMs from sensor data as input. The primary transition path of KRATOS will be to ARCADE as a plug-in for CAOS-D. Such transitions serve as natural gateways for transition of the software to a future service pack of the JSpOC Mission System (JMS). A secondary transition path that will be pursued in Phase II is to AFSPC for inclusion of the software into the Astrodynamics Standards Library.",

        "abstract": "Gradient metal alloy structures possess multi-functional properties that conventional monolithic metal counterparts do not have. Such structures can potentially change the paradigm of material selections and mechanical designs to enable more efficient space vehicles to be built. Existing laser-based additive manufacturing techniques for gradient metal alloy fabrication suffer from the following two major drawbacks: high system cost and slow printing speed. In this proposal, AlphaSense details the development of a novel 3D printer for the fabrications of gradient metal alloy structures. Key innovations of this proposal include the following: a) The fabrication of gradient metal alloy parts using low-cost resin as starting materials, b) The development of novel printing slurries containing micro-/nano- sized metal particles and photo-curable resins to fabricate the green parts, and c) The application of a Digital Light Processing (DLP) projector for simultaneous layer exposure. With such innovations, the merits of the proposed 3D printing method for metal part fabrication include the following: a) Low fabrication cost, b) High printing speed, c) Superior printing quality, d) Easy to scale up and e) Easy and well-controlled process.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: To enable the next generation of GPS, we require DBR lasers that can stay frequency locked and produce useful amount of power for 10 years.  To qualify DBR lasers for these stringent conditions, we propose to build and run an accelerated frequency locked aging test.  The test lasers will be held at various elevated temperatures to accelerate aging and with our novel test rig, we will be able offset frequency lock all of the lasers to an absolute atomic transition.  The time to frequency unlock data in combination with standard accelerated aging analysis protocols will be used to extract a mean time to frequency unlock at operational condition, nominally room temperature.  We will also perform a conventional diode aging test to study the power degradation of these lasers.  In addition to the lifetime tests, we will develop and test an auto-calibration routine that will detect and steer the standard DBR laser away from mode hops by tuning its temperature.  This technique will only be applicable to applications where periodic unlocks can be tolerated.; BENEFIT: High-power diode laser systems capable of reliable, agile, atomic locking will find uses in cold-atom spectroscopic sensors such as atom interferometers, gravimeters, magnetometers, atomic clocks, focused ion beam sources and quantum computers.   New inertial navigation sensors and atomic clocks are needed for GPS satellites and for GPS denied environments.  More accurate and lower power atomic clocks are needed for network synchronization for wireless networks and SONET.  Cold-atom technology is also being used for the development of high-brightness ion beams useful for semiconductor fabrication and electron beams for electron microscopy.",

(IAI) team proposes to develop an innovative solution called Multi-Modal Driver Distraction and Fatigue Detection/Warning System (MDF). MDF consists of four major modules: (1) Driver behavioral based measurements: such as measuring driver pose and psychophysiological measures of alertness (e.g. Percentage of eye closure-PERCLOS, Average eye closure speed-AECS), detecting yawning and gestures. (2) Driving style based measurements: detecting erratic inter/intra-lane driving, and erratic speed variations based on yaw rate sensor and/or Controller area network (CAN) bus signals. (3) Physiological sensing: leverage recent advances in physiological sensing (like heart rate, sleep and activity monitoring) using wearable devices. (4) Sensor fusion, Recording, Warning and Individualization module that manages the inputs from the other modules and takes appropriate action and issues warning when necessary. MDF provides innovative yet practical, fast yet reliable, detection of driver distraction and fatigue under a wide variety of operating conditions. By fusing different modalities of sensor information, MDF will work for different drivers with different physiological features and provide unique and customized feedback. ",

        "abstract": "Software is a critical part of modern infrastructure. The nation's industry and government bear significant costs due to cyber attacks that steal data or otherwise disrupt operations. Software-based systems are too complex to be protected by a single layer of defense such as a perimeter firewall. Instead, operators need layered defenses that detect, inhibit and even block attackers who breach the perimeter. GrammaTech proposes to develop a tool for protecting and monitoring systems subject to cyber attack. This tool uses a combination of binary rewriting and system-wide event tracking to both harden systems and detect sophisticated attacks. Once complete, it will allow Government and Industry users to detect and block cyber attacks that exploit software vulnerabilities not anticipated by the original software developers. \n\nThe first key advance of this approach is that we use binary rewriting to insert protection and monitoring directly into programs that are vulnerable to attack. This gives us complete access to program state and behavior in contrast to other techniques that have limited access to what a program does. The second advance is a system-wide monitor that takes low level events and generates a picture of mission health.\n\nGrammaTech will draw on its significant technology and expertise in program analysis and security. GrammaTech has successfully transitioned many projects from research to market over its history. Its latest transition is CodeSonar, a bug-finding analysis tool that is used by government, prime defense contractors and others for software assurance.",

        "abstract": "Intraocular surgery is usually performed under stereoscopic guidance using a surgical microscope. The surgeon is usually able to see intraocular structures through a clear cornea. However, when the optical clarity of the cornea is severely compromised, visualization of the retina and other intraocular structures is very difficult or impossible.  Poor visualization of intraocular structures during surgery is associated with an increased risk for surgical complications and subsequent irreversible vision loss. Minimally-invasive needle-size endoscopic tools are currently used to aid intraocular surgeries. However, they lack a stereoscopic view, and therefore the manipulation of the surgical tools within the surgical field becomes very challenging. As a result, very few eye surgeons use these tools. To address this problem, Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) is developing a novel stereo-endoscopy approach that can be used for intraocular surgical guidance. In addition to the stereoscopic view, an OCT channel is included to examine tissue morphology. The Phase I study demonstrated technical feasibility. Advanced engineering design and manufacturing, as well pre-clinical testing in collaboration with Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Boston, MA is being proposed for the Phase II program. Furthermore, preliminary steps for technology commercialization will be taken.",

An integrated approach is conceived to develop new stasis cocktails optimized for the critical phases of protection (prior to storage), preservation (during storage) and revival-resuscitation (after storage). The storage capability at -20C established in Phase I for hepatocytes will be extended in Phase II through 3 principal efforts: (i) further optimization of the prototype cryostasis cocktail and protocol optimization, (ii) scale-up via our proven whole rat liver models, (iii) initial scaling to preserve human livers and assessment using the Harvard/MGH liver perfusion platform and, as a stretch goal, full human liver pseudo transplants.",

This final upper stage design reflects multiple trades that addressed the original Phase I objectives .  The most significant design driver was the mitigation of technical risk by selection of a dual-stage configuration for the XS-1 upper stage(s), for which the stage presented here serves as the final (Stage 3) element of the launch system.  We determined that the impact on marginal operating costs was offset by the reduction in risk and costs during development and qualification for a single upper stage configuration which would require adoption of extremely challenging design targets and advanced technologies.

        "abstract": "Extremely low-cost, lightweight, and high performance expendable upper stages are critical to meeting DARPAs goals for low-cost launch.  Engines are the most expensive element of the upper stage, and the turbopump is the most expensive component of the engine.  The proposed research will develop and demonstrate a design and manufacturing approach that reduces cost more than an order-of-magnitude while retaining state-of-the-art high performance and lowering weight by exploiting modern physics-based design and analysis tools and low-cost manufacturing technologies. The turbopump was designed and analyzed in Phase I.  In Phase II, the turbopump will be manufactured and tested.  The proposed research will develop and demonstrate this manufacturing technology and validate the approach with cryogenic testing, and result in an extremely low-cost turbopump for an XS-1 expendable upper stage.  The ability to develop a state-of-the-art turbopump within the schedule and funding constraints of an SBIR will demonstrate the revolutionary step-change necessary to achieve high-performance and extremely low-cost expendable upper stages.",

        "abstract": "Terrain and weather profoundly impact military operations  especially in austere environments. The ability of military planners to prepare for the effects of terrain and weather offers greater responsiveness and survivability. Technology Service Corp (TSC) and its Colorado State University (CSU) partner propose flexible terrain and soil moisture impact analysis software tools to support agile operational planning and off-line analyses. Our approach includes combining considerable Army investment in decision support tools with other state-of-the-art information technologies to provide these tools. Tools will include: 1) an efficient, configurable and flexible terrain analysis engine; 2) a packaged soil moisture estimation module suitable to support development of the next generation NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM) and 3) a generalized soil moisture estimation engine applicable to a wide range of military and commercial analyses that include soil interactions. In Phase I and subsequent research, TSC and CSU investigated soil moisture estimation formulations that provide outputs at tactical resolutions (< 100 m pixels). They also investigated user-configurable geospatial reconnaissance (terrain analysis) engine implementations. The proposed Phase II will further generalize these engines for enhanced performance, robustness and applicability to a broader range of military and commercial applications.",

        "abstract": "Battlefield operations are increasingly driven by mission critical, network-centric applications. Each branch of service within the DoD has several programs that use modeling and simulation to plan, test and analyze communication networks. These programs span a wide variety of protocols, waveforms, networks, and models, often times across multiple tools. In some cases, the waveforms and protocols do not use the full TCP/IP network stack. Currently there does not exist a realistic traffic generator that can plan and deploy traffic across the disparate waveforms and models. In this SBIR proposal we present a parametric traffic generation application that will enable comprehensive testing of request and response application flows across a variety of waveforms and models, including network stacks other than TCP/IP. The parametric traffic generation application will be designed to send a request packet to a destination address, and receive responses from one or more receivers of the request packet. A framework will be developed to allow the application to work across network models that span different waveforms and network stacks. The framework will include traffic generation model, a Graphical Interface to facilitate rapid model configuration, and an extensible API to facilitate integration across other simulators or emulators as needed.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Data transmission in communication systems, RADARs, satellite systems, and other military devices are dominated by analog data conversion. High performance, low power digital to analog converters (DAC) that exceed 3Gsps with 12 bits of resolution and are available in the commercial marketplace, but they lack the radiation hardness required to support military satellite applications.    Trusted Semiconductor Solutions designed a radiation hardened, low-power, 3Gsps 12-bit DAC in Phase I.  The DAC is latch up immune, will operate at a TID > 1Mrad(Si) with SEU < 10e-10 errors/bit-day. Dose rate upset is 10e10 rad(Si)/s and dose rate survivability is 10e12 rad(Si)/s. The radiation hardened DAC implements a partially segmented architecture, which is typical for this performance class. The DAC has an SNR of 70dB, an SFDR of 76dB and operating power of 1.5W. The DAC interfaces to an ASIC or FPGA through four 12-bit LVDS ports running at 750MHz.  Prototype units will be fabricated, radiation tested and characterized in Phase II. Parts will be assembled in 255-lead hermetic CCGA packages. Additionally, a DAC evaluation module will be developed and delivered for the purpose of demonstrating functionality and performance. Product upgrade and MIL-PRF-38535 space-level QML-V qualification testing will be performed in Phase III.; BENEFIT: Execution of this program provides the Air Force with a state-of-the art QML-V radiation hardened DAC for space based MILSATCOM and GPS applications. The DAC will be fabricated on-shore and parts assembled in a ceramic, hermetic LGA package suitable for space flight. Prototype units and a DAC evaluation module will be available 15 months after the start of Phase II. The DAC evaluation module can be used to demonstrate and market the DAC in parallel with the Phase III QML-V qualification efforts. In addition to Department of Defense programs, the DAC is also well suited for commercial space, avionics, industrial, medical and commercial applications.",

The concept takes advantage of the known strengths of at least two different types of dynamic loaders to accelerate a pseudo-static test penetrator, and a proven approach to subsequently arrest it. At the end of Phase II, we expect to have a functioning prototype of ROOSTER, demonstrate it through experiments, and have validated models capable of designing and controlling the test system.

        "abstract": "The proposed Phase II research is based on an earlier Phase I SBIR study where K&C established the feasibility of a methodology to develop advanced cumulative-damage models that predict time-dependent reinforced concrete (RC)-bunker wall deflection, spalling, breach, secondary debris generation, and the incremental wall damage state from multiple weapon detonations. This effort builds on previous work conducted by K&C and ACTA in (1) analytically modeling the behaviors of walls to multiple hits and (2) developing a High Fidelity Physics Based (HFPB) fast-running model (FRM) for modeling cumulative damage resulting from multi-hits scenarios. In this proposal an advanced cumulative damage FRM (ACD-FRM), incorporating the complicated physics involved in multiple loadings leading to local and global failure of RC components will be developed. The methodology proposed to develop the ACD-FRM is general in nature and can be readily extended to other structural components or systems and for loadings other than blast and fragmentation. This methodology will provide a rational approach for the stochastic consideration of accumulated or cyclic damage and has broad applicability across a range of industries where consideration of accumulated damage and the associated requirements for repair, maintenance and replacement is critical, such as the energy, utility and transportation industries.",

The HIP composite compacts are generated from a metal powder mixture. Data characterizing the materials strength, rheology, and fragmentation properties can be acquired from this suite of experiments. The composite material systems tested in a feasibility study exhibited some behaviors similar to metals, like plasticity, strain-hardening, and strain-softening. The material also exhibited quasi-brittle behaviors, including dilation, as well as pressure and rate sensitivities, when subjected to very large compressive deformations or tensile/extension loads. To capture the metallic and quasi-brittle behavior observed in such experiments, a material model based in metal plasticity, augmented with a quasi-brittle formulation, is formulated to be capable of predicting both material behaviors.",

The proposed instrument uses range-resolved elastic backscatter data from a scanning lidar beam to generate a 3D map of aerosol density in a short time span. Aerosol density fluctuations are cross-correlated between successive scans to obtain the displacements of the aerosol features along the three axes. Current methods of non-intrusive global airspeed measurement include Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) and Doppler Global Velocimetry (DGV). Common drawbacks of these methods are that they require precise alignment of separate transmitters and receivers; and it is expensive and unwieldy to extend these measurements for use in medium and large wind tunnels.\nIn Phase I, AeroMancer identified the main requirements of the application and the instrument; developed a conceptual design of a Phase II prototype; identified 3D airspeed extraction algorithms; and benchmarked the performance of the prototype using experiments and numerical simulations.\nIn Phase II, AeroMancer will develop the final design of the prototype by finalizing the requirements; and by performing trade studies and an eye safety analysis to select major components. The prototype will then be fabricated, assembled and packaged for wind tunnel use. Algorithms for the extraction of 3D global airspeeds, turbulence and solid object identification will be developed. Different scanning approaches will be developed and sources of error in the measurement will be analyzed and quantified. Software packages for control, data acquisition, storage and processing will be developed. The prototype will be tested in the laboratory for alignment, calibration, verification and validation. Limited wind tunnel testing will be performed if resources permit.",

magnet  specifically attaching it to the sternum and developing a\nuniversal shape for both symmetrical and asymmetrical sternums  However the chest repairs\nwere successful due to the encapsulation of the device on sternum \nWe are requesting funds to modify the design of the implanted magnet housing and the means\nof attaching it to the sternum  This will be the third and potentially the last design iteration before\ncommercialization  During the last trial we learned the importance of including the effects of\npatient respirations as a test to determine the strength and viability of the implant  This study will\nevaluate and create \n   A means to quantify the effects of patient respirations on the design of the new device\n   A locking mechanism on the implant that will best remain immovableof implant will best\n remain immovable on the sternum\n   A mechanism that will not injure the bone and cartilage on the sternum \n   A mechanism fit best onto the bone disorder most noticeable on the sternum during the\n course of the two year trial Project Narrative\nThe Magnetic Mini Mover Device for the treatment of petcus excavatum  PE  has undergone\ntwo clinical trials  Our device is composed of two neodymium magnets  One is encased in\ntitanium and affixed to the patientandapos s sternum during a   hour operation  The second is attached\nto an orthotic brace that is held in place by the attraction of the two magnets  Over the course of\na two year treatment the chestwall is moved back into a near normal position \nWe have shown that the device is beneficial to a specific group of PE patients  usually those\nbetween the ages of   and    who have not gone through their pubertal spirt yet  During both\ntrials the mechanism  screw then cables  that affixed the internal to the sternum broke  During\nthe second trial the magnet became encased on the patientandapos s chest and the cable breakage did\nnot affect the completion of the trial  In face the

In Phase I, Lynntech demonstrated strong proof-of-concept for developing a novel, easy-to-use and cost effective device for quantitative real-time detection of a biomarker of coagulopathy, using human unprocessed whole blood as the input sample. In this proposed Phase II effort, we will expand the biomarker panel to include a second protein involved in the hemostatic mechanism. Subsequently, the biosensors will be optimized for industry standard accuracy, reproducibility, stability and shelf life. A prototype compact coagulopathy monitor and associated disposable microfluidic multiplexed biomarker analysis cartridges will then be fabricated and functionally optimized for continuous and simultaneous analysis of Lynntechs biomarker panel in human whole blood. The potential clinical utility of our prototype coagulopathy monitor will be demonstrated through a limited single-center pilot non-interventional human clinical trial. Successful conclusion of this Phase II will enable the follow-on Phase III effort to focus on multicenter human clinical trials, FDA regulatory clearance and commercial deployment of our coagulopathy monitoring product. Lynntechs proposed device will provide actionable knowledge to medical caregivers, resulting in better clinical management of trauma induced coagulopathy.",

        "abstract": "One of the most important infectious diseases affecting the health of military recruits is adenovirus, which causes acute outbreaks of respiratory disease in military facilities incapacitating personnel, burdening hospitals, disrupting military operations and increasing medical costs. We propose to continue the development of a new generation of adenovirus vaccines based on adenovirus-like particle (AdVLP) technology. This vaccine will significantly benefit the military by protecting servicemen against multiple adenovirus serotypes. This will minimize the impact of adenovirus disease in military facilities, which will reduce the costs associated with these disruptions and improve readiness.    The current adenovirus vaccine is effective in eliciting strong protection against two of several respiratory disease causing adenoviral serotypes. However the resulting vacated ecological niches created by this immunity are subsequently occupied by other viral serotypes, which leads to the reemergence of acute respiratory illness in vaccinated military recruits.  To address these limitations of the live adenovirus vaccine, it seems imperative therefore, to design produce and test a new generation of adenovirus vaccines and delivery strategies.     Our strategy for adenovirus vaccine development is based on the recombinant expression of adenovirus-like particles (AdVLPs) composed of alternative combinations of structural elements involved in the morphogenesis of complete icosahedral virion particles.",

Two advanced matching pursuit algorithms, JOMP and FOMP, developed to sparsely represent the compressed data will be evaluated. For LiDAR data compression, a novel geometry-based LIDAR compression technique is proposed. It first performs LIDAR classification to classify the data into tree points and building/ground points. Next, different compression methods are proposed to compress the tree cloud points and building/ground cloud points differently. Methods to quantify the quality degradation due to compression will be developed for SAR, multi-/hyper- spectral images as well as LiDAR data.

VLADE uses deep learning to analyze patterns in training data to enable the generation of descriptions of new videos.

        "abstract": "This project is developing strategies for liquid fuel injection that reduce the sensitivity of the injection process to liquid physical properties. The injection process depends on liquid properties such as viscosity or surface tension. Changes in properties can alter the distribution of the fuel ahead of the combustion process. Changing fuel temperature can change fuel properties. Alternative fuels may have different physical properties than the baseline fuel. By mitigating the dependency of the injection process on fuel properties, better control and understanding of subsequent combustion process can be attained. The goal of this project is to employ cavitation to both reduce sensitivity to changes in fuel properties and enhance atomization. Cavitation isolates the bulk of the fuel from wall contact, reducing the impact of viscosity and accelerates atomization, reducing the dependence on surface tension. To maximize benefit of cavitation, injector inlet shapes and cross sections will be optimized to minimize sensitivity of the injection process to liquid properties. The project involves a combination of high fidelity simulations coupled with detailed experiments in which specific injector geometries will be identified that will greatly reduce sensitivity to fuel properties. Both reacting and non-reacting studies will be carried out",

This work will not modify the existing GPS cryptographic structure, but rather develop an overlay for providing keying information to a receiver in a manner that makes all security information ephemeral, eliminating the permanent storage of CPI within the receiver. Existing and emerging battlefield networks will be leveraged to provide a method of securely distributing keys to a GPS receiver. This technique requires a security overlay over the tactical or strategic communication network where the security overlay will provide access control based on advanced key distribution, mutual authentication, location-based access and biometric techniques. The security overlay will provide secure transmission of encrypted, black keys to military receivers through all types of tactical or strategic communication networks, including mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Additionally, concept of operations (CONOPS) and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) needed to support the ephemeral overlay technology will be explored.; BENEFIT: A successful implementation of the proposed system would greatly reduce the cost and overhead associated with the development and manufacture of military GPS receivers. Removing the permanent storage of CPI from the receiver would remove the burden placed on receiver manufacturers by the strict security policies associated with SAASM receivers and open military receiver development to a wide range of non-traditional contractors.",

This is the number of threat event investigations completed per unit time (e.g., one work day).  The improvements in cyber analyst workflows has driven a market for managed security services.\n\nHowever, this improvement is still insufficient to counter the threat.

        "abstract": "System testing of an F/A-18 ACM with direct drop in replacement foil bearings was conducted demonstrating that MiTis 4th generation compliant foil bearings operating under normal conditions experienced lower temperatures than the OEM bearings and with lower turbine pressure and flow required to reach the same speed condition. In a dust environment, MiTis compliant foil bearings appeared unaffected by dust ingestion operating reliably with minimal signs of wear or damage after testing. This test series clearly shows that advancements made to foil bearing technology over the past two decades offer benefits in temperature margins, load carrying capacity and tolerance to debris.  Subsequent testing to determine off gases revealed that the major compounds appear to be a mixture of carbon dioxide CO2, sulfur dioxide SO2 and fluorocarbons of varying molecular weight/boiling point. Given the demonstrated suitability for use as replacement bearings additional qualification testing is warranted to verify minimal to no harmful off gas products even during high speed engagements and to demonstrate operability under vibration conditions.  Success in qualification testing will lead to expanded application of replacement foil bearings in other air cycle machines.",

The first is to develop, test, demonstrate, and deliver prototype three-dimensional (3D) array, Seismic Acoustic Detection and Ranging (SADAR) systems with a data sampling rate of 8,000 (8K) per second to automatically detect, classify, report, and localize underground sources for specific seismic-acoustic signals of interest in near real-time. The second is to develop, test, demonstrate, and deliver prototype Rapidly Deployable Hardened Sensor (RDSH) systems with Quantum sensing technology that can be deployed quickly into the ground by one person pressing it with their foot or using a blunt object, and then continuously record seismic-acoustic data in its area for at least 120 hours so the data can be extracted in-place for processing and analysis elsewhere. The SOW is organized under CLINs with the first three for the SADAR-3D/8K prototype. This system is an extrapolation of Quantums current 2D array SADAR product but requires extensive hardware, software, and algorithm development effort to leverage 3D array processings advanced capabilities. The fourth CLIN develops the RDSH prototype, focused on making a simple but robust quick-install sensor system. Both these prototypes will be thoroughly tested, and a government-witnessed demonstration performed.",

Often, initial assessment and diagnosis must be conducted by first-level responders who attempt to assess vestibular symptoms directly following a concussive event; however, these symptoms are often missed, not adequately evaluated, or misdiagnosed due to a lack of familiarity with the subtleties of impaired vestibular function. Based on a successful Phase I prototype demonstration, we propose to develop a full-scope system for the Assessment and Diagnosis of Vestibular Indicators of Soldiers Operational Readiness (ADVISOR). ADVISOR will provide a combination of over 15 different vestibular function screening tests (e.g., VEMP, SVV, DVAT, VEST-SOT), with an emphasis on screening Soldiers for fitness to return to duty (RTD). Tests are administered via the ADVISOR hardware, which uses COTS components to provide a low-cost solution that is optimized for use in theater. The ADVISOR software guides medical responders (e.g., Army Medics, Navy Corpsmen) to consistently administer assessments and correctly interpret the results.

To address this, Adventium and KSU propose to develop tools and techniques to analyze the safety and security of networks of interoperating medical devices, which will allow both manufacturers and the Health Delivery Organizations to make risk-aware decisions about the medical devices and configurations of their networks. We will leverage active work on the ICE standard and KSUs proposed ICE-based MAP architecture that will allow organizations to design supervisory medical device applications that are customized to the needs of their operations, while ensuring the resulting System of Systems meets their safety and security requirements. SSCATE will advance the deployment of safe and secure networks of medical devices by enabling manufacturers to meet their shared responsibility for the intended use of their devices, reducing the regulatory challenge of integrated device approvals, and providing medical staff with the tools to help them configure ICE-compliant systems.",

In Phase I we have developed multiscale computational tools integrating systems biology, biophysics and physiology to model the deleterious effects of platelet storage and to explore novel storage methods. The model integrates the bag-scale analysis of storage media chemistry, heat transfer and mixing with the cell-scale platelet systems biology. The model, partially validated on test data, correctly predicts metabolic shifts, changes in platelet shape, fall of media pH and other experimentally observed effects.

The OI radar uses waveform diversity for enhanced radar tracking and endgame guidance performance to support the IFPC2 mission, achieving enhanced angle accuracy and multipath mitigation over conventional radar architectures and enabling 3PS guidance. The 3PS guidance concept addresses the need for low-cost precision guidance and control of interceptors by creating what is essentially a localized energy field using the OI radar technology. The OI/3PS approach combines the best of command guidance with the best of semi-active guidance but utilizes significantly less fire control power-aperture and provides lower cost for target engagement than conventional command guidance, semi-active guidance, and active seeker approaches. As a result, the OI/3PS technology offers the potential to combine radar search and track with target engagement and intercept into a single radar that will facilitate maintaining current force structure manpower requirements. Since 3PS requires significantly less onboard radar hardware than semi-active or active seekers, 3PS will reduce the interceptor complexity resulting in reduced production and maintenance cost.",

(PSI) proposes to develop an unmanned aircraft system based bioaerosol detection capability that is cued to a region of interest using non-specific, persistent and wide area thermal imagers commonly deployed for surveillance.  The detection capability, referred to as Bio-MAV, will fold into a recursive Bayesian classifier (RBC) processing module currently being developed by PSI to detect and track bioaerosol plumes using widely installed thermal imagers.  Bio-MAV will be integrated to PSIs InstantEye (IE) as two modules: Mod 1 comprised of a Gen 3 IE with an on-board thermal imager used to observe, locate, and bound an aerosol plume, and Mod 2 comprised of a Gen 4 IE with a repackaged commercial off the shelf biological point detector to provide confirmation whether the thermal object identified by the RBC is a biological agent containing aerosol.  The projected detection limit is 50,000 ACPLA with 80% probability with a 2 minute time to detect.  Data streams from the two Bio-MAV sensors will be folded into the RBCs framework to provide wide area, persistent, high confidence bioaerosol threat early warning.  Bio-MAV will be developed and will undergo multiple open release field tests under the proposed effort.",

        "abstract": "To address the Armys need for a multifunctional integrated drive system sensor (MIDSS) to monitor rotorcraft drive system health, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to continue refining, developing, and testing the Multilayered and Arrayed Fiber Optic Sensor Suite (MAFOSS) system. MAFOSS is based on the integration of multiple different types of micro-fiber-optic sensors to simultaneously acquire multiple health-related types of data (e.g., temperature, vibration, strain, torque, and pressure). POC has successfully developed, tested, and demonstrated in the initial Phase II, a technology readiness level (TRL)-4 MAFOSS prototype. In this second Phase II, POC will further optimize and develop the MAFOSS system for size, weight, and power (SWaP) reduction and test and demonstrate the system on a rotorcraft drivetrain test rig in relevant conditions close to the real environment to reach TRL-6, readiness for transition in Phase III to specific Army platforms such as the AH-64 series. The capabilities MAFOSS provides will enhance rotorcraft safety, saving lives of our aircrews as well as potentially saving the DoD significant amounts of money for rotorcraft maintenance. Most importantly, the integrated MAFOSS will realize a reduction of least five times in size/weight compared to similar systems implemented with existing commercial sensors.",

A new generation of high-fidelity rotorcraft analysis packages have enabled new levels of prediction accuracy. These software packages are the modular integration of numerous multi-disciplinary codes, including computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and rotorcraft comprehensive analysis (CA). CREATE A/V Helios is a rotary-wing aeromechanics simulation framework that integrates these high-fidelity (CFD) with (CA).  Rotorcraft comprehensive analysis systems such as RCAS utilizing structural dynamics with lower fidelity aerodynamic methods with have evolved to play a crucial role in rotorcraft design and analysis.    The modular integration of CFD and CA programs into a single software package compliments each program's capabilities and enables the highest fidelity aero-elastic rotor and full vehicle analyses available.    The cohesive integration of HELIOS and RCAS and the enhancement of their user interfaces is crucial to improving rotorcraft design and analysis.  The proposed effort is to enhance RCAS and Helios Graphical User Interface (GUI) and significantly improve the analysis capability for U.S. Army rotorcraft simulations. This effort will enable the modeling and analysis of complex rotorcraft configurations in steady or maneuvering autopiloted flight.",

Load analysis software encapsulating unified formulation, varying-fidelity surrogate models, model fusion, input selection, and model verification were developed in an integrated environment. By way of extensive USAF relevant case studies, critical evidence was established to accurately analyze flight test data (5% uncertainty in load prediction) for various maneuvers at the real-time rate and to elucidate primary load-driving factors. In Phase II the software will be optimized in performance and functionality. The surrogate modeling will be expanded. Advanced fusion algorithms will be developed for improved reliability. Global sensitivity analysis technique will be developed for quantitative characterization of input significance. Model verification will be refined for objective evaluation of load prediction performance.

For such high speed platforms, environmental sensors will be needed to reliably sense the transition to sustained hypersonic flight, with the objective of making a valid and reliable flight determination that will then be used to enable or activate a payload, as in a safe & arm mode, for arming onboard munitions. Such environmental sensors, for hypersonic vehicles, do not currently exist. Innoveerings MESH system leverages a novel aero-acoustic property sensing approach to uniquely determine flight conditions of a hypersonic (M3-M6+) airframe. We believe the military potential of our SBIR Phase I results are positive, because our Phase I results showed that our sensors geometry can be designed to a specific Mach #. With no moving parts and a simple manufacturing approach, our MESH system has the potential to integrate with a hypersonic airframe, non-intrusively interrogate the flowfield while surviving the heat loads and performing its environmental flight validation functions for a military weapons platform.",

        "abstract": "Traumatic hemorrhage is the primary mechanism of death in potentially survivable combat injuries, and is the leading cause of death for civilians under the age of 44. A major underlying cause of this high mortality is Acute Traumatic Coagulopathy, a deadly pathophysiologic reaction wherein dysregulation of the clotting cascade can rapidly lead to a wide range of difficult-to-treat symptoms and a significant increase in mortality. To enable more informed, timely, and effective treatment of trauma-induced coagulopathies, there is an urgent need for technologies capable of rapid monitoring of the molecular markers of coagulopathy at the point of injury and at all subsequent levels of care. Toward solving this problem, we have developed the Real-Time Coagulopathy Monitor (RTCM) system, a biosensor platform capable of real-time measurement of multiple biomarkers of coagulopathy directly in patient blood samples analyzed at the point of care. The RTCM system consists of disposable test strips for simultaneous measurement of three coagulopathy biomarkers as well as a wearable ruggedized measurement device based on a standard Android smartphone and a battery-powered electrochemical reader. Both the RTCM reader and test strips are compact and thermostable, allowing convenient deployment with combat medics or EMTs and long term cold-chain-free storage at",

For submarines to meet the future COCOM ISR requirements they will need to improve the Direction Finding (DF) capability in the imaging mast. The proposed solutions to improve submarine DF must conform to open standards and approaches in the hardware and software design that readily support technological and functional advancement of the systems capabilities. DF is critical to improved situational awareness, ISR mission effectiveness, and overall ship safe operations particularly in the littoral operating regions.Our design will provide a small SWAP scalable DF solution that allows the tuners and DF processing to all be housed in the imaging mast and provides low bandwidth DF results as a data product.",

        "abstract": "For decades, cold working has been used to extend the fatigue life of aircraft fastener holes. This procedure may be a terminating action or used to extend the inspection interval/lifetime.  To have confidence in the process, the Air Force (AF) needs an inspection tool to conclusively determine: 1.) that cold working has been applied to a hole and 2.) if the results are within specifications. TRI/Austin has developed a prototype tool, the FastenerCam, to perform non-contacting inspections of aircraft surfaces. In addition to examining the fastener geometry, including the diameter, countersink angle, depth, and alignment, FastenerCam measures and correlates the vertical deformation around the hole to the degree of expansion. During Phase I, its capabilities were extended to include countersunk holes and the system was redesigned to perform non-contacting measurements, permitting work in tight spaces without damaging coatings around holes being inspected.  During Phase II, TRI/Austin will expand FastenerCams use cases to holes cold expanded through multiple plate layers, asymmetrically expanded holes, and countersunk holes expanded using Fatigue Technology Inc. (FTIs) countersink specific toolset.  Finally, TRI/Austin will develop a manufacturing prototype to permit this technology to be immediately brought to market upon completion of Phase II.",

        "abstract": "It is anticipated that XML will continue to expand until it heavily dominates the next generation of telemetry systems. The XML language can be used to define the syntax of valid Test & Evaluation (T&E) documents. however, it does not capture the semantic rules (constraints) and thus system-level semantic validation cannot be accomplished automatically. The size of complete XML instances for large data systems is large and thus manual validation of these systems is not feasible either. New standards and methods must be developed for formally capturing semantic rules of T&E metadata and for automatic validation of related XML instances.     VIStology and SwRI propose to develop an approach to capturing and automatically validating semantic constraints implemented in an open-source prototype of a semantic validation service (xVISor), which will enable truly multi-vendor T&E systems, adding to the success of prior RCC activities by encouraging and extending the possibility of further vendor interoperability. The effort will largely be focused on MDL, but the methodology will be applicable to any T&E standard. The approach will be evaluated using test cases co-developed with the T&E community.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: This effort is a collaboration between RMD and Alfred University. Our goal is to develop a process for producing optical ceramics with properties approaching or exceeding single crystals.  Phase I of this program successfully demonstrated the ability to orient non-cubic, non-isotropic ceramic precursors based on material composition using a magnetic field, and prepared a foundation for better understanding and controlling the effect.     Ceramic processing provides enhanced performance, lower cost, and relaxed constraints on size and shape.  We are investigating rare earth oxyorthosilicates, scintillators that are expensive to grow as crystals, for use in lasers.     Phase II objectives:     1) Develop a theory based process for producing transparent non-cubic ceramics. This will provide the basis for several commercial products including scintillators.     2) Produce a transparent non-cubic ceramic sample that exhibits optical signal gain.  This is the basis for a new generation of commercial high power lasers.     3) Explore the application of the technology to a variety of materials.  This expands the potential commercial base for this technology to more applications such as thermoelectrics, severe environment optical components, and piezoelectrics.     RMD will implement two commercialization paths: first for scintillator radiation detectors for defense, medical, and nondestructive equipment; second for lasers and other optical components.; BENEFIT: The successful development of this technology will have significant technological and commercial impact. Ceramic scintillators offer the possibility of larger, more sensitive and much less expensive radiation detectors for defense, homeland security, research and nuclear medicine. Ceramic lasers offer much higher power lasers for defense and industry, as well as lower cost, and the ability to fabricate laser configurations that are impractical or impossible to produce using single crystals.  Other commercial applications include visible, UV, and IR windows, lenses and optical components including electro-optical modulators, Faraday rotators, optical switches, high temperature fiber optic sensors for use in harsh and extreme environments. Additional products would include high efficiency thermoelectric generators and sensors, x-ray and neutron radiography screens, piezoelectric transducers, and high temperature superconductors.",

We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of the Virtual Shield prototype. In the Phase II effort, we will continue our Phase I work by adding more new functions.

This project aims to increase mission endurance by developing advanced recuperators that will reduce fuel consumption and significantly expand the mission envelopes for turboshaft-powered UAVs.  Creares innovative recuperator design enables highly efficient heat transfer, which results in very compact cores with low pressure losses.  Innovative fabrication and assembly methods enable these heat exchangers to be built at low cost and to conform to available space around the engine, which shrinks the overall envelope.  In Phases I and II, we proved the feasibility of our approach, developed full-size fabrication methods, demonstrated thermomechanical durability, measured thermal and flow performance, and designed and produced full-size recuperator modules.  The efficiency and pressure losses agreed well with our design models.  We now propose to build a full-size recuperator, integrate it with a common turboshaft engine, and demonstrate that the recuperated engine meets goals for reduced fuel consumption and durability.",

Non-drip repair procedures will be developed and qualified for the most common repairs  Ni, Cd, ZnNi and SnZn plating and anodizing, as well as electrochemical stripping in preparation for repair. The F-18 airframe requires unique brush plating tools for some coatings and areas, such as SnZn plating for EMI on doors and airframe. Non-drip tools will be developed computationally to plate these areas efficiently.

Through novel application of additively manufactured test articles, REACT enables reduced cooling design conservatism and rapid development of enhanced cooling technologies to meet market demands. This technology directly supports VAATE program objectives by enabling low cost development of high performance cooled turbine components. With this program, FTT and its subcontractor, AeroDynamic Solutions, Inc.

Also, with the increasing advancement of portable electronic systems, soldiers are often overburdened having less capability to carry smoke devices, necessitating the development of more efficient and smaller smoke devices. Several visual and bispectral obscurants have been developed but they are toxic, flame hazardous, or low performing. There is a particular need of less hazardous, less incendiary visual obscurants with significantly improved extinction performance. These materials can be used as standalone visual obscurants or in combination with advanced IR materials as bispectral obscurants providing broadband protection. Luna develops advanced hollow metallic nanoparticles with strong surface plasmonic effects. In Phase I, the technical feasibility was demonstrated by experimental synthesis and optical and morphological measurements, and theoretical modeling also identified clear opportunities for further improvements. In Phase II, Luna and its collaborators will optimize these nanostructures for visual and near-shortwave IR obscuration, develop more effective aerosolization processes and dissemination mechanisms, and demonstrate prototype performance in preparation of cost-effective scaling up and field testing.",

ASSETTs proposed solution, the Acoustic Array Assessment Tool (AAAT) addresses both of these cost drivers. To address performance, AAAT provides the ability to accurately simulate directional ocean noise using Reverse Far-Field Processing (RFFP). To address monitoring, maintenance and repair costs, AAAT provides the ability to create virtual sensors to replace failed sensors through multi-dimensional interpolation thus reducing or eliminating the need to dry-dock and replace failed sensors.

Cyans key small pixel innovations allow a much smaller HD format array which results in a reduction in the size of the optic (IFOV = dpix/fl) so that the resolution improves with smaller pixels.  At the same time the smaller sensor uses less detector materials and results in a size reduction in the sensor package as well as the optics.  The result of this proposal describes a very compact and lightweight IRST with WFOV/NFOV and high resolution zoom in window with processor aided multi-target tracking and ID. These HD sensors offer unprecedented new capabilities to address increased resolution, increased Signal to Noise, longer standoff range hostile fire detection, and sight ID.",

The emission in the very early period represents the brightest radiance for classification and explosive typing. The spectra observed during the rapid and extreme condition changes are also the result of energy transfer complexities after breakout, which contain information that is crucial for the design of novel energetic materials (EM). While there is evidence in DoD and DoE that the early time plasmas can be useful for EM disposal and other applications, there has been little understanding of the processes that lead to the highly excited states responsible for the emission. Emission spectroscopy is the chosen tool to investigate this complex phenomenology. In Phase I, Spectral Sciences, Inc. (SSI) and the University  of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC),  have developed  a prototype spectral signature processing capability to interpret the spectral signatures at all times of the explosion process. Through a synergistic approach combining models by SSI and experiments by UIUC in Phase II, we shall complete a robust processing algorithm and deliver a user-friendly software implementing a consistent protocol for spectral data analysis.",

        "abstract": "At sites ranging from Texas to Iowa, utility scale wind has become the lowest cost electricity source available, with recent prices well below 3cents/kWhr, lower than the cost of both coal and shale gas. This not only provides these communities with clean, low cost energy, it also provides a valuable \"second crop\" to the land owners in these areas. However, this opportunity is currently limited to a relatively small percentage of the country - while the 8 Plains states generate nearly 20% of their electricity from wind, the nationwide average is less than 5%.Keystone Tower Systems has developed a new technology that makes low cost wind energy accessible in all 50 states, and also ensures that a greater percentage of the value stays with the local communities where the turbines are installed. Today, wind energy is only economical in regions where strong winds can reach close to the ground, because current tower technologies cannot cost effectively lift turbines higher than ~80m. This height limitation is the byproduct of transportation limits between the tower factory and the project site - taller towers would ideally be larger in diameter at the base, but this results in structures that are simply too large to transport by road or rail. Keystone&#39;s technology bypasses the tower transport constraint by enabling steel to be shipped as flat sheets that are rolled and welded to form a tower at the project site. By fabricating at the wind plant, Keystone&#39;s system enables towers to cost effectively scale to any size. It also enables the tower, the most expensive component in a turbine, to be produced in the local community, rather than at a distant factory.During Phase I of this SBIR program, Keystone worked with the top turbine manufacturer in the world to design a field fabricated tower that is more than 70% taller than standard models, and with a leading wind farm developer on the initial design of a mobile tower fabrication facility that could be setup on a wind project during the construction phase. Also during Phase I, commercially available technologies were identified for almost all of the steps in tower fabrication, such as in-field painting from the bridge industry. However, large diameter flanges were identified as a critical gap. Because of the large size of these flanges (some as large as 7m in diameter), they are too large to ship and must be delivered in multiple segments. Large diameter towers also become very flexible, which, along with segmentation, presents unique challenges during the installation process. These challenges must be overcome while meeting the very tight tolerances that are required to ensure good load distribution and strong fatigue resistance. Keystone has developed a flange manufacturing and installation process that we believe will meet all of the necessary requirements, but it requires extensive validation in order to ensure that the flange will survive the 10s of millions of fatigue cycles that it will experience over its 20 year lifetime, as well as convince the conservative wind industry to accept this new technology. Keystone will carry out this validation program in the current project.",

This project combines low-cost COTS augmented reality (AR) technologies together to overcome these challenges, to vastly increase realism in live training. Through the use of the latest head mounted displays (HMD), 6 DoF occlusion/interference-resistant motion tracking devices, wide-range depth sensing cameras, and minor weapon modifications, a system can be built that is unencumbering to Soldiers and can scale to a platoon level without any self-interference due to energy emissions (e.g., infrared light, wireless communications). The system can operate in various weather conditions, day or night.    These COTS AR technologies actively correlate the live world with a virtual world  insomuch that virtual entities (e.g., OPFOR, IEDs) are naturally embedded visually, acoustically, and haptically. Soldiers are completely untethered and can maneuver in unlimited 3-dimensional space while maintaining localization and 6 DoF body part and weapon tracking to millimeter/sub-millimeter accuracy to provide realistic static and dynamic occlusion from any perspective of live or virtual assets.",

It is vital for the United States to adapt to changes in the global threat environment, maintaining an effective defensive capability and deterring future threat development. Combatant Commands (COCOMs) worldwide develop, evaluate, and refine courses of action (COAs) to adapt to such changing global threats, but have limited decision-support tools to effectively support planning and making informed requests for forces (RFFs). New decision-support tools are needed to enable: (1) flexible scenario creation to support the breadth of potential assets, threat conditions, and situational variations across the full spectrum of integrated air and missile defense; (2) quick COA evaluation at an appropriate level of fidelity; and (3) comparative analysis of the pros and cons of each COA option and provide justified, actionable recommendations. To support COA development and what-if analysis of alternative plans, we plan to design, develop, and evaluate a full-scope Course of Action Analysis Support Tool (COAST) prototype for missile defense. COAST provides planners with decision-support tools to rapidly construct scenarios, evaluate outcomes with a scalable simulation framework, and perform comparative analyses with a COA comparison tool to provide actionable recommendations.",

The enhanced capabilities include features to tighten accuracy and repeatability of the instrument when making measurements over long periods of time. Software enhancements will help users extract useful knowledge from the very large datasets the instrument generates as it operates autonomously for multiple days or even weeks.

As a proof-of-concept, Spectral Energies and its partners developed a low-dimensional, physics-based noise prediction tool during Phase I. This tool has been shown to be accurate to within 2-3 dBs in overall sound pressure level for subsonic and supersonic operating conditions. Currently, the tool has support for three-stream nozzles and aft decks. Future iterations of the code will include support for, 3D effects, imperfect mixing, twin jets, SERNs, and ground effect. Experiments and simulations will be performed to incorporate the new physics and to validate the updated model. Design guidelines for quiet operation based on analysis of our data will also be supplied with the tool. The final version of the noise model will be inserted into the cycle analysis tool NPSS so noise and performance can be predicted for new engine designs.

All sensors will send observation schedules and observation data to Heimdall Web to complete the feedback loop for the next scheduling iteration.  Phase I interfaces for non-traditional sensor operators will be refined in Phase II, and Heimdall Web will be integrated with JMS for SSN sensor asset planning.",

        "abstract": "1-Hexanol has a global market size of ~200,000 MT/yr, wherein this alcohol is used as an endproduct or as an intermediate in producing other industrial chemicals with applications in the plastics, textile, perfume, and chemicals industries. 1-Hexanol is commercially produced from petrochemicalsvia processes the require substantial energy inputs, use toxic gases, and waste that is difficult to dispose of. Suffice to say, current approaches for making 1-hexanol are neither sustainable nor environmentally friendly.Microbial processes are a promising,sustainable alternative to petroleum-based approaches for making chemicals such as 1-hexanol. However, most of today&#39;s processes for the biological production of chemicals are simply not as carbon efficient. These inefficiencies are namely due to theto loss of ~33% of the sugar&#39;s carbon as carbon dioxide waste(CO2), which causes an increase in production costs and results in bioprocesses that are economically disadvantaged- arguably the most crucial factor for commercializing technology to produce chemicals. Thus, there is a clear need within the chemicals industry to develop bio-based renewable processes with improved yields, better economics, smaller environmental footprints, and greater sustainability than existing petroleum-based processes.We are developing a platform of enzyme-based pathways for converting renewable feedstocks such as corn-stover &amp; woody biomass into chemicals, where essentially noneof the sugar&#39;s carbon is lost as CO2. Our\"carbon-conserving\" (C2) pathwaysenable microbes to make chemicals like 1-hexanol with improved theoretical yieldsand more economically compared to state-of-the-art approaches. During the previous Phase I project, we confirmedthe technical feasibility of our novel enzyme-based C2 pathway. In Phase II, we aim to integrate this C2 pathway into an engineered &amp; optimizedindustrially-relevant microorganism with a robustability to produce1-hexanol from sugars, which will allow us to transition to larger scales for developing the entire bio-based processto make 1-hexanol.The commercialization of our C2 technology for producing1-hexanol will have several broad-reaching benefits such as alleviating dependence on foreign oil, decreasing adverse environmental consequences of current processes, and promoting sustainable manufacturing. Successful completion of our project will also provide a new foundation for sustainable industrial chemicals as well as diversify the use of agricultural and forest feedstocks. Doing so will create new markets for agricultural and rural businesses, thereby expanding economic opportunities and creating jobs in the renewable energy/chemicals sector.",

        "abstract": "English language learners (ELL) are both the fastest growing and among the lowest performing student populations in rural schools. The average ELL student has spent seven years in U.S. school systems and is below grade level in reading, writing and math. High-poverty, minority children show gains in mathematics achievement during fourth through eighth grades when they attend schools focused on good teaching, successful instructional strategies, increased effort, better attendance and self-confidence in mathematics. Despite the influx of ELL students in rural communities, educational resources for these students are scarce, if they exist at all.AzTech Games is a suite of software applications with text read aloud to students, a storyline centered on historical events and in-game mathematical challenges and instruction. At the click of a button, written and spoken language switches from English to Spanish, providing bilingual supplemental instruction for schools that may have few, if any, bilingual staff. This technological solution is optimized for rural communities and usable by both ELL and non-ELL students, that teaches, tests and tracks progress in mathematics and English/language arts, accommodates to the student&#39;s native language and can be used by a regular (non-bilingual) classroom teacher.AzTech is centered on a computer game interface where a bilingual avatar guides the student through collection of assessment data and completion of increasingly difficult problems in computation, measurement and statistics concepts. Immediate feedback is provided to students, with reinforcement in the form of prizes earned for correct answers. The program analyzes incorrect answers and routes the student to appropriate instructional content based on the type of error identified. Instructional methods offer options of online games, quizzes, videos, animation and virtual manipulatives. Teachers can access analytic reports on individual student and class performance, with links to recommended online examples, class handouts and PowerPoint presentations. Utilizing software that enables us to create a cross-platform product, we address both the skills students need and account for hardware systems limitations commonly encountered when working in rural schools.After meeting all technical Phase I technical objectives, including prototype development, usability testing, creation of customized assessments and teacher resources and baseline data collection, The Julia Group has established the necessary foundation to bring to commercialization a product that addresses the performance gap for ELL students and takes into consideration the technical obstacles regularly encountered by rural schools.In Phase II, we are building upon our findings and expanding our research. Phase II will see the development of of 16 game levels in an online application that integrates instruction in English language and mathematics within a 3-D virtual world. To complement the software application, The Julia Group will create library of supplemental instructional resources and professional development resources for teachers. The end result will be a multifaceted commercial product on the marketplace. We will collect and analyze student performance and engagement data in a multi-year, multi-state study, with schools from three rural districts in three states already committed. In addition to efficacy data, we will collect and analyze data on barriers to implementation within rural schools the findings of which will not only further shape our efforts, but will also be disseminated in publications and presentations for the benefit of future technology companies in serving rural communities.",

Continued reliance on these limited, price-volatile, wild-caught \"wet fish\" resources present a critical constraint to the sustainable expansion of high-end marine aquaculture and its ability to produce healthy, efficiently grown, desirable fish for a growing and increasingly prosperous global population. Kampachi Farms has sought to resolve this issue by adapting the USDA-developed \"Formulated Sardine\" - a fibrous, high-moisture, soft extruded strip of formulated feed which more closely mimics the texture of natural fish - to high-end marine fish such as groupers and tunas. By switching to a formulated diet, sustainable, scalable agricultural oils and proteins can be incorporated into the diets of these high-value fish, rendering their expanded commercial production both more economically attractive to investors, and more environmentally sound.Phase I research thoroughly demonstrated the feasibility of this concept by conducting palatability and grow-out trials to determine if Formulated Sardines would be accepted by high-value marine carnivores and generate acceptable growth rates attractive to commercial culture. Several experimental formulations of Formulated Sardines were developed and manufactured by USDA ARS fish nutritionist Dr. Frederic Barrows, including the early deployment of a 100% fishmeal-free blend, which became the focus of grow-out trials during this study. All experimental diets were formulated to be nutritionally suitable for the two species tested: the relatively sedentary Giant Grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) and the more active kampachi (Seriola rivoliana). Growth, feed conversion ratio (FCR) and feed waste metrics were compared between populations of both species fed wet fish diets, pelleted diets and Formulated Sardines. The results of these trials were promising, with Formulated Sardines accepted by both grouper and yellowtail at comparable rates to their standard feeds, producing no significant differences in growth performance or FCR. The fact that these results were attained with a 0% fishmeal formulation, months to years ahead of when that development was expected, only underscores the Formulated Sardine feed format&#39;s potential for commercial utility in the culture of high-value marine finfish such as grouper and tuna. The apparent palatability of these diets in Grouper and Yellowtail studies also suggests several additional areas across the hatchery production cycles of these species where Formulated Sardine-type diets could provide significant advantages over traditional feeds.Kampachi Farms therefore proposes, through this Phase II research, to bring this novel aquafeed format closer to commercial viability by expanding into trials with Pacific Bluefin and Yellowfin Tunas, assessing its efficacy in specialty formulated broodstock diets, and determining the effectiveness of a derivative soft \"crumble\" product in accelerating weaning of highly prey-selective, difficult-to-rear marine finfish larvae onto formulated feeds.",

        "abstract": "Two-phase cooling systems are an enabling technology for high energy lasers deployed on aircraft, but the flow morphology can be influenced by the accelerations of airborne platforms, affecting the thermal and flow performance of the cooler. Microchannel coolers using low Bond number coolants can reduce these effects, since surface tension forces dominate over buoyancy effects. The insensitivity to accelerations was demonstrated in the Phase I program: this Phase II effort will provide the understanding and computational tools required to design two-phase microchannel systems with confidence.  The program will study the behavior of two-phase flows in high aspect ratio rectangular microchannels at high heat fluxes, using flow visualization and computational fluid dynamics to create reliable flow maps. The understanding gained from these studies will be used to improve computationally efficient numerical analysis tools, which can be used in future design efforts.

The Light Weight Tow Cable (LWTC), which contains high-performance polymer fiber reinforcement, has significant advantages over the alternative heavy weight tow cable (HWTC) that is reinforced with steel fibers. The LWTC provides enhanced capabilities in shallow towing and long scope lengths for ideal performance in littoral waters. While the LWTC provides these advantages, it suffers from significant durability issues. The LWTC performs well in tension, but compression loads can cause buckling and damage to the sensitive data transmission lines. The Phase I team developed a stiffened medium weight tow cable (MWTC) having a substantial increase in buckling resistance with a minimal increase in cable weight. Puncture and cut resistance was also improved. During the Phase II effort TRI/Austin will continue development of the MWTC materials and processes that were investigated in Phase I. Test results from Phase I and Phase I Option cable prototypes will be used to refine the cable design and evaluate additional performance properties, including the ability to terminate the cable into existing hardware. Prototype cable will be produced for extended operational field performance evaluation aboard a US Navy Submarine.",

        "abstract": "Reducing Cost, Improving Efficiency and Productivity of Farming Crickets as Food IngredientsAs the human population grows, it is ever more important to sustain rather than increase our levels of consumption from the earth and it&#39;s ecosphere. The market for protein is exploding. The global market for protein products was $15.2 billion in 2012. By 2017, these markets are projected to increase 30% to $20 billion dollars. Demand for protein has expanded well beyond the traditional body builder market into every area of life including weight loss, wellness, and sports nutrition among others. Yet already about 70% of agricultural land, and 30% of the total land on earth, is used to produce livestock. Thus, expanding the use of land for livestock production is neither feasible nor sustainable. The good news is farming insects, utilizes less energy, feed, land and water than other livestock at any scale (small or large). Thus, farming insects contributes less to climate change and overall pollution levels. However, farming insects such as crickets has not had the benefit of advanced farming practices, technology and innovations that other animal derived commodities have had over the past 150+ years. Insect farming has remained entirely manual, much smaller scale and largely unchanged for at least 60+ years. Due largely to lack of mechanization and innovation, these inefficiencies result in high costs and unreliable supply. Frozen crickets cost $4-$10 per pound. Compared to other protein sources, this is high. Cricket powder is at $24 per pound. Cricket powder requires 4 pounds of crickets to produce 1 pound of powder). Thus, any cost reductions in cricket production will result in a 4 fold corresponding reduction in the cost of dried products/ingredients made from them. In order to become competitive in the market, frozen cricket prices must drop to $1 per pound. The current Phase II SBIR funding will allow us to refine and commercialize our successful Phase I innovations to improve the feasibility of insects as a mainstream agricultural product and food ingredient. With those funds we will be able to: 1) improve efficiency/cost and mechanize cricket mass harvesting and freezing through refinement of our Phase I cricket harvesting/flash freezing prototype, 2) refine our Phase I prototype to produce a market-ready device to improve efficiency/cost of water delivery to crickets and 3) develop at least 5 new cricket feed formulations which will be quickly commercialized on new and existing farms.All Things Bugs LLC (www.crickepowder.com) continues to commercialize its innovations the rapidly growing human consumption market. Recently, all major news sources have covered insect as an up and coming source of food, often mentioning our company. Examples include: Huffington Post, Forbes, Fortune, Fast Company, The Newyorker, Fox News and many others. Further, as a leader in the industry in innovation and as the largest manufacturer of high quality insect based ingredients, our company is well positioned to commercialize technologies from this project. Our company has had great commercial success with its finely milled whole cricket powder (GrioproTM) (developed from other Phase I and Phase II USDA SBIR projects), including nearly half $1 million (over 10,000 pounds of cricket powder) in sales. Our product far out-performs the competition in overall quality as finer, ligher colored and overall better functionality in a wide variety of food and beverage products. It is being used by other companies in protein bars, baked goods. protein shakes, snacks, pastas and many other products on the market. We believe that these innovations will be broadly useful beyond crickets for farms producing other edible insects such as grasshoppers, mealworms and others. If successful, with this Phase II project, our company will be a step toward revolutionizing the food industry and an important change for agriculture by improving production efficiencies a",

        "abstract": "For Phase I, PathSensors, Inc. developed a proof-of-concept multi-well diagnostic device, based upon CANARY technology, capable of detecting Ralstonia solancerarum down to 65 colony-forming units (cfu) in response to the NIFA SBIR solicitation. In the Recovery Plan for Ralstonia solancearum Race 3 biovar 2, which was drafted as part of the National Plant Disease Recovery System, the USDA lists one of the \"highly important\" research priorities as: \"explor[ing] novel diagnostic techniques to detect R3b2 quickly and at low concentrations, such as ... highly sensitive antibody-responsive cell culture systems.\" To continue to meet this call PathSensors, through Phase II funding, will further develop the instrumentation and assays to fully integrate the testing system into a diagnostic lab setting for high throughput sample processing.CANARY&reg; (Cellular Analysis and Notification of Antigen Risks and Yields) is a cell-based biosensor technology that demonstrates unprecedented performance in terms of speed, sensitivity, and ease-of-use when compared with other standard detection technologies. The USDA has invested over one million dollars to develop CANARY&reg;. The USDA CPHST Laboratory in Beltsville, MD has used the Ralstonia biosensor to achieve one of the lowest limits of detection (LoD) of any biosensor-based, or other type of assay, for the detection of Ralstonia, achieving an LoD of 3 cfu from infected potato slices. Using PathSensors&#39; engineering and design expertise, we developed instrumentation that uses commercially available, off-the-shelf parts linked together and controlled through an integrated computer software system. Users are led through all steps of the assay via a computer software program. Positive or negative sample identification will be provided by processing the CANARY&reg; light output signal through an automated detection algorithm.To further commercialize this product, we intend to refine both our sample preparation methods and the user interface. We will also expand the catalogue of diagnostic assays by adapting this technology to current and existing plant pathogen assays such as tests for Phytophthora spp. and Citrus leprosis virus. In addition, PathSensors will develop a new biosensor for detecting the causative agent citrus greening disease, Candidatus Liberibacter spp. Citrus greening disease or Huanglongbing (HLB) is the most significant disease to threaten citrus production worldwide. The disease is widespread in both Brazil and Florida and is currently spreading to Texas and California. Once infected, citrus orchards are usually destroyed or become unproductive within eight years. The University of Florida reported that citrus greening has cost Florida&#39;s economy over $4 billion and 8,000 jobs, with losses of up to 30-40% of the expected citrus crop. To stem the spread and increase surveillance potential, a fast, high throughput assay needs to be developed for citrus greening. The instrumentation developed during Phase I answers this need and, to this end, we have partnered with Dr. John Hartung at USDA-ARS to incorporate his antibodies into the HLB assay.To build the confidence in the developed system, PathSensors will have third party diagnostic labs test and verify the performance. Upon validation, this system will be deployed and used in survey programs, field labs, and diagnostic testing facilities. Furthermore, this system will be made available to exporters to assure their plants are pathogen-free prior to shipping. Finally, PathSensors will further adapt the multiplex system for use with other existing plant pathogen CANARY&reg; cell lines, such as those for Phytophthora and Citrus leprosis virus.",

        "abstract": "The current dependence of the United States on fossil fuels has sparked enormous interest in the development of biomaterials derived from biomass, specifically cellulosic biomaterials. Cellulosic biomaterials are a carbon neutral, renewable resource, and their use could drastically curtail total carbon dioxide emissions while also reducing U.S. dependence on fossil fuels. Biofuels is one example of biomaterials that can be derived from biomass. Worldwide biomass energy resources are estimated at 2 x 1021 J per year; this compares to the total worldwide energy reserve of about 2 x 1022 J stored in crude oil. Therefore, biomass grown over the course of a decade sequesters the energetic equivalent to the entire worldwide reserve of crude oil and represents an enormous reserve of energy that has yet to be significantly tapped. In addition, the United States itself has large reserves of cellulosic biomass, and it presents a potential route to energy independence.The Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI) has identified a potentially attractive cellulose pretreatment process. Key to success of the CMS innovative pretreatment process is very high recovery of key starting materials. CMS has identified and provided preliminary data for successful membrane recovery of key starting materials. In Phase I CMS and JBEI demonstrated the pretreatment process and a novel membrane process for recovering the valuablekey starting materials. Using the basic datawe have quantified cost savings of CMS process being more than 60% relative to alternative process.CMS has put together a strong team of experts to demonstrate the CMS process. In Phase II we will scale up and optimize the CMS system and build a pilot test system to demonstrate the concept at larger scale. Using the pilot scale data we will conduct an engineering and economic analysis to highlight the economic advantage of the proposed concept vs. conventional technologies. This research and development project, if successful, will not only lead to a non-fossil fuel source of less-costly bio-fuels, but will also provide apractical routeto high value bio-chemicals. We expect alarge commercialization potential with this project.",

        "abstract": "Bovine tuberculosis (TB), a zoonotic disease caused by Mycobacterium bovis, continues to plague the cattle industry in the United States (US) and worldwide. Current diagnostic methods are inadequate; therefore, improved tests are urgently needed for disease control/eradication. The goal of the proposed research is to develop a simple, rapid, accurate, animal-side and cost-effective blood test for bovine TB in cattle. The assay will use Chembio proprietary Dual Path Platform (DPP) technology and rationally designed antigens of M. bovis to detect specific antibodies within 20 minutes under field conditions.Phase I studies have demonstrated the technical feasibility of the proposed approach. Several seroreactive antigens were identified which, when combined in our DPP assay, provided a diagnostic accuracy of ~95%. Proposed Phase II work has three technical objectives: 1) develop DPP BovidTB Assay, 2) evaluate test performance, and 3) validate the product in preparation for regulatory approval. Key antigen screening out of &gt;100 novel M. bovis proteins will lead to designing efficient polyepitope fusion reagents for improved antibody detection. The DPP assay will be fully optimized and evaluated with extended panels of well-characterized serum specimens from cattle with confirmed M. bovis infection and from TB-free herds collected in the US, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and South Africa. Large-scale antigen production and DPP product manufacturing protocols will be validated. Portable optical readers will be evaluated to generate accurate quantitative data for objective DPP assay interpretation. Test performance evaluation results will be collected and analyzed to support regulatory submission.Upon successful completion of the Phase II work, Chembio will bring the new product to the US and international markets. The proposed research will be translated into significant commercial applications worldwide. The Chembio manufacturing facility in Medford, NY, is registered with FDA and licensed by USDA. The company has an extensive track record of new diagnostic product commercialization, including DPP VetTB Assay for captive cervids and elephants, and an established network of international distributors. A new blood test with superior performance and practical features will improve bovine TB control/eradication programs. Thus, the proposed research will meet the goals of the USDA Program Priorities and Societal Challenge Areas related to animal production and protection, and it will satisfy the public interest to increase food security and promote exports of agricultural biotechnology.",

There is a wealth of information and data that indicate that the occurrence of infectious gastrointestinal diseases is globally on the rise; and that food-borne pathogens can readily adapt to environmental changes, contributing significantly to this escalation. In addition, there are major challenges in the development of timely and economical methods to identify pathogens from food samples suspected of causing these illnesses. Lynntech is developing an Adaptable, Label-free, Affordable, Rapid, Mobile (ALARM) system that will detect genomic nucleic acids purified from select pathogens responsible for food-related diseases. The ALARM technology is designed to be an integrated system that will perform pathogen nucleic acid amplification, as well as target detection using an innovative, field-ready, mobile system.Lynntech has established a highly innovative method to detect multiple genomic loci from each of three select food-borne pathogens using convective PCR. The three pathogens are: Salmonella species (spp.), Campylobacter spp., and E. coli (STEC). During Phase I, we successfully developed a multiplex convective PCR assay using primers specific for two loci within the genomes of each of the three bacterial pathogens. In addition, we included a single primer pair specific for an independent locus that serves as our internal positive control (IPC). Amplification of the IPC tells the user that the reaction is functioning properly. This represented a 7-plex convective amplification assay. In addition, Lynntech has developed and optimized a detection system that allows us to identify the convective PCR products in an economical, portable, label-free manner. This is a FET-based system that will signal if the pathogen is present in the food sample. If the food source is not contaminated, then there will be no signal. The IPC will signal for all reactions. Notably, both our multiplex convective amplification reaction and our FET-based detection system require low power, thus providing portability to the system.During Phase II, we will optimize amplification and detection. We will integrate these modules into a single system to detect food-borne pathogens at the point-of-use (in the field). By doing so, the Lynntech ALARM system will provide the global community with a rapid, portable, label-free means to detect pathogens responsible for food-related illnesses. This device will require minimal user training and will be applicable to the detection of multiple pathogens from a variety of food-related matrices. The Lynntech ALARM system will be applicable to both deliberate and unintentional contamination of food sources. Given the increasing incidence of food-related diseases throughout the world, the market potential for the Lynntech ALARM system is significant.",

        "abstract": "Demand for mapping forest disturbance and structural characteristics exists from USDA and Federal programs, industry, and international programs such as REDD. Applications range from operational forestry, assessing carbon sequestration, monitoring wildlife habitat, weather and disaster response, infestations, gauging forest productivity, and evaluating programs such as Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Easements, FIA, and state management plans. There is an opportunity to operationalize multiscale Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to generate metrics of stand structure and spatiotemporal changes. Specifically, this SBIR Phase II is to prototype an automated system and scale products for above ground biomass, forest stand height, crown canopy cover, and disturbance detection using multiscale SAR. During Phase II we build on previous work and leverage ongoing partnerships with USDA USFS and space agencies (NASA, USGS, JAXA, ISRO). Our focused Phase II builds on Phase I case studies by conducting a coordinated campaign of near-simultaneous collection of field data, SAR, and Lidar in partnership with USFS; adds the recently launched operational Sentinel C-band satellites; and scales products to larger areas in a robust and automated approach. We considered recommendations from Phase 1 reviews, Science Advisory Panel feedback, and the most promising outcomes from Phase 1. The long-term (Phase III) vision is to 1.) provide disturbance mapping services, 2.) build and offer robust Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) forest metrics derived from multiscale SAR, and 3.) develop Public Private Partnerships (PPP) to support regional, Federal (USFS, NASA, EPA), and international programs centered on monitoring forest disturbances and characterizing ecosystems services.",

        "abstract": "Ammonia (NH3) is an extremely important feedstock for producing nitrogen fertilizers, such as anhydrous ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) and urea (CO(NH2)2), that provide essential nutrition for crop vitality. The worldwide production of ammonia is more than 100 million tons per year. The conventional Haber-Bosch ammonia production process requires high pressure and temperature (up to 300 atm and 500&deg;C) and is, as such, extremely energy-intensive.The proposed Phase II project aims to further scale up the electrochemical synthesis of ammonia at lower temperature and pressure, and integrate this technology with off-peak renewable energy towards building distributed ammonia plants. The reactants are nitrogen and water that are immediately available and abundant. High-performance electrocatalysts and hybrid anion exchange membrane will be used to further enhance the ammonia production rate and process stability. These efforts may help transform the electrochemical production of ammonia to a more practical level.The successful application of this technology will lead to ammonia synthesis via a more environmentally-benign and economically viable approach, compared to the conventional Haber-Bosch process. The synthesized ammonia using renewable energy can be widely used as a feedstock for fertilizers in agriculture. The ammonia can also be considered as a means of storing surplus renewable energy during off-peak hours.",

        "abstract": "Hadal Inc. is partnering with the Pennsylvania State University through its Applied Research Laboratory (PSU:ARL) to develop a 6000 depth rated d36-based shear mode transducer. The combined experience provides an opportunity to develop and test a single crystal projector for incorporation into Navy and commercial systems. The discovery of a large longitudinal (d36) shear coefficient in piezo-crystals has lead to a novel transducer design previously unattainable with conventional piezo-ceramic. This crystal cut allows the working electrodes to be the same as the poling electrodes so that large driving electric fields can be applied without depoling. The electromechanical properties surpass traditional 33 mode crystal cuts. Measured d36 coefficients in the PMNT and PIMNT systems exceed 2200 pm/V and k36 values are greater than 0.80. This cut also has an extraordinarily high elastic compliance greater than 190 x 10-12 m2/N and a mechanical Q over 800. These characteristics are ideal for compact, high power, broadband acoustic projectors. Phase I suggested it was possible to build a compact shear mode transducer that operates at 10,000 psi ambient pressures. The design utilizes a two-stage isolation mount, housing, and fairing. Further investigation into a suitable pressure housing, fairing, and modified shear transducer is required.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the expedited development of a novel non-surgical medical device and therapeutic treatment for the approximately 1 in 3 women over the age of 30 who suffer from urinary incontinence, two thirds of whom, in part due to notable deficiencies of available solutions, elect to live without treatment while their symptoms progressively worsen. Urinary incontinence, although a very private concern, has far-reaching physical, psychological, social, and economic implications. For example, urinary incontinence has been found to reduce health-related quality of life measures on par with depression, incontinence is the number one reason for admittance into nursing homes, and the annual cost to the US healthcare system is estimated at $25 billion. Through design and validation activities this project will demonstrate the functionality of a wearable device that provides discreet, comfortable, easy-to-use therapy for female stress urinary incontinence. The technological understanding gained through this work lays the groundwork for subsequent commercialization of an FDA cleared product that will enhance the lives of tens of millions of American women. The proposed project provides a new framework for wearable therapeutics by enabling the patient to treat incontinence via discreet surface electrical stimulation without interruption to daily activity. Current non-surgical care often involves electrical stimulation via intravaginal probe, a treatment most woman are not willing to adopt or maintain. This project builds on successful Phase I feasibility work in which a contiguous array of cutaneous electrodes placed proximate the perineal tissue to deliver sufficient electrical muscle stimulation to promote pelvic floor toning were shown to maintain this efficacy under conditions associated with continuous wear. The Phase II project goal is to develop an incontinence specific electrical muscle stimulator to function with the electrode array. The system architecture will enable manipulation of the therapeutic waveform to support future multi-armed clinical studies designed to test the efficacy of various treatment regimens. The system will also track treatment frequency, duration and intensity to provide information to clinical researchers. Activity will include design, prototype fabrication, performance testing, human factors assessments, iteration and electrical safety validation. Refinements to the electrode array are also anticipated. The project will deliver a device suitable for future evaluation a human clinical studies, FDA clearance and product commercialization.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable a commercial implementation of holographic video microscopy, a fast, precise and flexible technology for measuring the properties of individual colloidal particles suspended in fluid media. This disruptive technology solves critical manufacturing problems across industries that work with colloidal dispersions. Demonstrated applications include: 1) monitoring the growth of nanoparticle agglomerates in precision slurries used to polish semiconductor wafers where scratches due to slurry agglomerates are responsible for waste valued at $1 billion annually; 2) tracking concentrations of dangerous contaminants in wastewater streams; and 3) measuring the concentration of protein aggregates in biopharmaceuticals, a safety concern noted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in this $250 billion industry. Holographic video microscopy is unique among particle-characterization technologies in providing comprehensive information about the size, shape and composition of individual particles in real time and in situ. Having access to this wealth of data facilitates product development, creates new opportunities for process control and provides a new tool for quality assurance across a broad spectrum of industries enabling safer, less expensive products for consumers while providing cost savings to manufacturers. The technical objectives of this project are: 1) to optimize the design of the underlying holographic microscopy system without compromising the quality of results; 2) to enable quantitative concentration determination including corrections for perturbations introduced by flow dynamics; 3) to expand the domain of operation to characterize non-spherical particles and 4) to apply machine-learning algorithms for automated robust operation. Using holographic video microscopy for commercial applications requires adaptation and innovation in the design of the prototype instrument that was used to demonstrate feasibility. Streamlining the optical train will require advanced modeling and the creation of new methods of correcting optical aberrations to enable ease of manufacture. Additional improvements in design will include advances in improving microfluidic flow control to generate accurate concentration determination, to adapt holographic analysis algorithms for characterizing the structure of aspheric particles, and to extend analytical capabilities for turbid fluids. Finally, innovative machine-learning using neural network algorithms demonstrated significant improvements for analytical robustness in Phase I and will be extended to a wider range of applications. The Phase II effort will enable holographic video microscopy of real-world samples with typical measurement times of a few minutes.",

On-going progress is generating growth in the bioprinting market creating demands for new job skills in the near future. To address industry needs, schools must ready themselves with the right tools and equipment to train next generation students. Moreover, increased accessibility of technology in education can help to empower students and expand their scientific creativity. However, current 3D bioprinting instrumentation are primarily designed for industry use and expensive. Technical barriers further prohibit many schools from gaining access. To truly democratize technology innovation for next generation scientists and engineers, a sustainable solution catered to the education market is necessary. This SBIR Phase II project is aimed at addressing this opportunity gap and will create an affordable 3D bioprinting equipment and educational toolkit catered to high schools and colleges. The proposed bioprinting equipment will be multi-functional so that teachers can use it for a variety of classroom applications. In addition, the educational toolkit will include student-friendly software tools facilitating experiments in 3D bioprinting, bioreagent kits, and curriculum to support teachers in using the bioprinters in the classroom. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to create a highly functional and versatile bioprinting equipment and educational toolkit for the high school and college education market. The motivation behind this work is to increase accessibility of new and cutting-edge tools to next generation students who will not only benefit from gaining industry-relevant skills they need in the near future but provide them with the opportunity to innovate. The proposed multi-functional bioprinting equipment will facilitate increased hands-on learning activities in the classroom, a key component in learning science and practice engineering, and project-based learning. To this end, the development of curriculum to support use of the 3D bioprinter is critical in manifesting adoption in the classroom. From the hardware engineering perspective, the project will focus on engineering design to achieve integration of multiple functionalities in the proposed bioprinting equipment.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to transform commercial construction through the democratization of scanning and automation of Building Information Modeling (BIM). Constant design and change management is a unique challenge that is costing the US construction industry billions of dollars annually. In order to prevent such a huge economic loss, this industry is in the path for a digital revolution. BIM is known as the first truly global digital technology that could revolutionize the construction industry. However, BIM usage is currently limited because it is only viable for large-scale projects. The primary reason is that the process is too laborious and expensive. The proposed technology will completely eliminate these barriers. Its ease-of-use, ubiquity of the capturing device, and automated object detection democratizes as-built BIM modeling. Enormous value could be generated due to streamlining and data management capabilities that are offered by the technology in the form of accelerated project schedules, reduced numbers of requests for information and change orders, and timely identified design clashes. This will pave the way to increase the competitiveness of the US construction industry, by enabling new products and services that support automatic BIM modeling. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project investigates the technical and commercial feasibility of an automatic and inexpensive solution for the Scan-to-BIM problem in the construction industry. Scan-to-BIM refers to 3D scanning of a physical structure and converting the captured raw spatial data into an object-oriented, semantically-rich model. Although there are a few technologies that aim to facilitate this process, the 3D modeling component remains primarily a manual and time-consuming task. When using the proposed technology, a non-technical worker videotapes the target structure. The video is automatically sent to a server for processing. A unique videogrammetric 3D reconstruction engine reconstructs the 3D geometry of the structure in the form of a 3D point cloud. It then extracts object hypotheses from key video frames and spatial data in the form of observations. Afterwards, it optimizes a novel coherent joint probability distribution function and infers a 3D layout. The outcome is an object-oriented 3D representation of the structure with embedded geometrical attributes and property sets. The main novelty of this technology lies in a hybrid approach that combines low-level segmentation with high-level space modeling. This advances the state-of-the-art in robust intelligence, particularly the interpretation of complex, unstructured data.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to help protect the environment by replacing existing toxic and environmentally-hazardous corrosion inhibitors used as lubricant additives with more eco-friendly alternatives. Release of lubricants (for example from loss during use, improper disposal of waste lubricants, accidental spillage, or off-shore drilling) has the potential to cause damage to the environment. Awareness of the toxic nature of current lubricant additives is a driver to develop new technologies for more environmentally friendly products. This project addresses the development of novel, environmentally friendly corrosion inhibitor lubricant additives. Besides the environmental benefits of the new technology, the lubricant industry may also benefit by expansion into environmentally sensitive market sectors (for example, marine lubricants used on ships) through the use of safer and less toxic additives. The new products also utilize non-petroleum based raw materials from renewable and sustainable resources, thus reducing dependence on petroleum. Apart from being non-toxic and environmentally friendly, the proposed products are also expected to be more effective inhibitors as compared to the products currently used in the market. The objectives of this Phase II research project are to design and develop environmentally friendly corrosion inhibitors providing high performance while meeting the eco-toxicological requirements of environmentally acceptable lubricants (EAL), including bio-lubricants. The use of corrosion inhibitors in lubricants is essential to protect metal surfaces. Unfortunately, many commercial corrosion inhibitors present issues with aquatic toxicity, persistence in the environment, and/or bioaccumulation that render them unacceptable for use in EAL or bio-lubricants. Awareness of the eco- toxicological problems of current inhibitors and the implementation of new regulations mandating the use of EAL in certain applications (e.g. marine lubricants) has created an urgent need in the market to replace existing products and the opportunity to develop new technologies for corrosion inhibition. This proposal addresses the key steps involved in the product development of corrosion inhibitors for biolubricants; namely (a) molecular design optimization, (b) cost-effective process scale up, (c) preparation of pound scale of lead products in the laboratory set-up; as identified in Phase I, (c) assessment of eco-toxicological properties using industry standard OECD/ASTM test methods and structure activity relationship (SAR) calculations, and (d) product storage stability testing.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is in support of Branch Technology's novel Additive Manufacturing (AM) process that combines 3D printing technology and conventional construction materials to enable a new way to create buildings. The construction market in the US is approximately 8% of GDP. Any portion of the market that could be enhanced would have a large impact in the US economy. To that end, Branch is creating a process similar to building found in the natural world. In the formation of natural systems, material is the most expensive commodity; a structure is derived by the efficient use of material, but shape is free to be created in almost any form. Branch can approach this efficiency with additive manufacturing, where form is created and material is deposited only when needed and little waste is created. At the core of Branch's method of AM-based construction are three key developments: a three-dimensional freeform structure (the cellular matrix or lattice) which serves as a scaffold for other materials, a robotically- controlled extrusion mechanism by which the cellular matrix is produced, and the algorithms necessary to control the robot for successful production. The proof of concept for this process and more have already been demonstrated by Branch in Phase I of this grant. The technical objectives for Phase II focus on improving the procedures and technology already created. The focus areas for this phase are algorithm development, hardware improvements, the application of finishing materials, code compliance testing, and material science experiments. Algorithm development consists of refining and creating the software necessary to extrude the printed matrix and support a client base. Hardware improvements are necessary to improve the speed and efficiency of the process to create a commercially viable workflow. This research will necessitate the purchase of extra hardware for experimentation. American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing for load bearing capacity is necessary to enter the market and provide code compliant construction. Experimentation in the application of finished materials to the 3D printed lattice such as spray foam and concrete are vital to the realization of complete buildings.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is the reduction of deaths and long-term disabilities in people suffering from bleeding in the brain caused by intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or traumatic brain injury. Currently, physicians detect worsening bleeding through a clinical exam where a patient shows outward signs of deterioration in their neurological status. By the time these signs of additional bleeding appear, much of the damage to the brain has already occurred. About a third of people who suffer a severe traumatic brain injury either die or are left disabled. For hemorrhagic stroke, 60% die and 70% of survivors are left with significant disabilities. A device which transmits and receives very low power radiofrequency signals has been created that can be put on a patients head. The presence of blood outside of the brain's vessels and arteries creates a characteristic change in the radio signal used by the device. Using radio waves to non-invasively detect brain bleeds will allow treatment to start sooner, which will save lives, reduce disabilities and lower the cost of treating severe brain injuries. The proposed project tests (i) the ability of the device to detect and characterize small changes in ICH size and location over time and (ii) the ability to display changes in the bleed in a meaningful way to physicians. An algorithm for determining the size and location of the hemorrhage will be tested using both a phantom model that mimics the human brain and an IACUC-approved pig ICH model. Multiple hemorrhage volumes and locations will be used to test the algorithm's ability to detect hemorrhage volume changes within 1 mL, location within 1 cm, and distinguish changes due to the hemorrhage from physiological changes in a living pig's brain. Signal measurements taken before, during, and after infusion of blood will be captured at each time point to test the accuracy of the algorithm. Software will be developed to display the information from the algorithm in three-dimensions while giving doctors and nurses control over thresholds for triggering an alarm and how often the device scans. To test the software, the data collected during the pig experiments will be used to determine how accurate the display matches the location and size of the hemorrhage from CT images collected during testing.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project provides a technology platform to convert non-food biomass, such as wood and corn stalks, into biofuels, chemicals, and bioproducts. Biomass utilization is a solution to increase global sustainability and decrease petroleum-based greenhouse gas emissions. This project will use wood biomass to simultaneously co-produce three high-end products, dissolving pulp, furfural, and technical lignin, of which the dissolving pulp and furfural are the focus of this project. Current methods of producing these products only use one of the three primary biomass components. By co-producing two products, revenues increase and unit production costs decrease as production costs are spread over a larger product volume. The use of this solvent obtained from the biomass is a unique approach in the biomass conversion industry and offers an alternative to conventional enzyme or microbial processing. Benefits include restoring furfural production in the United States, decreasing dissolving pulp production costs, and increasing the commercial value of renewable biomass that currently has low or no value. This sustainable and environmentally friendly technology will increase global sustainability and revitalize rural economies by stimulating investment and creating jobs. The objectives of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate and advance to pilot scale our technology to simultaneously co-produce dissolving pulp and furfural from biomass using gamma valerolactone (GVL) as solvent. While other technologies focus on the production of a single product from biomass, GVL?' ability to fractionate lignocellulosic biomass into its three main components (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) at high concentration and purity, produce significant cost and technical advantages. GVL fractionation produces solid cellulose at high yield (>90%) and purity (>90%), without the need for pre-treatment or further chemical refining. This cellulose can be converted into dissolving pulp for high-end applications such as textiles (rayon), cellophane, or microcrystalline cellulose. The hemicellulose fraction does not need to be separated from the GVL and is readily converted into furfural within GVL at high yields (>75%) and high concentrations, minimizing separation costs. Preliminary mass and energy balances and techno-economic modeling based on lab data predict attractive financial returns. Tasks will focus on biomass fractionation to produce dissolving pulp, furfural purification, and GVL recovery at bench-scale. This experimental work will inform the engineering development for an integrated, continuous process, pilot demonstration unit.",

Suboptimal operational decision-making in emergency departments and hospitals leads to inefficiencies that result in excessive patient wait-times, the diversion of ambulances to other emergency departments, wasted resources and patients who either leave before being treated or against medical advice. By connecting modern analytical approaches, including statistical modeling and systems engineering methods, to real-time data routinely collected by hospitals, the proposed project promises to result in a tremendously valuable analytics platform that will assist administrators in making dozens of operational and staffing decisions each day. This informed decision-making will not only improve hospital efficiency, it will lead to both healthier and more satisfied patients and simultaneous dramatic increases in revenue and profit. The technology proposed will have the potential to add significant value to the approximately 5,000 hospitals in the U.S., often on the order of millions of dollars annually. Hospitals and health systems now realize the value of effective analytics, and the analytics platform proposed here will be an obvious investment for any emergency department or hospital whose goal is to provide the best care to its patients at lower costs. The proposed project promises to yield a set of decision-support applications upon which emergency departments and hospitals will base their decisions each day. Substantial investments by hospitals and health systems on information technology, and in particular, electronic health records, have set the stage for evidence-based, data-driven decisions. These decisions will effectively leverage real-time data along with analytical methods such as statistical forecasting and event-simulation modeling. In particular, this proposed project will develop software applications, based on these analytical methods and linking to real-time data sources, tailored to emergency departments and hospitals. This project will involve 1) addressing the real-time needs of hospital operational decision-makers, 2) further developing a statistical and simulation modeling platform to inform these real-time needs, specifically reflecting emergency departments and whole hospitals, and 3) ultimately ensuring that actionable insights are delivered in a timely and intuitive manner to key stakeholders. These actionable insights that derive from the data and sophisticated methods must be delivered to the right decision-maker at the right time and in the right format, but will then have the capacity to substantially improve both the quality and efficiency of care-delivery throughout the hospital.",

Surgeons have the ability to prevent these catastrophic events, but only if the onset of the clot can be detected in a timely manner. Currently, of the patients who form clots after the targeted surgeries, half will suffer from a surgical failure due to the shortcomings of current modalities. This technology gives clinicians the ability to non-invasively track changes in blood flow within critical vessels to enable intervention prior to any compromise in health and prevent a majority of these catastrophic incidents. Beyond significant decreases in patient suffering and morbidity, such interventions will have an enormous positive economic impact on the health care system. This technology can also substantially improve clinical understanding of the clotting process and possibly enable non-invasive therapeutic treatments for these patients who otherwise would receive surgery. The proposed project offers significant intellectual and scientific merit associated with new methods of ultrasound flow analysis. The objective of this work is to develop a system that is able to collect a 3D volume of ultrasound data and automatically extract the blood flow data in the region of interest by detecting an implantable component. This novel approach to measuring vascular flow will be the first to enable detection of localized post-operative clot formation rather than detecting clot-related issues via delayed and indirect methods that leave patients at risk for surgical failures. This technique can allow for intervention earlier than all other available methods, thus improving patient outcomes and reducing hospital costs. Furthermore, this method enables automatic detection of critical changes in blood flow, eliminating the risk of human error. Lastly, dissemination of the technology developed in this proposal represents an important milestone towards the creation of simpler, more automated ultrasound systems that can place this non-invasive, non-ionizing modality in the hands of non-expert clinicians for use in a broader spectrum of medical applications.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to improve the commercial viability of technology that enables the real time measurement and control of landfill gas extraction systems. It has the potential to improve the economics of the Landfill Gas to Energy (LFG-E) market and reduce the environmental impact of landfills. With industry-wide implementation, annual revenues from existing LFG-E projects could be increased by over $450 million. The additional energy produced would power over 350,000 homes. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas (GHG), and the EPA estimates that in 2011, emissions from landfills accounted for nearly 17.5% of generation from all manmade sources in the US. The associated reduction in GHG emissions from improved landfill gas collection would be equivalent to the emissions of over 3.6 billion gallons of gasoline or 76 million barrels of oil. Furthermore, because of the improved economics, this Phase II project could encourage the development of new LFG-E projects, further expanding the size and value of this market. According to EPA estimates, currently undeveloped sites could account for an additional 850 MW of power generation, enough to power over 508,000 homes. The technical objectives of the project are 1) to reduce the cost of various system components, and 2) to address new product requirements related to third party safety and other certifications that are demanded by the market. The approach to cost reduction is to replace several commercially available off-the-shelf components (specifically, NDIR gas sensors and an electrically-actuated control valve) with custom designed alternatives that can meet product functional requirements at a 30% reduction in cost. In order to achieve the certifications that are demanded by the market it will be necessary to define the specific standards and protection concepts that are applicable, and then re-engineer hardware in accordance with these standards. This will involve a combination of component substitution and system re-design, depending on the specific protection concept(s) and hazardous location classification that are identified. The research will build upon the reliability and product functionality improvements that were a key outcome of the Phase I project, and successful completion of the research goals will enable more widespread adoption of real time control technology in the landfill gas industry.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project allows for the realization of a commercial millimeter-scale intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring product that can help neurosurgeons in treating patients with hydrocephalus. While the goal of this SBIR Phase II project is the development of said ICP monitor, the technology can also be translated to the development of 'smart dust', opening up the next generation of computing paradigm. This will mark a significant milestone towards massive-scale realization of internet of things, dramatically accelerating the technology adoption and research impact of millimeter-scale wireless sensor nodes. The technology adoption can be introduced to multiple markets including, but not limited to, medical, industrial, and consumer spaces. This would open up many new commercial opportunities that were previously limited by energy consumption and size, heralding a new era of computing in an unprecedented form factor and lifetime. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the development of a millimeter-scale intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring for improved treatment of hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a condition in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) builds up in the brain's ventricle area, causing head enlargement, epilepsy, and death. The only practical treatment for hydrocephalus is surgical implant of medical shunts, which relieves excess CSF to other parts of the body. The biggest problem with existing shunts is that they lack any embedded monitoring feature. Once the shunt is installed, there is no way to measure the internal pressure outside of hospital settings. The proposed monitor enables a 'smart shunt' solution, which continuously records ICP information inside the shunt for many years. This data is read out wirelessly and can be used to prevent shunt failures and improve the treatment of this lifelong disease.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project intends to meet the need for low cost dose-on-demand production of Carbon-11 isotope for biomarker and radiotracer applications in nuclear medicine. Biomarkers and radiotracers are commonly used for Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography (PET/CT) metabolic imaging, in support of research, drug discovery, and detection of cancer and other illnesses. They are also used for therapy staging of cancer, to determine if treatment is effective. Common examples include myocardial perfusion imaging of the heart to visualize blood flow and function, PET scanning of the brain to detect early onset Alzheimer's and brain tumors, and Choline PET/CT for the diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer. Carbon-11 is an important radiotracer/radiopharmaceutical that offers unique advantages due to its ability to be easily incorporated into many molecules without impacting biological activity. Carbon-11 is currently produced by using specialized targets on high-energy commercial cyclotrons. These cyclotrons cost millions of dollars to install, and existing targets are inefficient. Low energy cyclotrons are significantly less expensive, and are currently under development by multiple commercial companies. This project seeks to develop a novel cyclotron target methodology for producing Carbon-11 at low energies using unique nanomaterials, resulting in significantly lower costs. The intellectual merit of this project is in the use of novel nanomaterials to produce Carbon-11 more efficiently and at lower cost, through development of recoil escape targets. It is challenging to find a good target material suitable for both efficient production of Carbon-11, by one of several available nuclear reactions, and efficient recovery of the produced radiotracer in a usable form. The produced Carbon-11 can be difficult to recover, as it is easily trapped in many conventional target materials, resulting in low yields. Recent advances in nanoscience and technology allow for production of novel materials with unique characteristics. Boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT) are composed of fibers with single atomic thickness, or at most a few atoms thick, allowing Carbon-11 to be efficiently produced and recovered in the form of carbon dioxide gas using low energy cyclotrons. Prototype production targets will be developed and tested at commercial cyclotron sites. The process for collecting the produced Carbon-11 gas will be optimized to achieve the highest yields of usable radiotracer material. Efforts will be made to further develop BNNT materials with ideal characteristics, including high purity and optimal density.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to provide a usable stranded and associated gas collection capacity for oil & gas exploration companies. During drilling operations, valuable gas is lost through intentional venting and flaring, causing losses in natural gas delivered to the power plant or city gate. With the sector's expansion into more remote low-volume sites, these losses are increasing dramatically. Through this project's proposed novel Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) based storage technology, this project seeks to deliver a re-usable and transport ready intermodal container, to store gas at low pressure, eliminating the need to use expensive gas capture, purification and multi-stage compression systems. An economically feasible unprocessed natural gas storage technology would provide a useful tool for the domestic oil & gas industry in capturing what would be flared or vented and delivering it to the American economy. Taking the proposed novel MOF technology to the bench and pilot scale will show the feasibility of a flexible, transportable, low-cost infrastructure to abate flaring and venting. Successful developments in this project will help develop the knowledge for scale-up to large-scale vehicular tanks to allow for commercial implementation. The objectives of this Phase II research project are the development of stable and low-cost Metal-Organic framework (MOF) based storage technologies for the collection of usable stranded associated gas during drilling operations. In order to harness point source emissions, before being vented or flared, the project will develop a nano-engineered, MOF based sorbent for low-pressure capture and storage of unprocessed natural gas. The project will seek to develop a robust and scalable method to synthesize new MOFs containing other high-valence transition metal ions such as Al3+, Fe3+ and Cr3+. Furthermore, the project will screen a range of organic ligands for improving MOFs' surface property and storage capacity. Finally, by following alternative synthesis routes with low cost catalysts, the project will identify sorbent synthesis cost reduction strategies. The sorbent material will be tested with simulated vent/flare-gas compositions in a cyclic pressure range and the sorbent stability will be verified by an assortment of X-ray, spectroscopy, and microscopy methods. Following sorbent development, an ANG tank will be built and flare gas slipstream testing will be conducted in shale gas sites.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes new ways to inform, educate, advertise or entertain through a technology called projection mapping. This technology uses commodity video projectors to augment the surfaces of ordinary objects; applications range from advertising, events, and entertainment, to educational experiences at museums or schools, healthcare applications for rehabilitation and visualization, and simulation (e.g. military or employee training). Through multiple deployments at retail locations across the country, the company's prototypes have demonstrated that these applications will benefit not only the brands and companies that employ the technology, but also the end-users (students, consumers, etc), resulting in better engagement and faster learning when compared to achieving these same tasks through other media such as videos. Research performed during the Phase II project will allow the company to develop a scalable product and fulfill many deployments, bringing projection mapping to new markets. A free version of the company's software will also be available for non-commercial and academic use, enabling interdisciplinary research in fine arts and computer science. The R&D results generated from the research will be published and disseminated to the public. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build a commercially viable and scalable projection mapping system. While projection mapping has a long academic history, this captivating medium still remains out of commercial reach. As learned from over 50 customer discovery interviews, retailers are shifting towards location-based experiences to increase customer engagement and sales. Many other industries have a similar need to attract attention and convey information, but without a scalable product that can be easily deployed and maintained, they lack the means to provide these experiences. To address this need, the company will develop hardware and software systems to enable captivating and immersive projection mapping experiences. The core of this system is in software: the developed algorithms will robustly calibrate projection mapping systems comprising any number of projectors/cameras, automatically align projected content to the scene and perform color-correction when the display surfaces are non-white/textured. These algorithms will be validated through standard benchmarks, resulting in novel, state-of-the-art practices. Additionally, these methods will allow for reusable projection mapping content, a critical feature lacking in existing software, as well as cloud deployment and monitoring. New hardware configurations will also be developed to achieve new uses for projection mapping.",

The uses of video are increasing every day. Video instruction manuals are replacing printed instruction manuals. Video is replacing still images in on-line advertising, social media and billboards. It is predicted that over 90% of all Internet traffic will be video data in the next few years. Enabling all these applications requires the latest technology in video compression such as the techniques developed in this project. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project tackles the problem of creating a real time video encoder, using the latest H.265 compression technology, running in hardware on an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). An FPGA is a type of chip on which the logic is configurable - it can be programmed to implement any function. It represents a mid-point between a dedicated integrated circuit, which is very expensive to develop, and can never be changed or enhanced once it is fabricated, and a pure software solution which is very flexible but requires bulky and power hungry equipment (i.e. computers) as an underlying platform. The research conducted under this grant will devise, test, and implement algorithms that are amenable to realization on an FPGA, that operate in real time, and that yield a high quality result in terms of the visual quality of the compressed video with respect to the number of bits used. The goal, at the conclusion of this research, is the demonstration of a functional HEVC/H.265 encoder running on an FPGA which has cost, flexibility, power and performance advantages over other encoders.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to improve wheat yield globally by deploying newly developed, region-specific dwarfing genes. World population is predicted to grow to 9.6 billion by 2050. Wheat demand is expected to increase also due to a shift from rice to wheat consumption due to an expected increase in wealth around the globe. The increased wheat demand will have to be met under less land area and changing climate. Water use efficiency and increase in wheat yields will be important factors in meeting this demand. The proposed technology is poised to increase wheat yield under abiotic stress conditions. All of these benefits are expected to have a major positive impact on humanity. The wheat seed business is currently valued at up to $8.3 billion. The proposed technology will provide a competitive advantage to capture a significant market share of the wheat seed industry while contributing positively towards food security during the changing climate. This SBIR phase II project proposes to further develop and test alternative dwarfing genes to improve wheat yield and abiotic stress tolerance around the globe. Responsible for the \"green-revolution,\" dwarfing genes are required to obtain higher yields, but the two dwarfing genes present in more than 90% of the currently grown wheat varieties have serious ill-effects including abiotic stress sensitivity, reduced root length and biomass, seedling emergence, and vigor. During the Phase I research, four new dwarfing genes were identified and shown to be significantly better than the currently used genes. Phase II will focus on the comparison of the new genes with the old genes to show their true benefits. This research also will generate valuable data required for the development of \"release-ready\" varieties. Genetic background effects will be studied by transferring one of the new dwarfing genes into two different backgrounds followed by field and controlled condition evaluation. Future competitive advantage will be maintained by pyramiding the new dwarfing genes with complementary gene action. Closely linked DNA markers will be developed for an efficient transfer of the technology into diverse backgrounds.",

        "abstract": "Wildfires, based on 5-year average annual acres burned, have more than doubled over the last 30 years and total fire suppression costs have increased nearly an order of magnitude over the same period (i.e. &lt;$300M in 1985 to over $2B in 2015).1 The 2015 fire season, exacerbated by prolonged drought in the Western United States, resulted in ~10 million acres burned by wildfires across the US. Approximately 3.5 million acres of that total were in WA, ID, OR, and CA - regions that contain many waterways with Endangered Species Act (ESA) protected species.2 With the increase in wildfires comes an increase in fire suppression efforts, which in many cases includes the use aerial drops of flame retardant mixtures including FR salts like diammonium phosphate, viscosity modifiers, and corrosion inhibitors.3 These aerial drops are extremely effective tools for fighting fires, however, currently approved flame retardant chemistries are known to be toxic to aquatic species (for example the LD-50 for rainbow trout exposed to diammonium phosphate, a common flame retardant, is only 60-80 mg/L).4With the increased prevalence of wildfires in sensitive and ESA protected habitats, and particularly those that are threatening urban and suburban areas put fire fighters in difficult situations where the use of toxic flame retardants present varying environmental risks, however, not utilizing aerial flame retardant drops may result is significant loss of property and, potentially, lives. A Harvard University study predicts that wildfires will burn longer, wider, and create more smoke by the year 2050,5 which is consistent with the trends of the past 30 years. What is needed are effective flame retardant chemistries with significantly reduced environmental risks that can still provide wildfire fighters with effective management tools.Nano Terra demonstrated success in Phase I by developing a novel class of ammonium-freefire retardantchemicals that have a much lower toxicity to fish without compromising the FR performance. The planned work in Phase II will optimize the fire retardant formulation, validate the chemistry by being certified by the Forest Service, and address scale-up and manufacturability of the fire retardant to be cost-competitive with current commercial products.References:1.

        "abstract": "Feral swine (Sus scrofa) populations in the United States inflict serious and growing ecological and economic impacts to the farming and ranching ecosystems where their population continues to grow and invade new territory. These invasions ultimately impact the security, quality, and safety of the food supply and water resources coming from these regions. Recent and ongoing research is investigating the design and effectiveness of methods including traps, toxicant delivery systems, and bait formulas. However, these methods predominately lack sufficient ability to prevent unintended actions on cohabitating species. Using proven embedded sensor and signal processing technology, traditional and emerging baiting and bioagent delivery techniques can be augmented to prevent inadvertent treatment to other animals.Scientific studies highlight the consequences of the growing feral swine population and the challenges of effectively controlling additional growth. Feral swine are an invasive species well-known for destroying crops, damaging farmland by rooting, destroying natural resources such as water supplies, and spreading disease to livestock, other wildlife, and humans. In addition to agricultural impacts, evidence demonstrates many negative effects on local ecosystems and indigenous wildlife. Great need exists to have more impacting and game-changing population control systems targeting feral swine.To this end, the main goal of this research effort is to develop and test an automatic species-specific dual-sensory recognition system that can activate devices to deliver toxicants, disease vaccines, or contraceptives masked in baits. To maximize target-specific identification and minimize non-target activation (false-alarms) of management devices, the proposed system utilizes both acoustic and visual sensors together with a suite of highly efficient and robust algorithms. In the Phase II effort, ISTI will build upon our existing experience in Phase I to enhance and train algorithms to identify feral swine from in-field measurements in real-time using both audio and video observations. Phase II research will also demonstrate the ability to correctly identify feral swine while eliminating the risk of false alarms despite an unpredictable environment. Elimination of false positives differentiates this solution from other methods in that non-invading species are unharmed by population control activity. Phase II research will: (a) finalize the design of the acoustic-based recognition system developed in Phase I; (b) develop, implement, and test the companion image recognition system; (c) develop and implement a decision-level fusion algorithm to fuse the decisions of the acoustic and visual-based sensory channels to eliminate the incident of false alarms (e.g., other animals gaining access to the bait); (d) complete the hardware system with the addition of a low-cost camera; and (e) conduct comprehensive field testing and demonstrations in conjunction with our counterparts at NWRC APHIS. Performance metrics that will be used include probability of detection and classification, false alarm rates, and the classifier confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.The outcome of this research is extremely valuable to many USDA and NIFA programs. Using our automated species recognition system, selective baiting, pharmaceutical delivery, and improved management techniques for research and development (e.g., species-specific monitoring and non-invasive sampling methods) can be extended to many wildlife species. Moreover, by automating the process of species identification, significant cost savings and improved operational efficiency could be achieved for several wildlife management programs. The development of dedicated algorithms for robust detection and classification will be extremely useful for a myriad of agricultural and non-agricultural applications.

        "abstract": "Approximately 47.8 million episodes of foodborne illnesses (to one in six Americans), occur each year and result in roughly 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths in the U.S. Approximately half of the reported foodborne illnesses occur in children, with the majority occurring in children under 15 years of age. The development of reliable and effective methods to detect foodborne hazards (pathogens, microorganisms, chemicals, toxins) is therefore of paramount importance. To address the USDA&#39;s need for a field-ready device to rapidly detect foodborne hazards on site during pre- and post-harvest processing and distribution, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to continue the development of a novel rapid Foodborne Illness Detection (FOBID) system based on POC&#39;s established sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and lab-on-a-chip technologies. The use of microfluidic chips to perform ELISA allows reagent volumes of &lt;1 mL and assay times of &lt;60 min, leading to a significant reduction of reagent-associated costs and technician-hours typically required for the time-consuming laboratory-based testing. Importantly, the early knowledge about a food&#39;s condition can stop the tainted food from reaching the public, thus ensuring more efficient processing and a healthier food supply. The new FOBID system design allows for quantitative identification, agnostic sample preparation, process automation with little training, multiplex assay capability, and high portability. In Phase I, POC demonstrated FOBID feasibility by assembling a benchtop prototype and detecting and identifying two selected pathogens. Phase II will be devoted to developing a commercially viable FOBID system, demonstrating the assembled portable prototype for rapid and easy-to-use foodborne pathogen detection. We will extend the capabilities demonstrated in Phase I by enhancing accuracy, sensitivity, and the preconcentration process; reducing costs; improving configurability for customizable assays; and automating the system. We will also focus on thorough evaluation of FOBID&#39;s ability to detect and identify multiple foodborne pathogens spiked into various types of food matrices to mimic realistic situations. Its ease of use and applicability to practical situations will be evaluated with input from end users in the food value chain, such as producers, processors, and distributors.The overall goal of the proposed effort is to develop and demonstrate the capability of the FOBID system to rapidly identify targeted microbial pathogens/toxins in a format that is compatible with on-site detection in pre- and postharvest processing and distribution environments. The following specific objectives have been established to reach this goal: (1) Refinement of the FOBID system; (2) Optimization of the FOBID assays; (3) Assembly of the FOBID prototype; (4) Demonstration of FOBID performance in efficient pathogen identification; and (5) Definition of the commercial market for FOBID technology.With the fully developed FOBID, we anticipate that the nation will have a cost-effective and efficient platform for rapid on-site identification of microbial pathogens and biological toxins in food, water, or environmental samples. While such capability is essential to those involved in the food value chain, including producers, aggregators/processors, distributors, food service and retailers, and service providers of food testing, it can also be implemented by the local, state, and federal agencies, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for easy monitoring and control of food illness outbreaks.",

        "abstract": "The problem: Currently in the US, there is not an affordable way to fulfill the need of high quality grafted vegetable transplants for field growers and hydroponic greenhouse growers. The key issues that intensify the problem are: 1) the large number of seedlings needed in a single batch (US large farming operations), 2) the current high price of grafted plants and 3) the proximity of seedling suppliers realtive to vegetable growers.The solution: Grafted Growers LLC proposes to improve crop production methods and strategies, and promote energy conservation and efficiency by developing a sustainable indoor crop growing system (SIGS). The SIGS will be designed to produce large numbers of affordable, higher quality grafted vegetable transplants, with fewer resources (water, fertilizer, pesticides), and with a smaller land footprint than the current greenhouse and field production systems.In order to meet the demand of grafted plants in the US, Grafted Growers will use a combination of technologies to improve production output and efficiencies. For example, Grafted Growers in collaboration with the Systems Engineering Department at the University of Arizona, will use software packages to improve production logistics in order to increase yield and efficiencies. In collaboration with the Controlled Environment Center at the University of Arizona, Grafted Growers, will use computational models to improve the growing environment of the indoor propagation system. Also, in collaboration with the Department of Horticulture at North Carolina State University, Grafted Growers will develop technology to improve plant quality during key production steps (plant healing). Furthermore, Grafted Growers is committed to increase production sustainability of indoor growing systems and in order to assess the impact of the emerging technology (HO-SIGS), Grafted Growers will use Life-Cycle-Assessments of the plant production cycle in order to identify any avenues of improvement.",

        "abstract": "Similar to Army ground vehicle applications, there is a strong interest in being able to conduct vulnerability assessment for buildings and other infrastructure due to explosive threats.  Buildings and facilities can be subjected to blast pressure loads and fragments from a threat positioned either outside the building or in its interior.  The new developments will provide a simulation capability for computing the loads and the damage induced on buildings due to pressure waves and high velocity projectiles created by the detonation of an explosive.  The areas which are shielded from the projectiles will also be identified as \"safe\" zones.  BEST was originally developed and utilized for simulating the response of ground vehicles and its occupants to the loads from a buried explosive.  It has been validated through comparison to test data and it has been used for increasing vehicle survivability.  The new developments will enable utilizing BEST in building force protection applications.  The new tool will be used for designing new buildings or retrofitting existing ones for increased blast worthiness.  It will also be used for developing blast mitigation strategies that reduce the damage and increase the \"safe\" zones.",

        "abstract": "Vitrification, cryopreserved storage in a glassy rather than crystalline phase, is an important enabling approach for tissue banking and regenerative medicine, offering the ability to store and transport cells, tissues and organs for a variety of biomedical uses without the risks of damaging ice formation. Unfortunately, practical application of vitrification has been limited to reproductive cells and thin tissues due to diffusive (heat and mass transfer) and phase change limitations that preclude use in bulk systems such as organs and larger tissues. In our Phase I SBIR we proposed use of radiofrequency excited magnetic nanoparticles, nanowarming, to aid in rewarming of tissues to circumvent this problem. We successfully demonstrated that nanowarming of vitrified heart valve segments is a feasible alternative to convection warming. Alternative formulations and protocols reducing risks of cryoprotectant-induced cytotoxicity were also developed. In Phase II we propose translation of this technology to vascularized composite allotransplants in a step wise manner using animal tissue models in vitro, followed by transplant studies and concluding with evaluation of nanowarming for ice-free vitrified human allotransplants. The ultimate impact of these studies will be development of optimized rewarming of vitrified human vascularized composite tissues with reduced risk of cryoprotectant-induced cytotoxicity.",

Notable technical achievements include demonstration of an improved cylindrical cell Li/CFx-MnO2 chemistry with significant increase in power density and requisite low temperature performance that approaches the challenging LMAMS power and volume requirements.  To overcome these remaining hurdles, AETC identified a novel true prismatic cell and accompanying battery design that can meet LMAMS physical and environmental parameters according to analysis.. The remaining technical objective is implementing a form-factored cell-level design that reduces Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) and improves battery performance, while retaining high energy and low temperature capability. The final product deliverable will represent a maintenance-free, safe, flight worthy, environmentally benign design.  Application of new generation conductivity enhancement additives, along with the precise engineering of porosity in electrodes, and with other optimizations, is expected to boost systems projected power density to values comparable to those of lithium-ion and thermal reserve batteries.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: A challenge which continues to present a barrier to the utilization of AM and wide spread adoption is knowing when to use the technology. This is particularly problematic in aerospace and in MRO operations because the technology is still emerging, and knowledgeable, experienced practitioners remain in short supply and will likely remain so until the next generation of technicians and engineers are in the workforce. There is a large disparity between those that are truly knowledgeable (practitioners) and those who are familiar with the technology. The more parts/tooling that are built or attempted increases the knowledge base and ultimately will help push the adoption of AM technology. While caution should not be abandoned in exchange for speed, technology can come to the aid of the practitioners. The opportunity and proposed innovation, and subject matter of this proposal, is to determine the feasibility of leveraging advanced shape extraction algorithms, ontology model application, and an extensible knowledgebase to interrogate the depots part geometry and ascertain which weapon system components, or perhaps even more appropriate, what supporting production tooling are candidates for AM.; BENEFIT: The proposed solution will ultimately result in reduced maintenance and acquisition costs, decreased maintenance lifecycles, and reduction of acquisition cost for the maintenance of various systems. This effort will present a conceptual architecture and design to establish a benchmark and guidelines for the depot sustainment engineers to identify whether AM is a viable and economical alternative to conventional manufacturing methods for legacy weapon tooling and components. Demonstrable prototype of AMAS that will be used to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed AMAS operational system. Success will promote the use of AM in the DoD depots.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nHuman prion diseases are infectious and invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases  including sporadic\nCreutzfeldt Jakob disease  sCJD   the most common form  and variant CJD  vCJD  which is associated to\nconsumption of cattle meat infected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy  Currently there is not sensitive \nobjective and non invasive biochemical diagnosis for these diseases  and even less a procedure to detect\npeople incubating the disease in the pre symptomatic period  This is a major problem for public health  because\nprion diseases are known to transmit iatrogenically between human to human and because due to the long pre \nsymptomatic stage of the disease which may span five decades the asymptomatic carriers far outnumber the\nclinically affected individuals  To make the situation even more complicated  the infectious agent responsible for\nthese diseases  termed prion  is composed exclusively of a conformationally altered form of a naturally occurring\nprotein  named PrPSc  which has the unique ability to infect individuals and propagate in the body without the\nneed for genetic material  PrPSc is not only the infectious agent and the likely culprit of neurodegeneration  but\nalso the best surrogate marker for the disease  The challenge is that its quantity is high only in the brain at late\nstages of the disease  However  compelling evidences indicate that PrPSc is present in minute amounts in\nvarious peripheral tissues and biological fluids  including blood \nThis proposal is a continuation of a previously funded phase I II fast track STTR project  R  NS        whose\nmajor goal was to develop a blood  and cerebrospinal fluid  CSF  based detection assay for PrPSc associated\nwith sCJD and vCJD  Our strategy utilizes the protein misfolding cyclic amplification  PMCA  technique  a\npioneering proprietary technology developed in Dr Sotoandapos s lab  PMCA enables highly efficient prion replication in\nthe test tube by amplification of this process in vitro  and offers a great opportunity to detect very small quantities\nof prions  During the previous funding cycle we were highly successful to reach the main aims and milestones \nincluding the substantial optimization and improvement of the technology for human samples and the detection\nof PrPSc in samples of blood and urine of patients affected by vCJD with sensitivity and specificity approaching\n      Another goal of the phase II was to obtain approval for using PMCA for disease diagnosis  Currently  a\nvariation of the PMCA assay is successfully under use by the USA CJD Surveillance Center based on\nCleveland  OH to help the diagnosis of CJD and Amprion is receiving royalty payments for this application \nHowever  given the small number of cases  the diagnosis market is not profitable at this time  Amprion regards\nthe screening of the blood supply as the most relevant market for commercialization of the Companyandapos s\ntechnology  Based on the success achieved during the phase I and II of this project we engaged in extensive\ndiscussions with the UK National Institute for Biological Standards and Control  NIBSC   the governmental\norganism trusted with the responsibility to validate and approve prion detection techniques in the UK and the\nFood and Drug Administration  FDA  to define the regulatory pathway to get approval for detection of prions in\nhuman blood  As a result of these discussions we have agreed to a validation pathway defined by these\nagencies to obtain regulatory approval for the commercialization of a PMCA based assay for detection of prions\nin human blood samples and started the phase I of this process \nThe main goal of this Commercialization Readiness Pilot  CRP  project is to complete the regulatory and market\napproval of our test for detecting prions in blood of people infected by the vCJD agent and to increase the\nthroughput of the assay to handle the number of samples expected during commercialization  The validation\npathway includes   steps  namely   i  testing a panel of blood samples spiked with vCJD brain or spleen\nextracts   ii  a large screening of negative samples to assess specificity   iii  a panel of samples from non human\nprimates infected with the vCJD agent and  iv  a group of samples from patients with confirmed vCJD  These\nsamples will be provided blindly by the NIBSC or the FDA \nThe results generated in this project would lead to the development of a validated biochemical test to detect\nvCJD prions in human blood and the demonstration that this can be achieved before the clinical onset of the\ndisease in asymptomatic carriers through the longitudinal studies in non human primates experimentally infected\nwith the vCJD agent  Availability of a validated methodology to screen blood for infectious prions will increase\nthe safety of blood transfusions and potentially also products derived from human plasma  Finally  such a\nscreening test could be utilized for a study of the size of the asymptomatic population of carriers  i e  the number\nof people infected with the vCJD agent who have not yet developed the clinical disease   For commercialization\nof the validated test  Amprion will establish validated reference laboratories in different geographic locations  e g \nNorth America  Europe  Asia  that can handle the centralized testing of the samples with the accuracy  efficiency\nand safety needed for this type of assays NARRATIVE\nDevelopment of a biochemical assay for the sensitive  specific  early and non invasive detection\nof prions in blood of patients affected by variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease  vCJD  is a top\nmedical priority to increase the safety of the blood supply  vCJD has already been transmitted\nfrom human to human by blood transfusion and the number of asymptomatic carriers of vCJD in\nthe UK alone is estimated to be        people  This project utilizes the revolutionary protein\nmisfolding cyclic amplification  PMCA  technique to detect prions with extremely high sensitivity \nIn the previous phaseI II STTR project  we demonstrated that the technology permits detection\nof prions in blood and urine of vCJD patients with sensitivity and specificity close to       The\nmain goal of the Commercialization Readiness Pilot project is to complete the regulatory\napproval of our test for detecting prions in blood of people infected by the vCJD agent and to\nincrease the throughput of the assay to handle the number of samples expected during\ncommercialization  In this project we have put together the relevant technical  business and\nregulatory expertise  secured the availability of key samples and worked with regulatory\nauthorities in the UK and US to define the validation pathway to reach the approval of the test",

        "abstract": "Fertility in artificially inseminated dairy cattle has declined as milk production has increased, and is one of the most costly challenges faced by today&#39;s dairy farmer. This fertility decline causes economic losses of &gt;$300 million annually, losses due in part to damage incurred by sperm during the handling, cooling, freezing and thawing necessary for artificial insemination. For it is the quality of the gamete that is the most important factor in defining fertility (Aitken et al. 2012) and freezing damages the DNA, acrosome and membranes of sperm cells reducing sperm quality and therefore fertility. Membrane Protective Technologies Inc&#39;s GameteGuard&trade; technology provides protection to sperm cells during cooling, freezing and thawing. In fact, GameteGuard&trade; reduces DNA, membrane and acrosome damage by an average of 15-30% in frozen thawed/bovine sperm. More importantly, Phase I breeding trial of 423 lactating cows using two bulls resulted in a 25% improvement in pregnancy rate (P&lt;0.05).The improvements imparted by GameteGuard&trade; will have a very real economic impact at two levels of the artificial insemination industry: first, genetics centers (i.e. bull studs or locations where sperm doses are processed) and second, dairy farms. At bull studs ~10% of all processed sperm doses are discarded due to poor motility, DNA, membrane and/or acrosome quality resulting in an estimated annual loss of $3 mm in potential profit per large bull stud per year. At the dairy farm, a 5 percentage point increase in pregnancy rate will add $100 gain per dairy cow per insemination (Overton 2005).A larger breeding trial, the subject of this proposal, is required to statistically confirm an improvement in pregnancy per AI using GameteGuard&trade; treated sperm. It is anticipated the addition of GameteGuard to sperm prior to cooling, freezing and thawing will result in commercially relevant increase in pregnancy rates over conventionally frozen sperm due to improved post-thaw sperm health. This breeding trial will lay the groundwork for commercialization in Phase III. The second part of this project is development of a commercial scale quality control program enabling the company to successfully transition to commercial production.The use of GameteGuard&trade; at the bull stud will provide a cost effective option to start improving fertility. The integration of this technology at the stud is estimated to cost $0.5-1.00/dose (straw), a cost easily covered by slight increase in straw price which dairy farmers have indicated would be accepted. Interviews revealed they are willing to pay an extra $2-5/straw for increased pregnancy. The respective benefits imparted by the use of GameteGuard&trade; will impart a competitive advantage to the U.S. Cattle industry (dairy and beef). Moreover, improving fertility will help enable food production for a burgeoning world population and meets USDA&#39;s REE-Action plan objective 1.Membrane Protective Technologies Inc. is poised to commercialize this technology in Phase III of this SBIR proposal. The Phase I results demonstrating efficacy of GameteGuard&trade; on bovine sperm, while a sound business on its own, is serving as a model platform upon which applications are being built for other agriculturally important applications including sex-sorted sperm, equine or porcine artificial insemination.This technology is part of an ongoing effort by the USDA&#39;s Research, Education, and Economics Action Plan to sustainably intensify agricultural production. By improving fertility using organic extracts such as GameteGuard&trade;, dairy farmers will be able to improve their production economics.",

        "abstract": "Avian coccidiosis threatens poultry production worldwide. At this time, there are multiple means of preventing coccidiosis, each of which are not sufficient to completely control the disease without complications. Flock management entails a costly process of moving birds from place to place, rigorously cleaning pens, etc., in an effort to remove virulent forms of shedding. However, this means is expensive and unavailable to many producers based on their locations. A second form of prevention is the use of live viral vaccines. However, these vaccines produce sub-disease like symptoms in the poultry, reducing feed conversion and thus processing weight. A third preventive means is the use of prophylactic antibiotics, which may result in antimicrobial resistant strains of virulence. This research program evaluates two novel vaccine candidates that protect the poultry from coccidiosis while using a non-viral approach that does not infect the birds. A second major consideration is that these vaccine candidates will be delivered orally to the poultry, making application of the vaccines less costly and time consuming. A positive result will allow the implementation of a new way to prevent coccidiosis in poultry while reducing the use of viral vaccines or antibiotics.",

        "abstract": "30% of U.S. farm operators are women. Female-operated farms tend to be smaller and less mechanized and often include livestock. Because of certain physical characteristics, women are at significant risk for musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs)such as chronic back pain. MSDs are widespread in farming, with significant adverse impacts on quality of life and economic sustainability. For women, farming is the number-1 occupation associated with MSDs. Heavy lifting is a major risk factor for MSDs, and it is a ubiquitous part of farming. Our survey of women livestock farmers in 32 states, representing a cross-section of ages, experience, farm size and livestock type, found high rates of MSDs, some explicitly linked to lifting and carrying of heavy objects such as feed bags, hay bales and water pails. In fact, problems related to heavy lifting and carrying heavy objects were the one common challenge affecting virtually all the women livestock farmers we surveyed or interviewed, regardless of livestock type(s). To address this problem, which women farmers cited as a priority in surveys, focus groups &amp; interviews, we are proposing to design two new pieces of equipment:a wheelbarrow, cart or other vehicleto allow for the safe &amp; efficientmovement of material andwhich addresses deficits in currently available equipment; anda product or system to reduce the MSD-related risk factors associated with heavy lifting.  We expect the project to result in equipment that is easier, safer &amp; more effective to use for women farmers; a reduction in farm injuries, which contribute to U.S. health care costs, reduce the viability of farming for women and can have adverse impacts on availability of safe, nutritious, local food; a lowered risk for MSDs, a leading disability cause; and enhanced quality of life for women livestock farmers. The new products are also expected to be useful to male farmers, especially those who are older, and potentially to gardeners as well.",

        "abstract": "This Phase II Small Business Innovation Research proposal responds to food safety market needs by developing a high-throughput pathogen detector that will reduce the potential for disease outbreaks and costly food recalls. The device developed in this program addresses a broad sector of food producing markets. This project will focus on detecting live Salmonella organisms in industry-relevant large sample volumes faster, and with significantly higher sensitivity than state-of-the-art methods. The detection method uses DNA and RNA aptamers as biochemical \"hooks\" between Salmonella and magnetic nanoparticles. The magnetic nanoparticles are then detected by a novel tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) lab-on-a-chip sensor. The key innovation is a unique microfluidics architecture that localizes Salmonella and bound magnetic nanoparticles to the location on the TMR sensor with the highest sensitivity while dramatically increasing throughput. NVE Corporation has assembled a team of experts from academia and industry for microfluidics design and fabrication, aptamer and magnetic nanoparticle creation, and magnetic TMR sensor production, yielding a highly specific and integrated detection solution. A feasibility prototype was successfully tested in the Phase I program. The goal of the Phase II is the construction of a high-throughput bench-top system with faster, higher-sensitivity detection of Salmonella than otherwise possible.This file MUST be converted to PDF prior to attachment in the electronic application package",

        "abstract": "With global aquaculture production poised to double in the next 20 years the need for sustainable, cost effective feed inputs will be greater than ever - and soybean-based feeds can be part of the solution. Unfortunately, soy feeds use remains limited due to the presence of anti-nutritional factors including undigested oligosaccharides raffinose and stachyose, lectins that damage the intestinal lining, and phytate that binds to and prevents the uptake of proteins and essential cations. This is particularly prevalent for high-value carnivorous species such as salmon, char and trout where feed rations can only contain as little as 8% soy meal. Over Phase I of the project, we have identified and characterized at the molecular level allelic series of nonsense and missense mutations in the genes directly responsible for the synthesis of the targeted anti-nutritional factors. We have grown a collection of selected mutants carrying homozygous mutation for each allele of interest. In Phase II, we will fully phenotype the selected homozygotes and isolate the lines with best growth habits as source material for genetic crosses. Genetic crosses will be performed to combine mutated alleles to produce lines with: a single low anti-nutritional trait (low lectin, low oligosaccharides, low phytate), or to combine two, or finally three anti-nutritional traits (low lectin + low oligosaccharides + lower phytate). The effects of each mutation alone or in combination will be evaluated for agronomic performance. The transfer of the traits into elite varieties would start as soon as the phenotype for each trait has been assessed. By the end of Phase II we will produce enough product for a fish feeding study.",

One 60 kg adult femalecan produce approximately $30,000 worth of caviar. In order to maximize profits for sturgeon aquaculture, it is essential thatmales are removed from the tanks as early as possible, leaving only females that must be fed and reared for 6 years or more --until maturation and egg-production/harvest.The long-term goal of this project is to develop a minimally invasive, cost-effective, reliable molecular diagnostic to detect thesex of sturgeon at the earliest age possible (&lt; 12 months of age). Our working hypothesis is as follows: male and femalesturgeon, during development and sexual maturation, will display differences in gene expression in various tissues. We will useseveral powerful molecular tools in order to identify differentially regulated genes in easily-obtained tissue samples. Onceidentified, these differentially regulated genes (biomarkers) will serve as an effective screening tool to distinguish male andfemale sturgeon at an early age.

The goal of the project is to enable the detection and identification of spectral phenomenology-oriented critical targets in complex, highly variable backgrounds.  Relevant missions that may be addressed with the proposed sensor system include the detection of chemical and explosives threat materials; counter-IED and route-clearing missions; tagging, tracking and locating (TTL) applications; identify friend versus foe (IFF) detection; and other defense critical sensing missions.  In particular, the Phase II effort will focus on development and demonstration of a reconfigurable HSI system with the following characteristics: (1) rapidly field-configurable operation; (2) real-time, on-the-move operation; (3) near real-time, automated target signature detection; (4) significantly reduced size, weight and power, and cost (SWaP-C) resource requirement compared to existing HSI systems; and (5) imaging operation with minimal support infrastructure.",

First is to deliver a portable Splash Impact Measurement System (SIMS) with capablility of mapping the debris field surrounding an engagement event in broad ocean areas.  This mapping will provide the precise location and time of all objects impacting the sea surface.  The second objective is to have the system record the full acoustic signatures of the impacts for post-test analysis.  This analysis will provide additional parameters of the debris field impacts such as kinetic energy, mass, velocity, size and material composition.  This second objective of the program is highly innovative and research oriented and leverages and extends the work conducted in the initial Phase II.

Sea Power 21 represents a vision and roadmap for a transformational process which seeks to optimize Naval force employment through integration into joint global operations and align R&D toward specific current and projected warfighter needs. Sea Strike is one of the concepts behind the Sea Power 21 vision. Sea Strike is the ability to project precise and persistent offensive power from the sea and builds upon the asymmetric strengths unique to US Naval forces. Technology now allows Naval forces to decisively engage targets deep inside enemy territory while operating from a remote, secure, mobile afloat base. Electro-magnetic rail guns are one of the key technologies targeted for Future Sea Strike Capability and will contribute in a very measureable way to the ability of the US Navy to execute long range, precise, sustained, time-sensitive, and covert strike missions. Hypersonic guided flight for precision munitions delivery and the related launch survivability for guidance electronics are ONR focus areas. Our proposed shock hardened IMU solution leverages our relevant experience and adapts existing technologies to produce a reliable, compact, cost effective shock hardened and isolation approach for electronic systems subjected to the specific extreme shock environment characteristic of launch from an electromagnetic rail gun.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) developers have limited marketplace options for motor speed controllers.  The largest commercial controllers are generally limited to below 12 kW and battery voltages of less than 50 V, Although these are well suited to 800 Class helicopters and Giant scale fixed-wing aircraft, they are not powerful enough for larger UAV development.  A few high-power options exist up to 25 kW, though they are substantially heavier with less modularity and selection.  To scale up to higher powers, UAV designers are often forced to utilize industrial controllers, which are not packaged for minimal weight and flight capability.    To address this need for expanded controller options, this proposal outlines a modular, open architecture motor controller system comprising a main control module, recommended I/O module, and interchangeable power stage modules.  In the Phase II effort, PCKA will continue to refine upon and expand the open software modular motor drive ecosystem developed and demonstrated in the Phase I effort through a range of modeling, simulation, analysis, hardware prototyping, and flight testing.",

        "abstract": "This effort addresses an opportunity to dramatically improve the efficacy and safely of applying pesticides and herbicides to crops, by developing a real-time, onboard sprayer control system that will predict spray drift and ground deposition as they occur, providing corrective measures to mitigate drift and improve application. Combining the accuracy of existing precision agriculture tools with the ability to directly predict, control, and log spray application and drift in real-time will dramatically impact crop production, crop protection, and worker/public safety in the United States. Verification and validation of the approach and its implementation and testing on a production sprayer will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.This research will satisfy four of the USDA strategic goals by developing of a more efficient and safer way to apply pesticides and herbicides. Strategic Goal 1 (assist rural communities to create prosperity so they are self-sustaining, repopulating, and economically thriving) will be addressed by enhancing crop yields and productivity, which will lead to improved farmer profits, exports, and availability of the finished products produced from the crops. Strategic Goal 2 (ensure our national forests and private working lands are conserved, restored, and made more resilient to climate change, while enhancing our water resources) will be addressed by enabling more efficient and safer methods for applying pesticides and herbicides to protect our forests and working lands from invasive or non-indigenous species (i.e. spruce budworm and gypsy moth). Moreover, by directly mitigating the drift of applied chemicals, drift related contamination of water resources and the environment will be reduced. Strategic Goals 3 (help America promote agricultural production and biotechnology exports as America works to increase food security), and 4 (ensure that all of America&#39;s children have access to safe, nutritious, and balanced meals) will be addressed in a similar manner to Strategic Goal 1 through enhancing yields and ultimately increasing US food exports and ensuring access to safe food.",

We chose to keep the MX-15 turret as is and append to it a low SWaP accelerated processor that performs real-time FMV enhancement. A multi-layer software application addresses illumination, weather, and environmental limitations to allow clearer imagery. It then improves noisy and blurred data, followed by increase in resolution, therefore expanding the viewing range without altering the sensors or optics of the turret. Novel enhancement, deblurring, and superresolution methods are applied. The overall multi-layer algorithm is made fully unattended via the use of cleverly designed quality metrics. An overall quality metric that correlates with the NIIRS scale is used to match the capabilities of the MX-15 to the MX-20 turret. The resulting software is embedded in a low SWaP hardware board, allowing for real-time unattended on-board range and resolution enhancement, and interpretability improvement as measured by the NIIRS.",

The E-2C/D aircraft has a high vibration environment and a seat that passes these environments on unmitigated to the crew members maximizing discomfort, especially during the long duration missions that are standard for the E-2 aircraft. Exposure to these environments are even producing physiological damage and injury to crew members. A new propeller design has been marginally successful at reducing the blade passage frequency vibrations, but the propeller rotation frequency vibrations transmitted to the occupant and seat remain unacceptable. Under a previous Phase II SBIR contract a seat with an integrated magnetorheological (MR) vibration isolation system was developed, vibration tested and proven to be effective in isolating seat occupants from the vibration environment. The objective of this proposed Phase II program is to evaluate the ability of a seat with integrated magnetorheological (MR) vibration isolation to reduce the physiological problems of discomfort and pain experienced by the pilots of these E-2 aircraft. The approach is to conduct flight tests initially using the test residue/seat from the previously completed Phase II SBIR program.",

This is largely due to the continuous technology advancements in integrated RF/microwave and signal processing components and the conveniences that wireless connectivity provide, including the removal of bulky connectors, cables and the modularity and movement restrictions they impose. There is also cost reduction benefits with wireless connectivity due to the reduction in physical connector, cable and other hardware material costs and the associated infrastructure installation and sustainment costs. However, the transition to wireless doesnt come without its own hurdles. These include available spectral bandwidth, data intercept or jamming from enemy forces, unintentional interference from other sources and the various operation environment effects on link performance. TSC's novel mmW datalink addresses these issues and allows for the removal of cables or connectors typically required between missile sensors, electronics and subassemblies or between the missile and its launching platform to create the opportunity for modular, plug-and-play missile architectures.",

AMLCDs used in consumer electronics technology exists today that far exceeds 128 PPI of the original F-35 MFD.  Displays with resolutions over 256 PPI are available in commercial formats. Long battery life forced display providers to maintain very high display efficiencies despite increased resolution by developing processing methods for high electron mobility semiconductors.  The high PPI technology combined with increasingly high efficacy LED light sources enable higher luminance without thermal overrun.  The same technology used to increase the resolution also delivers faster update rates that is exploited commercially when showing high speed video (such sporting events).  In addition, the input interface has experienced some avionics specific innovations.  Optically enhanced resistive touchscreens have been developed specifically to address the human factor demands within the cockpit. This type touchscreen requires a purposeful touch to activate, thereby eliminating accidental activation.  Resistive touchscreens is not based on light interruption, and therefore will be compatible with advanced imaging system technologies that detect light beyond the NIR band.  They will further enable touch input redundancy if necessary.",

In this program, we mature several MIMO-related enhancements that are applicable to any distributed aperture airborne data link system.

Numerous existing directional datalink systems incorporate multiple high-gain antenna arrays which provide a strong base for significant MIMO-inspired capability enhancements with the introduction of the proposed applique.

In proof of concept studies we demonstrated that Codagenix&#39;s vaccine platform was capable of yielding a highly attenuated and immunogenic FMDV vaccine candidate using a laboratory strain. Now, meeting all of our Phase I deliverables, we have successfully applied our platform to serotype-A24, yielding a field and commerically relevant FMDV candidate vaccine. In Phase II we will focus on the swine testing of our A-24 vaccine strain, as well as use our A24 backbone to construct live vaccine candidates for serotypes O and Asia-1, two prevelant serotypes. With A-24, O, and Asia-1 combined we will havea commerically viable vaccine product that covers &gt;74% of all circulating FMDV. Our technology termed Synthetic Attenuated Virus Engineering (SAVE), \"de-optimzies\" viral genomes thereby reducing viral translation efficency via hundred of stable silent mutations. This SAVE-deoptimization retains 100% identity to the wildtype protein sequence - yielding a vaccine strain that is highly attenuated and a PERFECT antigenic match to your target. By being disadvantaged for translation within host cells, SAVE-deoptimized vaccine strains are avirulent while preserving highly immunogenic properties since they are antigenically identical to the parental wild type strain. FMDV is endemic in many countries around the globe and has proven to be devastating to livestock, with small outbreaks of FMDV causing nearly $1.5 billion in economic losses. A fast-acting and effective FDMV vaccine is needed to help halt the spread of an outbreak and protect cloven-hoofed livestock such as cattle, sheep, and swine. This is best accomplished with a live attenuated vaccine, such as the one proposed here. To differentiate between between vaccinated from naturally infected animals, our deoptimized A24 vaccine strain contains proprietary DIVA markers developed by our collaborators at PIADC. Since FMDV is a Biosafety-level-3+ pathogen and a select agent, all virus work will be conducted in direct collaboration with the PIADC at their Plum Island facilities.",

        "abstract": "1. Crops that have been genetically modified to protect against insect pests, such as those expressing Bt toxins, have gained tremendous economic and societal importance. These biotechnology products improve the stability of agricultural production through highly effective crop protection while reducing the use of traditional pesticides, fuel, and water by farmers in the US and internationally. Significantly, Bt technology has improved economic outcomes for growers. However, the durability of any given Bt toxin as a protective agent is shortened by the evolution of resistance in the target pest population. Strategies for delaying the evolution of resistance, called insect resistance mangement (IRM), need to be paired intelligently with the crop type, the climate, the target pest, and local agricultural practices. Research into IRM increasingly relies on sophisticated mathematical models that allow many numerical experiments to be done in a short amount of time. The complexity of these models has brought about a number of drawbacks, including 1) inconsistent assumptions that make model comparison difficult, 2) a lack of transparency due to the sheer difficulty of reproducing these models, and 3) the limitation of IRM modeling to a relatively small number of highly skilled researchers.With this USDA-NIFA SBIR Phase II award, Applied Biomathematics intends to research and develop the computational algorithms necessary to support a program that allows users to model the evolution of resistance to Bt or similar transgenic technologies in complex, multi-crop landscapes for a wide variety of target pests. The main goal of the project is to build a simulation engine capable of tracking responses to selection for resistance at up to 12 different genes, each of which may be associated with resistance to one or more Bt toxins. This task is difficult because such genetic complexity can consume a large amount of computing power and memory. Making the performance of the program good enough to use on typical computing platforms requires careful and creative optimization. Our approach will mix algorithms that simulate individual pests in great detail when necessary with faster approaches that lump individuals into populations with similar characteristics. This approach will be faster than models that are purely individual based but should preserve biological detail better than population-level approximations typically used in models with more than one gene. As part of a program that allows users to build IRM models without special training in mathematics, population genetics, or programming and that defines IRM models through a standard set of user inputs, the improved genetics algorithm will lead to a simulation tool that is powerful, transparent, and widely accessible.",

The proposed kit will deliver exceptional ease-of-use as well as performance metrics (time, cost, labor). By delivering a complete pathogen detection solution, the kit will enable more testing locations and a higher frequency of testing. In addition, the kit is designed to be low-cost from the beginning so entire new segments of food processors may adopt the technology where currently it is not economically feasible to do so, such as rural fruit and vegetable producers that operate only seasonally. A safer food supply chain protects those who suffer the most from foodborne illness outbreaks such as the elderly and small children. Commercial applications of the technology will find a global customer base as current laboratory microbiology tests are cumbersome, expensive and time consuming. Additionally, the products will feature technology integration capability to support Laboratory Information Management Systems thus enabling food safety data to be widely disseminated and part of a modern tracking and traceability system.The technology proposed by AST will support several of the USDA strategic goals. Low-cost pathogen detection enables American agricultural success by reducing food safety risk to small co-operatives and independent rural operators.

        "abstract": "Beef tenderness is the most important trait influencing consumer satisfaction. Currently there is no method for real-time classification of beef by tenderness. Current beef marketing is based on USDA quality grades (Prime, Choice, and Select). Therefore, the beef industry needs an integrated system that can simultaneously predict beef tenderness and also USDA grades. In the Phase I study, we successfully demonstrated the feasibility of predicting beef tenderness and USDA grades with a multispectral imaging system. However, in order to commercialize our technology, we need to (1) develop, refine, and integrate functionality for predicting USDA grades concurrent with beef tenderness, (2) evaluate accuracy and repeatability of the system with a large dataset, and (3) increase the prediction speed of the system. The overall goal of this Phase II proposal is to make the multispectral imaging system used in Phase I ready for commercial use.Meat packers are anxious to sort beef by tenderness because consumers are willing to pay a premium for steaks that are guaranteed tender. All of the major packers have expressed interest in a service to classify beef for tenderness. Economists estimate the domestic economic value of a USDA certified tender beef program to be as much as $760 million per year. Capturing a small portion of this value using the proposed technology would return annual revenue of $28 million. International potential would magnify this effect. This project is expected to enhance economic opportunities for cattle producers in rural America and processors by improving assessment of beef product quality to meet consumer expectations.",

However, there are no low-cost, robust diagnostic tests currently available for early identification of this or other citrus pathogens under field conditions. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) testing is the current regulatory decision-making standard for detection of HLB in citrus. qPCR has an evidence-based threshold value that is conservative enough to avoid excess false positives that could undermine trust. However, for decision-making by a grower, qPCR is not ideal. Early diagnosis is difficult to achieve because of highly non-uniform distribution of the bacteriumin a tree and there are seasonal and cultivar variations in bacterial llevels.There are strong motivations to find diagnostic processes that are based on changes in the plant that are induced systemically throughout the plant, making sampling less problematic. This programdirectly responds to the need to reduce the impact of plant pathogens and insect pests on citrus crops by developing a means of early detection. One approach that we are taking is analysis of the odor provide of healthy and diseased trees. We will develop an odorsampling protocol that will be low-cost and user-friendly, applicable to both grove owners as well as residential owners who have citrus on their residential property. We propose to develop a sampling technology and process that does not require highly-trained technicians and expensive equipment. This program will develop robust HLB signature libraries targeting accuracies of 0.9 or better on a tool that will have high throughput and be automated for low-cost operation (about 1/3 the cost of current qPCR testing).",

        "abstract": "Currently small unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) are limited in their ability to autonomously fly in complex, cluttered, environments.  This significantly limits the utility of small tactical UAVs to the warfighter/squad who must manually control the vehicle.  Small UAVs require: a) scalable autonomous survival behaviors to avoid collision with environmental structure and moving objects; b) Low size, weight, power, and cost.  The SSCI SA3 system (Small Autonomous, Sensor Agnostic, Sense and Avoid) addresses these two challenges through bio-inspired reactive controller and visual threat-estimation algorithms.  SA3 is built around a Steering Field which fuses obstacle representations from sensors of multiple modalities and combines them with the current navigation waypoint to generate reactive steering commands, avoiding obstacles while navigating.  In the current program we will demonstrate SA3 with visual Expansion Rate technologies for the detection of self-moving objects (other aircraft, vehicles, people, etc) and environmental structure (walls, the ground, etc).   In Phase I we designed the SA3 system architecture, performed a limited data collect, and demonstrated how key system components enable unassisted airborne navigation.  In Phase II, SSCI will work with one of our existing UAV partners to demonstrate the SA3 system in flight on a small UAV.",

        "abstract": "Project SummaryWe propose to continue the research and development of a four-wheeled autonomous agricultural robot that, while light-weight and affordable, can assist in harvesting by transporting produce from a human picker in the field to a collection station at the edge of the field thus increasing picker productivity by 50%.Our primary focus for this effort will be on the harvesting of strawberries. In California alone, more than 2 billion pounds of strawberries are harvested each year with a value of over $2 billion. The commodity nature of this crop applies pressure on the farmers to keep prices low, yet at the same time labor shortages are growing because picker jobs are unattractive to most Americans. Each picker harvests about $65,000 worth of strawberries per year, so increasing each picker&#39;s productivity by 50% allows them to pick an additional $32,000 worth of strawberries per year. Therefore farmers are highly motivated to adopt technology to boost picker efficiency.In the field, pickers do a very complex picking, sorting, and packing task that will take years to automate. However, in the traditional manual harvest scenario, pickers spend about 1/3 of their time transporting a full box of berries along their furrow to the nearest roadway and from there to a nearby station for inspection, payment registration, and stacking on pallets. Offloading this 1/3 non-picking transport time increases the picker&#39;s picking time by 50%.We have been working with a nearby strawberry farm, Terry Farms, to define an autonomous robot that can relieve the picker from the transport task to allow them to focus full time on the picking, sorting, and packing task which is their highest value add. The robot must be safe, affordable, and require a minimum of focus from the picker. The robot must be rugged, low power, lightweight, be capable of carrying a 10 pound box of strawberries and be able to operate for hours without recharging. Prior to and during the Phase I effort, we have designed and constructed the hardware and firmware for a prototype that meets these specifications. During Phase I, we began developing the guidance and control software.The complexity of robot autonomy includes image processing, scene understanding, predictive modeling, and path planning. Robot autonomy in a complex and unstructured environment is beyond the scope of an SBIR effort. However, strawberry fields and their surrounding roads are very regular, so the software task is tractable. By the end of Phase I we demonstrated furrow tracking, collision avoidance, picker following, and picker leading capabilities. We propose here to continue the advancement of the control software. By the end of Phase II we will demonstrate autonomous operation including hand-off in the field, obstacle accommodation, collection station identification, hand-off at the collection station, return-to-my-picker, and pack-up-and-go-home behaviors. Phase II will include field trials with multiple robots, each interacting with its own picker team and with the common inspection station.This effort utilizes the expertise at Tanner Research in mechanical design, power electronics, firmware, and software development including image processing, tracking, and advanced algorithms with large data and throughput requirements. For this work, we will augment our internal team with specific robot expertise from our collaborators at Caltech, Prof. Joel Burdick, and his graduate students.We expect to commercialize the results first with our lead customers Terry Farms and Driscoll&#39;s, and then, after rapid refinement, expand the roll-out to strawberry farmers statewide and worldwide. We expect to adapt the robot to other applications including transport of other crops, data gathering such as rapid phenotyping, picking, planting, weeding, and pest remediation.",

        "abstract": "As Oregon farmer and Organically Grown Company (OGC) executive director Andy Westlund confesses, being one of the 800,000 small commercial farmers in America is challenging (Hoppe, MacDonald, &amp; Korb 2010). Small farms are highly exposed to market risks, tend to focus on commodities, and have profit margins of just 3-4% (Hoppe, MacDonald, &amp; Korb 2010). As such, small price changes of a single crop can have a substantial impact on a farm&#39;s financial status (Page 2011). Variable input costs, such as energy, can play havoc with financing annual operating loans (Page 2011). Therefore, reasonable methods of reducing the uncertainty of operating costs and diversifying the income of small farms are desirable--not just for the farmers themselves, but also for maintaining this sector of our agricultural industry.In our market research, we conducted sit down interviews with more than 45 small farmers such as Andy Westlund. Not surprisingly, their desire to reduce operating costs is the primary factor that motivates farmers to produce their own electricity, usually through solar or wind. Andy uses recycled solar panels and primitive wind turbines to reduce his energy bills. For small farmers, the use of alternative energy simultaneously lowers the operating cost of the farm by reducing the usage of grid electricity and reduces exposure to risk from fluctuating energy prices (Sands &amp; Westcott 2011; USDA 2011). Finally, farmers recognize that generating renewable energy and using fewer fossil fuels reduces dependence on foreign oil, providing greater local and national energy security while reducing the risk of climate change (Sustainable Agriculture Research &amp; Education 2008).However, there are distinct challenges that have kept many small farms from implementing solar and wind energy. The top three barriers that Oregon farmers identified are (based on our own and external research): 1) up-front project costs, 2) permitting, and 3) troublesome paperwork for the incentive programs (Page 2011). Andy Westlund, for example, had to secure county permits for his twenty-foot wind tower, which is sited just a few steps from his thirty-foot-tall house. Additionally, he admits that the electricity produced will never cover the up-front cost of the system.In addition to the general renewable energy challenges Andy has encountered, traditional wind turbines have difficulties specific to farmers that have limited their adoption. The construction of the wind tower can disrupt farming activities and cause soil compaction issues (Linowes 2013). The tower and its blades can also pose an operating and safety problem for agriculture aerial work and can significantly hamper access to cropland, in turn detrimentally affecting agricultural production (National Agricultural Aviation Association 2014). Finally, while the permit and incentive program paperwork problems are important, the up-front costs of a large wind turbine can remove any chance of adoption by small farmers. For example, wind farms often use the Vestas V82-1.65 turbine (a 1.6 MW unit), which has an installed cost of approximately $3.3 million ($2,000 per kW capacity) (NREL 2014). This is well outside the financial range of any small farm. Although wind turbines are available in smaller sizes and prices, their efficiency drops quickly with the shorter tower while maintaining a similar level of product complexity. As a result, the system install cost doubles to $4,000 per kW capacity. Additionally, they actually produce only 10-15% of their stated generating capacity, about half the efficiency of utility scale systems (NREL 2014). Thus, a wind tower system that may be affordable to the average small farmer (e.g., tens of thousands of dollars) does not produce enough electricity to make it financially sensible.eWind Solutions sees these obstacles as both a problem and an opportunity. Our intention is to remove these barriers and create affordable wind energy generation systems",

        "abstract": "Spotted wing drosophila (SWD), Drosophila suzukii, is an aggressive, prolific, and polyphagous pest species of many crops, because they lay their eggs in healthy, unripened soft-skinned fruit,rendering them unmarketable. In August 2008, the first detection of SWD in the US caused great concern, as the fly was found infesting a variety of commercial fruits on the coast of California. The following year, SWD was detected in Oregon, Washington, Florida, and British Columbia; and in 2010, the pest appeared in Utah, North Carolina, South Carolina, Michigan, and Louisiana. Additional detections of SWD occurred in Virginia, Montana, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Maryland and most states in the Northeast and Mexico in 2011. In Europe, SWD was first detected in 2009 in Italy and Spain, and in France the following year. In 2012, SWD was also found in South America, in Brazil. Growers in SWD-affected areas have not only suffered significant losses in susceptible crops, but also increased costs of labor and materials to deal with this invasive pest, including higher inputs of chemical insecticides, and the use of monitoring and management tools to keep SWD populations under control.Damage caused by SWD has forced growers to stop or interrupt harvests, downgrade fruit, and apply additional pesticide treatments. Just in California, Oregon and Washington, where the total farmgate value of affected fruit is $2.6B, the total revenue losses due to SWD were over $511M. Routine cover sprays of broad-spectrum insecticides area now applied 5-7 times per season just to control SWD, increasing the likelihood that the crop will have excess residual pesticide levels.Because of those risks, the sustainable management and control market for SWD in North America and Europe is projected to exceed $250 million per year by 2017.US berry and tree fruit growers urgently need effective management strategies to deal with this emerging pest. Spotted wing drosophila has been a frequent topic in newsletters and trade publications, and is listed as a top research priority by national and regional grower associations like the North American Strawberry Growers Association, the North American Raspberry and Blackberry Growers Association, Michigan blueberry and cherry growers, and berry growers in New York and New Jersey. This proposal seeks to address the needs of these growers by developing a sustainable management tool for SWD: specifically, we will further develop and optimize an attract-and-kill strategy consisting of micro-bait stations that overcome the limitations of conventional insecticides. These bait stations exude semiochemicals that preferentially attract SWD, and phagostimulants that incite attracted insects to feed on the bait and ingest a lethal dose of insecticide. Using ISCA&#39;s proven semiochemical delivery system, SPLAT&reg; (Specialized Pheromone &amp; Lure Application Technology), the resulting product, SPLAT SWD, provides the necessary longevity and effectiveness needed by growers to maintain a profitable operation. SPLAT SWD will directly benefit growers by enhancing on-farm environmental and economic sustainability, and will extend these benefits to the consumer market by minimizing the risks associated with pesticide residues on produce, and by helping to maintain the affordability of locally grown, healthful foods.The results of our Phase I studies have been highly encouraging. We have successfully identified a number of components and blends that are strong attractants, affording high degree of efficacy as SWD baits in the laboratory. We developed and field-tested a number of prototype A&amp;K bait sprays, some of which proved to suppress populations of the pest, as well as the amount of damage these insects inflict on berry crops, in commercial crops. In Phase II, we will build on these successes to refine and optimize both the attractant/phagostimulant AI blend and the physical formulation of SPLAT SWD, to ensure that",

        "abstract": "ISCA Technologies proposes to further develop and optimize SPLAT&reg; TK, an attract and kill(A&amp;K) formulation designed to target all active stages of the deer tick, Ixodes scapularis Say, aspecies of major medical and veterinary significance in the U.S., due to its capacity to transmit Lyme disease and several other zoonotic pathogens. ISCA&#39;s sprayable, long-lasting SPLAT TK formulation will attract and arrest ticks in vegetation on the borders of high traffic or high risk areas, such as the edges of pastures, backyards, or hiking trails, thereby preventing them from locating and attaching to human or animal hosts. SPLAT TK consists of a blend of highly potent semiochemical components of the I. scapularis arrestment pheromone incorporated into SPLAT&reg;, a patented, EPA-registered controlled-release matrix. This product can be tank-mixed by the end user with an appropriate reduced-risk acaricide to form an effective, environmentally friendly A&amp;K formulation. Attraction to SPLAT TK blended with this tank-mixed acaricide component will result in the death or significant debilitation of all questing (host-seeking) ticks within the range of detection of the active semiochemicals. Our research suggests that very low quantities of acaricide are required to achieve desired levels of season-long tick control, as the selected pheromone components have been shown to induce ticks to cluster at the site of the attractants. The reduced toxicity of SPLAT TK is enabled by the synergy of a species-specific lure that attracts the target tick to a point source with a high dose of a reduced-risk acaricide. Unlike conventional acaricides, which must be applied as uniform cover sprays to be effective, SPLAT TK is designed to be dispersed as tiny, discrete point sources. These features facilitate this product&#39;s application across rural environments, even in areas of high human activity and in sensitive natural environments. SPLAT TK shows great commercial potential due to the increasing incidence of tick-borne disease in animals and humans, as well as the lack of effective control options for I. scapularis. By reducing the dangers posed by I. scapularis and the diseases transmitted by this species, we hope to safeguard the health of human and animal residents of our nation&#39;s rural communities and expand opportunities for economic growth within thesecommunities by bolstering such industries as rural tourism, camping, hiking, fishing, and agri-tourism, all of which are currently hampered by the lack of viable control options for disease-carrying ticks. In Phase II, this innovative, effective, and environmentally sustainable approach to tick control will be developed for application in livestock production, public health, parks andrecreation, and forestry pest management programs. The annual market potential for this product in U.S. rural communities is around $115M, with an additional potential sales value of ~$400Mto consumers in affected suburban markets. Phase I studies produced excellent results,demonstrating viability of the proposed solution. From several prototype SPLAT TK formulations of attractant/arrestant tick semiochemicals, two underwent small-scale field trials in New York that not only strongly suppressed nymphal I. scapularis populations, but alsocontrolled larval tick populations. Dead larvae, nymphs, and adults were found at or near SPLAT TK A&amp;K deposits on the foliage in the field, indicating that attracted I. scapularis manipulatedthe formulation until intoxicated. In Phase II, we will continue to optimize the prototype SPLAT TK formulation, the blend of arrestant semiochemicals, and select the best candidate reduced risk acaricides, to create a highly effective A&amp;K formulation for season-long control of I. scapularispopulations in the field. We will also conduct evaluations of various manual and mechanical methods of application for SPLAT TK, to identify the most effective means of deployment for t",

Conventional confocal microscope systems utilize refractive achromatic and apochromatic compound microscope objective lenses.  These objective lenses can yield two or three-color imaging that is free from spectral dispersion/chromatic aberrations, but cannot provide true broadband capability, nor do they generally allow confocal microscope systems to deliver good performance in the ultraviolet region due to limited available glass types in the UV. Microscopes using commercially available all-reflective objectives can achieve aberration-free imaging at low numerical apertures (NA), but cannot produce sub-micron spot sizes at the higher numerical apertures required for high resolution confocal microscope applications. The light collection efficiency of these objectives is also significantly limited, due to their low numerical aperture, preventing their use in weak fluorescence or low light level scattering applications. There is a market need for advanced broadband, high numerical aperture confocal microscope capable of achieving sub-micron resolution.",

        "abstract": "The TB-16 Fat Line Array is one of the most mission-critical acoustic detection instruments used aboard submarines and is connected to the boat by means of a Lightweight Tow Cable (LWTC).  The current design of the LWTC has demonstrated a propensity to buckle during deployment of the towed array by the OK-276 handling system.  The failure is attributed to a lack of axial compressive strength of the cable; a performance attribute that was understated during its development.  METSS proposes to address this challenge by improving the mechanical properties of the polymeric material used in the outer cable jacket of the LWTC.  The basic premise is that if the stiffness (flexural strength/elastic modulus) of the outer polymer jacket material is sufficiently increased, then the resistance to buckling of the LWTC could be improved.  METSS has demonstrated with both computer simulations and experimental methods that an improved axial compressive strength is feasible with these formulation efforts of the cable jacket resin.  The proposed approach would preserve the investment the Navy made in the development of the LWTC, as well as the current manufacturing and procurement base, as METSS would simply seek to become an alternative materials supplier to the existing LWTC manufacturer.",

        "abstract": "The Air Force Research Laboratorys Directed Energy Directorate is actively developing the next generation of high-power pulse discharge microwave and laser weapons for airborne applications. These weapons could essentially have limitless ammunition if prime power sources that are low mass, and can provide the electrical power needed, and be recharged once the weapon has been discharged are developed. Current prime power sources require a long startup time, consume fuel during stand-by flight scenarios, and are not well suited for an on-demand direct current pulse power system. Additionally, when turbo generators are used to supply power to a directed energy weapon, the aircraft loses a substantial amount of thrust, which is very undesirable during a mission. Lynntech has developed a hybrid fuel cell power system that is comprised of a high energy density proton exchange membrane fuel cell and a high power delivery Li-ion battery.  The battery provides the high power pulse while the fuel cell serves to recharge the battery bank through constant power operation. At the core of this system is Lynntechs enabling high specific power fuel cell technology, which allows us to develop a scaleable and flexible system that can be easily integrated for use in airborne platforms.",

        "abstract": "Compact, low cost, accurate hostile fire detection solutions are essential to effectively protect aircraft against small arms, RPGs, mortars, anti-aircraft artillery, and surface to air missiles. Detecting and classifying these types of threats is complicated by many factors including the need for full 360 coverage, requirement for high probability of detection with low false alarms, as well as variances in real world signatures. There is also the problem of having to process an enormous amount of data to cover the required spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution needed to produce a confident threat nomination. This effort is focused on developing an Uncooled Multi-Spectral sensor system specifically designed to be a low cost, compact, wide field of view, multi-spectral sensor for airborne hostile fire detection and discrimination. This practical approach will focus on implementing a novel optical design along with relatively cost effective uncooled infrared imaging sensor technologies to efficiently ascertain the critical spatial, spectral, and temporal information needed to detect and discriminate muzzle flash and plume signatures at a significantly high confidence level.",

If the phase II option is exercised, the aerospike would be flight tested as well. The computational analysis is already well underway, with numerous studies producing results that have never before been published. The ground testing phase will start with a full plug cluster aerospike engine test in a horizontal configuration; our phase I effort laid the groundwork for this test to be carried out later this year. The engine test will be followed in the development cycle by a fully integrated first stage test where the engine, thrust structure, and tanks will be tested together in a vertical configuration. Construction of the vertical test stand flame trench has already begun. Finally, the phase II option would permit the last evolution in engine development: a suborbital flight test of the Firefly Alpha launch vehicle. This flight test data acquisition opportunity is the first of its kind, and we would capitalize on it by flying a highly instrumented aerospike to record and publish performance in unprecedented detail.",

In general, improving modulation efficiency is highly desirable, as long as bandwidth is maintained, since higher modulation efficiency allows lower RF signal to impose equivalent change in the optical beam; better linearity of modulation reduces spurs and improves the fidelity of optical transmission and processing. The goal of this Phase II SBIR is to develop novel modulator concepts based on heretofore unexplored phenomena. It has been demonstrated theoretically that the proposed modulators enhance modulation efficiency as well as linearity while preserving broadband modulator response. In addition to developing fabrication methods, Phase I of the effort uncovered a new modulator architecture exploiting the originally proposed principles but simplifying the fabrication and improving modulator performance. Phase II will build on the experimental and theoretical results of Phase I, including the developed fabrication processes and designs, to reduce the concept to practice.",

Often vendors buy and integrate code acquired from third-party organizations into their designs, especially in embedded/system-on-chip designs. Currently, there is no way to determine if third-party designs have built-in backdoors that can compromise security after deployment. We propose to investigate techniques to detect backdoors in third-party IP components using principles from the area of Boolean Functional Analysis. A remarkable and novel aspect of our approach is that backdoors can be caught before the design is fabricated.",

E-commerce sales in 2015 accounted for 7.4% of total U.S. retail and are expected to rapidly rise. The potential for the commercial impact of general each-picking systems is high, as current manual labor methods are pain points for distribution centers; human picking is unpleasant, expensive and inefficient due to high absenteeism, high turnover and human error. The success of the proposed technology will also contribute to American competitiveness in the robotics industry. Of the top 20 distribution system integrators, only three are currently based in the U.S. Robotics is going to be the key driver of progress in this area, where each-picking, our core product capability, is a key component of future automated distribution systems. Beyond warehousing logistics, applications that our technology can benefit include: broad applications of industrial automation and manufacturing; military applications (e.g., IED disposal, where robots can perform tasks that are dangerous for humans to perform); and assistive healthcare (e.g., where robots must be compliant enough to be safe around humans while interacting successfully with unknown environments). This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will focus on the development of a state-of-the-art each-picking robotic system and its deployment, initially targeted at the order fulfillment industry. To date, robotic systems have enabled significant progress on transporting inventory on shelves or in totes. However, there has not yet been a deployed system that can perform the task of picking individual items from inventory bins and placing them in boxes for shipment. During Phase I of this project, RightHand Robotics developed a picking system far in advance of the research literature on robotic grasping, picking tens of thousands of items previously unseen objects, with error rates of less than 0.1%. During Phase II, the project will focus on advancing the state of the art in data-driven refinement of grasp planning using machine learning techniques, and will develop methods for box-packing that exploit the company?s advanced compliant grippers. These improvements will result in an average pick-and-place time of 6 seconds or less and an undetected placement failure rate of fewer one in ten thousand.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in line with the trend in medicine towards a prevention paradigm, following the premise that preventing problems is generally less costly than treating the problem or managing a future deficit. Excessive noise in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) has been clearly linked to cognitive deficits among the patients of these care areas. However, isolating the infants from any voice contact is also detrimental to language skill development. This project will investigate and develop a system that will provide for a more stable stay in the NICU, mitigate neurologic complications leading to developmental delays, and lessen the occurrence of hearing loss. The American Academy of Pediatrics? guidelines state that neonatal patients should not be exposed to noises greater than 45dBA yet hospitals struggle to achieve this. Deploying such a noise attenuation system with voice pass through capabilities will help hospitals provide the proper environment for their neonatal populations. Hospital administrators and clinical directors have expressed enthusiasm for this solution. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to develop an active noise reduction system for use in an NICU incubator, while allowing a parent's voice to pass through essentially unattenuated. To achieve the noise attenuation, the unwanted noise is monitored outside and inside the incubator and a corresponding signal exactly out of phase with the detected noise is used to largely cancel the unwanted noise. The system will employ a multi-channel hybrid system employing both feedback and feedforward elements. While a more complex approach, this has been shown to have performance advantages over simpler solutions. In this phase, the size of the zone of attenuation will be expanded, the algorithm will be adapted to multiple incubators having differing shapes, and a set of fail-safe provisions will be implemented.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable wireless industry carriers and equipment providers with an affordable technology solution to meet the continuing explosive societal/customer demands for data access. The telecommunication market sector has been increasingly consolidating to Asia and Europe where foreign governments are making strategic investments to encourage work in their respective countries. In a long-term, the proposed interference elimination technology can lead to increased investment in the telecom equipment sector and efficient use of the finite radio frequency (RF) spectrum in the United States. The expected technical and commercial outcome from the project is an active interference mitigation capability with product features including a significantly improved quality of service, simplified network equipment design and installation, and reduced requirements for many components such as antenna and filters. This in turn will reduce the overall cost per data link, as well as reducing the size, weight, and power requirements of the system. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the critical need for disruptive RF interference mitigation solutions. As networks are moving toward higher performance to accommodate larger capacity than ever seen before, the network operators, industry organizations, and equipment providers are looking into innovative technologies for next generation 5G wireless networks. There are two advantages offered by the proposed interference elimination technology. One advantage is extreme wide instantaneous bandwidth and the other is flexible tunability over GHz of operating frequency. These advantages help to consolidate and reduce front-end hardware. The focus of this program will be first on developing an optical system-on-chip version of the interference cancellation system with monolithically photonic integrated circuits. With a complete and fully function development board, the second focus will be on demonstrating the application in in-band interference mitigation for wireless backhaul networks, and showing improvement in 2x spectral efficiency and potential 1000x increase in capacity.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of genetically engineered tobacco plants that produce antibodies for the treatment of individuals infected with the Ebola virus. In the recent Ebola outbreak, a new antibody-based drug was shown to be effective in treating infected patients that was based on a transient tobacco-produced Ebola antibody cocktail called ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceutical, Inc, San Diego, CA). Unfortunately, Mapp Biopharmaceutical's supply of antibody was quickly depleted, as the manufacturing method was not able to keep up with demand. The technological innovation in this proposal is the targeted production of antibodies within the gland cells of the tobacco leaf surface structures called glandular secreting trichomes. The research objectives will be to demonstrate the secretion of antibodies to the Ebola virus from tobacco trichome glands. The goal is to generate a line of N. tabacum plants that is optimized for antibody production in plant trichomes to provide a biomanufacturing platform for the large-scale production of antibodies that may be used in the treatment of Ebola infection, and in the future, other diseases. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to use a recently developed plant-based biomanufacturing system to scale-up the production of antibodies to the Ebola virus for use as a therapeutic treatment. Mapp Biopharmaceutical has produced a drug based on antibodies to the Ebola virus produced in a tobacco plant transient gene expression system. Using this system, they have identified a glycosylated antibody variant (glycoform) with enhanced antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. Using glycosyl-transferase knockout lines of N. benthiamiana and transient expression strategies, the company utilizes plants to produce glycosylated antibodies that produce optimal recruitment of natural immune effector cells (Olinger et al., 2012). Other expression hosts (Chinese hamster ovary cells, yeast) yield product with reduced potency, and are not suitable alternatives. To recover active antibody with their current plant expression technology, Mapp Biopharmaceutical must destructively harvest plants, and isolate antibody from plant tissue homogenates. Unfortunately, this method has not been able to produce enough antibodies to satisfy the demand. The proposed method will allow for the production of antibodies in tobacco plants in large scale. In addition, the proposed system will use antibody harvesting strategies that do not require destructive homogenization as the antibodies will be secreted onto the surface of the leaf, and recovered by washing. The goals of this project are to increase the functionality of plant-produced antibodies, scale-up production, and reduce the costs of production further through system optimization.",

First, the development has potential to reduce the country's overall energy consumption by funding the development of low cost air quality sensors for energy efficient buildings. And second, the project will enhance the safety of our natural gas infrastructure with a low cost, low power methane (natural gas) sensor technology. This work will develop a methane (natural gas) sensor prototype with 10x lower cost, size and power consumption than current solutions. The proposed methane sensor will meet several currently unmet needs. These include enhanced public safety by enabling methane leak detection for natural gas distribution systems, and protecting first responders by enabling more and better methane detection in hazardous environments. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop the world's most porous materials, Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a sensing material. MOFs have been an active topic in material science research for over a decade, but they have yet to find a commercial application. This project promises to be the first commercialization of this exciting new class of materials. Nearly 40,000 different MOF structures have been identified to date. The crux of this work is to use a combination of computer models and laboratory experimentation to optimize a MOF structure that selectively and rapidly absorbs methane gas. The end goal of this project is to develop a commercial prototype methane sensor 'on a chip' that consists of a solid state mass transducer with the MOF coating that has been tuned for sensing methane.",

Finally, commercializing novel interactive technology also has the potential to help inspire a diverse array of young people to pursue a career in the critical areas of science, technology, engineering, and math. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to advance knowledge of low-cost technology that can provide realistic tactile feedback to a user touching objects in VR or AR: the project?s intellectual merits center on testing a new approach that combines minimal haptic hardware and sophisticated software algorithms. The research objective is to create a fully functional industrial prototype of a wearable fingertip thimble and custom software that embody the proposed approach. When the user's finger moves to touch a virtual object, a platform inside the thimble will initiate contact with the fingerpad and press with a force that varies with penetration distance, to render surface softness. A thermal actuator will convey the object?s thermal conductivity and temperature. When the finger slides along a virtual object, the user will feel its texture via carefully designed platform vibrations. Specific research tasks to be addressed include exploring haptic actuator options, building a library of haptic object properties (HOPs) that can be applied to virtual objects, and creating a communication protocol for exchanging haptic signals among devices. This project is expected to yield a fully functional industrial prototype and developer kits for the wearable fingertip thimble.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to address one of the primary barriers to the emergence of flexible electronics -the inability to assembly and interconnect thinned integrated circuits (ICs) onto flexible substrates in a reliable, cost-effective, high volume manner. Flexible electronics has been the subject of many industry journals, trade shows, technical conferences and market research reports. All describe a new age of ubiquitous electronics with devices embedded in the structures and items around us. Flexible electronic devices, unlike today's devices that are rigid and boxy, can conform to natural, curved shapes that exist in the real world. However, flexible electronics have yet to have their predicted economic and social impact. A major reason is because the electronics industry has not yet found a reliable, low-cost method for assembling thin, flexible ICs onto flexible circuit boards. Today's 'pick-and-place' assembly technology cannot handle ICs thin enough to be flexible. Until a new method is developed and adopted, the potential of flexible electronics will likely not be realized. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the integrated circuit (IC) aspects of a flexible hybrid electronics technology to a level at which these devices can be produced reliably and in volumes in a production-relevant environment. While most of the components of flexible hybrid electronics technology relating to printed electronics methods have been adequately researched and developed, little has been done on the integration of solid-state semiconductor devices onto highly flexible, organic substrates. Partial results have been reported in the literature, however, no attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive, wafer-to-end product approach suitable for commercial applications. This project will address this gap by focusing on all the steps for IC integration, including the preparation for assembly of ultra-thin, flexible semiconductor dies, their attachment onto a flexible circuit board using laser-enabled assembly technology, and their reliable electrical interconnection. The anticipated end results will be a complete flexible hybrid electronics integration technology developed to a level of pilot production readiness.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop an online, fully automated platform for designing high-affinity antibodies for use as potential drug candidates. The success of antibody-based drugs has generated interest in faster and more efficient methods to discover and optimize antibodies. The goal of this project will be to develop and implement a computational method for producing protein sequences of humanized antibodies. This will be achieved by providing software that allows scientists to move some of their initial experiments into the cloud, and achieve results much more quickly by using computational methods saving time and cost for new drug development. In addition, it is anticipated that this will improve the features of antibody-based drug candidates, enhance the success rate of clinical studies, and accelerate the commercialization of new drugs. This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop and implement computational tools for designing antibodies that are more effective, have fewer side effects, and have fewer problems in manufacturing. Current computational design methods rely almost entirely on the expertise of scientists iterating between experimental and bioinformatics approaches. An automated, systematic approach will help researchers design better antibodies with desired features in a shorter amount of time. The final platform will allow researchers to incorporate experimental and structural information to develop better drugs by determining which experiments will be necessary, assessing the viability of a potential candidate, and identifying structural features responsible for the molecule?s stability, immune response, and binding properties. The typical antibody design process takes many months and tens of thousands of dollars. With the aid of a computational process, this time can be cut back to the click of a button.",

        "abstract": "This Phase II project impacts the way engineering design is taught in design courses and contributes to the training of a strong workforce in areas related to science, technology and engineering. The Ecosystem is a software tool that automatically verifies designs against the requirements, to uncover oversights early in the process, but also fosters engineering judgement and creativity, allows for assessment of designs with less subjectivity, and facilitates smooth communication among team members. This results in productivity enhancements, higher quality designs and shorter time-to-market, but also in societal benefits (safer products, less risk of catastrophic accidents and more competitive design organizations). The target market consists of (1) educational institutions teaching engineering design, and (2) design companies striving to ensure compliance with the design specifications. The core innovation is three-fold. First, it consists of an e-design assessment engine that is being developed to a high degree of sophistication. Second, design repositories are investigated and developed for integration. Third, holistic (big data) analysis of design content and metadata is implemented. The project seeks to develop an innovative design decision (learning) support system addressing problems related to the high cost of design oversights. Such oversights can result in catastrophic failures, product recalls, or simply in budget or schedule over-runs (due to rework). The Ecosystem offers a flexible, yet systematic and generic, framework, for guiding designers through the design process, and for automatically assessing design activities, from each stage in the design process, against the product design specification (PDS). At the center of the Ecosystem is the e-design assessment engine, which decomposes the PDS, correlates the design activities against individual requirements, and provides real-time advisories in case of design oversights. The assessment engine automatically configures popular development tools for engineering design, determines relevant analyses, and interprets the outputs. The Ecosystem interfaces with these development tools, but does not replace. The Ecosystem can translate qualitative customer requirements into solid engineering requirements, and verify the relevance of the design content provided through seamless interfaces with industry databases. The Ecosystem improves designers' productivity through automation of many administrative tasks (e.g., generation of project reports). Despite the automation, the learning experience is not diminished. The Ecosystem prompts for, captures, and preserves the rationale for relevant engineering decisions. It also supports accredited, generic learning objectives for engineering design.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that it will enable a group of customers we call Risk Pricers (specifically, property and casualty insurance underwriters and mortgage bankers in financial firms) to profit from tailoring pricing on their products. They can do this by rapidly predicting financial losses for buildings having specific configurations, using the software developed in this proposal. These customers can then tailor pricing of earthquake insurance and mortgage terms based on refined analyses that we facilitate. Besides offering a clear financial benefit to Risk Pricers, this new analysis approach will also fundamentally change market forces and incentives around building safety. If a building's owner is incentivized to improve its earthquake performance (via lower insurance and mortgage costs), then high-performance buildings become more appealing and this will encourage design of better buildings. As the company's software makes more explicit the links between building properties and financial costs, society will benefit from more efficient resource allocation, ultimately leading to increased societal resilience. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop algorithms and software tools that provide financial guidance to customers interested in repair costs and closures of buildings due to earthquakes. To complete the development of its tool, the company will focus on calibrating statistical models to predict displacements and accelerations in a wide range of building types, when they are subjected to earthquake shaking. The company's method for rapid estimation of structural responses utilizes principles of engineering mechanics, but applied in a domain where academic research does not focus (i.e., estimating response of a structure whose properties are not fully known to the analyst). The key identified need is to calibrate a statistical predictive model for the response of a structure that is effective over all popular construction types of interest to customers in the insurance and mortgage banking markets (i.e., light frame wood, steel, concrete, concrete tilt-up). The company will also develop loss metric and calculation outputs that incorporate insurance contract conditions such as deductibles and limits, in order to link the calculations to customers' workflows.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop and commercialize a high resolution, protein-based retinal implant intended to restore vision to the millions of patients blinded by retinal degenerative diseases, particularly retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration. These currently incurable and blinding diseases affect between 30-50 million people worldwide, and lead to a loss of independence for the individual, as well as an increased burden on their caregivers. While improved quality of life is the most vital outcome of this technology, reduction of medical costs of treating chronic retinal degeneration and limiting time with doctors will also be of benefit to the broad healthcare field. The work outlined in this SBIR proposal also has the potential to significantly impact our understanding of retinal degenerative diseases, which will help in developing better and more effective treatments for a number of ophthalmic indications. The subretinal implant under development provides the framework for the next generation of high-resolution retinal prosthetics, while offering a cost-effective solution to vision restoration, and will help these patients regain independence and thus improve their quality of life. The proposed project will expand on the data collected from the in vivo surgical development and ex vivo efficacy studies supported by our Phase I/IB awards. First, a 40-animal rat study will be undertaken to further investigate the biocompatibility of the retinal implant. Second, previously developed surgical procedures will be refined in pigs to ensure reproducible and safe subretinal implantation. Third, a high-throughput in vitro assay will be designed to investigate a number of implant parameters, as well as the integrity and biostability of the retinal implant using retinal pigment epithelial cells. Additionally, medical device sealants will be investigated in this in vitro study, and the functional integrity of the implant will be measured using time-resolved absorption spectroscopy and an ion-sensitive detector, which is being developed specifically for this application. Lastly, this ion-sensitive detector will provide an opportunity to further measure the spatial sensitivity of the retinal implant with high resolution. These in vivo and in vitro studies are vital for the continued evaluation of biocompatibility, surgical feasibility, and efficacy of the implant. The results from these studies will further demonstrate the commercial viability of the technology under development.",

        "abstract": "This Phase II project will commercialize a big-data analytics-based adaptive online learning platform founded on the principles of adaptive learning. The online learning system provides adaptive learning strategies with real-time learner analytics. The system integrates learner analytics from four dimensional aspects of learning: multi-media, learning strategies, interactivity, and social interaction-- to deliver a personalized learning experience for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) students for significant improvement in the learning outcome. The adaptive learning software technology platforms with personalized learning strategies have demonstrated high completion and satisfaction rates for online students taking post-secondary courses. In this SBIR Phase II we propose to develop a unique data driven decision support interface that will result in real-time big data analytics for both individuals and large numbers of learners. The volume, velocity, variety, and veracity (the 4 Vs of big data) will be generated by the collection of data at individual schools first, with the potential to aggregate data from district, state, and even national levels. The big-data analytics of the learner trajectories through the adaptive learning platform will uncover patterns that can improve understanding of learner behavior in education. Big data, generated by the adaptive learning systems related to learner behavior in each learning strategy, will lead to valuable insights on efficacy of the proposed methodology and further development of the product on mobile platforms in the Phase II. The learner analytics will provide the basis for intelligent feedback based on the statistical evidence. The proposed method of data driven decision process for adaptive learning is based on the real- time cross-correlation statistical analysis of the predictor variables for an individual learner. The field trials of the proposed method will be conducted in the participating high schools. Collection of data for a group of students collected during the field trials in high schools will lead to discovery of learning patterns for the clusters of learners in each learning strategy. The previous Phase I research has led to the development of an analytical model for volume, velocity, variety, and veracity of data collected at school-wide level. This reports form this data is used for the development of decision tree and regression analysis to find correlations (knowledge discovery) that can be used for the improvement of learning enterprise (school). The data-driven feedback to students and the group analytics for teachers will provide necessary feedback mechanism for improving competency and graduation rates for STEM education in schools and colleges.",

Error correction plays a critical row in making digital devices reliable. Shrinking semiconductor geometries results in more errors. This has created a special problem for flash memory where the need for more rigorous error correction is approaching a practical limit with the widely used Bose Chaudhuri Hocquengham error correction. Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) is a recognized solution that can approach the theoretical limits of what is possible. This LDPC based technology can improve lifetime of flash by without the added cost of the existing BCH solution. This technology helps Flash Memory enterprises to use higher density flash to improve storage capacity and cut the storage product costs. Without the superior performance, small size and low power consumption of the LDPC technology, the migration to low cost high capacity flash memories will be seriously slowed. In the absence of a comparable alternative approach, there will be serious limitations on the performance of a vast array of products that depend on highly reliable and economical flash storage. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use a variety of techniques to minimize the area and power requirements and enhance the performance of Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) error correction codes for flash memory. Many of these techniques are applicable to a wide range of error correction applications in digital communication and storage from WiFi to hard disk drives. The need for better error correction is crucial for flash memory but there is a widening demand for improved error correction. For example larger memories require better error correction to insure the system failure rate is low. In the next two years the company expects to develop a Verilog version of the LDPC decoder that is easily integrated with a flash controller. The project will work with potential customers/partners to ensure the code works with controllers. In the long run these techniques can be adapted to a wide range of applications as the need for more reliable data continues to rapidly expand.",

Problems, by definition, are hard to solve. They require intensive thinking and open-ended experimentation, which are often not possible in today's classrooms. In the software, an expert avatar takes students on math explorations in video-game-quality 3D where they visualize and discover eye-opening mathematical truths. The program helps teachers turn math into exciting explorations that students will love. For example, as students fly a jumbo jet from New York to Tokyo, they effortlessly discover methods for finding the shortest path between two points on the surface of a sphere, which is a difficult geometry problem. Teachers can easily fit the program into their daily instruction and get crucial details about the weak spots of each student. The joy of discovery is envisioned to increase students' interest in math, science, and engineering and to significantly reduce their math anxiety. Besides creating jobs and tax revenue, the project is expected to contribute to measurably improved math scores across the nation's 132,000 schools educating 58 million students. The software being developed in this project is unique in that it emulates the natural style of communication between a student and an expert math teacher and immerses students in 3D virtual worlds where they develop deep mathematical insight and solve fascinating real-world problems. The program's ability to develop both mathematical content knowledge and problem-solving skills at the same time, as well as its capability to non-intrusively assess students during the mathematical explorations is also unmatched. During the Phase II project, the commercially viable software will be fully developed and its efficacy to improve students' mathematical problem-solving skills will be thoroughly researched.

        "abstract": "A pilots ability to maintain situational awareness during flight is critical to both mission success and crew and passenger safety. Loss of spatial orientation and overall situational awareness is a critical challenge for the DOD. This is especially the case for helicopter pilotage during tactical maneuvers in stressful conditions such as Degraded Visual Environments (DVE) scenarios. Accidents due to impaired situational awareness (including DVE) account for a large percentage of battlefield helicopter accidents. These accidents come at great cost to the Army; equipment is lost, and service members lives are lost. One key component being developed to mitigate DVE accidents is the Tactile Situation Awareness System (TSAS  USAARL), which uses vibrational cues to signal warnings and flight information to the pilot in an intuitive method. Building off a tactile system developed for Land Soldier cueing (Darpa/Army grants), Mide offers to create a High Definition TSAS wearable display featuring smart piezo tactile actuators tactors embedded in low profile shirts/and or pilot vests. Mids low profile and lightweight smart piezo tactors will reduce the Size Weight and Power (SWAP) of the current TSAS implementation; improve tactile cueing capability, and lead to an effective and fieldable system for DVE mitigation and piloting",

demand for\nimproved performance  Despite their increasing prevalence  the methacrylate resin phase for the vast majority of these\nmaterials has remained largely unaltered since Bowen first proposed the materials nearly    years ago  Presently \ncomposites suffer from shrinkage and stress that arise during polymerization  a subsequent lack of appropriate mechanical\nproperties of the resin material  and low depth of cure for polymerization  The composites also generally contain in their\ncore monomer the substituent bisphenol A  which is associated with ever increasingly significant regulatory and health\nconcerns  Following polymerization  the composites contain significant fractions of unreacted monomer that results in the\ncritical presence of extractables that coupled with moisture uptake by the sample can lead to degradation  The result is\noften secondary cavities and premature failure where composites average lifetime is less than   years  High resin viscosity\nof the base dimethacrylate monomers limits the ability to incorporate high filler volumes without the use of low viscosity\nreactive diluents that generally reduce the modulus and results in higher volume shrinkage and shrinkage stress  The resin\nphase is comprised primarily of dimethacrylate monomers typically selected from BisGMA  BisEMA  UDMA  and\nTEGDMA  Classically  the limitations of these materials have involved a trade off between the mechanical behavior  the\nstress and the extent of reaction conversion of the material that limits extractables and water sorption  These trade offs\nhave limited the advent of significant advancements in the development and performance of new dental restorative\ncomposites as the BisGMA TEGDMA systems have proven to be a local optimum within this overall flawed compromise \n Here  we propose a methodology that synergistically combines the use of thiol ene and methacrylate chemistries and\nhas demonstrated feasibility for a novel new

existing commercial composites and BisGMA TEGDMA\ncontrols  We will also demonstrate improved adhesion with existing commercial adhesive systems along with increased\ndepth of cure and increased lifetimes through wear and fatigue testing  Our preliminary results have demonstrated a much\ngreater mechanical property enhancement in composite methacrylate thiol ene systems than in the control composite\nBisGMA TEGDMA systems  These results indicate that the increased conversion of methacrylate thiol ene systems will\nnot only dramatically reduce the amount of extractable monomer but also enhance the interaction between the resin phase\nand the fillers  leading to enhanced mechanical properties  This same benefit is expected to lead to improved adhesion\nwith the native tooth structure  In the second aim  we will demonstrate reduced levels of extraction  degradation  and\nimproved biocompatibility in novel high conversion low stress methacrylate thiol ene composite dental restorative\nmaterials  The combination of dramatic improvements already demonstrated in Phase I feasibility studies and the\ncontinued performance improvements that will result from Aim I will synergistically also result in improved\nbiocompatibility and long term performance of these materials  Specifically  we will demonstrate improved\nbiocompatibility as measured through cytotoxicity  sensitization  and oral mucosal irritation testing  We will also\ndemonstrate reduced extractables and degradation products through comprehensive long term degradation studies \n Feasibility of material properties has been demonstrated through flexural modulus and strength  conversion  and\nshrinkage stress results already achieved  Additionally  feasibility of biocompatibility has been demonstrated through\nbiofilm growth studies  degradation extraction data  and Cytotoxicity results  In this Phase II work we will continue to\nformulate composite materials that achieve significant improvements in all of these areas to achieve an even greater\ndistinction advantage of the methacrylate thiol ene materials over existing commercial materials  The composite materials\nresultant from this Phase II work will demonstrate superior properties to existing commercial formulations in every\nmeasurable category  The synergistic combination of methacrylate and thiol ene chemistries coupled with a novel and\noptimized filler system and interface will lead to improvements in mechanical properties  adhesion  wear  and fatigue that\nare coupled with reductions in degradation and extraction products  reduced biofilm formation  and excellent\nbiocompatibility  Ultimately these properties will result in dental composites that exhibit dramatic improvements in\nclinical performance and overall lifetimes Narrative\nMore than     million restorations are performed each year with more than     of those restorations\ninvolving polymer composites  Despite this prevalence  these composites have an average lifetime of less\nthan   years due to the combined issues of mechanics  shrinkage induced stress  and degradation of the\ncomposite  The proposed technology purports to change this paradigm using the synergistic combination\nof the well known methacrylate systems with step growth thiol ene resins that aims to significantly\nimprove the performance of composite restorative materials in each of these three critical areas  We\ncombine the advantages of both step growth thiol ene and chain growth methacrylate polymerizations to\nachieve an overall composite system with dramatically improved conversion  corresponding to reduced\nextractables  and decreased shrinkage stress while also achieving improved mechanical properties and\nadhesion  Additionally we will demonstrate improved wear and fatigue properties  reduced\nextraction degradation  and reduced biofilm formation  Ultimately  these combinations of improvements\nwill lead to a dental restorative material with improved biocompatibility as well as improved performance\nand service life times",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant   A fundamental challenge in the drug discovery process is to develop drugs with high efficacy and minimal side  effects  As an initial step this depends on identifying lead compounds which interact with high affinity and regulate the activity of specific biological drug targets such as a protein involved in a disease pathway  However  a second equally important step is to verify that these leads do not interact and interfere with the functioning of the vast number of other proteins which comprise the human proteome  A variety of effective methods exist to perform label free high throughput screening  HTS  of compound libraries against single drug targets  However  the ability to perform HTS on compound libraries  or even a small set of lead compounds  against a large library of protein targets has not yet emerged  Such high throughput multidimensional drug screening  HT MDDS  would have a significant impact of the pharmaceutical and health  care industry  Most importantly  it would facilitate proteome wide detection of off target drug protein interactions  Such interactions often\ncause serious adverse drug reactions  SADRs  responsible for the over         deaths per year in the U S   exceeding the number of annual deaths due to cancer  In addition  HT MDDS would provide a powerful method to discover new targets for existing FDA approved drugs by identifying off target interactions as well as to elucidate the molecular basis of side effects fro on label use  In order to meet this challenge  AmberGen has explored during Phase I the use of its proprietary Bead GPS tm  technology as a means to perform HT MDDS during lead optimization  Bead GPS tm  is based on MALDI mass spectrometric imaging  MALDI MSI  of high density random bead arrays  where each bead in the array carries a unique protein and corresponding photocleavable mass tag for coding  PC mass tag   Binding of specific compounds to a specific protein is detected by measuring simultaneously the mass of the binders and the photoreleased PC mass tag s  residing on each bead  Our initial results demonstrate the feasibility of using Bead  GPSTM to screen a drug compound library against thousands of proteins in order to rapidly identify both on  and off target interactions on a global\nproteome wide basis  Progress during Phase I included  i  Development of new photocleavable linkers for facile attachment of mass tags to beads  ii  Demonstration of high capacity coding of protein bead libraries with single and double PC mass tags  iii  Construction of a model    member PC mass tag coded kinase library  iv  Screening the kinase bead library with two known kinase inhibitors demonstrating      specificity and sensitivity  During Phase II  we will further optimize Bead GPS tm  for HT MDDS with the goal of establishing it as a standard tool for pre clinical lead optimization  For this purpose  we will construct a     member PC mass tagged kinase protein bead library  This library will be screened by Bead GPS tm  against compounds from a model     member kinase inhibitor library  On target and off target interactions from positive hits detected by Bead GPS tm  will be further characterized for binding affinity and inhibitor activity using homogenous kinase assays  as well as by synchronization of fluorescent FRET and MALDI MS images of the random bead array  Improvements in several aspects of the Bead GPS tm  process including advanced MALDI MSI instrumentation and software will allow   to    fold improvements in sensitivity and scan speed  In order to accelerate the development and commercialization of Bead GPS tm   AmberGen will work closely with Dr  Cathy Costello  Director  Center for Biomedical Mass Spectrometry at the Boston University Medical School and a leading expert in the field of MALDI and its biomedical applications  Dr  Marvin Vestal  pioneer in MS  MALDI instrumentation development and President of SimulTOF Systems  Dr  Michael Pavia  a leader in the pharmaceutical industry and ex CTO of Millennium Pharmaceuticals  Dr  Yiwu He  former Global Head and Senior Director of GlaxoSmithKline and currently Senior Program Officer at the Bill andamp  Melinda Gates Foundation and Dr  Gheorghe Doros  Associate Professor of Biostatistics at the Boston University School of Public Health  AmberGen will also explore the use of improved MALDI MSI instrumentation in collaboration with SimulTOF Systems and Bruker Daltonics PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Serious adverse drug reactions often due to unwanted off target drug interactions are responsible for over         deaths per year in the U S   exceeding the number of annual deaths due to cancer  In order to reduce the occurrence of such adverse drug reactions  AmberGen has developed during Phase I a new technology based on mass spectrometric imaging of random bead arrays that allows high throughput screening of libraries of drugs against libraries of proteins in order to detect off target interactions  During Phase II \nwe will optimize this new technology with the goal of establishing it as a standard tool for pre clinical lead identification and optimization",

Phase I experimentally demonstrated the feasibility of SRICOs approach using the sum frequency generation process. A novel, robust packaging scheme was demonstrated to efficiently combine disparate wavelengths to launch into a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide. Highly efficient DFG input coupling technology, in combination with the in-house capability to produce and test PPLN waveguide devices, makes SRICO uniquely suited to implement a wide range of frequency converters for use in QFC applications. In Phase II, SRICO will build on the solid foundation established in Phase I to produce fully packaged compact plug-and-play quantum frequency conversion modules based on a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide having high difference and sum conversion efficiency with at least 10 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: This proposal details a Narrow Width Line Of detection (NWLOD) system to be used for human intrusion detection systems protecting critical Air Force assets on flightlines, launch facilities, and weapon storage areas. A high probability of detection (Pd) is required for targets including people walking, running, crawling, and jumping and vehicles traveling at high or low speed when crossing through the LOD; however, the width of the detection area for the LOD shall be less than 1.5 meters (threshold) or 1 meter (objective). The LOD shall have a low probability of false or nuisance or false alarms and shall not detect people or vehicles outside the 1.5 meter width. The key challenge is that many other activities take place on the flight line, including movement of aircraft and vehicles right up to the LOD. A second challenge is that no aspect of the detection system should interfere in anyway with normal flightline operations. To address this critical need, Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI), along with our collaborators proposes to develop LC&F, an integrated distributed sensor array narrow width Line of Detection (LOD) for Narrow-width line protection of flight lines, launch facilities, and other key assets.; BENEFIT: The need for perimeter security is increasing due to a constant risk of terrorist attacks, large-scale illegal immigration, increased crime and violent anti-government protests as a result of international and local issues. Theft at Brussels airport in March 2013, other security breaches at Atlantas Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in November 2012, Utahs St. George Municipal Airport in July 2012, Y-12 National Security Complex in August 2012, and the Philadelphia International Airport in March 2012 are just few examples of the increasing number of threats. The demand for security is increasing as these breaches have raised criticism. The demand is not limited to any extent; it is a necessity now-a-days for all the verticals including Transportation; Critical infrastructures such as nuclear plants, chemical industries, and oil and gas facilities; Commercial buildings; Govt. and Defense; and for all Sensitive areas, has also shown increase in the demand for security technologies and systems.",

Systems that respond to threat indicators from sensor fusion and external sources generate and evaluate potentially large sets of course of actions (COAs) based on incomplete or noisy data. These systems must reason under uncertainty and anticipate possible contingencies for plans that involve complex sequencing and sensor tasking. The Probabilistic Reasoning for Enhanced Course of Action Generation (PRECOG) system uses advanced probabilistic reasoning methods to represent complex COAs and their evolution under uncertainty and to optimize the choice of COAs against multiple objectives. The representation of COAs includes the ability to task sensors and allows execution of actions to depend on the occurrence of contingent events or the results of sensor fusion. PRECOG will advance the state of the art in decision making algorithms, enabling efficient COA selection on board a satellite.",

It is expected that the current P-8 operational CONOPS envelope will see sonobuoy deployment from high altitudes up to 15,000 ft.  The accurate placement of current production sonobuoys from high altitudes is very challenging; they spend more time descending through uncertain, varying atmospheric conditions causing significant drift and trajectory variation which, in turn, results in unreliable splash point prediction.   Previous studies have shown that production sonobuoys deployed from high altitudes can have placement errors as large as 1,300 to 7,000 meters depending on conditions.  Additionally, increased altitude deployments increase time to splash latency.  Large placement errors and time to splash latency are unacceptable for conducting effective air-ASW missions. The PHASE solution, originally developed for the Q53 and now proposed for Q62, will allow the Navy to conduct air ASW from all altitudes with better accuracy and reduction in descent latency.  PHASE is a low cost improvement that is a two part solution: a sonobuoy ballistics model paired with a descent module affixed to the top of a standard sonobuoy without sonobuoy modification.",

The specifics of the LWIR detector requirements are: 8-12 m wavelength response, GHz bandwidths, and D*=1013 Jones. Wavelength and bandwidth requirements are already met by existing detectors, however present detectors are 100 away from meeting the D* requirement. Meeting the needed D* requires a 104  improvements in both dark and background current. Phase I of this program successfully demonstrated a detector breakthrough, that can accomplish the 100 x improvement in D* using an advanced type of resonant cavity-enhanced photodiode (RCE-PD). In Phase II the RCE-PD design will be optimized, and a receiver module operating at 9.3 m will be fabricated and tested.

This is true more than ever as engineers strive to save energy, increase performance, and reduce emissions.  Given this trend, it is very important that the product design and R&D engineers have the ability to measure engine parameters during operation.  The instrument proposed is designed for that purpose.  Gas turbine engines have historically been limited by material in the rotor section.  Higher gas temperatures passing through the turbine yields higher efficiency and performance.  Measurements of temperature, pressure, strain, and acceleration in and around the turbine blades and passages allow evaluation of design changes, thermodynamic performance, and material limits.  This requires a high channel count, resolution, and sample rate instrument with low noise.  To achieve this, IR Telemetrics will develop a completely non-contact (wireless) design for rotating applications and will accommodate more than 100 channels, have 20 bit resolution, at 400kSPS, with a noise floor of -90 dB and capable of doing this at 25,000rpm.

        "abstract": "The Marine Corps uses Portable Oxygen Generators (POGS) to produce on-demand medical-grade oxygen from air for expeditionary medical applications (patient ventilation, anesthesia, and to refill oxygen bottles). The POGS currently in use are bulky, heavy and can consume up to 1,800 W of electrical power, occasionally overloading the Forward Resuscitative Surgical Systems (FRSS) power generators.  In this SBIR project, TDA Research, Inc. is developing a small, low power, portable oxygen generator that uses vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) to produce USP grade, 93% medical oxygen.  The unit uses ambient air as the feed and delivers USP grade oxygen. This unit will meet DoD requirements for high flow capacity (up to 15 LPM) and be able to produce oxygen at up to 2,200 psig to refill D-size oxygen bottles.    The POG developed by TDA utilizes a unique sorbent that has a higher efficiency for the separation of N2 and O2 and can operate at lower pressures than currently used commercial air separation sorbents.  These two characteristics enable the POG to use less electrical power and use smaller sorbent bed sizes.  This will reduce the logistical burden of operating the oxygen concentrator by the Marine Corps.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Given the national importance of protecting our space assets, there is a growing need for an effective means to track and characterize Earth orbiting space objects, including operational satellites, inoperational satellites, and debris.  This, in turn, has motivated the development of space-based sensors that can observe the same objects or the same space regions at any time of the day or night, and in all-weather conditions.  However, given the large number of space objects and vast distances involved, we need a systematic method to task these sensors to maximize the detection, reacquisition, and characterization of space objects.  Under this Phase II effort, STR will expand the technology concept developed by its Phase I effort to maximize detection probability and state estimation accuracy of Earth orbiting objects through closed-loop data fusion with a feature-aided Multiple Hypothesis Tracker with the K-best hypothesis selection capability, coupled with the Sensor Resource Management to optimally assign tasks of discovering new objects and updating tracked objects to sensor resources, based on an information theoretic metric.  We will develop a closed-loop system prototype, provide a demonstration of the closed-loop data fusion concepts for space surveillance systems by space-based sensors.; BENEFIT: Using space-based SSA platforms will enable almost continuous SSA operations, removing space and temporal gaps of space object observations by conventional ground-based Space Surveillance Network (SSN) optical sensors.  The potential commercial applications include space monitoring applications, especially the monitoring of the commercial geostationary satellite operations, mainly broadcasting and communication applications.  In the future, commercial SSA monitoring will become necessary for other private-sector space activities, including space exploration and sightseeing.",

The filter will be matched to a cooled, long-wave infrared (LWIR) focal plane array (FPA) to produce three HSI dimensions (a hypercube) simultaneously in a compact,  low size weight and power (SWAP) package.

The hyperspectral data is obtained at the FPA frame rate.  Combined with temporal algorithms, it can be used to identify spectral/temporal signatures.

These experiments will quantify subjective response to tactical jet noise with the specialized metrics. Furthermore, noise monitoring studies are planned to evaluate the magnitude and variability of these specialized metrics measured from real flight operations.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The objective of this solicitation is to develop real-time automatic scaling software for oblique ionograms (OIs).  In Phase I, using recently developed mathematical concepts of sparsity and fractional norms, we have developed a novel method for detecting the desired trace data and determining whether a given point is an ordinary magnetoionic mode (O) or an extraordinary mode (X) while reducing selection of noise/interference data.  A selected OI trace could be converted to an approximately equivalent vertical ionogram using the laws of virtual geometry (VG) and inverted to an electron density profile, but this is an unnecessarily inaccurate method.  We have instead assimilated the OI trace data directly into NWRAs assimilative ionosphere model, GPSII (GPS Ionospheric Inversion).  This approach allows for ionospheric horizontal gradients that would be lost in the VG approach.  In Phase II we will further develop this new method of automatically scaling oblique ionograms into a robust system suitable for use in routine operations.  This will require making the trace extraction algorithm more robust to disturbed ionograms and significantly reducing processing times.  We will exercise the new code on a wide variety of real measured ionograms and perform performance analyses.; BENEFIT: An automated system for finding oblique ionogram trace points will allow for real time assimilation of potentially dense networks of ionosondes.  The Australian DSTO has already fielded such a network, the Dense Integrated Network of Ionospheric Sensors (DINIS), for defining the propagation environment of their OTH radar system, JORN.  A similar networked sounding system has been proposed for the US Next Generation OTH Radar (NGOTHR).  Making best use of the ionograms provided by an ionospheric sounding network to improve the geolocation accuracy of NGOTHR will require a direct 3D ionospheric data assimilation algorithm like NWRAs GPS Ionospheric Inversion (GPSII).  For GPSII to function without a human in the loop, as will be necessary for the throughput required of NGOTHR, automated trace extraction will be required.  This capability will also benefit the intelligence community.  A limitation of HF geolocation of emitters in denied territories is the inability to measure the ionosphere in the denied region using vertical ionosondes.  However, it is often completely reasonable to propagate over a denied region using oblique-incidence HF paths, that is, oblique ionograms.  GPSII is already being evaluated in the IARPA HFGeo program and has proven to provide unparalleled accuracy in accounting for the signal deflections caused by medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs).  A reliable OI autoscaling capability will extend the benefit of GPSII to HFGeo in denied territories.",

        "abstract": "Numerical reservoir simulation is the primary tool a reservoir engineer uses to predict future production from hydrocarbon reservoirs and to develop a plan to maximize production at minimal cost. Compositional reservoir simulation, in particular, is required to have an accurate physical description of the subsurface oil and gas in development situations involving gas injection, condensate production, or the coupling of reservoirs with multiple oil qualities. Because this simulation is extremely computationally intensive, engineers are often forced to simplify the models of their reservoirs, sacrificing accuracy and predictive capacity in order to allow their simulations to run in a practical time frame. To address this performance problem, an extremely high-performance compositional package will be added to the researchers\u2019 existing reservoir simulator, which currently implements a simpler black-oil description of the hydrocarbons. The proposed compositional addition will utilize the exceptional throughput provided by graphics processing units (GPUs) in combination with a novel approach to the implicit solution of the nonlinear partial differential equations to drastically reduce simulation runtime. It is estimated that typical compositional reservoir models will run ten to one hundred times faster than with currently available reservoir simulators, enabling higher accuracy predictions in less time. In Phase I of this project, a compositional equation-of-state module will be developed, validated, optimized for efficient operation on GPUs, and benchmarked against published results. In the first year of Phase II, this module will be integrated into the existing high-performance simulator, and code for the novel nonlinear solution method will be implemented. In the second year of Phase II, the new package will be extensively validated with public benchmarks and proprietary models provided by customers, and the code will be optimized and hardened in preparation for commercial deployment. The advance in speed provided by the compositional reservoir simulator resulting from this project will enable higher quality decisions to be made about optimal field development. This can help increase the ultimate recovery from the nation\u2019s finite petroleum resources. The density and cost effectiveness of the GPU computing platform used for the simulator will also make extremely high performance computing available in a workstation computer. This will make HPC much more accessible to smaller corporations, including engineering consulting firms that cannot afford the capital outlay and maintenance costs of a traditional HPC cluster. New computational methods and software will be developed to allow faster and more accurate simulations of the flow of subsurface water and hydrocarbons in petroleum reservoirs. The resulting reservoir simulation software will enable more efficient production of the nation\u2019s petroleum reserves.",

        "abstract": "To protect against sophisticated cyber attacks, many critical infrastructure environments have deployed Bro, an open-source network security platform with capabilities that far exceed conventional intrusion detection solutions. Originally pursued as research platform at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Bro is now protecting thousands of organizations world-wide, including U.S. government agencies, Fortune 10 enterprises, banks, telecommunications carriers, most national laboratories, and many universities. While powerful, today\u2019s Bro deployments typically remain small in scope\u2014consisting of just a few individual installations monitoring an organization\u2019s major upstream links. Increasingly, though, critical infrastructure operators realize the potential of pushing Bro much deeper into their networks. Deploying large numbers of Bro sensors across their entire network fabric would allow them to monitor, and correlate, activity occurfing anywhere inside a widely distributed environment. Unfortunately, there exists no scalable solution today for managing a large footprint of Bro sensors. Broala, LLC proposes to fill this gap by developing a robust solution for operating Bro at scale. Founded by the creators of Bro to bring the system\u2019s power to enterprises and government, Broala will develop technology that harnesses Bro\u2019s best-of-class capabilities for comprehensively protecting the nation\u2019s largest critical infrastructure networks\u2014making it easy to deploy fleets of Bro sensors across an infrastructure, easily manageable from a central location and adaptable to the environment\u2019s changing needs and constraints within minutes. The foundation for Broala\u2019s solution will come from a commercial Bro appliance that the company recently announced. Our initial reference environment for this project will be the U.S. Department of State, which is seeking to deploy hundreds of Bro sensors across its locations around the world. Broala expects the new technology to become commercially attractive to many other U.S. critical infrastructure sectors as well, including banks and telecommunications carriers. As such, this work has the potential to vastly improve the protection and resilience of the nation\u2019s most critical resources across industry and government. While many critical infrastructure environments depend on the open-source \u2019Bro\u2019 software for protection against sophisticated cyber attacks, no scalable solution exists today for rolling out large numbers of Bro sensors across globally distributed infrastructure. Broala, LLC, will fill this gap by developing a robust solution for operating Bro at scale.",

        "abstract": "Synchrotron x-ray radiation has become an integral tool relied by scientists across a diverse range of academic and industrial disciplines, ranging from the development of new drugs and environmental or agricultural studies, to cutting-edge research on semiconductor and advanced materials. Recent advances across multiple fields toward nanometer-scale studies has resulted in tremendous demand among the burgeoning synchrotron community for increased access to smaller microbeams down to 100 nanometer or even 10 nanometers. This proposal aims to address the major concerns highlighted at a recent Department of Energy sponsored workshop, in which leaders of the synchrotron community identified manufacturing and technological limitations of current approaches to synchrotron x-ray optics as bottlenecks to advancing research performed at the synchrotron. This Fast Track proposal will develop an innovative approach to developing a single-bounce, axially symmetric and achromatic x-ray mirror lens with paraboloidal inner profiles capable of focusing x-rays down to 100 nm. These paraboloidal mirror lenses will have 2X larger numerical aperture than Kirkpatrick-Baez x-ray mirrors (thereby providing 4X more x-ray flux and flux density), >80% focusing efficiency, and a working distance that can be customized to specified need, which will enable upgrades of older, less used beamlines that may otherwise be retired or the cost-effective building of new, shorter beamlines. Proposed deliverables in Phase I include the development of: an optical shaping system, a measurement (metrology) system to determine the quality of the optic and provide rapid feedback on fabrication parameters, and one paraboloidal mirror lens designed for 10 keV x-rays. This lens will be used to demonstrate a 700 nm focus at 8 keV during Phase I. Deliverables in Phase II will build upon the developmental work of Phase I through planned iterative improvements to the stability and capabilities of the optical shaping system and upgrades to the metrology system for greater precision and accuracy. Ultimate deliverables of Phase II are the fabrication of four paraboloidal mirror lenses capable of achieving 100 nanometers, and with each designed for a different x-ray energy (5, 10, 15, and 20 keV). The paraboloidal mirrors will accelerate and empower the scientific work performed with x-ray microbeam techniques that impact our knowledge and life quality, by providing substantially higher flux over current optics approaches and thus reducing data acquisition times for more efficient use of limited synchrotron beam time. It will furthermore enable cost-effective developments of and upgrades to beamlines, thereby facilitating widespread access of high resolution x-ray microbeam techniques to a broader base of researchers. In addition, the technology and process developed in this fast-track proposal can be leveraged for developing high performance and high resolution laboratory x-ray equipment. Synchrotrons are extremely powerful sources of x-rays that are used by scientists in cutting-edge research in fields spanning from semiconductors to pharmaceuticals and agriculture. This proposal aims to develop innovative x-ray optics for efficient focusing of synchrotron x-rays to address major scientific questions at the nanometer and subcellular scales.",

        "abstract": "Innovative methods are required for the processing of aluminum alloys with ultra-high strength and ductility for wide usage in energy savings and light weighting in many DOD and commercial applications. Conventional techniques for achieving the range of chemical and physical material properties have reached a plateau and are producing only incremental improvements. This SBIR Phase II project, proposes an innovative processing approach of powder compaction and sintering with fields to process ultra-high strength aluminum alloys with strength properties that are double that of wrought materials. The method involves blending aluminum powder alloys with alnico (magnetic particles) as reinforcement, powder alignment during green body forming, and subsequent field assisted sintering approaches for full densification and grain boundary engineering for higher strength, ductility, and texture. The project also establishes commercial viability for production at the conclusion of Phase II. The Phase I results have demonstrated that aluminum alloys processed via this route have 50 % higher strength than conventional press and sintered alloys of the same base composition. The processing approach can be suitably developed for other light-weight alloys such as magnesium and titanium.",

The key technologies underlying SETUS are the Area Statistics approach to quickly and accurately resolve uncertainty in the acoustic environment, and an Agent Based Simulation with Bayesian Weights (ABSBW) which compares both positive information (passive sonar contact) and negative information (lack of passive sonar contact) against a number of simulated target agents to estimate the likelihood any individual agent could have generated that positive and negative information. Preliminary results from Phase I demonstrate that SETUS is capable of making significant improvements to the state of the art of passive sonar state estimation, and the Phase II work will refine and enhance SETUS in preparation for transition to fleet use via the APB process.",

In particular, for the military wireless systems that need to communicate over long distances interference often limits communication to within the flight or platoon, denying the ability to communicate to radios outside the group. This project will design and build distributed radio interference mitigation systems  for both the anti-access area denial (A2AD) maritime environment and the aerial environment. The project will implement a variety of high performance signal processing algorithms that can operate in both an aerial environment with high Doppler and in the maritime environment with complex channel conditions. The project execute three spiral developments that progressively reduce risk and demonstrate the key technologies.  The project will culminate in a realistic bi-directional DRIM system that both beamforms at the transmitting cluster and the receiving cluster.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of Phase I research was to investigate the feasibility of creating the NeuroAudit Wireless EEG System-on-a-Chip (SoC). The system measures EEG waveforms from up to 64 electrode sites and transmits the data wirelessly to a nearby electronic gateway device (e.g. Smartphone, Tablet or computer). The system operates at very low power levels allowing the head worn SoC to be completely powered via harvested energy. This results in a revolutionary system, which is essentially invisible to the user and can collect data 24/7. During Phase I an extensive literature search, analytical calculations, simulations and measurements were used to design the ideal system for this application. The result of this work is a schematic level design, which meets the goals of the project. The solution uses a novel frontend topology, which greatly reduces required power consumption while maintaining signal integrity equivalent to traditional systems. Data is transmitted using a low power ultra-wideband (UWB) radio. Furthermore, the team has outlined a power harvesting solution, which can power the NeuroAudit system using a multimodal approach.",

These particles are typically fabricated on planar surfaces, since patterning planar surfaces to achieve the desired effects is relatively straightforward.  However, for planar geometries the particles optical properties are sensitive to the incoming radiations angle of incidence.   This results in sub-optimal performance when a particles overall response is integrated over all possible incident angles.  In fact, this angular dependence limits the maximum mass extinction coefficient obtainable using conventional infrared obscurant approaches, such as, shaped metal particles with high aspect ratios (e.g. rods, flakes). For an optimal obscurant particle, angle of incidence should ideally not play a critical role in the extinction performance",

Using modern HMI design patterns, these displays will reduce operator interaction while increasing the operators productivity. These HMI improvements will provide customizable and interoperable displays that result in improved collaboration amongst operators, improved identification and classification of emitters, improved situational awareness, audio analysis, and reduced operator workload. The improved HMI will follow the SWFTS style guidelines thus assuring a common look and feel with other SWFTS subsystems. The EW NGA open architecture will facilitate simplified integration and improved test and evaluation of the improved HMI.  The EW operator workflows were developed and analyzed with an eye to simplification and enhancement. The revisions to operator workflows will serve as the basis for a HMI Concept of Operations (CONOPS) to be developed during Phase II.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project offers a unique approach to teaching the difficult content of operating with fractions through interactive, adaptive games. Existing products are not effective at teaching fractions, and half of US eighth graders cannot correctly order three fractions, a fourth grade standard. Current research and the Common Core State Standards emphasize using a number line to teach fractions, which is a more effective approach; however, leading curricula are not fully aligned to this method. This project aims to improve 3rd-5th grade students' understanding of fractions through engaging apps that encourage estimation and problem-solving. Unlike other apps, which typically end with just a score, this project will provide rich, actionable insight to help teachers screen and monitor students' progress over time, thereby improving teachers' instruction as well as student learning. Closely aligning with NSF's mission of improving mathematics education for all children, this project fills an essential need in the marketplace for engaging, effective software that aligns with Common Core and provides data-driven intervention support. This software will be specially designed for children who struggle in mathematics and will meet the criteria for intervention software, further increasing its commercial value for the school market and its potential to generate income. This project aims to improve children's use of efficient strategies in estimating and solving fractions arithmetic by targeting children?s metastrategic awareness and metacognitive abilities. This project will include the development of a series of fractions apps and game-based data reporting for teachers to help them tailor instruction and target interventions. Extracting actionable insight from children?s gameplay rather than from standardized tests is a novel innovation that has the potential to dramatically change teaching and learning. The development process will include wireframing novel gameplay and developing app components and features. The backend system will identify learning patterns within clickstream data collected during play and apply data-mining techniques to these patterns. Instead of assessing single actions as correct or incorrect, the backend will identify series of actions and associate them with a particular strategy. This data will be used to inform instructors, test hypotheses, and provide evidence for learning. A dynamic content generation engine will use the insights extracted from student data to provide learners with highly targeted, fine-tuned activities. The project?s research will include both informal design research and a randomized control study with 3rd-5th grade students to determine the effects of using the software on procedural and conceptual knowledge of fractions.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project can lead to a revolution in the consumer electronics market (mobile handsets, tablets, game consoles and wearables), wherein high performance, low power, small footprint multisensing (not limited to inertial sensing) platforms with timing devices, are all directly microfabricated on a common ASIC substrate. Sensor fusion can produce unprecedented user experiences by using data collected from all sensors and processed using machine learning algorithms. This can further boost the sensor and timing markets that are expected to exceed $6 billion dollars by 2017. Moreover, the emergent Internet of Things (IoTs) and wearable markets are expected to reach $20 billion dollars by 2025, which can induce a rapid growth of such intelligent sensor fusion market. This can have a tremendous societal impact as wearable devices and IoT systems, interfaced with mobile platforms, can be used to monitor people?s health, safety and energy consumption. Making these solutions affordable will make it amenable to low income households not only in the US but also around the world. It will also enable researchers to attain new frontiers of knowledge such as in digital sensory systems. The long-term goals are to provide such intelligent sensor fusion solutions. This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to demonstrate wafer-scale microfabrication of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) inertial sensors directly on the application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) substrates, by using electroplated copper (e-Cu) as a structural material. MEMS inertial sensors, such as gyroscopes and accelerometers, are pervasively used in consumer electronics and automotive industries. Current trends are, however, requiring higher device performance with smaller footprints, wherein multi-degree-of-freedom sensors are integrated on the same package, to enable new capabilities and user experiences. These requirements can be met by monolithically fabricating inertial sensors on ASIC substrates, which is complex to achieve with silicon as a structural material. Using e- Cu, which is currently used for ASIC metal interconnects, as the structural material, can enable easier routing to implement optimized mechanical structures, smaller dimensions given the high density of copper, extremely low cost as no wafer bonding is required, smaller form factors, multiple sensors on a single die, and much smaller parasitics providing low noise and higher performance. Phase II tasks will be to wafer-scale fabricate an inertial measurement unit that is monolithically integrated with its ASIC with optimal performance parameters.",

While haptic interactions in these applications can already be portrayed with desktop robotic force feedback devices, the developed haptic technology could provide realistic haptic feedback at a much lower price point (required for consumer devices) and unlike current force feedback devices, the developed haptic devices can be used to naturally interact in large workspace applications like motion-input video games or VR experiences. The proposed research will enhance the scientific understanding of human-haptic and multi-modal interactions in virtual environments, and will create a model for this technology to migrate into adjacent fields. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to meet the market demand for intuitive, immersive, and inexpensive haptic technologies in the emerging field of consumer virtual reality (VR). Multiple companies are now making inexpensive 3D head-mounted displays (HMDs) for VR, but current haptic interfaces are either too expensive, have limited range of motion, or are too crude to portray realistic haptic interactions in VR. The company has created an ungrounded haptic motion controller that utilizes a new form of touch feedback that applies in-hand shear forces to create compelling physical feedback at a price that is viable for consumer markets. The proposed research objectives are based on feedback from key stakeholders and VR enthusiasts who have tried the company?s current high-end haptic controllers. Their feedback suggests improving the overall user experience of the controllers through reducing device size, mass, and system latency, while improving device ergonomics and reducing cost. The Phase II research builds on the findings of Phase I, which showed that even simpler implementations of the newly developed haptic technology were still found to be more compelling than traditional vibration feedback. The project will result in a reference design that can be mass produced.",

Successful commercialization of the innovative Cerenkov BoroSilicate Glass (CBSG) technology will serve a broad customer base in the nuclear detection and verification industry. Market research indicates large scale potential, in the billions of dollars. This market is currently well served with gamma ray and x-ray detection devices, but the capabilities for portable and wearable neutron detectors are not as well established. The proposed technology will close this gap and is anticipated to have a very broad impact. The Cerenkov detector technology can also be transformative in enabling new kinds of directional arrays for neutron imaging and portal detectors, helping to make the nation's borders more secure against illicit nuclear materials and providing improved tools for nuclear safeguards and verification. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to commercialize an innovative neutron detector module based 100% on solid-state technology. The overall objective of the project is to build on the successful Cerenkov BoroSilicate Glass (CBSG) detector prototyping in Phase I/IB to develop a small, low cost, modular neutron detector which can be integrated with existing gamma detector technologies to 1) form a comprehensive, scalable, networked solution to the problem of Special Nuclear Material detection; 2) enable inexpensive in-house and third party integration of neutron detection technology into radioisotope identification devices and personal radiation dosimeters; and 3) allow for further testing and advanced product development relating to directional neutron detector networks, direct fast neutron detectors, and neutron spectroscopy. The research objectives include a thorough quantitative assessment of the detector front-end material response to neutron radiation and evaluation of its optoelectronic characteristics. In particular, in collaboration with a specialty glass manufacturer, the isotopic composition of glass front-end will be optimized for fast neutron detection.

        "abstract": "This Phase II project aims to help address the achievement gap for English Learners, who consistently average 21% below native English speakers on reading scale scores starting in 4th grade and are twice as likely to drop out of school. Eighty percent of teachers believe that materials for English Learners are sub-standard, which contributes to this gap. The project provides an online crowd-authoring and sharing platform that gives K-6 language teachers the tools to meet their unique instructional needs on demand. It is the first and only platform to enable practicing teachers to rapidly build digital language lessons and interactive games that align to their specific requirements, without any technical know-how. The platform provides built-in rich media resources that adhere to best practices based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. Any teacher may access these open educational resources at no cost, provided they make their own creations available for public reuse, revision and remixing. The project seeks to understand the dynamics of collaboration and quality assurance for interactive content at a massive scale. Crowd-authoring can invest educators with the power to transform language learning into a field that is highly responsive to the evolving needs of educators and learners. This Phase II project will pioneer mass customization of interactive games and media in the field of second language acquisition. The project aims for teachers to create 175,000 custom digital lessons and interactive games using media resources provided by the project. Phase II will develop four new types of games that improve language acquisition using audiovisual experimentation, realtime chat with artificial intelligences, and a new technology that transforms visuals and narratives composed by students into grammatically accurate text and audio. Phase II will integrate these innovations into a crowd-authoring and quality assurance system capable of scaling to 100,000 new teacher-made learning objects per month. By giving language educators tools to rapidly create, share and customize content to meet their precise needs, the project seeks to significantly improve learning outcomes. Phase II will implement real-time formative assessment reports for teachers to evaluate student experiences and issues with the custom teacher-made interactive content. A controlled full-year, multi-site educational impact study will measure whether the project affects vocabulary acquisition, comprehension, grammar and sentence formation, and whether any skill gains transfer to other contexts. It will also reveal deep data insights about the process by which K-6 students acquire a second language.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project can be found across the semiconductor industry with its initial market in wireless communications. Due to the extraordinary properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), applications include low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, and RF power amplifiers (PAs). Looking forward, carbon nanotube transistors (CFETs) can reshape analog radio frequency electronics, enabling the higher data rates and improved capacity demanded by next generation wireless systems due to their intrinsic linearity and associated low out of band interference . CFETs are highly efficient, dissipating less unwanted power than current state of the art technologies while handling high power levels. This translates into more battery life for mobile devices with lower cooling costs. With more linear RF transistors, many billions of dollars of spending on additional base stations, larger batteries, and radio spectrum can be avoided, at great savings to consumers and industry. More speculatively, the creation of reliable grwoth techniques for CFETs and associated manufacturing processes may offer an excellent sensor platform or better ways to form on chip interconnects. The key problems being investigating of in situ growth of high performance nanotubes are applicable to the fabrication of CNT based devices for many electronic applications. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop electronic devices for radio frequency applications using carbon nanotubes (CNTs). CNTs are a one dimensional material with diameters in the nanometer range. CNTs have unique and highly desirable properties ranging from superior mobility to current carrying capability to thermal stability. Calculations show CNT amplifiers will be inherently linear with noise suppressed to the lowest possible quantum limit. These properties allow for electronic devices that will perform better than existing technologies, such as silicon and gallium arsenide. Just as importantly, the cost for making these devices will be dramatically lower due to the relatively simple method for material synthesis and device fabrication. This work will enable wafer scale arrays of high density in-situ tubes to be grown on silicon enabling the development of carbon electronic components a manner comparable to silicon devices. This work will enable cost effective wafer scale growth of devices which exploit the groundbreaking linearity that CNTs can deliver.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of new tools to understand the dynamic behavior of cellular machinery that is disrupted in disease. Unraveling the dynamic aspects of cellular physiology that may be targeted therapeutically requires new technologies capable of profiling the response of entire signaling pathways to pharmacological intervention targeted at single pathway nodes. The availability of physiologically relevant live-cell models that are compatible with visualizing and quantifying the spatiotemporal regulation of disease-relevant signal transduction pathways and cellular machinery will be key to enabling this approach. The ability to monitor multiple facets of key cancer signaling pathways in this way represents a valuable opportunity to identify potent and selective therapeutic inhibitors of \"undruggable\" targets, such as the Ras protein, which is a crucial driver of more than 30% of cancers. By enabling development of a robust and scalable high-throughput live-cell assay platform, this technology may reduce the time and cost to pinpoint the mechanism of action and off-target effects of pharmaceutical chemicals, thus delivering new capabilities to rapidly and cost-effectively identify safe and effective therapeutics. This SBIR Phase II project will develop a robust and flexible platform for rapid generation of precision-engineered, multicolor fluorescent cell lines and associated high-throughput microscopy-based assays. This platform contrasts with industry standard methods for developing such cell lines and assays, which are lengthy and inflexible. The project comprises optimization and execution of four components: 1) Generation of a panel of cell lines compatible with rapid, reliable stable reporter integration; 2) Delivery of a library of approximately 25 multicolor reporters of the Ras/MAPK pathway; 3) Rapid generation and validation of a library of approximately 100 validated stable reporter cell lines expressing all therapeutically relevant mutations and isoforms of the Ras/MAPK pathway; and 4) 384-well plate assay development and screening of these Ras/MAPK reporter cells using tool compounds. The project aims to demonstrate the capability of the platform to rapidly pinpoint compound mechanism of action and potential off-target effects by monitoring multiple facets of previously inaccessible biology associated with a critical, high-value oncology target in live cells.

        "abstract": "This Phase II project aims to develop software to automatically assess public speaking skills and prepare students with better oral communications skills necessary to perform job tasks. Oral expression is the most highly valued ability throughout the economy and ranks as the second most highly-valued skill for high-wage, high-growth, high-skill occupations. Approximately 4.5 million college students take a basic communications course each year, however, as class sizes get larger and online learning becomes more common, public speaking instruction becomes increasingly difficult. Practice and feedback are essential aspects of these courses, yet it is a struggle for teachers to find enough time to sufficiently interact with students. This SBIR project aims to develop the key concepts of automated public speaking assessment such that a student?s vocal delivery can be objectively measured and presented in a manner that creates an independent, personalized learning experience. Unlike traditional methods of public speaking assessment, the proposed system can be available at any time, provide objective feedback and track student practice and improvement. The proposed Software-as-a-Service is projected to generate $16 Million in revenue over five years and create more than 25 high-paying, US-based jobs. This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop an automated assessment system for public speaking that determines how a speaker would be perceived by an audience. Automated assessment for speech has already occurred in spoken language proficiency, which leverages Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) and semantic analysis. Automated voice assessment has also been utilized in lie detection and emotion detection, which focus on autonomic responses in the user?s voice, such as when stress affects the vocal cords. The hypothesis behind this SBIR project is that speakers can consciously use and modify non-semantic speech behaviors to produce more desirable listener perceptions. Automatically linking listener perception to speech behaviors represents a novel direction in automated assessment for speech. The Phase II objective is to develop software sufficient for automated public speaking assessment such that a student?s vocal delivery can be objectively measured and presented in a manner that creates an independent, personalized learning experience. Voice analytics capability investigated in Phase I will be enhanced and developed into a cloud-based service which helps students practice, track, and improve their public speaking habits.",

        "abstract": "Infectious diseases can have significant impact on operational readiness of military forces. This proposal describes a rapid immunochromatographic diagnostic test (Noro Detect) for gastroenteritis caused by Norovirus (NoV) infection. The test can potentially be used in combination with a portable reader (powered by rechargeable batteries) for automated reading and interpretation. The proposed solution is small, lightweight, and insensitive to environmental extremes such as dust, high humidity, and storage temperatures of up to 45C. The test will have high sensitivity and specificity to differentiate from other enteric pathogens, and can detect norovirus infection at the onset of symptoms. Time to result is expected to be 20-30 minutes, and many tests can be run in parallel. Major advantages of this diagnostic method are that it is fast, soldier-friendly, non-invasive, and likely to be consistent with obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance as a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-waived diagnostic device. Rapid identification of the diarrhea-causing pathogen will aid immediate intervention. Such a test will have a need for both military and non-military use. InBios will work closely with its distribution channels worldwide to make Noro Detect available to government and private reference laboratories/hospitals and at point of care settings.",

The need to characterize the dynamic response of DMs is key in improvement of their design and effective operation in future high-bandwidth AO systems that can compensate in real-time for atmospheric turbulence. This proposal by Advanced Systems and Technologies, Inc. (AS&T) directly responds to the above NAVY needs with a unique and comprehensive testing station that employs an architecture supporting multiple modalities of optical metrology tailored specifically for DM devices of various designs. In Phase of this program we performed initial proof of the concept of a novel optical non-contact sensor fusion concept, the Multi-mode Interferometer for Evaluation of Dynamics in Adaptive-optic Systems (MIEDAS) that supports full dynamic and static characterization of deformable membrane mirrors. The unparalleled measurement capabilities incorporated in MIEDAS are uniquely suited to the new sensor technologies sought by the Navy for comprehensive DM characterization. This proposal lays out a work plan to develop a Phase II prototype instrument that will provide a comprehensive test and evaluation platform for future Navy adaptive optic system developments.",

This was accomplished by combining the benefits of CEMs active suspension, central tire inflation (CTIS), and TRIs variable vehicle cone index (VVCI) system through the use of a new Enhanced Safety Control (ESC) system to minimize the effects of road breakaway and to enable vehicle extraction from a variety of immobilization scenarios. Multiple simulations were run which indicated significantly improved performance. For the Phase II effort the team proposes to: complete development of the Enhanced Safety Control system; integrate it onto an existing HMMWV with active suspension; integrate TRIs VVCI and CTIS to improve soft soil mobility; and conduct testing at an independent test facility to demonstrate improved performance during road breakaway events and vehicle extraction scenarios. The results shown during testing will then be incorporated into future performance predictions for future JLTV and MRAP class vehicles. Following a successful demonstration, the team will work with our commercial partners to market the completed system.",

The ability to tailor the properties of the feedstock materials and to deposit them into complex 3D freeform gradient patterns will be demonstrated. The properties of the materials will be tested over their tunable range of operation and over a range of temperatures. Homogeneous and heterogeneous material samples will then be reliability and environmentally tested.

This was done by taking advantage of the higher electrical conductivity of CFOAM compared to the baseline material.  This promising concept will be further developed during the Phase II effort by building and testing panels and by feeding the test data back into the models from Phase I in order to find the best combination and arrangement of materials.

Omm Scientific, Inc. is currently working with their Air Force customer under a Phase II STTR effort focused on converting Diaminoazofurazan (DAAzF) to aminonitroazafurazan (ANAzF). Although ANAzF may be a useful propellant ingredient, it is not useful for explosive applications or of interest to the Army. Nalas Engineering Services, Inc. (also small business) worked with the same Air Force customer on a Phase I STTR to develop novel processing to aminonitrofurazan (ANF). Again, ANF is not of interest to the Army. Although the materials being processed at the request of the Air Force are not applicable to Army requirements, the technologies developed during these efforts are quite relevant to the Armys desire to improve explosive performance. For this enhancement, the focus will be on oxidation of preparation of Bis-amino-oxadizazylfuroxan (BAFF) to its dinitro analog (BNFF).",

Phase 1 culminated in the demonstration of half-scale 24\u2019 diameter roundabout\u2019s center circle made with the recycled boards. The same material and modular construction approach can be applied to other roundabout features, such as splitter islands.\n\nPhase II will feature two major types of activity. Lab testing will be conducted to verify suitability of the recycled plastic boards and associated ground anchors for the roundabout application, with special tests created to evaluate durability and hold down features. The majority of Phase II work will center on identification of locations for prototype roundabout installations in cities around the country. ZKxKZ has already reached an agreement for the site of our first Phase II installation. It is expected that prototype roundabouts will be installed early enough in the program to allow the team to monitor the performance of the systems over a period of operational exposure, and use this data to adjust future designs for any observed shortcomings.\n\nThe ultimate objective of Phase II will be establishment of a low cost mini-roundabout product suitable for commercial sale.\n",

        "abstract": "Chronically implanted neural electrodes are used to treat various neurological and neuropsychological disorders and for brain-machine interfaces used to control advanced prosthetics. Powering these systems with batteries is risky due to loss of power and energy over time, necessitating additional surgery, creating a lapse in treatment and additional risks from potential exposure to toxic material. Energy harvesting from the human body is a promising alternative, but current strategies have many drawbacks including inconsistent power production and poor lifetimes, among others. In response, Lynntech is developing an energy harvesting strategy that transforms chemical energy in the blood into electrical energy using a unique, bioengineering approach. The energy harvesting construct will be able survive for extended periods within the body and is capable of providing power that can directly be used to run the functions of a neural implant for deep brain stimulation. In Phase II, design concepts will be developed and scaled for animal testing and characterized in vivo. Additionally, preliminary scaled-up bioengineering will be explored along with integrating our system with a deep brain stimulator. Innovative designs coupled with long-lasting materials will enable this device to achieve long term goals of harvesting the chemical energy available within the human body.",

There is a need for low-cost missile seekers that can be integrated on smaller platforms without any moving parts. Next generation semi-active laser seekers therefore require novel non-gimbal (strap-down) seeker solutions with the same total field of view operation as a gimbal seeker in order to maintain track on a target.  A SAL seeker must also operate in an environment which may be rich with background radiation, particularly when the sun is located in the sensor field of view.  In order to reduce the impact of background radiation the seeker optics requires a wide field of view narrow band pass filter centered at the target near-infrared laser illuminator wavelength.  This requires a solar rejection filter with a pass band to be tuned to a desired laser designator wavelength. AEgis technologies proposes to use  a  metamaterial approach towards the realization of a  wide field  of view tunable infrared band pass filter technology that can be utilized for strapped down semi-active laser seeker sensors optics.",

These engines are even less efficient at partial power conditions where they often operate. Bottoming cycles, such as organic Rankine cycles, can utilize this waste heat to produce useful work, improving overall efficiency by 10 to 20%. An enabling technology for utilizing a bottoming cycle is an Exhaust Heat Recovery Heat Exchanger (EHRX) which transfers heat from the gas turbine exhaust to the working fluid of the bottoming cycle. For marine applications, this heat exchanger experiences large temperature transients and gradients, and is exposed to a corrosive exhaust stream. These environmental factors make long lifetimes and durability key challenges. On this program, we are developing an innovative and robust EHRX that is optimized for marine applications. During the Phase II Base, we developed fabrication procedures, built, and tested prototype EHRX components and a subscale EHRX. During the Phase II Option, we built and delivered a larger subscale EHRX to be used for performance testing with a gas turbine. On the proposed program, we will (1) build a prototypical scale EHRX, (2) procure a commercial bottoming cycle, and (3) assist in the integration and testing of an EHRX with a gas turbine engine and bottoming cycle to demonstrate power generation from waste heat.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Ionospheric Scatter Radars (ISR) are used to probe the ionosphere.  Radio signals are transmitted and sometime later a received echo arrives.  The information in the return signal is remarkably rich in physical content concerning the composition of the ionosphere.  The power in the return echo is proportional to the electron density along the radar line of sight.  In addition, the spectrum of the received signal is important and yields information about the electron and ion distribution functions and mean velocities.  The objective of the proposed research is to develop a low cost, high performance Ionospheric Scatter Radar for Air Force use.  This radar can have the performance of the AMISR while costing less than 33% of that cost.  Alternatively, it can provide a much greater technical performance at about the same cost.    The major advancement is the capability to establish a bi-static radar which can take advantage of improvements in electronics and, specifically, the low noise figure allowed by the elimination of a transmit/receive switch of a monostatic radar installation.  High power single transmit devices can be used and the beam combined in space for  large power-aperture products.; BENEFIT: The major impediment to the wider global implementation of scattering measurements is cost. A radars effectiveness can be measured by the product of its power and its aperture (antenna area). In traditional radar systems, getting to high power-aperture products is expensive in both dimensions  power must be precisely transmitted at high frequency, and the antenna must be physically large, and often structurally complex. Multiple conventional radars providing the power-aperture product required are not feasible in todays fiscal environment.   In this proposed effort, Diversified Technologies, Inc. (DTI) and MIT Haystack Observatory (MIT) will work together to implement a modern paradigm, where low power transmitters, precision receivers, and discrete antennas are integrated into radar elements which can be and readily deployed to meet Incoherent Scattering Radar (ISR) requirements. Through advances in microcircuits and computing power, these elements can be replicated at low cost, fielded in large aperture arrays can be fielded, and tied together with advanced processing algorithms to achieve the same performance through replicability of a network of Incoherent Scattering Radars (ISRs). These ISRs can be deployed at a reasonable cost, competitive with a single satellite or a small group of conventional radars.",

        "abstract": "As naval vessels increase capabilities for carrying out various missions, overall power requirements of these vessels continue to increase. Consequently, the power conversion equipment used to supply power throughout the ship increases in size, weight, and power. State-of-the-art electronics power density, including the thermal management system (TMS) is limited to approximately 0.5 MW per cubic meter. This is a major limitation in future ship designs because naval vessels have a limited space claim for electronics, and the Navy would rather install more functional equipment instead of the electronics that power such equipment. Thus, the Navy would benefit greatly from more power dense and efficient power conversion systems. The use of Mainstreams GaN switch module, initially developed in Phase I, is but one part of the equation when it comes to making higher power density systems. While the switch allows for switching frequencies up to 200 kHz and wide operating temperatures, TMS and passive components necessary for power conversion equipment must also be shrunk while demanding that they handle higher levels of power.

AOSense will test this optical source module under simulated laser failure and unlocking, and will characterize its performance under severe acceleration (5g rms over a frequency range of 20 Hz  2000 Hz).    In parallel, AOSense will work with the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory to perform proton irradiation tests on critical optoelectronic components necessary for atomic sensor operation. Device performance will be assessed in real time as these components are exposed to a  total ionizing dose (TID) representative of a multi-year space mission. Results will inform component selection for future space-borne atomic sensors.; BENEFIT: Operation of an atom-based sensor in space or strategic environments demands utmost confidence in the laser system. The laser system must have the ability to detect, avoid, and recover from a loss of wavelength lock and/or output power. Currently, no commercially available laser system can provide the narrow-linewidth, high-power optical output over multi-year time scales required by a fieldable CA-IMU. AOSense proposes to address this deficiency by demonstrating a rugged optical source module featuring autonomous laser locking and fail-proof optical output. Development of this laser module, in tandem with validation of its components under ionizing radiation, will result in a ruggedized and reliable laser source capable of autonomously driving an atom-based sensor within the space environment. Such an effort would greatly help to enable space-based applications for atomic sensors such as IMUs, clocks, and magnetometers, opening up significant market opportunities in the defense and commercial sectors.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The thermal spray process has many inherent complexities within each sub-process including feedstock manufacturing, component surface preparation and masking, torch parameter selection, robot trajectory and laboratory coating evaluation. Each sub-process is governed by rigid specifications that provide thermal spray applicators with procedural and process guidelines throughout the application. Current aerospace thermal spray specifications are not adequate to capture many nuances in feedstock procurement and process management. This allows non-optimal, yet conforming materials and processes to be used during overhaul and repair yielding unsatisfactory outcomes in some instances especially in cost and productivity. ReliaCoat Technologies, a small business specializing in advanced thermal spray concepts, will perform a detailed analysis of present coating specifications to determine the most critical areas of the process which are prone to variability in spite of operating within specifications. ReliaCoats strategy aims to improve these specifications from within: i.e. operate the materials and processes within the scope of the specifications but introduce robustness through in-process gates and appropriate knowledge management tools to shrink variability and tighten distribution. This will allow cognizant engineers to benefit from the outcome without moving away from decades of experience base, while process engineers will be able to use tools to improve productivity.; BENEFIT: The benefits anticipated by investigating and implementing modified coating specifications include the following; reduction of laboratory test frequency, reduction of time required for qualification by minimizing process variability, increasing throughput of parts coated and minimizing the amount of rework, together providing higher productivity and enabling high velocity maintenance scenarios. The in-process gates will provide a deeper insight into thermal spray processing, enhancing the operators understanding of process variables. ReliaCoat is aiming to provide integrated process management solutions to the thermal spray industry via expert knowledge in materials science and process engineering into ruggedized yet readily adaptable industrial tools with user friendly software.",

The feasibility of a 10x lower cost design approach for a Fourier transform type, thermal imaging spectrometer was successfully demonstrated in the previous SBIR effort. The keys to this success were the replacement of the expensive voice coil servo / laser positioner with a new low cost COTS piezo-electric transducer and the replacement of the very expensive cryo-cooled MCT detector array with a micro-bolometer array. A spectral resolution of 4cm-1 was successfully demonstrated.  MESH is proposing to integrate the latest micro-bolometer detector array technology and then to optimize the performance.

Surprisingly, however, only a handful have addressed an end to end DSA communication system, and to the best of our knowledge none have looked at how DSA can be enabled in a single transceiver legacy radio. In our proposed approach we look to strike a balance between maximizing throughput gain via DSA and maximizing the probability for a timely and successful transition. Our approach is based on a novel mechanism for sensing of the spectrum and exchange of the sensing data within the network without any interruption of the data traffic and without any hardware blocks external to the legacy radio. During the Phase-I effort we used extensive simulations to model our approach and quantify its performance in a host of scenarios, we also validated its operation in a 4 node TRL-4 prototype system. The objective of the Phase II effort is to mature the technology with an eye towards transition. A TRL-7 prototype for COTS based MANET solutions is expected within the the Phase-II Base effort.

Corrosion damage is important to the management of the structural integrity of an airframe, and current corrosion damage modeling methods are expensive and provide only rough estimates of damage.

        "abstract": "The objective of this Phase II project is to research, develop, and commercialize a resonant scan lens (RSL) for use in a resonant light detection and ranging (R-LIDAR) distance sensor. R-LIDAR uses a resonant optomechanical system to generate a beam scan. While resonant optomechanical systems produce high-speed and large field-of-view (FOV) scans from a miniature form factor, the beam scans lack uniformity across the FOV. Poor scan uniformity is typically addressed by clipping the scan periphery to remove the most non-uniform regions. Z-senz proposes to research and develop an RSL to linearize a resonant scan thereby increasing the FOV and duty-cycle of an R-LIDAR sensor. This project builds upon the NIST Phase I SBIR effort that demonstrated a 25% average improvement in linearity from a 90% duty-cycle scan compared to an unmodified resonant beam scan. This project proposes to iterate the RSL design to achieve a 75% average improvement in linearity from a 90% duty-cycle scan and develop this technology for use in an R-LIDAR sensor. While the RSL research improves the performance of the R-LIDAR system, this technology has utility to a large number of high speed imaging and display applications, including: microscopy, endoscopy, ophthalmology, scanning displays, and laser machining.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will revolutionize the treatment of individuals with autism. One of every sixty-eight US children has autism (over 1.1 million). The estimated cost of providing Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy to those who could benefit is $7.5 billion dollars annually. Societal impacts include: 1) more individuals with autism across the globe will receive treatment regimens that will enable them to live more fulfilled lives and reach their full potential; 2) families whose children are good candidates for treatment and receive it will experience reduced stress and better family life; and 3) the additional lifetime cost of not effectively treating children with autism, which is approximately ten-fold the cost of treatment, will be reduced. Because high-quality, contextually rich ABA performance data will be collected for the first time, efforts to apply data analytics will contribute in two important ways: a) patterns may be discerned across individuals with autism to better understand variations in autism and create therapies to target these differences; b) expansion of the frontiers of data mining to provide guidance in real time will contribute to a number of areas within and beyond ABA therapy. The proposed project will optimize therapy outcomes for individuals with autism by transforming agent-based guiding technology into an adaptive and intelligent ABA therapy assistant for supervisors and instructors. The project pushes the boundaries in providing cost-effective, adaptable, intelligent, real-time guidance and data-collection support to instructors that integrates naturally into the instructional process and is easy to learn and use. ABA therapy experts, supervisors and instructors will verify the analyses and resulting guidance incorporated into the technology. Advanced theories of usability engineering, including some developed by the project team, will be used to build interfaces that supervisors and instructors can intuit without the need for learning new concepts and syntax. The project will utilize the collected logs from multiple sessions with multiple therapy recipients and multiple therapy providers to uncover hidden patterns and assist supervisors in selecting appropriate therapy steps personalized for the individual with autism. The project will build on a large body of recent work in visualization, machine learning on temporal predictive modeling and sequential pattern mining, including some of the previous results of the project team. Special attention will be paid to the recent work in educational data mining and intelligent tutoring.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR phase II project is focused on quantifying and developing one's creative thinking abilities. In more details, this project will develop modules that measures one's domain-base and subject-base creativity and validate the modules using statistical validation techniques. Creative talent will remain the great differentiator in the coming world, and the organizations that thrive there will do so because they have the right potentials. Using the semantics-based psychometric approach, this project designs exercises and models that assess one's creativity. This project will help employers in acquiring creative employees and also train and educate current employees in ways by which they can become more creative. The market is vast, encompassing potentially all employers who hire and manage workers with symbol-analytic skills. According to the 2010 U.S Census, there are over 143M people employed in the workforce. This project will expand to various sectors of the workforce using strategic partnerships with distribution channels in workforce education companies, and talent/human capital management companies. Currently, creative thinking strategies and assessments are taught by experts and consultants in the form of workshops. Such semantic creativity assessment is a manual, time-consuming and expensive process. This project creates a set of open-ended exercises and evaluates each exercise based on the four creative-thinking dimensions: 1) Originality: Original thinking capacity and ability to generate novel and out-of-the-box solutions; 2) Fluency: Ideation capacity and ability to push past the first set of known responses; 3)Flexibility: Divergent-thinking capacity and ability to think non-linearly; and 4) Elaboration: Detailed-oriented and ability to provide intrinsic details about each possible solution and response. This project automates such testing by using advances in semantic-based psychometric modelling, natural language processing (NLP), semantic networks from computational linguistics and computational power for statistical mining of large corpora. Due to ease of scalability, this solution is not limited to any one country or region. The solution can be deployed world-wide. Currently, this project has gathered data from 161 different countries around the world. This project is the first step towards automation of open-ended exercises in various fields and contexts such as situational judgement assessments, emotional intelligence and motivational assessments.",

        "abstract": "This Phase II project proposes to develop a computer science (CS) educational software that has the potential to inspire millions of U.S. K-12 students to learn computer programming. This software will leverage the motivational power of a popular video game, to teach CS to students by teaching them to reprogram the video game itself. The United States currently has a severe deficit of students pursuing CS. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that over 1 million computing job openings will go unfilled by U.S. workers by 2022. By leveraging the power of a popular video game, the technology proposed in this Phase II project has the potential to expose millions of K-12 students to coding in the next 5 years. The commercial impact of the underlying technology developed in this Phase II project does not stop at the over 100 million users who currently play the popular video game with which the current educational software integrates. Because the underlying technology is transferable to any moddable (i.e. reprogrammable) video game, the technology has the potential to be used to teach CS with other popular titles from the rapidly growing video game industry. This Phase II project proposes to continue the development of a software product that is a web-based coding environment for novice programmers. This software goes beyond the state-of-the-art technologies in this space (i.e., scratch.mit.edu) in several ways: 1) It uses automated tutoring techniques to customize the educational experiences for novices, 2) it facilitates writing programs that manipulate objects and terrain in a 3D environment, 3) it allows the novice user to reprogram a popular video game, 4) it has an in-browser, WebGL-based 3D runtime environment, 5) it supports both a novice-friendly visual programming language (Blockly) as well as a text-based language (JavaScript), 6) it leverages gamification techniques such as badges, points, and unlockable items, and 7) it supports multi-user, collaborative coding. The objectives of this Phase II project concentrate on improving student experiences in order to increase customer retention and acquisition and to finish the development of a marketable product that will teach 5 million K-12 students in the next 5 years. The first objective of this project involves developing and extending the browser-embedded game engine. The second objective focuses on improving systems that match students with appropriate educational content and motivate students to continue learning. Finally, the third objective involves implementing new systems that incentivize students to create and share with the community.",

        "abstract": "This Phase II project is to the first personalized learning platform for hands-on education that works with the billions of mobile devices already in people's hands worldwide. Because the technology works on any mobile device and requires little instructor facilitation, it will be commercially successful in home settings when parents are busy and school settings where budget restrictions limit the number of facilitators. Beyond commercial impact, this project will help address the nation's need to prepare citizens for the 21st century economy, improve science literacy and help provide equal opportunities to underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). This project is an effective teaching tool because it employs personalized learning, where the content and pace of learning are optimized for the individual learner. Personalized learning has already been shown to result in higher learner engagement and increased retention of concepts in educational software. Through the use of proprietary augmented reality and adaptive learning technology, this project brings personalized learning to hands-on STEM education, enabling learners to develop problem solving skills in a more effective, engaging and lower cost way. The key innovation in this project is a single software framework combining advanced augmented reality (AR) and adaptive learning (AL) techniques to capture learners? interactions with real world objects (for example, circuit blocks, fraction bricks or chemistry models) via a mobile device camera, analyze the significance of the interactions and automatically provide personalized guidance to each learner. The system will be the first to provide a high level API above the complexity of AR and AL, allowing designers of learning experience modules to focus solely on content and user experience instead of hundreds of thousands of lines of complex code associated with AR and AL. The methods employed will be the research, design and development of the augmented reality and adaptive learning engine, its integration with three learning experience modules: circuits, fractions, basic geometry, and an evaluation of the modules. To guide the development, pilot studies utilizing A/B testing with competing approaches, pre and post assessments, and behavioral analysis of users interacting with the system will be conducted periodically.",

        "abstract": "Algal biofuels hold the promise of directly replacing fossil fuels through domestic production of renewable gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel. Before algae can be converted to fuel it must be harvested and concentrated 400fold, however, no commercial technology can perform this step cheaply enough to allow economic production of fuel from algae. The lack of a low cost algal harvesting technology is a critical roadblock preventing the commercial development of algal biofuels. This problem is being addressed through development of Manta Biofuel\u2019s low cost magnetic algae harvesting technology. The project (Phase I & II) is focused on developing equipment that can harvest algae cheaply enough so algal biofuel are directly cost competitive with fossil fuels. In Phase I we developed and successfully field tested an efficient, commercial scale magnetic algae harvester. This harvester significantly exceeded the DOE\u2019s target performance metrics. DOE\u2019s Target Performance metrics (Topic 12c) Manta Biofuel\u2019s Phase I results\nReduce algal dewatering capital cost by 2530% 76% reduction in capital cost Reduce energy consumption by 20% 89% reduction in energy consumption Produce an algae slurry of 20% solids 23% solids algae slurry was produced Our Phase II project will target a final capital cost reduction of 92.4% and a final energy consumption reduction of 93.9%. The Phase II project will refine our design to meet cost and energy metrics through data driven engineering, lab testing and field testing. We will also focus on improving reliability to the level that is needed for a commercial system. Specifically, we will target three days of continuous unmanned operation. This level of performance is critical to be competitive in the fuels industry due to the low cost of fuel. The harvester will be used commercially in Manta Biofuel\u2019s cost competitive renewable crude oil production system, ensuring that this project fulfills the SBIR program\u2019s mission of commercializing federally supported R&D. In addition, companies in wastewater treatment, nutraceuticals, and environmental remediation industries have expressed interest in purchasing this technology. Successful development through Phase II will result in an algae harvester with sufficiently\nlow cost to allow economic harvest of algae for fuel. Enabling production of renewable algal biofuel at scale will have significant public benefits. Development of renewable fuels will reduce greenhouse gas emissions that lead to global warming. It will drive the creation of sustainable jobs in rural America where biofuel production will take place. Domestically produced fuel will reduce dependence on foreign oil and help decouple US foreign policy from US energy needs. Deriving our fuel from a sustainable source will provide economic security through predictable production and prices as opposed to the boomandbust cycles that dominate fuel markets today.

        "abstract": "Keeping aging nuclear power plants in operation is crucial to the energy requirements of the United States. Monitoring and maintaining the strength and durability of concrete structures in power plants is essential for their ongoing safety and longevity. RMD is developing solidstate eddy current sensor technology with superior sensitivity, signaltonoise ratio, depth of interrogation, and spatial resolution to perform nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of concrete structures. The sensors will allow plant operators to improve the longterm operation and performance of nuclear power plants and ensure safety and reliability. The sensors developed in this program will offer superior performance to stateoftheart commercial devices and will have general utility in the NDE market. How this Problem is Being Addressed: RMD has shown that its new solidstate AMR sensors for eddy current test (ECT) and NDE outperform current commercial NDE technologies. RMD will work with its industrial partners to capitalize on the unique ability to detect deeply buried, defects and develop this technology into a commercial product. Phase I Results: Using both theoretical modeling and experimentation, RMD has developed new sensors, electronics and software that have the capability to provide superior, high reliability NDE. The probes will be compatible with existing NDE instruments. Phase I demonstrated that the new sensors can detect defects in metal reinforcement rods beneath the surface, similar to the rods and posttensioning tendons used in today\u2019s concrete structures, and that the approach offers significant advantages including high sensitivity, good spatial resolution, extended depth capability, and the potential for less complex and more costeffective sensors for ECT and NDE. Phase II Plans: The Phase II program will complete the research and development of RMD\u2019s novel NDT technology for inspecting nuclear power plant infrastructure. RMD will continue the theoretical modelling to optimize the AMR sensor design and system configuration in order to provide better capabilities than the technology that is currently available for detecting defects in components encased in concrete. RMD will further develop specialized data collection and analysis algorithms, design and build electronic circuitry, and develop a 2D mechanical scanning system. The end result will be a selfcontained prototype that can be demonstrated in the field. Commercial Applications: The solidstate ECT probes will be more sensitive, have higher signaltonoise ratio, scan faster, and provide more reliable detection of smaller defects than existing technologies. The proposed sensor arrays will be compatible with existing ECT equipment, ensuring rapid acceptance in the marketplace. The markets we will target include power generation, highway infrastructure and transportation, oil drilling, utility pipes and natural gas pipelines.

        "abstract": "Second generation biorefiners must be able to accept and process the full range of regionally relevant biomass sources, including hardwoods, softwoods, and a rapidly expanding number of herbaceous species (corn, miscanthus, switchgrass, sorghum, etc). Comminution technologies are needed that can process dry, green, and high moisture baled herbaceous biomass into millimeterscale feedstock particles. In addition, systems to feed biomass into comminution equipment need to accommodate bulk field chopped biomass, round bales, and large rectangular bales. This project will develop a low energy rotary shear comminution system to make millimeterscale particles for use in biochemical and thermochemical conversion platforms. In the DOE SBIR Phase I and II projects, we demonstrated the technical feasibility of a paradigmchanging rotary shearing comminution technology that enables efficient milling of high moisture and green biomass all the way to final millimeterscale particle size BEFORE drying when drying is needed and WITHOUT drying when high moisture feedstocks are desired. The new rotary shearing technology is an alternative to conventional hammermills for preprocessing wood chips and debaled herbaceous biomass into feedstocks for conversion to biofuels, biochemicals, and bioproducts. Phase I and II results demonstrate that the proposed rotary shearing technology can produce similar particle sizes to a hammermill on high moisture feedstocks, but with higher flowability and with a fraction of the comminution energy. Our Phase IIB project will entail design, building, and testing of a commercialscale and quality rotaryshearing comminution system having a design capacity of 7.5 tons per hour with wood chips and at least 5 tons per hour with lowerdensity herbaceous materials. The comminution system will be designed in cooperation with launch customers and production tested at their facilities. Additional specification support will be provided by national laboratory to ensure the equipment can be integrated into their user facility for testing in direct comparison with the industry standard debaler and commercialscale hammermill. Process economics will be evaluated against the DOE base cases for each feedstock and conversion pathway. Commercial deployment of rotaryshearing biomass comminution systems will improve the net energy balance of cellulosic biofuels and bioproducts, thus reducing the contribution of these industries to greenhouse gas emissions. This technology enables processing of high moisture and \u201cwet bale\u201d biomass to increase utilization of available biomass resources and reduce process wastes. Key Words: biofuel, biomass, biorefinery, feedstock, size reduction.

Diluteburn engines are an attractive solution to developing\nmore energy efficient and environmentally friendly passenger vehicles; however, ignition instability\nassociated with dilute mixtures prevents widespread application3. A U.S. made, lowenergy nonthermal\nplasma ignition system demonstrated in Phase I to enable diluteburn engines will have a major impact and could result in a reduction in NOx emissions over 50% and fuel savings up to $80 billion/year in the U.S., while impacting more than 10,000 lives and reducing CO2 emissions. The system also has the potential to extend spark plug lifetime, which is critical when evaluating advanced ignition techniques and is the focus of this Phase II grant. A novel lowenergy nanosecond pulsed ignition system was advanced from TRL5 to TRL6 during the Phase I grant, and was shown to reliably ignite dilute mixtures. The system developed in Phase II will provide a solution to two critical problems for both heavyduty natural gas and gasoline engine manufacturers (e.g. Ford, Caterpillar, etc.), improving both fuel economy and extending spark plug lifetime, which will accelerate the adoption timeline of a product that would enable a significant leap in the performance of next generation of fuel efficient vehicles. The system demonstrated in Phase I will be developed to deliver increased voltage and repetition rates to increase diluteburn stability, and a control system based on a feedback loop will be developed to avoid spark breakdown. This will be the first time that a control system has been developed for a nanosecond pulsed ignition system to avoid spark breakdown and minimize energy delivered to the spark plug while optimizing combustion performance, and it is expected to reduce spark plug service intervals by more than a factor of two compared to highenergy thermal ignition systems. This is especially critical for applications such as stationary power generation where taking an engine out of service to change spark plugs every 16 weeks costs over $10K/hour. During Phase II, existing relationships with engine research facilities and engine manufacturers will provide additional financial support, expertise and experience to develop and optimize the ignition system to meet market needs. The preproduction prototype developed during Phase II will be licensed to ignition system Tier 1 suppliers in Phase III for manufacture and use in spark ignition engines.

        "abstract": "Future nuclear power plant designs call for large numbers of metallic fuel pins made from uranium alloys. Existing methods for casting these pins are very slow and costly. This project aims to enable largescale production of metallic nuclear fuel by developing an innovative continuous casting process. We are developing a continuous casting method that uses innovative process equipment, instrumentation, and control algorithms to produce precision metal fuel pins at very low cost and with metallurgical properties that are optimal for nuclear fuel. We designed and built a facility for demonstrating the casting process, designed and built mechanisms that enable precise process control, and designed, built, and/or obtained critical components needed for continuous casting at a high rate. Phase II (still under way) will conclude by demonstrating that we can produce metallic pins at a high linear casting rate with the fine, equiaxed grain structure needed for good irradiation performance. We propose to augment Phase II by developing the technologies and processes needed to meet commercial requirements for metallic fuel pins. Technical objectives will be to: (1) produce pins that meet commercial dimensional requirements, (2) extend the existing process to enable continuous production of many multiple pins, (3) develop robotic technology for pin cutting and handling, (4) establish quality control procedures, and (5) begin to transfer the technology from current simulated fuel materials to UZr alloys. The work plan calls for modifying the Phase II casting facility to enable augmented capabilities; running pin casting experiments using CuNi alloys to achieve high rates of pin production while meeting dimensional requirements; designing and assembling robotic hardware for steady production and handling of multiple pins from a single crucible of molten material; developing inspection methods to validate the fabrication approach and establish quality control procedures; and beginning work to develop the necessary hightemperature materials that will enable casting pins from UZr alloys. The primary commercial application will be production of metallic fuel pins for prototype and commercial nuclear power plants. The public benefit will be a lowcost, reliable source of electric power that is produced by safe and environmentally benign power plants. The technology we develop for precision control of the continuous casting process will also enable production of a wide range of metallic components for commercial applications, and can also be used for edgedefined, filmfed growth of crystals.

Biomass represents an abundant, renewable fuel source with significant unrealized potential to supplant nonrenewable fossil fuels in providing for the Nation\u2019s energy needs. Combustors are typically fabricated from low cost steels, which do not achieve acceptable lifetimes in biomass combustion applications. Interest has been expressed in novel, lowcost approaches for fireside surface modifications of the base metal that will provide the desired thermal and chemical resistances. General statement of how this problem is being addressed: Identify and develop corrosionresistant coatings for the inner surfaces of biomass combustors to provide the necessary resistance to high temperatures (600900 \u00b0C) and corrosion from attack by alkali halides and water. Demonstrate the capability of pulsed electrodeposition to fabricate high performance, long life coatings, with scaleup to coating electrodeposition and testing of combustor bodies on a demonstration scale.\nWhat was done in Phase I? Phase I demonstrated a cost effective, scalable, flexible manufacturing process for application of highquality coatings to low cost materials for improved lifetime and durability during operation of biocombustors. Specifically, a range of coating compositions of cobaltnickel with chromemolybdenumiron were deposited onto 1\u201dx4\u201d coupons, and surpassed a 500 hr accelerated high temperature corrosion test. A preliminary analysis showed that pulsed electrodeposition is economically\nviable for production of a NiCr coating that has the potential to greatly improve biocombustor component\nlifetime. What is planned for the Phase II project? 1) Optimize cobaltnickel with chromemolybdenumiron\ncoatings on lowalloy materials to meet the performance specifications of biomass combustors, specifically longterm adhesion and corrosion resistance in relevant high temperature environments, 2) Demonstrate enhanced corrosion resistance compared to the base alloy in relevant environments, 3) Build an alphascale prototype and coat biomass combustor parts to demonstrate scalability, 4) Design a system for processing multiple geometries, and 5) Update the economic analysis and continue commercialization\nefforts. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Economical application of corrosionresistant alloy coatings to biomass combustors has the potential to facilitate enhanced economics and utilization of biomass as an energy source. Improved combustor technology will decrease the costofownership; integration with other technological advances would presumably increase the extractible energy per mass\nof fuel, further enhancing costeffectiveness. The technology has the potential to facilitate a transition of\nlargescale electrical generation to renewable biomass. The potential global market for generation (steadily increasing from 14.6 petawatthours of fossilfired generation in 2011) is substantial. Key Words  alloy coatings; electrodeposition; biomass combustors; renewable resource, manufacturing Summary for Members of Congress: This project will develop an economical method for applying corrosionresistant coatings to the inner surface of chambers for burning wood, grass, straw, and other plant matter. These coatings will increase the lifetime of the burners, decreasing the cost of ownership for biomass combustion equipment.",

Significant effort has been exerted to develop costeffective nearequilibrium ammonothermal (NEAT) growth of bulk GaN crystals; however, due to extreme hardness and chemical stability, a lowcost wafering process for bulk GaN crystals has not been established yet. Currently, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) to achieve a damagefree, atomicallyflat wafer surface is so inefficient that ~150 hours are required to finish the surface. To achieve a time and cost efficient process to make the surface epiready, we need to develop a wafer shaping process which minimizes subsurface damage and therefore CMP time. This project develops a novel grinding method called EGriniding, which creates a smoother surface with reduced damage using less processing time than the conventional polishing process. During Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of EGrinding by achieving a mirrorlike surface (RMS roughness ~2 nm) and very thin subsurface damage layer (~0.5 \u03bcm, achievement goal was 1 \u03bcm) on 10 x 10 mm GaN wafers. In Phase II, we will expand the wafer size to 2\"\" and incorporate EGrinding to achieve a more than 30% reduction in wafering time. SixPoint is the leading company in GaN boule growth, therefore we can incorporate the EGrinding into our production process without any business obstacles. The successful development of a lowcost wafering process will lead tolowcost, lowdefect GaN substrates needed for energyrelated applications such as power electronic switches and solidstate lighting.

        "abstract": "The quest to understand dark matter is one of the major activities in modern particle physics and astrophysics. It is widely believed that dark matter is composed of a new type of subatomic particle that is not yet well understood. An important discovery in this area is the annual modulation signal measured using sodium iodide scintillation crystals deep in an underground laboratory in Italy. While this result runs contrary to the findings of some other experiments that utilized different methods, there are also some recent results that support the findings. Therefore, there is a clear need for confirmation of the experiments. A new sodium iodide experiment with lower radioactivity background levels would have a higher sensitivity that could confirm or refute the annual modulation result. The goal of this project is to develop sodium iodide detectors with considerably lower background. This is being accomplished by intensive purification of the raw materials, followed by special processes for crystal growth and detector fabrication. In the Phase I project, considerable progress was made in the purification and crystal growth aspects, which demonstrates the feasibility of the approach. Unprecedented low levels of radioactive impurities were achieved in large sodium iodide. Scintillation properties of the highpurity sodium iodide crystals were also found to be suitable for dark matter experiments. The proposed Phase II project will follow the approach demonstrated in Phase I and scale it up for the full size detectors that are needed. Prototype dark matter detectors will be built with the necessary purity and components to provide suitable performance for the annual modulation experiments to be replicated with even better sensitivity. The scientific impact of this result will be significant in furthering the understanding of a fundamental mystery in modern physics and cosmology. The availability of highpurity sodium iodide crystals will enable several largescale dark matter experiments that are under development worldwide.",

        "abstract": "The problem being addressed in this proposal is the current extensive use of energy hungry hot water heaters in both residential and commercial building in the United States. To date, attempts to create a low energy hybrid hot water heater (HWH) have resulted in hot water heaters that have high differential prices and significant noise and maintenance issues resulting in low sales and low value perception. This Phase IIB Sequential project would continue the development of Xergy\u2019s next generation of low cost, no noise, and high efficiency hybrid hot water heaters which will be suitable for commercial adoption. Xergy Inc. directed by Principal Investigator, William Parmelee is proposing the following project: \u201cAdvanced Hybrid Waterheater using ECC\u201d, under DOE TOPIC NO.: 03c. Phase I successfully created a New (Electrochemical) Compressor suitable for a 50 gallon Hybrid Hot Water System, that is more efficient than current mechanical compressors and that is also, noiseless, vibration free, modular and scalable utilizing nonGHG refrigerant (water). In Phase II the goal is to create a High Fidelity heat pump hybrid hot water heater in conjunction with General Electric (GE) containing an Electro Chemical Compressor (ECC). Xergy determined in Phase II that while the initial water based vapor phase compression cycle powered by an electrochemical compressor is technically viable; shifting to a metal hydride/Hydrogen sorption/desorption cycle will provide superior performance and reduce the size of the required compressor. Phase IIB In Phase IIB Sequential, Xergy proposes the development of an optimized integrated metal hydride/heat exchanger based heat pump system for a HWH. The key parameter controlling the efficiency of the system is the heat transfer between the hydride and the exterior of the heat exchanger. The need for this product is very clear. More than 70% of electric demand is utilized in buildings, and approximately 15% of residential electric demand is for hot water production. Anything that will reduce that individual subunit demand will significantly reduce our total energy demand, emissions and our dependence on foreign energy sources. This product would also reduce the use of GHG refrigerant, resulting in substantial environmental benefits. Utilizing this technology, would have farreaching positive effects on the HWH market by increasing market penetration for Hybrid units. This is a disruptive and transformational technology that in addition to the target of HHWH could be modified to other applications very easily and quickly for the following appliances: wine chillers, electronic cooling: basically anything that needs cooling above zero C. Keywords: compressors, compressor membranes, GE, hybrid hot water heaters, energy efficient hot water heaters, energy efficiency. This project entails the development of a compressor which can be used to drastically reduce the energy requirements for hot water heaters in the United States.

        "abstract": "Laser plasma accelerators (LPA) enabled by the Tm laser driver to be developed by this project offer much reduced size and cost compared to conventional accelerators of the same energy. This would drastically cut the cost of highenergy particle research on colliderbased facilities and advanced light sources. Planned conventional accelerators (e.g., for the proposed International Linear Collider) would be 25 miles long. LPA hold the promise of making possible a lowcost tabletop accelerator with particle energies in the tens of GeV range such. The proposed 2micron Tm laser technology offers to advance LPA of nuclear particles, thus replacing the traditional mammothsize and costly accelerator research facilities with roomsize systems. The advantages of 2micron lasers over their more developed 0.8micron and 1micron counterparts is in 4 to times improved particle trapping by ponderomotive force, thus enhancing the acceleration process. Compactness and relative simplicity of laser accelerators promises to greatly reduce the cost and timelines of highenergy research, and to advance new scientific discoveries. With energetic particle affordable for universities, commercial laboratories (e.g., semiconductor material development), and hospitals, the US would be able to maintain its technological leadership. The proposed project will leverage the ultrafast laser technology known as edge pumped disk laser (EPDL), which Aqwest previously developed for the US Army, thus benefiting from previous US government investment. In Phase I, we conducted engineering design, proofofconcept analysis, and fabricated a novel Tmdoped laser ceramic. In Phase II, we will fabricate and test laser gain elements, and construct and test a Stage 1 of a 2stage multipass amplifier for the driver laser. An eyesafe 2 \u03bcm Tmbased EPDL (especially pulsed) also has major commercial applications ranging from laser material processing (especially cutting and welding plastics) to remote sensing, biological tissue surgery in vivo, remote sensing, lidar, infrared countermeasures, and optical communication.

        "abstract": "The future of high energy particle physics and Xray light sources for biological and material research require miniaturized linear accelerators that at present cannot be qualified using existing methods. Such miniaturized linear accelerates will be instrumental in managing the cost of future accelerator facilities. There is presently no suitable diagnostic for ensuring RF breakdowns are minimized during the commissioning stage of these miniaturized linacs. In response to this shortcoming, RadiaBeam proposes to develop and build an automated singleshot gratingbased spectrometer working in the terahertz regime of these new miniaturized linacs. Such a device will be capable of measuring the presence of an RF breakdown event and will be used as a feedback mechanism in the commissioning of these linacs. Such grating spectrometers exist in the visible and infrared regimes but recent advances in materials science and detector technology make this scheme extendable to the regime of interest on a costeffective basis. A proofofprinciple spectrometer was developed and tested with bench top sources. After calibration and bench testing, the spectrometer was used in the successful qualification of a terahertz linac at Facility for Advanced Accelerator Experimental Tests (FACET) beamline at SLAC. The shortcomings of the proofofconcept device and potential additions were identified. Building on the success of the prooforprinciple demonstration, RadiaBeam will design and deploy a narrow band and wideband spectrometer for general THz instrumentation and terahertz linac qualification. The resulting spectrometers will be full commercial devices and will be tested at the THz test stand at the advanced Photon Source, and as an advanced RFBD diagnostic at MIT during the commissioning of a nextgeneration terahertz linac. The proposed spectrometer will allow advancement of miniaturized terahertz linacs, allowing miniaturization of many future DOE accelerator facilities.

An important step for this electrification is the development of more cost effective, longer lasting, and more abusetolerant rechargeable batteries. Due to their low thermal and chemical stability, and low resistance to oxidation, current polymerbased battery separators have difficulties in meeting the increasingly stricter requirements for electric vehicle application. A groundbreaking breakthrough in battery separator technology is needed to address this formidable challenge. Leveraging our technical leadership on the preparation and processing of ceramic nanowires, we are developing a new generation high performance battery separator by using ceramic nanowires through a low cost manufacturing process. Our nanowire battery separator will provide lithium ion batteries with high safety, high energy density, long term stability, and high power density for various electric vehicle applications. We have successfully fabricated the world\u2019s first flexible ceramic nanowire battery separators, and have demonstrated their high safety, long time stability and superior electrochemical performance at full cell level. All the key concepts have been experimentally validated. We will overcome any technical barriers to the large scale and low cost production and commercialization of our ceramic nanowire battery separators. And also we will fabricate high performance large format lithiumion pouch cells to convince battery manufacturers to adopt our ceramic nanowire separators for their electric vehicle battery use. The overall market for lithium rechargeable battery separators is expected to reach $3 billion in 2020, mainly driven by the demand for electric vehicles. The successful commercialization of this advanced nanowire separator technology will generate significant economic gains to the States as well as new employment for US workers. The adoption of this high safety battery separator technology will partially cure the public fear to the safety concern of lithium rechargeable batteries in electric vehicles, and help their fast and wide adoption in various electronic vehicles by automobile manufacturers. The large scale adoption of electric vehicles will reduce environmental pollution, improve air quality, improve human health, and reduce health care cost. Key Words: nanowire, ceramic, membrane, separator, battery, high safety, high energy density, long term stability, high power density.

The integration will allow for automation of the fluid domain mesh, assignment of boundary conditions, and coupling of the fluid solver to the thermal solver. As a consequence, there will be no increase in the user burden of running a thermal solution when the fluid solver is added. The technique demonstrated during Phase I for fast and accurate Temperature Emissivity Separation analysis will be implemented in existing Temperature Emissivity Separation codes. Both the fluid solver and Temperature Emissivity Separation techniques will be tested to validate their operation and to determine limiting factors in scene modeling and accuracy. The design and performance evaluation of vehicles, electronics, machinery, and protective clothing require accurate predictions of the heat transfer due to convection. The proposed fluid solver will make thermal analyses fast enough to become an integral part of modern, rapid turnaround design processes. This will lead companies to develop products that are more reliable, more durable, more energy efficient, and operate with improved performance. The proposed work will also reduce errors in temperature and emissivity retrieval from hyperspectral images. This technology can be applied to the monitoring of nuclear proliferation activities and to other remote sensing tasks including the mapping of natural resources, oil and gas exploration, security and border patrol applications, and public health monitoring.

        "abstract": "Reducing the size, weight, and increasing the efficiency of automotive traction power inverters requires the development of novel high voltage, high current silicon carbide high speed rectifiers, since the existing silicon technology is severely limited in terms of operating temperature, frequency and energy efficiency. However, the non-optimized device and manufacturing technology currently used for silicon carbide power diode fabrication results in higher energy losses and a noncompetitive price point with respect to silicon. How is the problem being addressed? Novel device and process technology in combination with the use of a high volume manufacturing strategy on large diameter silicon carbide wafers is proposed in this proposed program for achieving near theoretical device performance on high current power Schottky rectifiers. The proposed device and manufacturing strategies will drastically reduce the manufacturing costs for silicon carbide Schottky diodes, making them costcompetitive with the existing silicon technology. What was done in Phase I: Phase I was focused on developing and optimizing the device and layout designs necessary to scale up the rated current of the silicon carbide Schottky rectifiers to 100 Amperes. A major task involved transferring the process technology to a largescale, high volume foundry identified in the proposal. A pilot wafer lot was implemented at the large volume foundry and the device performance was benchmarked against the current state of the art. What is planned for Phase II: Phase II will be focused on increasing the current rating of the diodes to 200 Amperes, while focusing on the 900 Volt market segment as required for automotive applications. Detailed reliability investigations pursuant to the industry standards is planned for Phase II. A detailed commercialization strategy will also be implemented during Phase II Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Electric vehicle power electronics manufacturers such as General Motors, Delphi Automotive and Cummins Power Systems are expected to be direct customers of the proposed silicon carbide devices to be developed in this program. Reducing the weight of the power module, which represents 23% of the total Inverter weight will extend its electric range and/or reduce the size and cost of the battery. Significantly reduced silicon carbide chipsizes for the same current rating along with lowcost, high volume manufacturing strategies proposed in this program will help meet the aggressive power electronics targets set for the electric vehicle industry by the DOE for the year 2022. This in turn will enhance the country\u2019s energy security by reducing dependence on foreign oil, save money by cutting fuel costs for American families and businesses, and result in a cleaner environment by reducing harmful CO2 emissions from gas powered vehicles.

        "abstract": "As new applications arise for supercritical CO2 (sCO2) power generation, and higher efficiencies are achieved through higher system pressures and temperatures, the need to improve technologies becomes essential. Traditionally lubricated and cooled oil bearings cannot tolerate these temperatures, and the higher pressures makes keeping the oil separate from the sCO2 an increasingly difficult challenge. These conditions strongly promote using the sCO2 as the lubricant, rather than oil. This grant application seeks to develop a new gas foil bearing that meets these needs by using the sCO2 as the lubricating fluid by substantially advancing the art to provide increased load capacity, damping, and wear resistance. To achieve project objectives, best in class technologies in pressurized hydrostatic gas bearings and hydrodynamic gas foil bearings will be combined to produce an advanced hydrostatically assisted hydrodynamic gas bearing design. Analytical models and codes were updated to include the fluid properties of sCO2. Novel bump foil geometries and patterns were evaluated to maximize stiffness and damping characteristics. Candidate coatings were evaluated for start stop wear resistance. Prototype bearings were fabricated and installed in a high speed test rig for validation testing (using air) of hydrostatic and hydrodynamic performance. Refinement of the analytical models will continue in order to predict bearing performance using sCO2 as the working fluid. Design data will be obtained from sCO2 machinery OEMs (including a major OEM collaborator) as a basis for generating full scale bearing designs. Foil and hydrostatic pocket geometries will be optimized for the larger bearings. Prototypes will be designed, fabricated, and validation tested in a representative sCO2 environment. The proposed effort directly supports both commercial and federal interests. Foil bearings are an enabling technology which allows the creation of machines that otherwise could not be built, particularly in high speed machines or in ultrapure systems like sCO2 where contaminants, such as oil or grease, cannot be tolerated. Advancements in the technology can be immediately utilized in a variety of applications ranging from sCO2 systems, ground based gas turbine powered electric power generators, compressors, refrigeration equipment, vehicular systems (turbochargers, fuel cell blowers), aerospace environmental control systems, auxiliary power units, small to medium propulsion gas turbines, and rocket turbo pumps. Key Words: Supercritical CO2, gas foil bearings, oil free bearings, hydrodynamic bearings, hydrostatic bearings, turbo expander, compressor, high temperature bearings, high pressure bearings. This project will develop an advanced foil bearing using high pressure/ temperature sCO2 as the lubricating fluid. This will enable the development of more efficient power generation equipment, resulting in energy savings with its reduction in fossil fuel consumption and associated Greenhouse Gas emissions, and will produce jobs in the U.S. bearing industry.",

        "abstract": "The DOE High Energy Physics Accelerator Technology subprogram supports the development of new particle accelerators to enable discovery science in high\u2010energy physics, and through accelerator stewardship works to make accelerator technology widely available to science and industry. The DOE High Energy Physics (HEP) program was created to understand how our universe works at its most fundamental level. Breakthroughs resulting from the program have broad applicability in areas as diverse as science, medicine, industry, and homeland security. Yet despite the recognized importance of accelerators, creating advances in this field has been hindered by the lack of effective computational tools. Designing new systems is extremely complex, and the current workflow is difficult to use, prone to error, and does not effectively use high performance computing and other resources. A customizable software application based on the Computational Model Builder (CMB) for accelerator modeling and simulation is being developed to address the needs of multi\u2010physics workflows. CMB is an open\u2010source framework designed to support the creation of customized applications for numerical simulations. CMB will be extended for advanced accelerator design, simulation, and optimization by supporting multi\u2010physics workflows, enabling simple management of high performance computing resources, and tight integration across pre\u2010processing, simulation, and post\u2010processing tasks using scalable computing architectures. Phase I focused on providing an end\u2010to\u2010end application for defining electromagnetic simulations based on the Omega3P simulation module, one of six multi\u2010physics modules provided by ACE3P (Advanced Computational Electromagnetics 3D Parallel) analysis suite. The application was successfully executed on the NERSC HPC systems, including final post\u2010processing of the results. In Phase II we propose extending this work to support all of the ACE3P modules resulting in an end user system capable of fully supporting multi\u2010physics simulations for high\u2010energy accelerator systems as well as improving its ease of use. In addition, this work will improve the utilization of DOE\u2019s HPC resources by incorporating in situ visualization techniques into the simulation environment. Particle accelerators are essential to scientific discovery as they advance our understanding of the fundamental properties of matter, energy, space, and time. Opportunities exist to design new accelerators, which can promote innovation and develop new products and services. Because the system developed here is being released as open\u2010source software, the resulting work will facilitate the creation of extended research communities, and provide a commercialization strategy based on services and customization.

        "abstract": "The simulation of magnetically confined plasmas requires considering multiple overlapping scales. Continuum models address reactor scale behaviors, while particle methods capture fine scale behavior. The complex combination of physics and reactor geometry results in simulations involving massive calculations and data sets, which can only be executed on parallel computers. Thus, there is a critical need for effective methods that can execute coupled simulations with fully parallel representations, and computations, at both the continuum and particle level with specific consideration of the ability to perform validation with experimentally measured data. The goal of this project is to develop structures and tools for multiscale plasma simulations that provide a parallel mesh and particle infrastructure, data analysis operations to support validation, geometry and meshing methods, methods for scalably coupled mesh and particle operations, and a user interface for specification of the fusion plasma simulation workflows. What was done in Phase I: A parallel mesh with particles infrastructure was defined and implemented including the procedures needed to support particle simulations. Preliminary support for particle simulations were added to a fusion plasma code using these methods. Data analysis methods have been initiated to support verification, validation and quantity of interest evaluation. The fusion device mesh generation procedure had been extended and a graphical user interface added. What was planned for Phase II Project? The parallel mesh with particle infrastructure will continue to be advanced with emphasis on using it to full advantage in two fusion plasma codes accounting for the needs of many core and accelerator supported nodes on massively parallel systems. This will include the full implementation of the new partitioning method defined in Phase I. The data analysis methods will be expanded to support the execution of uncertainty quantification operations. Mesh generation methods for stellarator devices will be developed.

        "abstract": "For use in congested traffic, start stop vehicle technology (microhybrid) offers the promise of significant increases in fuel economy and reduction of pollutant emissions, without large increase in the vehicle sales price. A key enabling component of the start stop system is the battery. Present start stop systems employ lead acid batteries because of their low initial cost and excellent low temperature performance, but these batteries suffer from life limitations especially when subjected to repeated deep cycling and high charge rates. Consequently, alternate battery systems with improved life characteristics are the key to enable widespread adoption of start stop vehicles. Liion technology is the leading candidate to replace lead acid batteries in start stop systems and several battery companies have announced Liion batteries for start stop applications. However, most Liion battery systems offered today suffer from one or more disadvantages such as poor low temperature performance, poor high rate charge acceptance, or high cost relative to lead acid batteries. This is at least in part because the materials in these batteries are not optimized for the specific requirements of start stop applications. TIAX is developing Liion technology for start stop applications that overcomes the limitations of the current Liion systems by tailoring its proprietary CAM7 cathode material for use opposite lithium titanate anode (LTO) anode in pouch cells that provide excellent cold cranking capability, elevated temperature stability, cycle life and safety for 12V start stop batteries. In Phase I, TIAX showed that CAM7 cathode/LTO anode pouch cell technology provides excellent 30 \u00b0C cold cranking capability and elevated temperature stability (without pouch cell gassing/swelling), that the performance could be improved by CAM7 material modifications that specifically targeted the start/stop implementation, and that CAM7 cells had superior performance to competing cathodes. In Phase II we will optimize the CAM7 material and the cathode and anode electrode designs for the 12V start stop battery application. We will develop a cell design for 12V start stop batteries based on automobile company input and our internal results. We will assemble scaled versions of these cells into 12V modules that achieve USABC 12V start stop vehicle battery stability and scaled power and energy targets, and we will demonstrate the excellent abuse tolerance of these cells under standard thermal, electrical and mechanical abuse tests. The TIAX start stop battery technology will facilitate widespread commercialization of start stop microHEVs by enhancing the available energy, dynamic charge acceptance, and life of Liion batteries used in microHEVs. Rapid, widespread adoption of affordable microHEVs in traffic congested areas of the country can yield benefits including reduced adverse health impacts from pollution in urban and other high traffic areas, reduced adverse environmental and economic impacts of global warming, and reduced economic impacts of fluctuations in global petroleum supply and price. Key Words Start stop vehicle battery, microhybrid vehicle battery, lithiumion. TIAX is developing low cost microhybrid vehicle battery technology that will facilitate widespread commercialization of start stop vehicles by presenting a compelling value proposition for drivers in congested traffic areas. This will reduce the fuel consumption and pollutant emission associated with idling in traffic, yielding public health, environmental quality, and economic benefits.",

        "abstract": "Siliconbased detectors are central to all modern particle physics collider experiments. The functional area of these systems has increased from a few square centimeters in the mid80s to 200 square meters for the CMS tracker in the early 2000s. Upgrades being considered for the high luminosity LHC will require more than 200 square meters for CMS and ATLAS experiments and over 600 square meters for the proposed CMS High Granularity Calorimeter. In spite of this huge increase, silicon sensors are still being made on 4\" or 6\" wafers; building them on larger wafers would reduce both overall cost and the number of modules needed. The sensors must also be radiation hard, which implies thin (~100 micron) sensitive regions to minimize bias voltage. Producing thin, large area sensors is a significant challenge that must be solved for the next generation of trackers. Tezzaron proposes to develop the capability to produce thin silicon detectors with large area (200mm) wafers at its wholly owned subsidiary foundry, Novati Technologies, in Texas. This effort extends work currently underway, funded by the DoE Phase I grant, that has demonstrated baseline production of sensors for the CMS tracker and High Granularity Calorimeter. Phase I incorporates designs from Fermilab, SLAC, and Argonne. In Phase II Tezzaron will use designs developed in collaboration with other groups coordinated by Fermilab. We will demonstrate the production of thin, large area, radiation hard sensors with enhanced polysilicon bias resistors and AC coupled strips incorporating MIM capacitors. Beyond improving the baseline process, Tezzaron will create a Product Development Kit (PDK) to enable widespread user adoption and support. In Phase I, Tezzaron fabricated sensor prototypes on six wafers processed with variations in implant, wafer thickness, and thinning processes. Earlier work was improved upon by adding a Pstop to the designs and wafer processing flow. The results are good except for low breakdown voltage from one of the thinning techniques employed. We believe we have identified the root cause, and will address it in future work. Tezzaron intends to support the HEP community and, in future, to apply the technology to commercial applications like digital Xray and PET scanners. The Product Development Kit (PDK) planned as part of Phase II will allow less sophisticated users to exploit the newly developed sensor technology, permitting more widespread commercial adoption, especially by small and medium enterprises. Key words Silicon sensors, accelerator, silicon, detector, SPM. The project will develop a domestic commercial source of advanced silicon detectors for use in research applications such as particle accelerators and in medical and industrial devices such as PET scanners and digital Xray equipment.",

        "abstract": "Modern fuel cells have been in development since the 1960s and stand on the cusp of commercialization, but are held back by high manufacturing costs and expensive catalysts. Membrane costs alone can account for as much as 45% of the total cost of a commercial fuel cell system. Furthermore, manufacturing defects in the membrane can cascade into complete stack failure, which is expensive and time consuming to resolve. These defects are often not discovered until costly catalyst has been irreversibly applied and the MEA is fully assembled, leading to additional wasted materials and\na slow correction of the coating process. To achieve large scale commercialization, fuel cell manufacturing needs a high efficiency, real time quality control system that can provide 100% inspection of the membrane at coating speeds up to 60 ft/min. Statement of how this problem or situation is being addressed Mainstream\u2019s approach uses nearUV/Vis light to infer membrane film thickness, composition, and defects with a single detector, light source, and pair of cross polarizers. Mainstream\u2019s Cross Polarized NearUV/Vis (CPNUVV) system simultaneously measures membrane thickness and determines and quantifies membrane defects in real time at rolltoroll coating speeds. This information can be relayed\nto a printer to mark defective membranes, allowing exclusion from catalyst coating as well as rapid feedback to correct the membrane coating process. Our approach enables two measurements to be performed with a single low cost detector and light source with no moving parts. In Phase I, Mainstream proved technology feasibility, developing the detector to a TRL 5 and demonstrating it on a membrane web line at speeds up to 100 ft/min. In Phase II, Mainstream will further develop the detector to a TRL 7, increase the resolution and operation speed, and demonstrate it on high speed rolltoroll membrane web lines. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits the CPNUVV Detector will help drive down costs and increase reliability of fuel cell membranes which are often still too expensive to compete with conventional power technologies. The early detection of defective membranes allows their removal before further coating or assembly steps, reducing costs by minimizing wasteful use of expensive platinum catalyst, labor used to construct stack materials, and\ndefective returns from the customer. The CPNUVV Detector is not limited to fuel cell membranes and other membrane processes can benefit from improved quality control devices.

        "abstract": "Due to the high cost and complexity of high power radio frequency (HPRF) heating systems, which require high power gyrotrons or klystrons, associated power supplies, wave guides and vacuum systems, they are rarely available for the small scale Validation Platform Experiments (VPEs). The charter for the small scale VPE community is to advance our level of knowledge in plasma physics and control to support the larger tokomak experiments and the entrance into the burning plasma era. Significant progress in transport, instability control and the underlying plasmas physics could be gained if the VPE community had access to high power RF heating systems at costs that can be supported under current funding levels. General Statement of How This Problem is Being Addressed: Eagle Harbor Technologies, Inc. (EHT) has created new high voltage nanosecond pulser, which combined with NLTL technology will produce a low cost, fully solid state architecture for the generation of the RF frequencies and power levels necessary for plasma heating and diagnostic systems within the VPE fusion science community. The proposed system does not require the use of vacuum tube technology, is inherently lower cost, and is more robust the traditional high power RF heating schemes. The program will directly support the small scale validation experiments, where the new system will be demonstrated at two fusion experiments during the Phase II program. What was done in Phase I? In the Phase I program, EHT designed, built and tested a new high voltage nanosecond pulser system with two versions of NLTLs and associated RF antenna feed systems. The new system was demonstrated at EHT and confirmed to produce pulsed HPRF output at high pulse repetition frequency (100 kHz). EHT designed a new high efficiency lumped element NLTL. EHT also worked with both HITSI and antenna design consultants for integration of the HPRF onto HITSI. What is planned for the Phase II project? In the Phase II project, EHT plans to scale the HPRF system to higher output power levels and a build a demonstration unit, which will be utilized at both the HITSI and the High Beta Tokamak (HBT) experiments for testing and qualification. EHT will also continue development work on the novel high efficiency NLTL design to produce frequencies consistent with lower hybrid current drive applications. EHT will also work with RF antenna design experts and personnel at HITSI and HBT to properly match the HPRF to the launching antenna and to maximize RF coupling into the plasma. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: HPRF generation using vacuum tube based systems is widely utilized in the scientific community, military and industry. Vacuum tube technology is fully mature with little expected advancement in robustness and simplicity for these systems. There is a wide need for new technologies for RF generation which can increase capabilities while reducing cost and complexity. Additionally, the new nanosecond pulser has demonstrated utility in the creation of low temperature plasmas, which have applications in surface decontamination, materials processing, UV light generation and several novel medical applications including cancer treatment. Continued support of the nanosecond pulser technology alone could have wide ranging benefits in these areas.

        "abstract": "The economic viability of wind energy is critically dependent upon robust, long duration operation, while minimizing outages and costs for repair and ongoing maintenance. Active load mitigation offers a way to control both peak and fatigue inducing loads so as to forestall major failures, preclude costly repairs and service interruptions, and extend the life of wind turbine blades, generator components and the entire turbine system. Mitigation of loads requires some form of adaptation of the turbine to variable conditions (e.g., atmospheric turbulence, wind speed variation, turbine to turbine interaction, tower shadow), and these needs can be addressed through an application of \u201csmart\u201d materials based devices to provide on blade aerodynamic control. A novel actuation system, previously developed for onblade helicopter rotor control applications, is proposed for use on wind turbines as a means of actively mitigating excessive wind turbine loads. The device uses shape memory alloy (SMA) materials as its prime mover, is compact, low power, and robust, and can be designed as an integral member of a rotor blade or as a separate retrofit device to enhance existing wind turbine installations. Thanks to the SMA material\u2019s high resistivity, direct electric actuation is possible, and the unit is self-locking, requiring no additional power to maintain its new orientation once actuated. Applications include active load control of extended length wind turbine blades, low speed performance improvement on existing and new blade systems, and improved blade endurance and fatigue life through reduction of vibratory loads from atmospheric and upwind wind turbine turbulence. The Phase I/II research program is to understand and address the scaling issues associated with transitioning this technology from helicopter aerospace applications to wind turbine blade design and operational use (under Phase I), and then, under Phase II, execute a design/build/test program to validate the actuation concept\u2019s effectiveness at load reduction, and suggest improvements and modifications necessary to implement these actuators on both future turbine rotors and as a retrofit improvement onto existing rotors on installed turbines. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The principal immediate application of this work is to provide additional control mechanisms to improve the efficiency and reliability of wind turbine rotors and wind turbine systems. The actuator and adaptive load control system technology to be developed as part of this effort could be used for new turbine designs and also be applied to retrofit existing wind energy systems for improved performance and structural life. The net effect of their use would support reducing the operating costs of wind turbines, thereby improving their power conversion capability and enhancing their power quality.

        "abstract": "Multipactor is an incessant problem that plagues numerous commercial and military systems, including satellites and particle accelerator components such as klystrons and free electron lasers (FELs). Metallic surfaces within High Power Microwave (HPM) devices are susceptible multipactor due to the high Secondary Electron Emission Coefficient (SEEC) of internal surfaces. Current solutions, including traditional coatings such as Titanium Nitride (TiN) or use of magnetic systems to suppress SEE, are insufficient to support HPM operations at high frequencies (1 \u2013 40GHz) and high operating powers. Nokomis has developed a unique thin film material with an extremely low SEE that does not affect the performance of Radio Frequency (RF) devices. The material was successfully demonstrated through Phase I as suitable for HPM applications through testing and simulation. Under this Phase II effort, HPM devices will be coated and tested in representative environments to demonstrate the benefits and advantages of the developed technology. Nokomis will further enhance the developed DLC coating, improve the deposition methodology to accommodate closed and complex HPM device geometries, and perform in line high power high frequency testing to demonstrate performance gains. The achievement of Phase II technical objectives will position this technology for rapid commercialization, enabling the enefits of multipactor mitigation and/or suppression to be leveraged by the HPM community.

        "abstract": "The next generation of high energy physics experiments will require detectors for tracking Minimum Ionizing Particles (MIPs) at rates of >1000kHz/mm2 in a radiation environment with a neutron fluence up to 2x1016 neq/cm2. The high radiation dose must be tolerated by the sensors which must last over the experiment lifetime without repair or replacement. In addition the already achieved excellent tracking information of today\u2019s pixel detectors must be extended to cover a larger area within established power budgets. This problem is aggravated by increasing particle density and trigger rate, which tend to increase power. The High Energy Physics Community (HEP) has long adopted low power CMOS ICs for reading out semiconductor tracking detectors. But the detector and readout IC for ongoing HEP experiments are fabricated separately and connected on a per chip basis through hybridization or fine pitch wire bonding. This approach suffers from high assembly cost and is not scalable towards high volume production. The detector technology that will provide a solution to these challenges is expected to leverage existing CMOS processes and mainstream semiconductor fabrication and packaging techniques. A monolithic detector, similar to commercial CMOS image sensors in smart phones, seems to be the most viable approach. In the HEP community these detectors are referred to as Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS). In phase I we developed a pathfinder chip with a resolution of 256x256 pixels on 10micron pitch which is presently in fabrication as part of an SCI (Sensor Creations, Inc.) internal Multi Project Wafer (MPW) run. The sensor supports 2x2 binning into 20x20micron2 pixels, corresponding to a 128x128 resolution array. Analog as well as digital readout is supported for both resolutions. Digital information is generated by an end of column discriminator with programmable threshold. In phase II we will design a MAPS array with a resolution of 1024x1024 pixels on 20 micron pitch. The device will support low power onchip data reduction based on the OrthoPix architecture. The proposed device will achieve the targeted tracking rate of 100MHz/cm2. After the front side CMOS fabrication has been completed, wafers will be thinned and a common backside electrode is deposited. With a dedicated backside electrode, a strong depletion field can be created throughout the detection area leading to accurate charge collection with minimum lateral diffusion. As the accumulated radiation dose and associated device damage increase throughout the sensor lifetime, the backside bias can be increased independent of any bias constraints of the CMOS circuitry. By the end of phase II we will deliver a complete radiation tracking sensor system with a tracking rate of 100MHz/cm2. To our knowledge this will be the highest tracking rate achievable by any detector chip today. High energy physics experiments need stateofart, reliable, low cost sensors to detect and understand particles that make up matter. This proposal supports the development of such sensors through the use of everyday technology for commercial digital cameras.

        "abstract": "Heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, chromium, mercury, and cadmium have attracted significant worldwide attention for their impact on human health. To allow the efficient monitoring of such RCRA 8 heavy metal levels in water in steam electric power plants and other facilities, a precise, mobile and highly sensitive measuring instrument is required. Traditional laboratory based water analysis systems are usually costly and bulky, so not suitable for wide scale field deployment. Statement of how this problem or situation is being addressed NanoSonic\u2019s NanoCS\u00ae chemFET heavy metal sensors offer significantly improved chemical sensitivity and selectivity, and wireless communication of contaminant concentration data to fix or mobile receivers. Multiple sensor elements can be configured into a small, lightweight, low cost probe to measure all RCRA 8 heavy metal targets simultaneously, and can be configured for permanent installation or mobile testing. What was done in Phase I? During Phase I, NanoSonic proved the technical feasibility of our initial scientific hypothesis. NanoSonic demonstrated that 1) silicon nanomembranes may be used as single chemFET sensor transducers, and as individual elements in multielement chemical sensor arrays, 2) a minimum detection level of 0.01ppm\nof target material can be achieved, 3) high selectivity to specific heavy metals, such as arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, selenium and silver can be realized using different, chemically self-assembled interfaces between the sensor elements and the water being analyzed. What is planned for Phase II? During the Phase II program, NanoSonic would transition these semiconductor nanomembrane chemFET RCRA 8 sensors and probes from their current concept and prototype stage to fielded instrumentation products. Prototype sensor probes capable of measuring all RCRA 8 heavy metal concentrations would be field tested by subcontractors in multiple steam electric power plants, other manufacturing facilities, and wastewater systems. This will require a complete understanding of sensor properties and the transduction mechanism, optimization of sensor design and production processes, completion of data acquisition and signal processing hardware and software, and the development of effective approaches to calibrate manufactured sensors and compensate for cross sensitivity effects. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits Multiple small, low cost sensor probes could be distributed over an area to allow the spatial mapping of heavy metal targets and the tracking of heavy metal concentrations as they change over time. The proposed NanoCS RCRA 8 heavy metal analysis tool would be a viable commercial product for NanoSonic.

        "abstract": "Gasification technologies convert coal and biomass into synthesis gas feed streams that can either be used as a fuel for highly efficient power generation cycles or converted into value added chemicals and transportation fuels. However, coal derived synthesis gas contains a myriad of contaminants that may be egulated in power plant emissions and act as poisons for the catalysts used in downstream chemical manufacturing processes. TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) is developing a low cost, high capacity, sorbent that can remove ammonia and hydrogen cyanide (NH3 and HCN, the acid rain precursors) and the trace metal contaminants (such as mercury, arsenic and selenium) from the synthesis gas in a single process step. Unlike the commercially available gas cleanup technologies, our multi contaminant control system operates at 240oC (464oF), above the dew point of the synthesis gas; operating above the dew point improves process efficiency and reduces capital costs. During Phase II we continued to improve the performance of our sorbent. We scale dup its production using commercial manufacturing techniques, and completed a 500 cycle test to demonstrate its life and activity in a multi bed laboratory reactor. In a prototype unit, we demonstrated the viability of the technology using actual coal derived synthesis gas at the National Carbon Capture Center. We also completed a detailed engineering analysis to fully quantify the benefits of the new technology. In the Phase IIE effort, we will develop a fully automated multi contaminant removal system that is capable of treating 10 SCFM of synthesis gas. We will carry out extended tests using coal derived synthesis gas to fully the demonstrate the concept. We will carry out detailed process simulations using AspenPlusTM to accurately estimate the economic value of the new technology integrated with different gasifiers, treating synthesis gas generated from different coal (and potentially other) feedstocks. We will complete the design of a world scale system with accurate cost estimates from vendors. The use of coal derived synthesis gas in power generation is an emerging technology with significant commercial potential, because gasification based power cycles operate with much higher efficiency than conventional pulverized coal combustion plants.

This is particularly important for small modular reactors (SMRs), where BIM is needed\nto support planning, excavation, construction, commissioning, operation, maintenance, security, and regulatory\ncompliance, and thereby reduce development and planning costs, improve quality, and enhance safety.\nWhile lidar has made significant inroads in providing data for civil and building information systems, today, 3D\nlidar measurements are mostly acquired with large, expensive fixed terrestrial laser scanners. When multiple\nperspectives are needed to collect non line of sight data, fixed terrestrial systems must be moved and calibrated.\nMobile lidar systems offer the potential to generate geo-registered 3D points as the platform moves through a scene,\nenabling remote inspection of extensive areas of installation work closed off from direct visual inspection, such as\ncomplex pipework, concrete seams, and structures in hard to access locations. However, while mobile lidar systems\nhave now been commercially available for a few years, none have the performance required of BIM. Systems with\nthe requisite accuracy remain large. There is no low cost, ~1kgweight, soda can sized lidar sensor compatible with\nthe handheld, unmanned air vehicle, and unmanned ground vehicle platforms needed for mobile data acquisition.\nGENERAL STATEMENT OF HOW THIS PROBLEM IS BEING ADDRESSED: The ocular hazard regulations, along with the size, weight, and power (SWAP) constraints of mobile unmanned platforms\u2014added to the requirement to measure position and orientation with a very high degree of accuracy for the creation and geo-referencing of point clouds, over long ranges\u2014has previously made LIDAR based surveys impractical for mobile lidar systems. To address the need for accurate, high resolution, compact, mobile lidar instruments, an eye safe mobile lidar system\u2014with the geospatial position and pointing accuracy and mm scale accurate range measurements required for as built drawings\u2014is being developed, with a SWAP consistent with small autonomous platforms. WHAT WAS DONE IN PHASE I: To address the need for mobile 3D lidar instruments, and refine SMR requirements, key industry stakeholders were consulted to detail SMR project lifecycle BIM requirements, identify data product requirements, specify interfaces to BIM databases, detail database formats, and identify industry life cycle software work flows. After working with industry stakeholders, a rigorous trade study was conducted. Then, key eye safe lidar components and subsystems were demonstrated with 10m to 1km range capabilities, mm scale resolution, and highly accurate geospatial positioning, orientation, and pointing. The design was developed of a mobile lidar, optimized for rapidly obtaining geospatially accurate 3D point clouds over large areas at long range. WHAT IS PLANNED FOR THE PHASE II PROJECT: In Phase II, a compact, lightweight lidar system optimized for acquiring the mm scale accuracy 3D point cloud data required for BIM will be developed, characterized, and demonstrated in a relevant environment. The mobile lidar will be calibrated and demonstrated capable of acquiring accurate geospatial data and interfacing to data work flow software. The capabilities of the mobile lidar will then be demonstrated on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) and an unmanned air vehicle (UAV).

        "abstract": "Over the past decade, advances in shale characterization and stimulation technology have opened Hydrocarbon bearing shale to exploitation. The success of all of these plays can depend on the proper characterization of the shale reservoir. To determine if favorable composition and structure are present, it is currently necessary to conduct a number of different analyses that are time consuming and expensive. With the decline in fossil fuel prices, it has become increasingly important to develop cost effective analytical toolsets that provide an efficient integrated characterization of shale to assist oil and gas exploration. Statement of How this Problem or Situation is Being Addressed In this program we propose to develop a powerful suite of new analytical techniques derived from ion beam capabilities for direct measurement of C, H, and O content. Elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA) will be used for direct measurement of H present, and nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) to determine the amount of C and O. Determining mineral composition using particle induced Xray emission (PIXE), and ion beam induced luminescence (IL) will provide a direct and efficient process for mineral mapping. In addition a unique approach will be added through the utilization of the nuclear microprobe and Heion microscopy (HIM) for imaging organic matter and rock fabric, analyzing the spatial distribution of hydrocarbons and assessing the abundance and types of micro porosity to provide an estimate of organic carbon transformation, thermal maturity, and the expected hydrocarbon type (dry gas, liquid rich gas, or oil). Under the project, Amethyst Research Inc. is developing an ionbeam analysis technology as a one stop solution to advanced characterization of shale, and providing low risk productivity assessment for shale reservoirs. What was Done in Phase I: In Phase I the feasibility of direct measurement of H, C, bulk mineralogy and elemental contents by ion beam analysis has been demonstrated as a single chamber one stop analytical solution. The analytical techniques have been found unique in providing quantitative elemental distribution with spatial variation. What is Planned for Phase II: In Phase II, ion beam analysis will be compared with traditional techniques and the analysis will be standardized using reference samples. Based on the direct and nondestructive elemental ion beam analysis, a model will be developed that uses accurate C, H and O values to predict the fraction of hydrocarbons, inorganic carbonate and water (free and bound) in shale. Commercial Application and Other Benefits This program has the opportunity to develop techniques to streamline elemental and carbon analyses and establish a model to qualify the shale\u2019s productivity based on relative oxy hydrocarbon abundance.

Converting this heat to electricity at 30% conversion efficiency would produce ~9 GW of electric power, an equivalent to about 4.5 Hoover Dam outputs. Efficient low cost recovery of low level IWH at significant scale could displace a large number of fossil fuel power stations and avoid the concomitant production of CO2 as well as other greenhouse gases (GHG) and pollutants. Based on DOE target cost of $1/We, there is a potential $9B market for electricity generation from low level IWH. Traditional means for production of electricity from heat such as the steam cycle, organic Rankine cycle (ORC), Kalina cycle, all have efficiencies 20% from low level IWH. Alternative established technologies such as thermos electrics, thermionics, or piezo electrics are about an order of magnitude short of each of the DOE efficiency and cost targets.  Aqwest proposes to develop a magnetocaloric generator (MCG) offering thermodynamic efficiency up to ~80% of Carnot limit, which enables ~30% conversion efficiency of low level of industrial waste heat (IWH) at 450\u00baF (232\u00baC) to electricity. In Phase I we assembled a bench scale demonstration MCG unit to map out the operating regime.

Tetramer proposes this Phase IIB to design and build a coater device enabling reproducible processing of these materials for the purpose of validating their utility as security coatings. The innovation of this technology is its sensitivity to perimeter breaches for coated substrates; however, the coatings are highly processing dependent and require stable processing conditions to prevent false positive tamper indication. To develop a system capable of providing uniform, reproducible manufacturing conditions, Tetramer will adapt a computer numerical control motion system to provide digital control of a coating fixture. By integrating the motion controls with the deposition controls, various deposition techniques and processes will be investigated to identify the processing conditions necessary to prepare security coatings with consistent and predictable performance. Since the films are comprised of polymer materials that are deposited as monomers, part of the process research will include the development of consistent, uniform curing methods as well as evaluation of starting materials to provide acceptance criteria that are directly tied to coating properties. In Phases I and II, the fundamental operating concepts of this technology were successfully demonstrated. Coatings were manufactured by hand with manual casting and curing techniques and integrated with LEDs and sensors to exhibit the technology for potential customers in security and defense markets. These potential customers enthusiastically received the concept but stated that the potential for false positives from variable manufacturing processes was a risk to scale up. These companies have encouraged Tetramer to pursue this opportunity to advance the manufacturability of these coatings and have offered up to $200,000 of in kind support to facilitate advancement of this technology for future DoD and commercial applications. Key applications for this technology are for tamper indicating or anti tampering coatings. Several iterations of the coatings are described during the proposal with different levels of complexity and utility. High security coatings (e.g. For physical security of electronics and servers or Nuclear Safeguards) are enabled using this technology that can autonomously detect tampering events to the perimeter of a protected volume and initialize further tamper indicating or anti tamper mechanisms. Another form of the coatings can be used for 2factor authentication of products and has utility in commercial and governmental applications. Lastly, simple tamper indication coatings based on Tetramer\u00ae materials can be integrated with commercial thin films such as shrink wrap or product label films to provide novel tamper indicating and authentication functionality at low cost. Key Words: tamper indicating, coatings, safeguards, authentication, verification, tamper evident. Current tamper indicating technologies do not  ufficiently indicate real and attempted attacks on protected volumes, allowing counterfeiting of commercial products and theft of sensitive documents, data, and weapons. Manufacture of unique coatings will enable a broad range of tamper indicating and anti-tamper technologies from simple tokens to autonomous tamper detection.",

With a total ocean volume of approximately 1.3\u00d7109 km3, there is at least 4.5 billion tons of uranium in seawater which is about 1000 times the amount of uranium known to exist in terrestrial ores. Developing efficient and reusable adsorbent for economic extraction of uranium from seawater is an active research area in the USA and other countries in the world. In the Phase I study, we discovered that acrylic fiber (yarn) can be converted to an amidoxime and carboxylic acid containing polymer adsorbent which is selective, efficient and reusable for extraction of uranium from seawater. The adsorbent shows a uranium adsorption capacity greater than other adsorbents reported in the literature in real seawater tests. The SBIR Phase II project will test the polymer adsorbent in kilogram quantities in a scaled up operation to produce 10\u2019s gram quantities of uranium oxide from seawater. The proposed uranium from sea water experiments will be carried out using an outdoor circulating raceway flume facility available at PNNL\u2019s Marine Sciences Laboratory in Sequim, Washington. The scale up technology demonstration is necessary for us to obtain data for developing an industrial scale process and to perform cost analysis of the process for production of uranium from seawater. Initial cost analysis based on the data obtained from small sample (50100 mg) tests is promising suggesting that this new technology could make uranium production from seawater economically competitive with the land based uranium mining methods.

        "abstract": "The feasibility of fusion as a practical energy source needs to be improved significantly by removing some of the restrictions that low temperature superconductors put on the fusion magnet systems. One method to simplify the magnet system is by using high temperature superconductors (HTS) that allow for a higher magnet performance and much larger temperature margins. Successful application of HTS in fusion magnets requires reliable, low resistance cable joints. There is currently no practical method of making reliable joints in high current HTS cables. This proposal seeks to develop reliable, low resistance joints between HTS magnet cables that would allow for practical fusion magnets to become a reality. Joints between magnet cables capable of carrying currents exceeding 60 kA will be developed into an industrial product with the goal of having a joint resistance of less than 10 n\u03a9 at 4.220 K. During Phase I of the program, we demonstrated feasibility of our approach to make joints between HTS magnet cables and demonstrated a joint with resistance of 110 n\u03a9 at 77 K in a subscale cable carrying 8 kA. We demonstrated that current was injected homogenously into the cable containing 111 superconducting tapes. During Phase II of the program, the joints will be further optimized to reduce the resistance to below 10 n\u03a9, while joints between cables containing as many as 400 superconducting tapes will be developed. Several full scale cables with joints will be constructed and their performance will be measured at 4.2 K while carrying currents in excess of 50 kA. Reliable, low resistance joints between high current HTS cables will enable compact fusion magnets, high field magnets for scientific experiments and the next generation of accelerator magnets for particle physics and proton cancer treatment facilities. They will also enable high density power transmission cables for Department of Defense applications. Key words Compact fusion magnets, high temperature superconducting cable joints, demountable fusion magnets.

The reformed gas can then be converted into higher value products or cleaned and used with in fuel cell and other applications. The proposed plasma fuel reformer is a non-catalytic approach that avoids expensive catalysts that are susceptible to deactivation through sintering, coking or poisoning. Statement of how this problem is being addressed: A novel non thermal plasma reactor design is being developed with a focus on maximizing syngas yield with minimal electrical power.

        "abstract": "High temperature superconducting wire (HTS) technology has a significant potential to become the wire of choice for helium\u2010free, ultra\u2010high field magnet systems. High\u2010field, helium\u2010free magnet systems are attracting more interest as the world supply of helium is depleted and new science facilities are demanding magnetic field levels much higher than accessible by niobium\u2010based superconductors. Currently, HTS wire is manufactured as a thin, 1 micron\u2010meter, superconducting layer deposited on a 1 cm wide 100 micron\u2010meter thick metal substrate. Due to this geometry, a magnet wound from the wire suffers from high losses. Additionally, the mechanically weak interface between the superconductor layer and the ceramic buffer is known to be the most common source of HTS magnet failure. Brookhaven Technology Group (BTG) will develop and demonstrate the feasibility of a new type of cable bundled from exfoliated HTS filaments. The approach is based on successful Phase I experiments on stress\u2010induced exfoliation of HTS filaments. The technology eliminates the HTS\u2010buffer interface thus enabling mechanically strong narrow filaments. In Phase I, the filaments were demonstrated to retain up to 90% of the original critical current and possessed tensile strength in excess of 500 MPa. In Phase II, we will develop technology for bundling and twisting the filaments into a narrow, 1\u20102 mm diameter cable in a reel\u2010to\u2010reel mode. This geometry will deliver significantly improved quench stability of the cable and enhance the traditionally low tensile strength of the conductor. The cabling system will include an exfoliation unit, a laser slicing attachment and a bundling\u2010twisting machine. The cable will be tested both at 77 K and at 20 K, 8 Tesla field. The mechanical tests will be performed at National High Field Magnetic Laboratory. After the cable test, a solenoid coil will be\nwound using a bundling method that reduces AC loss of the coil by a factor of five as compared with a coil wound using 10 mm wide YBCO wire. The AC loss reduction will be confirmed by direct measurements of the loss by use of the rotating calorimeter facility at Wright Patterson Air Base Laboratory. Our cable technology will provide a pathway for efficient and economical high\u2010temperature superconducting magnets operating > 20 K. Such a magnet could be cooled by conduction, thus not requiring a supply of helium. High temperature operation ensures that the materials comprising the magnet have approximately 50 times more specific heat than at 4.2 K. This makes the high\u2010temperature magnet quench\u2010resistant. Quench\u2010resistant magnets can be ramped faster and they are more efficient and reliable. These features are very appealing for many applications outside of particle physics facilities. For example, there is a large market for MRI machines in countries with undeveloped helium re\u2010fill infrastructure. Keywords: YBCO wire, superconducting magnets, MRI machines.",

        "abstract": "Development of liquid transportation fuels from biomass is an essential part of diversifying the U.S. energy portfolio. Algae represents a promising next generation bioenergy source for producing energy from renewable sources because of the fast growth and high oil content of certain algae strains. However, because of very dilute concentrations of algae in the feed and consequently very large volumes of water that must be processed, harvesting algae contributes significantly to the cost of algal biofuel production. Cost effective algae dewatering technology is needed to reduce cost of algal biofuels. Membrane filtration technology has several advantages over other solidliquid separation technologies such as simple modular operation, compact units and lower energy requirement compared to centrifuge. However membrane technology is not widely used because of membrane fouling and module blockage issues as the algae solids content is increased. The proposed effort will address these issues by using \u201copen channel\u201d module design. Phase I project demonstrated producing >25% w/w algae paste with \u201copen channel\u201d membrane module system. The initially proposed spiral module technology was replaced by gravitational settling technology for algae preconcentration. Technoeconomic analysis indicated feasibility of the proposed overall process to reduce capital cost by 36% and energy requirement by 91% over conventional DAF/centrifuge process meeting U.S. DOE\u2019s project goals. The Phase II effort will develop a twostage membrane filtrationbased algae dewatering system with a lowcost, high volume gravitational settling system for preconcentration and a highperformance SmartFlow membrane module to produce >20% w/w algae paste. A threestage membrane system will be fabricated to continuously process 100 L/hr of 1% w/w algae feed to produce 5 L/hr of 20% w/w algae paste and demonstrate its longterm operation. The proposed process will be demonstrated to reduce capital cost >30% and energy consumption >20% over conventional DAF/Centrifuge process to meet DOE\u2019s performance and cost goals. The proposed Phase II effort will develop a costeffective algae dewatering system which will help reduce the cost of biofuel production from algae. Several other applications are also sought for algae such as in nutraceutical and food industries and for bioplastics. The proposed development will help to make algal products affordable. Key words: Membrane filtration, open channel design, algae, biofuel, gravitational settling. This project will develop a novel algae dewatering system meeting U.S. DOE\u2019s performance and cost targets for algae harvesting.

        "abstract": "Advanced high energy electron accelerators based upon laser plasma acceleration rely on using capillary discharges for both forming the plasma and providing a means for guiding the intense laser beam over distances much longer than the Rayleigh range. Scaling these devices to high energy levels requires using long capillary discharges with relatively low onaxis electron densities while still maintaining a small matched laser spot size throughout the capillary. Tapering of the plasma density along the capillary is also important for optimizing the energy gain. Conventional capillary discharges cannot satisfy these requirements. Conventional capillary discharges also typically rely on selffocusing to achieve guiding of the laser beam, which is undesirable because selffocusing is a nonlinear process and difficult to control. Therefore, being able to achieve true matched guiding is another critical need. We have developed a new type of capillary discharge that can operate with: 1) true matched guiding without reliance on selffocusing, 2) relatively low onaxis electron densities, 3) large enough capillary diameters to avoid damage by the highpower laser beam, and 4) longitudinal density tapering. During Phase I, we successfully performed experiments that verified the model predictions for our new capillary discharge and designed a prototype. During Phase II, we will build and test the prototype, including characterizing the capillary discharge and confirming guiding of a laser beam. Our densitytailored capillary discharge will help laser plasma experiments reach their ultimate goal of TeV energies as well as enable them to advance the field by utilizing true matched guiding of the laser beam. Our device can also help laser plasma accelerators and other plasmabased technologies become marketable products, for example, to create tabletop linear accelerators or xray lasers. Compact accelerators can generate tunable, intense electromagnetic radiation for industrial, medical, defense, and homeland security applications, such as for nondestructive testing and to generate gammarays for detection of hidden nuclear materials.

Due to the adverse radiological and material properties 241AmBe, there is an urgent need to prevent intentional or accidental diversion and/or use as a radiological dispersal device. With over 9000 active sources in the field, it is difficult to track and safeguard these materials. Development of an alternative source is a compelling scenario for risk reduction. The primary obstacle cited for 241AmBe replacement is that a change to the source effects the neutron emission spectrum and properties\u2014requiring recalibration and tooling redesign. Having a neutron source with a \u201cmore comparable\u201d neutron energy spectrum to 241AmBe would greatly assist with the transition problem for near term operating source replacement and industry acceptance. The 7Li(d,n) fusion reaction potentially offers a means to generate high energy >13MeV neutrons without using tritium or other radioisotope. Plus, a mixture of D(d,n) and 7Li(d,n) provides the best of both worlds for\nneutron porosity sensitivity at 2.5MeV and stimulating inelastic gamma rays at 13MeV for C/O ratio and gamma spectroscopy measurements. The on/off pulsed nature of the proposed accelerator would allow a multifunction \u201callinone\u201d tool for well loggers. In Phase I, we demonstrated a clear pathway to increasing accelerating energy to improve the 7Li(d,n)\ncross section.

The Phase I effort included experimental evaluation of materials, design development, neutron irradiation testing, and proof of feasibility prototype demonstration. Key\nstructural materials were experimentally evaluated for compatibility with boric acid, a chemical used to control reactions in pressurized water reactors. Simple sensor and packaging prototypes were tested in a research reactor to evaluate performance under neutron irradiation. Complete sensor and packaging prototypes in an original equipment manufacturer test facility to demonstrate performance in a relevant environment. What is to be done in Phase II. The Phase II effort will include: working with OEMs to guide technology develop and transition efforts; design and  development of dedicated drive and signal conditioning electronics; development of the next generation of sensor and packaging designs; rigorous lab scale testing of prototype devices, including required regulatory compliance; highfluence neutron irradiation testing at a test reactor; and device demonstration in an application relevant test system.\nCommercial applications and other benefits. The ability to deploy a distribution of flow measurement sensors within the reactor vessel or reactor core would greatly improve the ability to continuously measure the amount of margin available, and operate at higher temperatures which would improve the thermal efficiency. This increase in efficiency will allow more electricity to be generated from the same nuclear fuel investment. The proposed sensor also has the potential to improve public safety and reduce negative environmental impacts by assuring reactor cooling system flow.

A large UAS has both the payload and endurance to enable more economical mapping than manned systems. The overall design approach is to utilize stateoftheart laser designs to create a highly compact laser transmitter and combine it with latest generation electronics for data acquisition and signal processing. A design was developed for a compact airborne laser scanner with the accuracy required for digital terrain mapping and that is deployable on a large unmanned aircraft system. A concept of operations for the aircraft and sensor was developed. System size, weight, and power estimates were developed. The engineering design for integrating the sensor with the demonstration aircraft will be completed. Sensor subassemblies will be fabricated and then integrated with system electronics. The airborne laser scanner will then be demonstrated on a small manned aircraft operating under the concept of operations developed for unmanned aircraft.

        "abstract": "Increased electricity demand amid infrastructure development restrictions continues to foster  innovation for distributed generation. Whereas pumped hydro installations are fixed locations, battery, thermal, compressed air, and flywheel storage can be mobile and competitive if they are cost effective, reliable, and safe, and have regulatory approvals and industry acceptance. Improvements to efficiency, power density and flexibility, and reduced capitalization cost are required to enable these competitive energy storage methods to be realized. Statement of How This Problem or Situation Is Being Addressed. Silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFETs offer benefits of increased efficiency, higher power density, and simplified thermal management compared to silicon devices at 12.47 kV AC/MW+ utility class power levels. We aim to use these emerging devices to greatly improve the value proposition of energy storage based distributed generation by increasing power density and eliminating large 60 Hz magnetics and unreliable liquid cooling. Our innovation is an Advanced Power Inverter (API) with (1) high power density electronic designs having high efficiency at utility power levels; (2) a physical geometry with high heat transfer rates, allowing liquid cooling hardware to be replaced with convective cooling; and (3) a bidirectional transformerless architecture, which greatly increases power density, reduces cost, simplifies the design, and improves reliability. What was done in Phase I? The following API technical milestones were achieved during Phase I: obtained and tested 10 kV SiC MOSFETs in the laboratory, demonstrating that these devices have adequate maturity and performance; achieved power density that is 4.3 times greater than existing inverters; eliminated the 60 Hz transformer and liquid cooling hardware; achieved end to end efficiency of 96%; achieved switching frequency of 20 kHz that is three times higher than for high voltage IGBTs. These accomplishments will provide power conversion electronics for grid tied energy storage applications that are smaller, more efficient, and require lower capital than existing systems. What is planned for Phase II? During Phase II we will complete design work, fabricate a full scale API prototype, evaluate performance, and prepare for commercialization transition. The Phase II API prototype will be manufactured as the first unit from a representative production line, showcasing commercial readiness for our initial Phase III customers. Commercial Application and Other Benefits. This API technology will find broad application to distributed electrical power generation equipment. Our team includes stakeholders with access to both terrestrial utility as well as Department of Defense markets, creating expansive revenue potential for this technology. Innovative API features will improve reliability, increase power density that will simplify deployment for urban and shipboard environments, reduce capitalization cost, and enable far greater power levels and revenue.

        "abstract": "Marine and hydrokinetic (MHK) energy converters are often installed in remote, harsh environments where access is limited and maintenance is a costly and labor intensive process. The lack of real time information on the status and health of critical structural components prevents the adoption of condition based maintenance strategies, and thus requires the use of preemptory maintenance practices. This creates a deficiency of information on failures, and in turn impedes future design efforts. General statement of how this problem is being addressed: Luna is developing an embedded sensing system that combines sensors, electronics, and structural health and prognostic algorithms to identify the presence, type, and severity of structural damage to MHK devices. This technology will provide results that can inform control strategies and maintenance activities to lower operational costs and improve energy converter availability for energy production. What was done in Phase I: In Phase I, Luna used active electromechanical impedance measurements to obtain structural data and relate this to the onset of discrete damage for composite plates, as well as fatigue induced degradation from manufacturing flaws that are common in MHK devices. Detection and prediction algorithms were developed to perform a damage state analysis of the results to classify system health, with detection\naccuracies of 85.7 \u2013 93.4% observed for composite specimens tested in the laboratory. What is planned for the Phase II project: The Phase II project will extend research in the Phase I, generating predictions of the remaining useful life for components based on damage state assessments and estimates of future loading conditions. These algorithms will be designed for implementation on embedded sensing hardware, with a preproduction prototype designed and built to provide data acquisition, signal processing, analysis, and communication with MHK control systems. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The proposed technology will result in a marketable structural health management system that can be integrated into existing or future MHK systems. The technology provides comprehensive characterization of the structural integrity of critical components in the MHK device throughout its lifecycle, comprised of development, testing, towing, installation, lifting, and normal operation of the energy converter. The information generated by this system will be used to notify operators of upset conditions or impending structural faults based on measured or predicted health states. This will have application to a variety of MHK devices, and derivatives of the technology will extend to other renewable energy platforms such as land based and offshore wind turbines.

Recording signals from these sensors requires demanding data collection capabilities. Sensor data has high bandwidth (greater than 1 THz); it must be collected from multiple sites around the target chamber for significant temporal durations and must be single shot. A single system must also be able to completely characterize laser driver pulses at multiple locations, providing the intensity and phase of the laser pulse with sub picosecond time resolution. Statement of how this problem or situation is being addressed. This SBIR project will develop a new technology to record the intensity and phase of optical waveforms from sensors, or the intensity and phase of fusion driver laser pulses, with terahertz bandwidths and time windows spanning more than several nanoseconds.

        "abstract": "Battery storage systems are the backbone of the future grids. These systems provide distributed energy storage capabilities for smoothing the load profile and coping with generation and load power fluctuations. By incorporating these resources, voltage stability and overall reliability of the grid will improve. A challenge in the utilization of battery storage systems is the design and manufacturing of high efficiency high power density bidirectional inverters to interface between batteries and the utility grid. Traditional Silicon based inverters do not offer high efficiencies and suffer from larger real estate requirements. Recent commercialization of low cost Gallium Nitride (GaN) semiconductors has opened up an opportunity to manufacture high efficiency inverters that can operate at higher switching frequencies and demand smaller filtering elements. InnoCit\u2019s technical approach is to utilize modular stacks of printed circuit boards (PCB) as the core of its GaNinverters. InnoCit has devised a modular 10 kVA diodeclamped multilevel GaNinverter to form a rack based 100kVA inverter. By using a multilevel topology, InnoCit is able to utilize the commercially available low voltage GaN switches. Using a modular rack based design on PCBs, InnoCit has introduced an innovated automated manufacturing method to eliminate the traditional dc bus structures and wiring. As a result, InnoCit has significantly reduced its manufacturing and labor cost and will offer a 20% lower price tag compared to the competing products. Also, InnoCit\u2019s solution reduces the size by 74%. During the Phase I project, InnoCit performed a preliminary market analysis and developed estimates of the market growth. Also, the team interviewed several potential customers. On the technical side, the team performed comprehensive simulations and finalized its converter topology. A gate driver circuitry was designed and developed for\nGaN switches that was commercialized and is now available for purchase on InnoCit\u2019s website as well as Amazon. Lastly, a TRL4 prototype of the proposed battery inverter was developed and tested. During this Phase II project, InnoCit LLC will revise its TRL4 GaN inverter prototype to a TRL7 prototype ready for certification testing. To this end, the team will finalize the design of the circuit boards, design a rack drawer system to use with modular 7.5kW units, and will design a rack cabinet to house ten GaN inverter modules to form a 75kW inverter. Tasks include CAD modeling, FEM thermal analysis,\nprograming, electrical measurements for EMI compliance, and isolation voltage analysis based on UL requirements. Additionally, InnoCit GaN inverter will be tuned to support hybrid battery racks with multiple chemistries and to offer a CEC efficiency of 89.5%. Also, a U.S. manufacturing and commercialization plan will be developed. Lastly, field tests with demonstrations to potential customers and early market adopters will be executed. InnoCit is aiming to commercialize its full GaN inverter system by 2018. This project helps DOE to reach its SunShot goals by enabling high penetration of intermittent resources though the use of battery systems for compensation of power fluctuations. Due to its lower cost, public will benefit from a reduced capital investment requirements and larger return on investment rates.

        "abstract": "The DOE is evaluating deep borehole disposal of nuclear waste, where waste packages are emplaced in deep boreholes in crystalline rock formations. Improved well seals and plugs are needed for the challenging conditions at depth, particularly with the performance assurance required for long durations of nuclear waste isolation. Similar needs exist in the oil and gas, CO2 injection, and geothermal energy extraction fields as wells are set deeper into harsh chemical and thermal environments. Conventional well sealing cements are challenged by the conditions at depth, due to their vulnerability to chemical degradation and limited service temperature. High performance plug and seal components can be formed in place using self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS) processes. Solid phase metal/oxide reactions, supplemented by engineered mixtures of minerals and oxides, form ceramic like sealing features in wells. The plugs are developed by lowering hermetic packages of reactive material into the well, and reacting the charges to form molten material which fills and solidifies in the target region of the well. The reaction produces strong, low permeability, high corrosion resistant plug material. The initial viability assessment demonstrated formulations capable of achieving high compressive strength (over three times that of cement), low permeability (less than 100 \uf06dDarcy) with the inherent corrosion resistance and service temperature characteristics of ceramics. The initial Phase II effort refined the plug formulations to optimize reaction product properties. Numerical simulations predicted the thermal effects of the plug on its surroundings. The plug emplacement system was designed (and is presently in fabrication), compatible with wireline systems. Small scale and full diameter plug formation tests have been performed in scaled experiments. The Phase IIa effort refines the understanding of thermite systems and additives, tailoring them for applications in uncased boreholes. Such settings are being considered for deep borehole disposal of nuclear waste. Detailed property measurements and scaled experiments will characterize the performance of these plug materials and the nature of the plug/rock interface. Comprehensive thermal, structural, and fluid numerical analyses of the plug and surrounding rock will aid in predicting coupled processes and sealing performance. Poor well sealing has caused contamination in surface and subsurface water supplies, and negatively impacts the performance of reservoir regions planned for CO2 sequestration and injection. This technology will offer sealing capabilities unattainable by traditional cement based techniques. Demonstration tests in CO2, geothermal, and conventional oil and gas wells are anticipated in subsequent phases. Key words: Nuclear waste, plugging and abandonment, sealing plugs, wellbore integrity, deep borehole disposal, thermite. This project will develop high performance sealing plugs for use in deep borehole disposal of nuclear waste and commercial wells.

A monitoring sensor located inside a storage cask to provide direct measurements of internal conditions is of particular interest to DOE.

Proposed Solution: In this proposal, Xwave Innovations, Inc., along with Prof. James P.

These reactors are typically very compact and they can be used in regular electric power production, for naval and space propulsion systems or in fission surface power systems for planetary exploration. Liquid metals in fusion reactors can be used in heat exchange, tritium breeder systems and in first wall protection, using a flowing liquid metal surface as a plasma facing component. High power accelerator driven subcritical (ADS) systems will need to employ liquid metal targets and beam dumps for spallation and for heat removal where the severe constraints arising from a megawatt beam deposited on targets and absorbers will require complex procedures to dilute the beam, and liquid metals constitute an excellent working fluid\ndue to its intrinsic characteristics. Liquid alloy systems have a high degree of thermal conductivity far superior to ordinary nonmetallic liquids and inherent high densities and electrical conductivities. This results in the use of these materials for specific heat conducting and dissipation applications. Typical applications for liquid metals include heat transfer systems, and thermal cooling and heating designs. Uniquely, they can be used to conduct heat and electricity between nonmetallic and metallic surfaces. The motion of liquid metals in strong magnetic fields generally induces electric currents, which, while interacting with the magnetic field, produce electromagnetic forces. Thermomagnetic systems exploit the fact that liquid metals are conducting fluids capable of carrying currents source of electromagnetic fields useful for pumping, heat dissipation and diagnostics. Studies on engineering magneto hydrodynamics of liquid metals are being performed aiming to the development of computational tools and software for the design, modeling, simulation, optimization and fabrication of liquid metal annular linear induction pumps for nuclear applications. But the coupling between the electromagnetics and thermos fluid mechanical phenomena observed in liquid metal thermomagnetic systems gives rise to complex engineering and numerical problems observed in different type of applications in the nuclear, space and industrial field. Therefore, future applications of this research can lead to the development of tools for the design and analysis of liquid metal and plasma based technology with applicability on: thermal control systems, advanced nuclear propulsion and power systems, generation IV reactors, targetry and machine protection mechanisms on high energy particle accelerators, and biomedical engineering problems such as artificial MHD heart studies and new contrasting\nagents.

        "abstract": "Climate change concern has led to a focus on greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, by a large number aging coal fired power plants. The addition of carbon capture to these plants will significantly reduce carbon emissions, but the process requires energy and increases the electricity cost by 32% to 73%, depending on the type of plant. If carbon emissions could be greatly reduced from these plants, at low cost, this would represent a significant contribution to improving air and water quality, and the Department of Energy\u2019s goals of reducing capital costs of plant upgrades and enabling affordable capture would be supported. How this problem is being addressed The proposer has developed a carbon capture technology that can both capture this polluter and replace a portion of the existing high energy stream in power plants, which reduces the additional costs needed for implementing this process, while reducing the plant energy need. This approach will help carbon capture be implemented in fossil fuel power plants, reducing emissions, with minimal increases in electricity prices, by applying a low cost production technique for high capacity carbon dioxide contactors. On the utility side of the contactor, the energy is integrated into the power plants existing streams, thus substantially reducing the carbon capture cost. What was done in Phase I: Under Phase I, testing and analysis was performed to demonstrate process feasibility. A monolith element was tested and proved to capture and release the carbon dioxide, with three times better capacity than a packed bed. The absorption and desorption cycles were tested and showed that its operational\ncharacteristics can be exploited by similar cycles in the power plant. The economic analysis showed that the additional cost of electricity is minimal, with the proposed approach. What is planned for Phase II: Under the proposed Phase II, the process will be designed into a power plant stream. The full scale system design will be scaled down to a prototype reactor design, fabricated and tested, which will include capturing and releasing CO2 cycle on one side, while transferring the needed and released heat to the power plant simulated stream, on the other side. By testing a prototype simulating a portion of the power plant, the results will be relevant to a plant, and will be used to update the economic model, better\ndefining the process cost. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits By enabling the production of a reactor at low cost and integrating carbon capture with existing unit operations, it will be more economical to capture carbon and will lower the capital and operating costs for upgraded coal fired power plants, resulting in lower electricity costs for ratepayers, and making investment in this technology more attractive.

        "abstract": "Nuclear power plant (NPP) operators are required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to perform cybersecurity assessments on their internal networks, control systems and critical data assets on a regular basis to ensure regulatory compliance and safety, security and emergency preparedness of the nation\u2019s most critical infrastructures. However, the current assessment processes in the nuclear industry are highly manual driven, labor intensive and costly. The existing software tools for assessments used today are primarily report generators based on user input to a sequence of static questions. The results generated from such practices are inconsistent, costly, difficult to verify, and inadequate to capture the security posture of an NPP in a timely fashion. In this SBIR, we will develop an innovative solution for the cybersecurity assessment problem via automation. By using a quantitative risk model, we will create a robust and extensible software tool to help streamline the cybersecurity assessment process in the nuclear industry. The software tool, called Automated Cybersecurity Assessment Manager (ACAM\u2122), is designed to support NRC regulatory policies and industry standards, and provide NPP operators with a set of web based functions to manage cybersecurity risks efficiently and cost effectively. At the end of Phase I, we created an initial version of a quantitative risk model and developed a prototype of the ACAM product that demonstrated the solution feasibility and laid out a solid foundation for continuous research and development (R&D) in Phase II. Our Phase II plan is to continue maturing our quantitative model for industrial control systems (ICS), continue developing the ACAM prototype into an enterprise product, and complete the ACAM testing in a lab test environment with realistic digital and process control assets. The end result will be a full-fledged ACAM software product ready to be deployed for beta testing with customers and integrators towards commercialization. ACAM will be the first software framework for conducting quantitative cybersecurity assessment from a risk perspective, providing accurate and consistent assessment results with significant cost savings. The result of this SBIR will fill an important gap in cybersecurity risk management for the nuclear and power industry, creating a viable solution that can be easily customized and adopted by other utility companies as well as other ICS industries. As more enterprises adopt cybersecurity assessment practices, we will be uniquely positioned to capture this growing market by continuing to advance the ACAM technology and help to secure and protect our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures for years to come.

We have demonstrated high heating rates with the nanoparticles during the Phase I project. In the Phase II project, we will improve our already high heating rate by optimizing the RF heating process, along with the type, size and morphology of the nanoparticles so that they heat tissue samples rapidly and uniformly.  At the end of the Phase II project, we will test our apparatus and nanoparticles with animal tissue.  Success in the Phase II project will ensure that the cryopreserved tissues pass from the vitrified state to the liquid state without forming crystalline ice (devitrification), and without the high thermal gradients which can lead to mechanical failure (fracture).",

These successes and progress on the Modular Space Vehicle, along with standardization (Space Plug and Play Architecture) continue to show promise in a responsive space architecture focused on modularity and reconfigurability. There is a need to enhance the capability of small spacecraft to support this paradigm via miniaturized, high performance, and cost-effective components. Small, agile space companies can act as liasons between the commercial and space markets to leverage their strengths to ensure products are robust to the space environment, carry appropriate mission assurance and risk profiles, and can be delivered in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of conventional space components. Honeybee Robotics proposes to offer an attitude determination and control system tailored to nano-sat class spacecraft.

The proposed project would retrofit one government supplies MTRCS with a transcritical CO2 refrigeration system while maintaining the capacity and high efficiency of a two stage, variable speed semi-hermetic compressor. The CO2 HeMTRCS will operate in the required dual temperature mode (freezer and refrigerator) at the challenging 135 F ambient condition, where the typical single stage CO2 refrigeration cycle has low efficiency. Poor efficiency leads to greater greenhouse gas production, defeating the purpose of adopting CO2 refrigerant.

        "abstract": "Infrared devices fabricated using III-V strained-layer superlattice (SLS) materials have many advantages over present state-of-the-art HgCdTe detectors, e.g., cost, manufacturability, operability, and theoretically lower Auger generation rates. However, due to the presence of inherent growth related defects the SLS materials have not achieved full potential. While growth improvements are anticipated, it is not clear whether those will be sufficient enough to enable widespread adoption of the SLS technology. This issue is addressed by a post-epitaxy process for improving material quality by passivating defects and shallow donor impurities with a UV-assisted hydrogenation. This is ideally suited to advance the integration of SLS into DoD systems due to its effectiveness and the ease of its integration into the process flow. The primary parameter to monitor material quality is the minority carrier lifetime, which was nearly doubled by hydrogenation as demonstrated in the Phase I program. In this Phase II, in partnership with Hughes Research Laboratories and Air Force Research Laboratory we will optimize the hydrogenation process, evaluate lifetimes, and test Performance Evaluation Chips, and FPA operabilities of treated materials.",

These experts have designed and fielded several 1+ meter class radars specifically for weather surveillance using phased array and conventional gimbaled reflector antennas. The team has also fielded tracking software that is deployed worldwide in USAF and other US military forces surveillance radars. Using this expertise, trades on mechanical and electronic scan, single versus dual polarization, single versus dual frequency, single versus multiple faces, and multifunction to include air surveillance versus single weather detection have been completed to make unambiguous recommendations for future PDR implementation. The study has concluded that a hybrid solution at X-band meets all USAF requirements. Dual polarization is included to simplify system calibration and improve measurement accuracy with minimal impact to the system cost. Last, a preliminary bill of materials has been assembled that is substantially less than the target system price of $500K providing ample room to cover integration and tests costs while meeting the USAF price objective.",

        "abstract": "Highpower (kilowattclass) lasers are of great interest to the Department of Energy (DOE) and other commercial users, for many areas of accelerator applications: for implementation of future colliders, in generation and manipulation of electron beams, in electromagnetic radiation and particle beam generation. For many of these and other applications, it is required that these lasers operate at high repetition rates and short, subpicosecond pulse widths, with greater than 20% electrical to optical efficiencies. The laser technology of choice to meet these requirements is solidstate lasers, which use gain media based on crystals or glasses doped with rare earth or transition metal ions. Of particular interest are Erbium and Thulium fiber lasers emitting in the 1.5\u20131.6 and 1.7\u20132.1 \u03bcm wavelength ranges, respectively. Systems based on the current state of the art are unable to meet the efficiency requirements sought by DOE. Traditionally, the wallplug efficiency of fiber lasers has been limited by three factors \u2013 the opticaltooptical conversion efficiency of the fiber gain medium, the wallplug efficiency of the semiconductor pump source, and the optical losses associated with coupling the semiconductor pump into the dualclad fiber. The work proposed herein will enable a dramatic improvement in the system wallplug efficiency of fiber lasers for accelerator technology by simultaneously addressing all three of these issues. Resonant pumping of Erbium and Thulium fiber lasers offers significantly reduced quantum defect (and hence high opticaltooptical conversion efficiency) compared to pumping at shorter wavelengths. By directly pumping the upper level of the laser with a long wavelength pump, the energy loss associated with nonradiative decay to the upper laser level can be avoided, improving overall efficiency. Unfortunately the wallplug efficiency of long wavelength fibercoupled InPbase diode pumps is low (35% at 1.5 \u03bcm and 15% at 1.9 \u03bcm). This prevents the resonant pumping approach from yielding significant improvements in total system efficiency. To address this problem, this program will develop high power fibercoupled laser diode modules operating at 1.5 and 1.9 \u03bcm. The proposed approach is expected to make a leap forward in efficiency, ultimately delivering >50% and >20% rated power conversion efficiency at 1.5 and 1.9 \u03bcm, respectively; these projected values are inclusive of the optical losses associated with fiber coupling. The envisioned product at the end of this program will be a fibercoupled module that can be incorporated into a fieldspecific system. Key Words: diode laser, laser pump, high power laser, high efficiency laser, long wavelength laser, accelerators, fiber lasers. This program will develop high efficiency and high power diode laser pumps operating at wavelengths around 1550 nm and 1900 nm. These high performance laser pumps will enable the application of Erbium and Thulium doped fiber lasers in DOE accelerators, as well as in other high impact commercial areas.",

        "abstract": "Kestrel Technology will develop CLAIM: Corpus- and Logic-based Automated Identification of Malware, which will pioneer a novel approach to malware detection and identification using a Big Code corpus of known malicious programs.  CLAIM will work by performing a logical match (based on semantics and functionality, not signatures) between unknown, possibly malicious programs and known malicious programs from the corpus.  The match will be performed by applying our technique of lifting-into-logic to both programs (x86 binaries), using a model of the x86 instruction semantics, and then applying our equivalence checking techniques to detect equivalent malicious functionality. When malice is detected, CLAIM will produce a certificate of malicious behavior, showing in detail how the new program's functionality corresponds to known malicious code in the corpus.  All of this is enabled by the Big Code corpus of known malware.  The corpus allows the difficult problem of malware detection to be reduced to the more tractable problem of equivalence checking.  In turn, this equivalence checking problem is made tractable by our advanced techniques, including lifting into logic and the strategies used in the Axe Equivalence Checker (suitably adapted to handle x86 malware).",

        "abstract": "To address the Army need to detect the earliest formation of corrosion through paint, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) developed a new low-cost Paint Additive/Nondestructive Interrogation (PANDI) system. The paint additive increases paint transparency for IR light, which is emitted and measured by the corrosion sensor. The inorganic additive is fully compatible with current coating systems and does not interfere with pretreatments. Moreover it improves scratch resistance, increases water repellence, and protects paint against microbial erosion, without compromising aircraft camouflage. Based on successful testing of the Phase I PANDI breadboard prototype on ninety MIL-DTL-53022 and MIL-DTL-53039 coated coupons, POC proposes in Phase II to develop a device with a small optical head on a borescope extension for inspection of difficult-to-access areas. The device will be equipped with Google Glass, and the paint additive will be optimized for aircraft coatings. The ability of the PANDI system to detect corrosion through paint at the lowest possible level on aircraft structural sections will be validated under accelerated exposure to corrosion formation. Phase II efforts will focus on optimizing the PANDI design, fabricating and testing a prototype, addressing manufacturing/formulation of the new paint and additive, and identifying a Phase III path ahead for military qualification.",

The current composite patches and other processes that represent the state-of-the-art for reinforcement weakened areas are expensive; difficult and potentially hazardous to install; and not durable.   Our novel solution to reinforce weld joints and other difficult-to-access areas in fuel system piping is our Compact Repair System (CRS).  We have adapted a conventional welding process currently used for large-scale manufacturing and miniaturized the technology to facilitate material addition for reinforcement.  Our CRS is ideally suited to portable systems for shipboard pipe reinforcement applications.  During the Phase I project, we successfully developed and demonstrated that our proof-of-concept CRS produces excellent reinforcement of weakened joints with a pressure rating far in excess of the Navys requirements.   In addition, we developed a preliminary design of the CRS as springboard for the Phase II project.  During Phase II, we will complete the system design, fabricate a prototype, complete testing at Creare and at an on-site location to be determined by the Navy, and work with the Navy and our product-based sister company, Edare, to transition the technology.",

The INAV-SL system utilizes electro-optical/short wave infrared (EO/SWIR) imaging sensors to analyze the location and orientation of the landing deck relative to the aircraft and provides precise relative position estimates to the Fire Scout air vehicle to facilitate safe approach and landing. The system also measures the motion of the deck with respect to a stabilized deck position and provides measurements as defined by the current landing system, thus fulfilling its role as a functional back-up to the existing landing system. The proposed effort focuses on in-flight system evaluation, building on the progress accomplished in the previous INAV-SL SBIR efforts. The INAV-SL system, which has been implemented to date as an engineering development unit, will be evaluated, updated, and implemented as candidate hardware and flight tested.

        "abstract": "Under this Phase II effort entitled Electromagnetic spectrum Dynamic Deconfliction and Situational Awareness (ED2SA), STR and ISS propose to develop novel visualization and decision support technology that will enable an Air Operations Center (AOC) operator to intelligently manage spectrum allocation at the operational level, taking into account both contextual factors (constraints from the environment and neutral actors such as civilians, plus enemy force laydowns) and friendly courses of actions (COAs). Our approach significantly improves on current spectrum management methods in todays AOCs, which feature manual, ad hoc processes with little automation support other than spreadsheets. Key innovations include 1) algorithms for aggregation of related spectrum usages and discovering frequency dynamics, 2) decision support for deconfliction across frequency, time, and spatial dimensions, 3) adaptive visualization of spatial EW engagements based on Wares Visual Thinking Design Patterns methodology. Over the course of four spirals, we will integrate and evaluate the ED2SA prototype using operationally realistic scenarios and datasets and integrate with ISS C2Core tool suite.",

The Phase-I research effort has been successful to show that the proposed BML sensor suite is capable of performing three state-of-the-art laser diagnostics techniques  laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), spontaneous Raman spectroscopy (SRS), and CH2O/OH planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF)  for high-speed 2D FAR and HRR measurements within pressure range of 116 bars. During the Phase-II, the sensitivity and precision for FAR measurements with BML sensor suite will be further improved. A widely tunable OPO for performing BML-based 2D HRR measurements will be developed. The full packaged BML sensor suite for FAR and HRR along with multiple species concentration and temperature measurements will be employed for combustion instability study in the AFRL test rigs and burners.",

The primary objective of this Phase II, therefore, is to build a more fully integrated prototype of the benchtop C&R capability that was proven effective in Phase I that will show an effective C&R capability. The prototype will protect a vulnerable operating logic subsystem as well as have the appropriate SWaP, form, and fit.

Current approaches can provide simple alerts, but struggle to provide a complete picture of operational constraints and impacts.

TALII integrates multiple sources of incoming information into a context engine, which  maintains awareness of the current mission state and the state of incoming data. This model of context is then combined with perceptually-driven design principles to tailor a visual analytics interface for users in the AOC that highlights important information and selects appropriate level of detail to maintain situation awareness. Course of action visualization and recommendation helps users make faster and more effective decisions under changing conditions.",

        "abstract": "Methane is the third most prevalent greenhouse gas, whose atmospheric concentration is currently over 1.7 ppm and is about 21 times more potent when compared to CO2. Thus, while the quantitative monitoring of methane levels is necessary, it is also critically important to directly identify the sources of the methane emissions, for example, in ice floes, leaks in pipelines, and also from drilling/fracking and other anthropogenic activities. The Phase I effort has indicated that a new class of detector \u2013 resonant cavity enhanced photo detector \u2013 can be successfully manufactured with excellent resonance at the absorption band for methane. This is a significant result, and provides for the first time narrow band infrared detector that has significantly improved performance over any existing infrared detector. For the Phase II effort we will develop an inexpensive methane gas imaging camera, that can be used for direct observation of methane gas/emission. The imaging array uses the advanced resonant cavity enhanced photo-detector (RCE-PD) design that can be tuned to the absorption spectrum of the gas (i.e. methane). This camera will be high sensitivity, low power, and lightweight so it can be readily integrated onto UAV\u2019s platforms and hand held systems.",

        "abstract": "The bloom-forming algae Karenia brevis produces neurotoxins known as brevetoxins (PbTx) that can cause illness in humans and marine wildlife. During K. brevis blooms, also known as red tides, elevated levels of brevetoxins have been linked to massive bird, fish, and marine mammal kills. In addition, human consumption of brevetoxin contaminated shellfish leads to neurotoxic shellfish poisoning. The economic impact of K. brevis blooms in Florida alone has been estimated to be upwards of $30M/year.[1] In collaboration with Dr. Leanne Flewelling of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission's Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, NeoClone, Catalina Sea Ranch, and VICAM, Intelligent Optical Systems, Inc. (IOS) proposes to continue its development of a fast and portable shoreside lateral flow assay (LFA) for cost-effective immunoassay detection of PbTx. Coupling of detector antibodies to highly fluorescent labels technology has proved in Phase I to enhance assay sensitivity. As a result, with this beach-side assay, unlike the current laboratory assays, NOAA can implement routine coastal monitoring. In Phase II, IOS will validate assay sensitivity and develop a cost-effective sampling and testing kit for the rapid detection of brevetoxins in seawater, and ultimately in shellfish meat.",

Localized regions will have fully integrated, self-healing, compositionally graded, non-silicon containing protective oxide surfaces capable of withstanding higher temperatures than the silicon containing SiC matrices. Novel processing technology will form these tempered regions of the aeroshell that will operate with zero erosion at temperatures well above 3000oF. The PSI production process minimizes the use of process tooling and eliminates the expensive and time consuming machining of dense ceramics.

        "abstract": "Roma Plastilina #1 (RP#1) clay has been used for nearly five decades as an industry standard recording medium in ballistic testing of body armor and helmets. RP#1 provides a simulated tissue response that can be correlated to human tissue damage. Despite its long history of use in ballistic testing, RP#1 was actually developed and is manufactured for the artistic community. Its formulation and properties have changed over time, so the Army has had to adapt new handling and calibration methods to support the ongoing use of RP#1 and preserve the link to legacy ballistic test data. In addition, the raw materials used in the production of RP#1 have inherent differences which are naturally occurring and uncontrollable, such that no supplier can guarantee clay composition, microstructure or formulation consistency. Under the proposed program, METSS will develop a new ballistic backing material that is dedicated for use in the ballistic testing community. The new material will be able to meet the calibration test standard when tested at ambient temperature, while maintaining a viscoelastic response that is consistent with RP#1 so ballistic data generated with the new material can maintain ties with legacy test data. The new material will be based on synthetic materials, using controlled industrial processing methods to produce a consistent product with well-defined thixotropic behavior.",

        "abstract": "The Nielsen Engineering & Research Division of Analytical Mechanics Associates (AMA) is proposing the continued development of their Actively Stabilized Drogue Refueling System (ASDRS).  This ASDRS minimizes drogue motion resulting from atmospheric turbulence, tanker wake, tanker motion, and receiver forebody effects.  Numerical predictions indicate that this system can reduce the maximum radial displacement of an F-18 drogue in light turbulence from 2.61 feet to 0.16 feet.    By presenting a more stable target, the ASDRS significantly increases the success rate, safety, allowable weather envelope, and cost effectiveness of aerial refueling operations for both manned and unmanned receivers operating with manned or unmanned tankers.  A stabilized drogue is viewed as a required piece of technology to achieve operationally acceptable refueling efficiency for automated aerial refueling.  AMA will advance the development of their ASDRS through a combination of electro-mechanical design, numerical analysis, wind tunnel tests, ground-based environmental testing, and flight tests.  The proposed Phase II.5 effort leverages a combination of PMA, SBIR, and commercial funds.  Successful completion of this Phase II.5 contract will provide a strong foundation for future qualification flight tests and rapid transition to the war fighter.  The proposed effort will advance the ASDRS from TRL 5 to TRL 6-7.",

In our Phase I, we analyzed cyber operator tasks within the DoDs Cyber Incident Handling Life Cycle (CIHLC), including information and data sources needed to perform those tasks. Integrating Goal Directed Task Analysis (GDTA) methods with CIHLC task decomposition, we modeled the cyber operators environment and its corresponding decision making requirements. We then created, and qualitatively assessed prototype transformations of low level data as visualizations that support operator decision making requirements. In Phase II, we will objectively evaluate insight gained during Phase I by conducting an experiment to quantitatively measure the effect interactive data visualization techniques have on operator analytic and decision making performance. We will implement a visualization prototype with data transformations, and an experimental interface that permits remote, asynchronous participation, enabling a disperse and diverse candidate population of experienced cyber operators to join the study.  Outcomes from the Phase II effort will contribute significantly to understanding how visualizations can be used by cyber operators, and enable multiple transition opportunities for the visualizations and data transformations, as well as a cognitive architecture for visual analytics support to cyber operations.",

The DNB HGS has extreme low-light sensitivity that enables a new generation of nighttime imaging. Many of these emerging applications\u2019 utility however depend on absolute radiometric accuracy and sensor stability. Currently the DNB HGS calibration hinges on transferring calibration from the low and medium gain stages to the HGS using a solar diffuser, which is more than seven orders of magnitude brighter than many of the faintly lit targets imaged using the HGS. As a result, the HGS absolute calibration accuracy under extreme low light may be too low to provide quantifiable information and detect change. Our new AALS will improve our small target radiometry/point source understanding. Combining our national standards-traceable AALS with a sensitive VIIRS nighttime imaging capability has the potential to create game changing new commercial and military applications. Key to commercialization and economic viability is the ability to design and field a cost-effective AALS.",

        "abstract": "This proposal from Climate Forecast Applications Network addresses the challenge of providing business-relevant subseasonal forecasts for the energy and agricultural sectors, including applications to renewable energy. An innovative multi-model prediction system using the CFSv2 and ECMWF forecasts will be developed to exploit the advantages of each model. An interactive web-based dashboard system is designed to display and deliver the forecast information in a flexible and dynamic manner to aid decision support integration. A comprehensive assessment of predictability of businessrelevant variables by region, initial and target month, and atmospheric flow regimes provides the basis for assessing the confidence of individual forecasts and for identifying forecast \u2018windows of opportunity\u2019. An ensemble calibration scheme uses predictability assessment, reforecasts and recent forecast errors to correct for model bias error and to improve the shape of the ensemble distribution. Advanced ensemble interpretation techniques support scenario predictions of extreme events. A strategy for assessing confidence of each forecast is based on a comprehensive forecast evaluation, predictability assessment, and ensemble characteristics.",

        "abstract": "The aquaculture industry lags in genetically based selective breeding programs when compared to terrestrial commercial crops. This aggravates the United States\u2019 (U.S.) $11 billion dollar seafood deficit, puts U.S. aquaculture entrepreneurs at an early disadvantage for success, and increases risk of bivalve crop degradation from climate change. Heterosis in bivalve crops, the phenomenon in which hybrid offspring exhibit enhanced traits compared to parental trait values, has been documented in scientific literature, but studies still remain scant and rarely address the genetic components of selection from breeding. To address this gap, Catalina Sea Ranch, LLC (CSR) will develop a novel family line system within the emerging model organism Mytilus galloprovincialis, which will be used to generate the framework for a genetics based selective breeding protocol.\nWithin this framework, there are 2 main goals for Phase II of SBIR funding: 1) to further develop family line resources in order to have the statistical power to identify specific genes responsible for commercial traits from Phase I; 2) to develop selective breeding protocols based on emerging techniques such as RNA interference and gene counting techniques in order to assess crop value at the earliest possible stages.",

If the density of nitrogen was measured directly, the accuracy of these measurements would be improved greatly. Southwest Sciences, Inc. proposes to develop a portable analyzer that would be used in conjunction with sonic anemometers to improve the performance of eddy covariance flux measurements. This instrument would use a new optical method to detect ambient nitrogen gas density with good precision and fast time response.

In Phase II, our Phase I developmental forecasts of impact variables created from CFS2 forecasts will become operational and available to customers. Computing the forecasts and verification over a historical period will demonstrate the remarkable skill and reliability achieved as a result of new and novel calibration techniques developed in Phase I.\nThe impact variable forecasts from operational CFS2 forecasts can then be combined with that forecast skill to show decision makers the expected consequences of acting at various predicted probabilities to seize opportunity or mitigate adverse events. Phase II will provide web-based interactive decision advisory systems tailored to industries such as energy, agriculture, transportation, insurance, and finance so that decision makers can assess alternative action, reduce climate variability risk, and increase profit, thus demonstrating that the value of our forecasts lies in the action they motivate and the favorable consequences that follow.",

        "abstract": "The underlying framework for modern-day weather forecasting is numerical weather prediction (NWP). Even the current and planned weather observing platforms leave gaps that are insufficient to meet the requirements of NWP. Mano Nanotechnologies, Inc. proposes to commercialize a new environmental sensing system, known as \u201cGlobalSense\u201d, which will enable transformational forecast improvements by filling these critical data gaps and benefit a broad range of applications with sensitivity to atmospheric conditions.\nThe GlobalSense system features an ensemble of completely disposable airborne probes, mechanisms to deploy probes, and receiver platforms to gather data from probes. The ultra-compact probes, called environmental Motes or eMotes, will function as passive drifters in the atmosphere using no active propulsion or flight. The novel eMote design exploits component miniaturization as well as integration of micro- and nanotechnology-based components in a bio-inspired form factor to minimize complexity, cost, size, mass, terminal velocity, and power consumption.\nThe Phase II project objective is to develop, test, and demonstrate a complete prototype GlobalSense system in the atmosphere. This objective will be met using mainly commercial off-the-shelf components with parallel and overlapping fabrication efforts on each system component following the specifications, component lists, and other design documentation resulting from the Phase I effort.",

The Army has identified the need to develop a simple, easy-to-use, portable screening device to assess military personnel in the field.  Such a device should provide an objective measure of mTBI and concussion so that it can be used by unskilled personnel to determine the level of care needed by the patient, which will lead to better medical intervention and outcomes. Reliable, specific and accurate diagnosis of mTBI will require multiple tests that will measure structural, functional and quantitative components associated with this diverse injury.  In this project, we plan the design and development of a portable Neuro-Vestibular Integrated Test (NVIT) system that will effectively address diagnosis of mTBI and visual/vestibular deficit.

The solution will spontaneously vent the entire rocket motor case in the event of a fuel fire making it applicable for both small and large diameter motors. The concept leverages CRGs extensive advanced composite manufacturing expertise, scalable nanocomposite fabrication technology, and IM mitigation experience as well as the commercial partners experience as a major energetic material and system manufacturer. The resulting system will offer a scalable solution for FCO mitigation that can be used with a variety of composites manufacturing techniques. Because the materials are also toughening agents, the case will not suffer weak spots or parasitic weight. In Phase I CRG demonstrated the feasibility of the concept.  In Phase II CRG will optimize material properties and fabrication methods to fabricate and test up to a 21 case prototype.",

Such sensors will serve the urgent needs for (1) measuring ballistic impact pressure on clay when testing personnel protective equipment including body armor inserts and helmets, (2) collecting blast impact pressure distribution data for better understanding of traumatic brain injuries and body injuries, and (3) wearable sensors for measuring extreme impact pressure on soldiers for further improving their protective equipment. As the first to develop the film sensor technology for the measurement of such extreme impact events, the proposal team identified key technical challenges including the lack of sensing materials suited for measuring the extreme impact pressure and a dynamic calibration model for accurate calibration of the measured pressure. In Phase I, the team has successfully demonstrated the feasibilities of new sensing materials and models in measuring high impact pressure with fast time response and high measurement accuracy. Phase II will focus on the development of deformable and conformable multi-point film sensors and miniaturized multifunctional control units for applications in armor/helmet ballistic and blast tests.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are being used extensively by the military for operations in theatre, but they are largely remotely piloted.  In particular, for smaller UAVs, added autonomy would make them much more useful.  Current FAA regulations make commercial operation of UAVs very difficult and expensive, and a prerequisite for changing the status quo would be added autonomy.  The development of small, low-cost, low-power navigation systems that can impart key functions necessary for a UAV to safely navigate a diverse and potentially congested airspace is needed.  Key functions include obstacle avoidance, dynamic mapping and navigation, and automated takeoff and landing.  Creare has teamed with Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University to develop an advanced navigation system that takes advantage of recent developments in small, low-power, low-cost sensor technology, and improved performance of computer hardware and combines these with the latest developments in vision-aided navigation, adaptive terrain mapping, vision-based obstacle avoidance, and biological-inspired flight control algorithms.  We propose to enhance the development of a small, lightweight, low-power, and low-cost navigation suite demonstrated in Phase I into a complete system able to provide navigation in an a priori, unknown, dynamic environment to allow safe autonomy to small UAVs.",

        "abstract": "In an era of reduced Defense budgets and increasing threats, military planners are seeking new technologies to reduce operating costs and increase operation capabilities for space and aviation platforms, and weight reduction is an attractive target. For example, transportation costs to geosynchronous orbits using a NASA reusable launch vehicle are close to $10,000 per pound of payload. Copper wiring, which makes up as much as one-third of the weight of a 15-ton satellite and 20 miles of an F-22 aircraft, is a clear target for weight reduction. Half of this wire weight is typically in the EMI shielding. Developing new lightweight, conductive materials that replace copper in the shielding and core conductor could serve as a lead candidate for radically reducing this weight. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) combine high strength, electrical and thermal conductivity with low density, which makes them ideal for applications where weight reduction is a priority. DexMat is commercializing CNT technology that has shown the highest published values for conductivity and mechanical strength of CNT materials. This Phase II Proposal will continue developing CNT-based cables with solution-processing technology capable of producing high performance CNT fibers and coatings, without the use of binders and wetting agents.",

Part of the proposed effort, the validation test campaign, will produce key validation points from thermo-mechanical coupon tension, compression, and shear testing of a next-generation material system(s) at temperature and provide insight into material performance under complex loading conditions. The project will also demonstrate the feasibility of using the material models in a full-scale thermo-mechanical simulation of a notional reentry structure. Lastly, the toolset (including source code and demonstration models) will be provided to Navy personnel for beta testing.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic stall in rotorcraft blades still remains a challenging problem for the US Army since it limits the operability, maneuverability and flight speed of the rotorcraft. There are numerous documented instances of large impulsive blade pitching moments and loss of lift resulting from dynamic stall events.  In this proposal our primary goal is experimental testing and verification of the performance of optimized airfoil sections that delay the onset of stall.  The experiments are critical since the margins for design improvement are small but the overall payoff in alleviating dynamic stall remains very significant for the reliable operation of the current fleet of rotorcraft.  A comprehensive analysis of the modified rotor blade with the optimized airfoil sections will be carried out to ensure suppression of dynamic stall events.    Furthermore, the transient aerodynamic loads and detailed PIV visualization obtained from dynamic testing can be used to improve turbulence modeling procedures and better understand the transient events that initiate the processes that ultimately lead to the formation of the large-scale dynamic stall vortex and result in full blown dynamic stall.  Lastly, the CFD-code used in dynamic stall design with its upgraded turbulence models will be integrated into the Helios Framework.",

While current AFFF fire containment and extinguishing techniques can be used to put out the fires, they do little to alleviate the remaining heat from the structure and surrounding area, leading to long wait times after extinguishing the fire before rescue personnel can safely enter the wreckage.  To best fit the needs of rescue personnel, man-portable systems need to be supplied with fire suppression agents capable of not only extinguishing the fire but also limiting thermal exposure of first responders by cooling and shielding hot objects,  allowing the wreckage to be able to be traversed and handled shortly after extinguishing.     Lynntechs solution is to incorporate low cost intumescent nanocomposites of exfoliated synthetic clay nanoparticles with low thermal conductivities into existing AFFF systems.

        "abstract": "Currently, the United States Army encounters many scenarios where soldiers must enter hazardous areas, yet still maintain isolation from contaminants such as chemical and biological agents as well as hazardous material exposure. This requires that the soldiers respiratory tract be isolated to prevent exposure to these contaminants. In order to accomplish this, the soldiers wear protective suits and/or masks which include a respiratory isolation system, more commonly called a rebreather.  Inherently, current rebreather technologies fall short in several areas primarily caused by the CO2 scrubbers used, creating both discomfort and unsafe conditions for the soldier.   Lynntech has developed a safe and novel solution to address the above concerns by creating a regenerable scrubber based off high surface area macroporous ion exchange resins.  Lynntech will further development efforts by designing and optimizing a new long-duration rebreather system that incorporates Lynntechs regenerable resins for CO2 capture.  This will entail the full investigation of the most optimal rebreather design and canister configuration to reduce potential negative effects for human use.  Furthermore, the regenerability of the sorbent will be optimized, with development of regeneration processes and equipment for sustained use and reuse.",

Miniaturization of Nokomis Hiawatha sensor to a System-on-a-Chip (SoC), called the Hiawatha-on-a-Chip (HoC), enables constant monitoring of low power RF emissions from protected devices to detect intrusion attempts in real time.  Under this program, Nokomis will fabricate the prototype HoC sensor through a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) Integrated Circuit  (IC) fabrication process and demonstrate its ability to detect, identify, and diagnose the minute changes in the RF environment of computational assets caused by intrusion attempts.

        "abstract": "\"MDA interceptors require lighter weight TSRM and ACS components to achieve performance goals for next generation SM3. Lower density, higher temperature internal insulation materials will reduce weight in the DACS and ACS components. In ongoing MDA SBIR programs, SDC is developing a composite insulated pressure accumulator (PA) for SM3. The composite overwrap has proven to be lighter weight compared to a metal design; however, the insulation inside the composite PA accounts for a large percentage of the PA weight. To address MDAs need for lightweight SM3 propulsion pressure vessels, SDC recently completed a Phase I program which demonstrated feasibility of reducing the PA insulation weight by 55% through thermal analysis, subscale component manufacturing, and hot gas testing. SDC is proposing a Phase II SBIR program to continue technology development to reduce weight of insulated composite through the following innovations: non-traditional insulations which have higher temperature capabilities and lower densities compared to traditional EPDM rubber insulations; insulation characterization through analysis and coupon testing; manufacturability and insulation integration into flight weight components; and hot gas testing to quantify insulation capabilities.\"",

Hypergolic fuels are used in these missiles for inducing spontaneous ignition. These fuels are toxic, and require monitoring of leakage. InnoSense LLC (ISL) has developed a prototype sensor following Lockheed Martin (LM) specifications. ISL sensors are designed to serve as a drop-in replacement for the existing LM sensors. Tests show that ISL sensors detect 10300 ppm MMH and 10100 ppm NO2 within 10 minutes at temperatures ranging from -46 C to +71 C. They exhibit long-term operational stability and capability of withstanding shock and vibration under laboratory conditions. When tested at LM Advanced Technology Center, the prototype sensors detected 235 ppm MMH and 97 ppm NO2 at 35 C and 235 ppm MMH at -46 C. This sensor system needs ruggedization and construction of multiple prototype units for rigorous testing followed by independent validation. Toward that in this project, refined, optimized and ruggedized working prototype units will be developed.  LM has endorsed this project and through a support letter expressed intent to continue working with ISL. A highly skilled engineering and commercialization team has been assembled for executing the proposed project.",

        "abstract": "Summary\n Many samples taken from individuals and animals are stored by treating them with a chemical  formalin \nand then encasing them in paraffin or wax  these are called formalin fixed paraffin encased  FFPE  samples \nUsually this storage is very good for preserving them for observation under microscopes  but it presents some\nproblems in terms of analysis of their DNA  Genetic analyses are important because many of these preserved\nsamples are biopsies of cancer tissue  and cancers are diseases brought on by changes in the DNA  By\nunderstanding the genetic content of these samples  we can look for specific DNA sequences that can be used\nto diagnose cancer  We can also use the information in these samples to determine what therapies might work\nbest  and to measure how well the therapies applied are working \n There are some instruments and kits of reagents available for getting at the DNA in FFPE samples  but\nthey are usually complicated  Often they use dangerous chemicals  They are inconsistent in the quality of\nDNA extracted  which can sometimes end up broken into small pieces or bound with proteins that make them\nunusable for genetic analysis techniques like sequencing  where the order of the different components of DNA\nare read out  Often they just extract too little of the DNA  And they require significant hands on time \n Adaptive Focused Acoustics  AFA  is an ultrasonic technology that focuses sound energy onto small\nvolumes  It is used for many processes like breaking up tissue samples to extract proteins and DNA and\ngrinding solids into uniformly sized particles  Recently AFA was applied to FFPE samples in a process\nperformed manually  The process removes the paraffin and breaks the tissue down to extract the DNA  It\nprovides     times as much DNA as other methods  and that DNA is of higher quality \n This project will develop a system that uses AFA for FFPE samples with a special instrument and a special\nplastic cartridge  Air pressure on the instrument will move the liquids in the cartridge  and AFA will remove the\nwax  extract the DNA  and mix the liquids and reagents in the cartridge  The DNA that AFA removes from\nsamples will also be purified by binding to little magnetic beads  which are held in place by magnets on the\nmachine  This makes the extracted DNA ready for use in other applications  like DNA sequencing  This\ninstrument and cartridge will provide a reliable  reproducible  and labor saving way to use FFPE samples that\nare very valuable and sometimes irreplaceable and that can be used for research or by doctors in diagnosing\nand treating patients \n We will do this by breaking down the whole process into small pieces and developing those individually \nThe pieces are the extraction of DNA using AFA  chemical treatment to remove proteins and to break any\nchemical bonds between the DNA and itself or remaining protein contamination  and purifying the DNA  The\nperformance of each step will be compared to the manual method  The ways we will measure the\nperformance include determining just how much DNA there is by adding a fluorescent dye and measuring the\nfluorescence  measuring the length of the DNA molecules  which tells us if they are too broken up to be used\nfor other applications   measuring the contamination by residual protein by seeing how much UV light is\nabsorbed by the DNA solutions  and finally by using a DNA amplification method called quantitative PCR that\nonly works well if the DNA is intact and not bound to other contaminants in the sample  We will also sequence\na few samples that have been processed by the prototype  When all of the pieces have been developed\nindividually  they will be put together \n For the project  the cartridge to do this work will be made using a computerized milling or cutting machine\nthat can make high quality models of structures with features of size less than that of the diameter of a human\nhair  When the cartridge is made into a product it will be made from molded plastic  The instrument will be run\nby a computer and modified from an existing Covaris AFA instrument \n If this project is successful  the next phase will be to solve manufacturing problems  including storing\nreagents on the cartridge  and scaling the cartridge up to many samples Extracting nucleic acids from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues is vital to cancer research  but it is\nusually labor intensive and suffers from low yield and poor quality  We will develop a robust  standardized\nsystem to extract and purify nucleic acids from these tissues  A cartridge based microfluidic system will\nimplement high frequency ultrasonic technology  Adaptive Focused Acoustics   which has already been proven\nto provide high quantity and quality extractions when used in manual protocols",

        "abstract": "To achieve MDAs mission, it is crucial that the BMDS be able to acquire and maintain accurate tracks on objects produced by a missile launch over the lifetime of the threat.  Certain missile events, such as break-ups and intercepts, have the potential to adversely affect the quality of situational awareness provided by the BMDS.  Therefore, Numerica Corporation proposes an advanced optimization and estimation solution for track refinement over a broad range of off-nominal break-up scenarios, including passive rotational effects, impulsive break-ups, compound break-ups involving multiple closely spaced events, and break-ups precipitated by the collision of two objects.  Our solution is founded on fundamental principles of physics, estimation theory, and methods of non-convex and combinatorial optimization. In particular, our approach is robust to the existence of sub-optimal local minima of the track refinement problem and is able to identify ambiguous solutions.  Our approach also addresses the joint track refinement and data association problem, thereby achieving improved association of ambiguous data near the break-up or collision event. Numerica plans to coordinate with MDA and a prime contractor for a program of record to demonstrate our proposed approach using operationally relevant data.",

Another area of interest is the measurement of oxidant levels in potable water to ensure safe levels are maintained. Current manual methods are not an efficient use of resources. These manual methods require consumables and are not real time. Commercially available sensors are unable to survive or accurately measure levels of oxidant in the 50 to 500 ppm range.

Conventional approaches require disassembling and re-assembling parts for inspection. In the past several years, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) technology has emerged from the research environment into initial applications in a wide variety of fields and can help alleviate this inspection burden. In this program Acellent has proposed to develop an innovative SHM based Multi-Physics-Based Intelligence Sensing System for Fatigue and Fastener Crack Detection in Multi-Layer structures to address fatigue crack detection under uncertainties related to environment, geometry, loading and boundary conditions etc. The goal is to accurately and reliably detect, locate and characterize corner cracks originating from fastener holes in multi-layer structures. The system will be designed for safe and optimum performance in aircraft and is supported by Boeing for future implementation on aircraft structures in concurrence with the U.S. Air Force Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP) requirements. Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of detecting cracks smaller than 0.1 in a lab environment. Phase II will focus on development of the complete system & testing, creating a complete prototype of the system and demonstrating capabilities in operational environments in compliance with the ASIP requirements.",

Although the Army has expended significant resources addressing threats in the cyber domain, current defense efforts are largely reactive. Augmenting our cyber defenses with tools that proactively analyze the intentions and behaviors of our adversaries and predict likely attack vectors on the network can alleviate the manual analytic burden on cyber specialists and increase the resilience of our networks. To address these needs, in Phase I we designed and demonstrated the feasibility of a system for Cyber Attacker and Network Vulnerability Analysis and Simulation (CANVAS). CANVAS is a tool for the analysis of cyber vulnerabilities and proactive development of defense strategies. CANVAS enables cyber defenders and policy makers to wargame intelligent models of attacker intentions and behaviors on a simulated network. This provides predictive analysis of attacks for cyber situation awareness and to make defensive recommendations. Based on our Phase I success, we propose a Phase II effort to develop and evaluate a full-scope system, the Cyber Attribution Network Training & Education Engine (CANTEEN), which extends CANVAS capabilities to: (1) identify correlations between live-data sources and adversary models to provide attack attributions; and (2) include support for training.",

The proposed Phase II program would build on the successful work in Phase I toward creation of a washout mandrel for the upper stage rocket motor of a land-based Aegis missile and bring it to the level of producing a full-scale motor-case mandrel prototype for testing and evaluation. We will undertake a series of tasks that will progress the technology toward the goal of adapting our Green-Aero(sm) tooling to move from shop- and small-run production to producing manufacturing quantities of robust, reproducible, readily manufacturable mandrels at reduced cost and shortened lead times. We further will be working to insuring that an increase in case cure temperatures will not require changing the washout mandrel solution derived for lower cure temperatures. We will also be developing a manufacturing cost model to estimate production costs and evaluate where efforts at further manufacturing improvements should be concentrated in Phase III. In this Phase we anticipate moving the TRL of 4-5 to 7 and the MRL from about 5 to 7.",

To achieve these results Sapient incorporates computational situation awareness (CSA) and smart interaction (SI). Computational SA acts as a surrogate user maintaining attention on the mission progress so that the warfighter doesnt always have to. When opportunities and issues are observed, CSA communicates information to the warfighter via audio and context-relevant visualizations so that the warfighter can make critical control decisions. Smart Interaction further enhances the warfighters command by providing natural, multimodal, and efficient methods of interaction with unmanned vehicles. Together, CSA and SI provide the ability for one warfighter to control several unmanned vehicles.",

One example is when test systems as a whole or tester subsystems become obsolete. A typical approach is to perform one off engineering investigation that requires extensive use of high value personnel and recurring effort that could be automated using technology based approaches. The automated technologies could also support various acquisition decision criteria where policy requires existing test equipment families to be evaluated during the ATS acquisition process. Additionally, as potential for inter-operational test programs increases, the need for tools that can deterministically characterize test program applicability for different test systems could greatly reduce manual efforts and eliminate potential to attempt usage of target systems whose capability is not a match for either specific test programs or envelopes of test requirements that encompass groups of test programs. Resulting technologies will empower developers, program managers and acquisition professionals in alleviating redundant effort, providing indisputable data for deterministic decision making and fostering improved interoperation.",

In order to support cross domain simulations, the SG had to meet several key requirements, including real-time communications, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for session establishment, and support TLS/SSL for encryption of data in transit. Many of these same features can be leveraged for similar real-time communications, such as desktop video teleconferencing (dVTC).  The DoD has an urgent requirement for a secure high definition dVTC that is seamless, interoperable, efficient and responsive to joint and  coalition Warfighter requirements. Currently there are no certified cross domain dVTC capabilities available.  Trident Systems proposes to develop an enhanced capability based on the N04-054 Phase I results and our DoD certified cross-domain collaboration technology, Voice and Video Cross Domain Solution (V2CDS). The innovation to be exploited is Tridents proven Assured Pipeline filtering technology to mitigate covert channels in cross-domain VTC communications.

The heart of the system is a high accuracy true-time delay unit which provides simultaneous fine time delay granularity and long maximum time delays. The signal path is completely analog with no frequency conversion, hence is free of any digital artifacts and has minimal spurious components.  Since the system is based on wideband true time delay, the false target will be naturally consistent over multiple radars operating over multiple frequency bands, which is next to impossible task for a traditional DRFM system.   Additionally, ORFM also supports advanced ECM jamming waveform generation techniques, including supporting multiple false targets, support of independent Range Gate Pull-In/Out (RGPI/O) profiles for each false target, support of coordinated and uncoordinated Velocity Gate Pull-In/Out (VGPI/O), and flexible velocity and acceleration support to allow direct kinematic equation profile operation.

Ultimately, the FASTER Toolkit will allow any user to be able to convert an existing or new computing system/software to utilize state-of-the-art acceleration devices in a more efficient manner.  The second component of this project consists of constructing an HPC single-simulation node consisting of multiple CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs, and Altera FPGAs.  Once the single-simulation node is constructed, CEI will perform a complete software port of the missile simulation software code using the FASTER toolkit.  Once the performance and limitations of the design have been thoroughly accessed, a technology demonstration will be conducted within an MDA facility or other appropriate venue.

        "abstract": "As the price of helium has increased substantially in recent years, the interest in finding an efficient and economical method of helium recovery has never been more important.  One method that can reduce the cost of rocket test operations is to recover hydrogen and helium gases using an electrochemical process.  Sustainable Innovations is developing a commercial electrochemical platform that separates and compresses hydrogen using Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) technology for industrial applications such as metals and electronics processing. A Helium Recovery System (HRS), based on the same platform and constructed by Sustainable Innovations, selectively removes hydrogen from the mixed H2/He stream, leaving behind the high-value helium.  The system then removes residual water vapor from this helium and compresses it to commercial storage pressure.  This system featured a subsystem that captured the vented hydrogen and helium gas mixture, an electrochemical separation subsystem that purified both hydrogen and helium streams, and a compression subsystem that permitted high pressure gas delivery. A critical next step in the advancement of the HRS design is proving the scalability of this technology.  The innovative step in this proposal is to increase the gas capacity capability of the electrochemical separation system while maintaining optimal operating efficiency and durability.  It is expected that at least a doubling of throughput capacity per unit cell area ? largely driven by the amount of current that can be practically applied to an individual cell area without hindering longevity of critical components, can be achieved. This performance will be validated by cell durability tests. The innovation will be scaled in Phase II and integrated into a low-cost, scalable, modular package that will be delivered to SSC.",

Specifically, the thermal control fluid must maintain excellent thermal properties for heat rejection under peak conditions while at the same time remain liquid at extremely low temperatures. Currently used fluids either do not meet the low temperature requirement (glycol/water mixture) or do not have thermal properties conducive to a compact, efficient system (Galden). Mainstream has identified several promising next generation thermal fluids using computation chemical techniques. Mainstream has already demonstrated in Phase I that these fluids are superior to incumbent fluids. In Phase II, Mainstream will perform more long term durability, compatibility and performance studies in a simulated test-loop representative of conditions encountered on NASA spacecraft.",

        "abstract": "This Phase II program will develop novel laser transmitters needed for planned airborne and space-based active remote sensing missions. This program will build on successful Phase I work to provide a Technology Readiness Level 4 (TRL-4) laboratory brassboard demonstrator of a new laser source for Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) measurements of atmospheric water vapor with secondary capability for methane characterization as well. Accurate measurements of both atmospheric constituents are critical to the understanding of global energy transport and climate change. Under our Phase I program, Fibertek successfully demonstrated the capability of a new laser source, a diode-pumped frequency-doubled Er:YAG laser to generate millijoule output near 823 nm that was tunable through water-vapor absorption lines for DIAL measurements. The new laser system offers simplicity and efficiency that will reduce risk for future airborne and space-based missions. Significantly, the new laser approach offers an upgrade path with reduction in size, weight, and power (SWaP) consumption over current state-of-the-art DIAL based on less-efficient non-linear parametric conversion of diode-pumped Nd:YAG lasers. This new-generation technology reduces the size and weight of flight hardware to make it compatible with affordable, more capable airborne and satellite payloads. In Phase II we propose to build on our successful Phase I demonstration to develop a full scale water vapor laser transmitter source, meeting or exceeding requirements for planned DIAL instruments.",

        "abstract": "Planetary missions (e.g., Pioneer, Cassini, or Voyager) and applications with moderate power draw and increased mobility requirements (e.g., Curiosity) have successfully employed radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) as thermal-to-electric power converters. While ~100 We-class radioisotope power sources continue to be in demand, new higher power electric generators (&#8805;500 We) will enable, and enhance, numerous robotic space applications and are ideally suited for upcoming Discovery- through Flagship-class missions.  These &#8805;500 We generators will require both increased source power and increased conversion efficiencies.  State-of-the-art thermoelectric generators, for instance, achieve ~7% efficiency, and recent laboratory results are paving a route toward ~15% efficiency. Alternatively, promising results from Lee et al1 and other groups have shown that thermionic thermal-to-electric (TTEC) generators are capable of achieving high conversion efficiency (>25%) at temperatures &#8805;1200 ?C by leveraging modern microfabrication techniques.  An additional benefit is that the high-quality ?waste heat? from these thermionic systems is rejected at ~800 ?C, which opens the door to its use as a topping stage for more traditional converters, including thermoelectrics, dramatically raising the ceiling on total system conversion efficiency. To further advance NASA?s high-power solid-state thermal-to-electric conversion capabilities, Nanohmics Inc., working in collaboration with The Boeing Company (Huntington Beach, CA) and Sandia National Labs? Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies (CINT) proposes to demonstrate a high-efficiency thermionic thermal-to-electric converter (TTEC) module based on nanostructured, high survivability emission materials. TTEC realization will open up new opportunities for deep space planetary science missions, and future manned spaceflight voyages that are no longer tethered to the sun by photovoltaics.",

        "abstract": "The NASA SBIR Phase I project addressed the technical feasibility of an innovative torrefaction (mild pyrolysis) processing system that can be used to sterilize feces and produce a stable, odor-free solid product than can be easily stored or recycled, while simultaneously recovering moisture and producing small amounts of other useful products. The Phase I project demonstrated that mild heating (200-250 C) was adequate for torrefaction of a fecal simulant and other analogs of human solid waste (canine feces). The net result was a nearly undetectable odor, complete recovery of moisture, some additional water production, a modest reduction of the dry solid mass and the production of small amounts of gas (mainly CO2) and liquid (mainly water). The amount of solid vs gas plus liquid products can be controlled by adjusting the torrefaction conditions (final temperature, holding time). The solid product was a dry material that did not support microbial growth and was hydrophobic relative to the starting material. In the case of canine feces, the solid product was a mechanically friable material that could be easily compacted to a significantly smaller volume (~50%). In addition, the torrefaction method can be applied using the same or similar conditions to other types of wet solid wastes and is compatible with the Universal Waste Management System (UWMS), now under development by NASA. The torrefaction process could also be accomplished with minimal crew interactions and modest energy requirements, which could be improved even further in an optimized and innovative Phase II Torrefaction Processing Unit (TPU), which is the objective of the current proposal.",

        "abstract": "Naval unmanned vehicle operators require advanced mission displays to effectively collaborate with planning and execution automation in complex and dynamic operating environments. To address this, we will extend our previous successful efforts to develop Advanced Mission Display and Planning Tools (AMPT) that reduce the workload of managing heterogeneous manned and unmanned vehicle teams. These decision-support interfaces will intuitively convey complex behavior-shaping events and operational constrains, enabling operators to efficiently perceive system status, identify response requirements, and direct automated planning tools. Under this proposed Phase II AMPT effort, we will expand prior analyses to characterize operators need for observability and directability of automation within a broader set of targeted mission domains and control settings. We will leverage this analysis to extend and refine our design of AMPT ecological mission displays for supervisory control of heterogeneous manned and unmanned vehicle teams. Finally, we will expand the breadth and depth of our AMPT mission display software prototypes and integrate these with representative Navy planning technologies, such as the Common Control System (CCS). We will use these integrated prototypes to demonstrate and evaluate our mission display approaches with subject matter experts and representative users, directly informing the development of unmanned control stations and workflows.",

Many CNT based technologies have diminished properties due to a density of CNT-CNT junctions. Current CNT production techniques are limited in either CNT length or scalability. Development of a scalable method for production of ULCNTs based on Mainstreams proprietary technique will allow for their integration into current CNT based application and open a range of new applications in wiring, composites, and thermal control. In Phase I, Mainstream demonstrated the novel reactor design and its potential to fabricate ULCTNs. In the proposed Phase II, Mainstream seeks to further their understanding of the reactor conditions and catalyst/substrate interactions in order to extend the ultimate length of the fabricated ULCNTs. Mainstreams past experience in CNT synthesis for composites and electrical storage makes them uniquely suited to developing the ULCNT synthesis method.",

TRACER is based on the Bayesian-based mathematical framework of finite set statistics (FISST).  The Missile Defense Agencys command, control, battle management, and communications (C2BMC) system has many missions in support of ballistic missile defense engagements.  Focusing on off-nominal breakup events of tracked targets, the reconstruction of these events needs to be able to supply a best estimate of the time of the breakup event and the state of the parent target at the time of breakup.  Since multiple data streams feed the C2BMC system, the target tracking needs to be performed in a framework of multi-sensor filtering.  This framework also needs to be able to handle the post breakup multi-target problem.  As a result, new approaches are needed for multi-target, multi-sensor data fusion and event reconstruction that provide the C2BMC system the means necessary to inform battle management on a real-time basis of off-nominal target breakup events.  Phase II will conclude with testing using realistic MDA data from multiple sensors.",

        "abstract": "The Navy currently uses a variety of aviation data collectors to record operational data that is analyzed to enable MFOQA, accident investigations, condition based maintenance, and other data analysis functions. Many of the data collector applications have closed file formats that change periodically and cannot be used without OEM equipment or assistance. These aviation file formats have common, discoverable, underlying characteristics which, when analyzed, can aid in the self-discovery of unknown formats. New research and development is required to create a software tool capable of exploiting these underlying characteristics to enable decoding these files without reliance on the OEM. We propose to continue the development of such a tool implementing Intelligent Data File Interpretation (IDFI), a software technology capable of identifying and decoding arbitrary binary files from aviation data collectors. Our IDFI technology focuses on the use of statistical analysis techniques to make inferences about the content of the file that would be difficult or impossible for a human to do alone. In addition, it combines other techniques (such as human-aided decoding) with the statistical analysis research in order to create a file format decoder that is robust against changes in file formats or the introduction of new formats.",

An unobtrusive system to measure, assess, and predict Astronaut cognitive workload can indicate when steps should be taken to augment cognitive readiness. This system can also support testing and engineering (T&E); engineers can accurately evaluate the cognitive demands of new tools and systems, as well as how they affect task performance. In our Phase I effort, Charles River Analytics designed and demonstrated a system for Cognitive Assessment and Prediction to Promote Individualized Capability Augmentation and Reduce Decrement (CAPT PICARD). CAPT PICARD: (1) robustly and unobtrusively performs real-time synchronous data collection with a suite of sensors to provide a holistic assessment of the Astronaut; (2) extracts, fuses, and interprets the best combination of indicators of Astronaut state; (3) comprehensively predicts performance deficits, optimizing the likelihood of mission success; and (4) displays the data to support the information requirements of any user. The solicitation defined the following Phase I goals: review physiological, neurophysiological, and cognitive assessments in extreme environments and long duration missions; design an algorithm to assess workload. We did focus on these goals; however, we went beyond them to also demonstrate a functional prototype by the end of Phase I. Based on the success of this Phase I effort, we recommend a Phase II effort to refine and develop each component of CAPT PICARD, and iteratively evaluate this system in an undergraduate lab, at a T&E lab at Johnson Space Center (JSC), and in a mission-like analog environment at JSC. Successful completion of these tasks will result in a tool that can both dramatically improve Astronaut mission readiness and the design and development of tools Astronauts use to carry out mission objectives.",

The current solution for burn-related pain is the administration of systemic opioid drugs, which have significant side effects and are highly addictive. A potential solution to this problem is localized, topical delivery of analgesics directly to the wound site via a burn dressing. In the Phase I project, KeraStat hydrogels demonstrated the ability to deliver opioids in a mouse model to provide topical analgesia. Further, these opioid-loaded KeraStat hydrogels provided sustained pain relief when compared to topical treatment with the opioid alone, demonstrating the effectiveness of the delivery system. Given the proof of in vivo efficacy from the Phase I project, this Phase II project seeks to confirm in vivo testing in a rat burn model using the most promising formulation of KeraStat + morphine.

        "abstract": "In summary, increased energy storage to meet the initial Phase I requirements was demonstrated as readily achievable through several approaches. The approach that offers the greatest benefit in terms of providing additional energy and maximum design flexibility was the conformal/structural cells shaped as and replacing the wing elements. The cell becomes the entire wing element, which provides the mechanical strength and stiffness needed for the munition. In demanding applications, such as munitions and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), it is advantageous to use components that can provide multi-functionality. A second approach demonstrated was a half cylindrical tube-shape that could be part of or wrapped around the body of the munition. Thus far in the development, the lithium-ion battery has demonstrated sufficient power, energy density and structural stiffness. The optimization of cell characteristics/design demonstrated as much as a 50% increase in energy density over commercial off the shelf (COTS) cells. The GEC, in its present configuration, was found to add little to the stand alone lithium ion battery in this application and has been directed toward other applications, such as the fast charging system. Further increases in energy density were demonstrated with the \"naked\" cell design and are possible with the implementation of silicon anodes.",

There is a considerable need to develop an imaging system that can yield low distortion imagery while achieving low size, weight, and power criteria. Vecna proposes OmniEye, a camera for acquiring high-definition imagery for omnidirectional situational awareness. OmniEye achieves a hemispherical field-of-view by digitally compositing, in real-time, multiple images acquired from 17 calibrated image sensors. At the size of a quarter coin, OmniEye delivers 5 megapixel color spherical images at 30 frames per second. OmniEye corrects image distortion and aberrations in software by leveraging mobile GPUs. OmniEye features an intelligent frame grabbing mechanism that selects individual sensors in the array based on the viewing region. This capability significantly reduces the data transfer rate and processing requirements. When coupled with a VR display, this mechanism enables fast, responsive digital pan-tilt-zoom capabilities determined by the user's gaze direction. Also, OmniEye features a saliency detection module cues a user's attention to areas of interest in the view sphere using state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms for object detection and tracking.",

A preliminary system was successfully demonstrated in Phase I. In Phase II, the primary goal is to demonstrate the benefits of using a customized pressure sensor installed in live patient sockets to guide upper limb prosthetists during the fitment process. However the envisioned diagnostic solution goes beyond the traditional consultation by providing continuous pressure data over several days to the prosthetist. That dynamic pressure data stream will allow the prosthetist to immediately address comfort issues and update the socket accordingly. The final step in this novel fitment process solution is the 3D printing of the improved sockets.

It is often desirable to execute graph analytics applications on a wide range of hardware platforms (from supercomputers to mobile devices).  The equivalence between a graph and the associated sparse matrix encoding a graph's adjacency list has prompted considerable interest in casting various graph algorithms in terms of sparse matrix operations.  We propose to identify a set of high-level matrix and graph primitives and to create efficient implementations of primitives for multiple platforms. This will serve the basis for a performance portable graph framework. A runtime graph analysis engine will also be developed and integrated into the framework (to select the best algorithms and data structures based on the graph and compute hardware). This will allow graph analytics experts to develop performance portable graph applications without concern for the low-level optimizations required to target their application to a particular hardware platform for multiple graph layouts.",

This tunable resin system has the capability to release pressure in a cook-off event within specific operational and trigger requirements.  Luna has demonstrated that this system will cover a wide range of mitigation solutions, enabling the technology to be tailored to a specific application.  These resins under development are comparable in cost to commercially available materials since they are comprised of traditional structural matrix chemistries and are compatible with standard composite manufacturing techniques.  In Phase II, Luna will work with MDA and Orbital ATK to further develop the technology for implementation into specific MDA and other DoD platforms.  A stepping stone approach will be utilized to demonstrate the technology on progressively larger sized composite motors while developing a full integration plan for the Ground Based Interceptor Orion motor.",

There is strong evidence that these shortfalls result due to deviation of the structure and chemical composition between the grown T2SL and its design.  Molecular dynamics-based molecular beam epitaxy growth simulations will be used to evaluate T2SL design and growth strategies that minimize this deviation.  The most promising strategies identified from the simulation results will be validated by experiments that will assess the theoretical understanding and optimize a growth process based on the predictions. Technology transfer to commercial T2SL material foundries will also take place.",

The work will address the following limitations of most commercially available FMS: they have limited advanced features; are specific to a single aircraft type; and cannot be readily modified by researchers. The proposed research will identify and extend advanced FMS features for the simulation evaluation of 4DTBO concepts in different phases of flight, based on the feasibility demonstration during Phase I work. Some of proposed feature include (i) advanced 4D guidance modes such as Required Time of Arrival (RTA), 4DFMS, and Interval Management (IM), (ii) high-fidelity wind modeling and wind update capability for improved predictability, (iii) trajectory negotiation, (iv) optimal 4D trajectory planning. Phase II work will develop a generic FMS interface to NASA's Multi-Aircraft Control System (MACS) to enable the evaluation of FMS modules from multiple vendors in 4DTBO simulations. The proposed FMS platform and the generic FMS interface will allow the users to deploy a wide array of autonomy enabling FMS features through a Graphical User Interface. All the algorithms and software developed under this research will be delivered to NASA at the end of the project.",

        "abstract": "To address the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) need for improved lightweight solutions for lightning mitigation for large missiles, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to advance the development of a new Grounding Multilayer Missile Coating for Lightning Strike Mitigation (GRAMS). GRAMS provides protection to large missiles against direct lightning strikes by offering a unique solution that consists of novel layered material that is highly electrically conductive, thermally insulating, extremely lightweight, and bonded to the existing missile skin. GRAMS has an outer surface that is electrically conductive and that can survive high launch temperature, and also can shield against electromagnetic pulse (EMP). In Phase I, POC fabricated and tested samples with a simulated lightning strike and tested at high temperature. In Phase II, POC will optimize the material and fabricate larger (~24 in. x 24 in.) test samples and a subscale prototype. These will be tested with high current (up to 200 kA) lightning tests. This technology offers missile survivability against direct lightning strikes, thermal effects, and debris, which directly addresses the MDA requirements. We will focus on developing a plan for integrating GRAMS into an MDA missile platform, and layout a commercialization plan to extend GRAMS to civilian markets.",

        "abstract": "Modern computer systems often incorporate multiple computational devices such as conventional processors, graphics processing units (GPUs), specialized accelerators, and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Programmers are able to exploit these new architectures for improved performance and reduced power consumption, but at the cost of increased programing complexity. Further complicating matters, architectural differences often require completely distinct kernel implementations to attain acceptable relative performance, even within the same family of devices, resulting in code that must be constantly maintained. Therefore, it is highly desirable to have a unified programming language and paradigm of sufficient abstraction such that software can be written effectively for the current target but can also be compiled for a multitude of possible other architectures. To address this need, we propose a portable, highly parallel, set of tools based on C++. Programs written in our specialized embedded domain-specific language (EDSL) can be used to rewrite portions of their programs, which will automatically be optimized for their target platforms. Using this EDSL leads to software that contains complete dependency information for each function within a program, allowing automated dataflow analysis, optimization, and code generation to be feasibly performed on a large scale.",

        "abstract": "The proposed model-based Fault Management system addresses the need for cost-effective solutions that enable higher levels of onboard spacecraft autonomy to reliably maintain operational capabilities. The system will provide onboard off-nominal state detection and isolation capabilities that are key components to assessing spacecraft state awareness. The ability to autonomously isolate spacecraft failures to component levels will enable faster recovery thereby reducing down time. Model-based systems can provide better fault coverage than traditional limit-checking systems. The proposed system in particular will result in a relatively compact software package because it relies only on modeling nominal behavior; fault models are not needed. Thus this approach has the capability to detect any off-nominal behavior including un-modeled faults. Health information produced by the FM system can be used to make resource allocation and planning and scheduling decisions by ground operations or by other on-board autonomy agents. The system can be built and tested standalone potentially reducing FM developmental and testing costs. The FM system provides an evolutionary approach to full onboard autonomy as it can first be implemented and tested in ground-based systems and then migrated onboard spacecraft. Onboard fault management will be crucial to NASA mission success particularly during critical times where the situation changes rapidly and unpredictably with no opportunity for operator support.",

Airport ramp areas are the most crowded and cluttered spaces in the entire National Airspace System (NAS). Operations associated with turnaround of the aircraft from the gate represent a significant source of delay and therefore impact the predictability of NAS operations. The computer-vision-based Gate Activity Monitoring TOol Suite (GAMTOS) will specifically identify the various stages of turnaround such as refueling, baggage handling, and deicing. It will further employ a probabilistic model of the times associated with each of these events, that will be used for predicting the future sequence of events and their predicted times of completion. We seek to leverage our expertise in monitoring aircraft using the Vision BAsed Surveillance System (VBASS) currently being developed under a Phase III SBIR research from NASA Ames Research Center. At the end of Phase II, the GAMTOS software is expected to operate in two different modes. The first mode is an offline mode, which generates a database of gate activities, their timings, and their sequence. The second mode is a real-time mode which involves continuous monitoring of activities and prediction of future activities.",

The relative magnitude of the two varies depending on altitude, temperature and the planet.  Usually radiation is more significant at lower pressures and at higher temperatures.  Gas conduction is more dominant at higher pressures and lower temperatures.  In most planetary entries, both modes of heat transfer are significant.   Typical flexible or rigid refractory ceramic fiber Thermal Protection System (TPS) such as Advanced Flexible Reusable Surface Insulation (AFRSI) and Shuttle tiles can take high temperatures, can reduce gas conduction at lower pressures, and scatter radiation at higher temperatures.   \nThere is a need for more efficient TPS with lower mass, reduced thickness and significantly lower thermal conductivity to make inter planetary missions possible.  In order to achieve this goal, insulations need to be developed that can further reduce gas conduction and radiation heat transfer compared to standard refractory ceramic fiber insulations. \n\nThe overall objective of the Phase II program is to migrate and optimize proven paper making concepts to fabricate robust, flexible and cost efficient, fiber reinforced aerogels, without sacrificing the thermal and mechanical qualities, in large sections suitable for application on High Speed Vehicles (HSV?s).  \n\nFurther investigation in Phase II would focus on production methods and recipe optimization for this new class of thermal insulations.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) equipment, such as Eddy Current (EC) and Ultrasonic Testing (UT), provide important tools for the Air Force to characterize flaws, cracks, and/or defects in aircraft, thus monitoring potential safety issues. This equipment is typically hand-held and used by maintenance crew in flight lines and hangars to inspect aircraft. The U.S. Air Force currently utilizes thousands of units of various NDI equipment in bases throughout the world. Most NDI equipment is powered by a battery (alkaline, NiCad, NiMH, or Li-ion). The Air Force is interested in finding alternative forms of energy for NDI equipment. In the proposed project, pH Matter and its partners will develop a new technology to function as a power source for NDI equipment.  The proposed energy storage technology will be used for commercial applications, including NDI equipment, UAVs, and portable consumer electronics. The technology will provide the benefits of improved energy density, faster recharging, and lesser logistical burden compared to existing battery technologies.; BENEFIT: The technology will improve energy density, recharging time, and offer grid independence.  The technology could be used in commercial applications, such as NDI equipment, UAVs, and other portable consumer electronics.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The Rapid Engineered Additive Legacy Tubes (REAL Tubes) program will addresses significant problems faced by the sustainment community. Tubes are essential for propulsion and aircraft systems, conveying fuel, hydraulic and lubricating fluids, and air throughout engines to ensure effective operation in a wide range of environments.  The Air Force currently sustains some 20,000 legacy engines which typically have as many as 200 tubes as part of the external envelope of the engine.  Tubes must be maintained in the field and during overhaul and maintenance in the depots.  Failure of a single tube during a mission can lead to loss of an engine, and ultimately loss of an aircraft.  Tubes have long lead times that can extend the maintenance cycle or lead to a system on the ground that is not operationally ready. By applying additive manufacturing in an innovative way, the critical path item for tubesthe tooling necessary to produce themcan be delivered on demand, real-time through the combination of a CAD model and proven 3D printing capability, significantly reducing the lead time for tubes and dramatically improving operational readiness for the warfighter.; BENEFIT: During feasibility demonstration in a commercial production environment, the REAL Tubes methodology, using 3D printed tooling, reduced lead times by 54% compared to current methods.  Tooling costs were reduced by as much as 80%.  Commercial application has been proven; the next step is to extend the technology into the sustainment community.  The potential is significant--the Air Force manages some 20,000 legacy engines, with each having up to 200 tubes.  If the application for the sustainment community affects only 5% of these tubes, the benefit will be realized by at least 200,000 tubes.",

        "abstract": "The Air Force faces challenges related to selecting, maintaining and repairing coatings that protect and enhance the performance of critical components in gas turbine engines. Coatings must maintain performance despite experiencing several degrading mechanical, thermal and chemical impacts.  In Phase I, CFDRC demonstrated feasibility of a physics-based model to compute damage progression under stress from the microscale to macroscale. The team demonstrated the use of CFD to determine conditions at the surface of a part, and identified a way to link surface conditions from CFD simulations to the damage state of the material based on the stress state. In Phase II, CFDRC proposes to deliver a multiscale material modeling toolkit to predict damage leading to delamination of multilayered coating systems when subjected to harsh service environments. The response of the material system to damaging stress is modeled beginning at the length scale of the microstructure using peridynamics to predict fracture nucleation and progression. The project will validate the accuracy of the modeling toolkit to predict damage progression against a burner rig analysis of a characterized coating system. The validated model will be demonstrated on a repaired coating system to assess its applicability to challenging service applications.",

The objective is to develop full size panel(s), with unique integrated tooling that will facilitate an optimized and accurate fabrication process, where the materials and design configuration are tailored for durability and damage tolerance at specified static and dynamic load requirements for the CH-53K Cargo floor system. Advanced composite materials are considered to take maximum advantage of their tailor-ability to achieve a durable/damage tolerant configuration that is significantly lighter than the current CH-53K aluminum floor panels with Hybrid glass-graphite/ Thermoplastic designs. FEA and classical analysis performed in Phase-1 continues in Phase-II, developing an integrated tooling system to fabricate the floor panel assembly and meet the CH53 configuration requirements with added durability and impact resistance. Validation will start with fabrication of 5 test panels that will be tested and validated, followed by a full-scale Treadway floor panel development that can be tested in the operational environment of the CH53K.

However, because it is often difficult to relate theoretical advances to warfighter advantages, MDA is challenged to determine the value of certain investments. A critical need is an evaluation tool that can assess early-development radar algorithms, using consistent metrics, so that promising investments can be quickly differentiated from less useful options.  In this program Numerica will develop a BMD radar algorithm test environment for use in variety of programs.  The tool will provide an open architecture and modular operating framework. The software will be unclassified (but representative), distributable, and will provide a variety of warfighter-relevant performance metrics. Numerica offers a high-value solution in this program because we will develop a system based on an existing, mature simulation environment. This environment was developed to serve as our Track Management Development Environment for MDA and Army air and missile defense programs.  Numericas solution already supports an open architecture, has a sophisticated electronically scanned array radar model, includes complete default algorithm components, supports web-based visualization, and includes a metrics suite.

Our innovation is researched through achievement of five objectives and associated work efforts. The first objective is the refinement of use cases for the big data application. We draw upon our knowledge gained in Phase I research and continued interactions with aviation stakeholders to narrow the use cases to specific applications that are a challenge to NASA and the broader aviation community related to RSSA, SMARTNAS, and other ATM research efforts. The second objective is to create a Big Data technology-driven architecture and processing capabilities for the more specific use cases developed to meet objective 1. The third objective is to achieve a subcomponent demonstration for each refined use case so that we can measure the benefit of using these techniques to solve ATM analytics challenges.

        "abstract": "The advancement of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) with computing power and communications hardware has enabled an increased capability set for multi-vehicle collaborative operations. By cooperatively allocating unmanned resources, vehicle tasking, and planning the subsequent vehicle paths, the efficiency of UAS operations can be maximized. Heron Systems proposes to develop the Multi-Agent Cooperative Engagement (MACE) framework into a mature prototype that enables collaborative resource allocation, task allocation, and path planning for unmanned systems operating in dynamic environments subject to diverse communication conditions. This Phase 2 work will focus on refining the path planning portion of MACE as well as maturing the resource and task allocation library developed during Phase 1. The path planning architecture will define key modules to plan paths to a global objective, assess potential obstacles, and avoid collisions while maintaining progress towards the global objective. The framework will be constructed in a modular fashion to allow a plug-and-play capability for the resource/task allocation as well as the various components of the path planning pipeline, giving end users the flexibility to explore other methods for UAS collaboration. At the conclusion of Phase 2, the MACE framework will be demonstrated using Heron Systems? HWIL simulation/stimulation environment. Once verified via the HWIL environment, the MACE framework will be deployed onboard several aerial assets and tested against scenarios specifically tailored towards precision agriculture applications.",

Modeling and simulation plays a significant role in the Missile Defense Agencys ability to maintain and ensure their mission readiness and to expand mission capability. While powerful, specialized, and inexpensive COTS computing hardware is readily available to address this need, what is lacking is a capability for efficiently harnessing that the power of that hardware for running computationally-intensive software applications. DASH is a software platform that closes this capability gap by efficiently distributing computational tasks in a software program among the hardware computing resources available on that system. DASH combines existing mature and cutting-edge technologies to provide a unified and effective platform for acceleration of computational tasks. DASH provides an interface to hardware systems built from COTS components, enabling software application to obtain hardware-accelerated performance regardless of hardware configuration or computational workload. DASH will enable MDA to obtain orders-of-magnitude improvements in the performance and capabilities of M&S software by integrating inexpensive commercial hardware acceleration components into their distributed computing system.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have the potential to significantly impact modern society. While the technology for unmanned air vehicles operating day in and day out without constant human supervision is maturing steadily, much remains to be done to make these vehicles commonplace. We have identified a number of challenges that must be addressed for these vehicles to safely and efficiently conduct their tasks in the National Airspace System (NAS). Civilian applications of UAS must ensure that they can: (1) fly safely without an operator, using but not relying on maps or GPS to guide their course; and (2) deal with contingencies, especially rare events such as complete failure of sensors that provide awareness of the environment. We plan to address these challenges in the context of small, low-cost air vehicles in a manner that will enable our technology to be widely adopted. In Phase I we have demonstrated GPS-free navigation and environmental mapping in real time on a kilogram-scale sensing and computing payload for a small multi-rotor aircraft. The demonstration was noteworthy because it was conducted in complex environments in which GPS signals are blocked or degraded by multipath. In Phase II we propose to extend GPS-free navigation to a larger set of operating environments and to show collision-free guidance from take-off to landing with emphasis on the phases at low altitudes. We will work with the UTM team at NASA Ames to coordinate our experiments on block 4 testing.  We expect to show in this program that it is possible for small autonomous air vehicles to reliably and safely fly in the first and last 50 feet of operation.",

        "abstract": "The DoD requires an increase in performance and density of solid propellants for use on boost, strategic and tactical missile systems. Attaining ingredients with higher energy and density while simultaneously maintaining satisfactory physical properties is extremely challenging. Focused efforts are needed to identify, synthesize, and characterize new ingredient oxidizers that can be produced commercially at low-cost while meeting the required defined by the DoD/NASA/US Industrys Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology Program goals and beyond.  Early Phase I efforts focused on CL-20, the most powerful conventional explosive known to date and a close analog of Aurora, a material described in the Russian literature to possess very promising properties. CHEETAH calculations show that Aurora could offer a good specific impulse for propellant applications, thus making its production desirable in order to evaluate its performance in various formulations.  Recent studies towards this material were conducted as part of a separate Phase II program.  Our strategy towards Aurora has evolved and now covers various synthetic routes that  could allow us to produce this desired material in multi-gram scale upon validation and optimization. Our team proposes to tackle this challenge using a renewed 3-fold complementary approach described in this proposal.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant   Alzheimerandapos s disease  AD  represents a progressive degenerative illness that affects the brain  resulting in memory impairment  The complex etiology of AD is not fully resolved  although toxic isoforms of amyloid    A   plaques are strongly implicated  Current treatment options are considered to be symptomatic  They are only moderately effective in stabilizing or improving cognitive and functional symptoms  Majority of the research into treatment for Alzheimerandapos s focused on the protein beta amyloid  which is the main component of deposits found in the brain of Alzheimerandapos s sufferers  Unfortunately in the past  many anti amyloid drugs failed in advanced stages due to safety or efficacy concerns  Thus  there is an unmet need for therapies that halt or substantially slow disease progression   Over the past decade  our continued research has yielded a system to treat AD  Our treatment strategy is based on the observation that A  peptides are in a dynamic equilibrium between the periphery and central nervous system  CNS   Our lead candidate  andquot Amytrapandquot   is composed of a retro inverso peptide  RIP  that can sequester toxic   amyloid peptides A      and A     in the periphery  thereby drawing these toxic peptides out of the CNS  Our research studies have demonstrated the andapos proof of principleandapos  of this sequestration effect in vitro and in vivo  The research focused on evaluating the binding capacity of different RI peptides  Amytrap with different peptide sequences  to peptides A       and A       in vitro along with its effects on clearance of plaques from the brain in an AD mouse model  The results show that Amytrap is able to reduce A  levels in brain extracts from AD model mice  The reduction in A  levels was associated with improved memory parameters in these mice  Further we have observed suggestive evidence that administration of Amytrap to AD mice at younger age is more effective  This important piece of observation is consistent with the recent findings resulting fro failed re emerging human clinical trials  We have further improved the properties of this Amytrap system by linking the RIP to albumin  One of the advantages of the albuminized peptide is the absence of any untoward immune reactions  Recently  we have obtained additional evidence via imaging experiments that Amytrap does not cross the BBB thus reassuring our peripheral sink hypothesis  However  Amytrap warrants further investigation to test its potential as a disease modifying agent  In this phase   application  we attempt the next logical decision making point  We propose to conduct expanded studies on efficacy  genetic toxicology and safety pharmacology of the Amytrap molecule  Studies will focus on understanding the properties of Amytrap and translating them to practical applications which will enable us to commercialize Amytrap  Determining the minimum and maximum effective dose of the Amytrap molecule on performance in the andquot yandquot  maze is one of our primary goals that will result in a therapeutic index  We plan to examine the genotoxic potential of Amytrap by standard experiments in vitro and in vivo  We will consequently conduct safety pharmacology studies and evaluate the effect of Amytrap on the CNS  respiratory and cardiac systems over long term  We believe Amytrap is ideally positioned in that it closely resembles its biological target  Further  Amytrap is safe and economical with no side effects  Therefore  we anticipate that Amytrap will be accepted in humans  The proposed commercialization plan includes a strong research team  including a CRO  well verse with IND enabling studies   a comprehensive business plan and commitments from potential strategic partners including Connecticut Innovations Inc  CII  and BioPharma Strategy Advisors  CA  To this effect  CII has already awarded a small grant to RT to fund efforts to bridge the phase   with the phase   research  The outcome of the proposed phase   studies is expected to satisfy mandatory requirements to position Amytrap for a future investigative new drug  IND  filing and subsequent human clinical testing PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  We have developed and improved the composition of a proprietary complex detoxification system andquot Amytrapandquot  to treat Alzheimerandapos s Disease  AD   Our system is based on the observation that A   peptides  toxic molecules generated in AD  are in a dynamic equilibrium between the periphery and central nervous system  CNS   Amytrap is composed of a retro inverse  RI  peptide linked to polyethylene glycol and albumin which can sequester toxic amyloid peptides A       and A     in the periphery  Addition of albumin appears to enhance the sequestering effect of the RI peptide  We have reproducibly shown that this formulation  which is injected subcutaneously as a gel  is effective in clearing A  from brai and is non toxic and non  immunogenic in a mouse model of AD  The proposed phase   research attempts to perform genetic toxicology and safety pharmacology studies on Amytrap  The proposed research is aimed to meet the regulatory requirements for an investigative new drug filing  IND   We have put together a strong team of researchers and continued our efforts in establishing partnership with commercial entities to ensure guaranteed progress on commercialization initiatives  At the end of this research period  we expect to generate a potentially new drug candidate to treat AD  pending further clinical testing  and establish a fruitful partnership with a pharmaceutical company to pursue further development",

        "abstract": "We have demonstrated the ability of our Dynamic Monitoring and Decision Systems (DyMonDS) framework to structure a systems approach to the modeling and control of aircraft electric power systems. To begin, we selected two example aircraft power systems and developed dynamic models for those systems within the DyMonDS framework.  Next, we derived optimized sets of control set points for the power systems.  Each set of set points constituted an optimized allocation of resources under an assumed aircraft operating condition.  A separate set of control set points was derived for each assumed operating condition.  To do so the selected aircraft electric power systems were first mapped into equivalent terrestrial power systems. The NETSS optimization software for terrestrial electric power systems was then applied to optimize the aircraft power systems.  Finally, we developed and stabilizing controllers for electric power system operation around each set point set.  To do so, critical, and potentially unstable, aircraft electric power system dynamics were first identified for closed-loop control.  Finally, the required controllers were designed and simulated to show that they indeed stabilized the dynamics around the prescribed set points. All accomplishments were greatly facilitated by the DyMonDS framework.",

        "abstract": "Conventional SAR operates in the Stripmap mode. Wide unambiguous swath coverage and high azimuth resolution pose contradictory requirements on the design of SAR systems. A promising technique to overcome this limitation is Digital Beam-Forming (DBF) on receive where the receiving antenna is split into multiple sub-apertures. This provides the capability of forming multiple beams via post-processing. DBF techniques applied to SAR systems can increase receiving antenna gain without a reduction of the imaged area and suppress interference signals. A highly capable DBSAR instrument design would consist of wideband Transmitter-Receiver Module (TRM), precise multi-channel timing and synchronization and reconfigurable processing engine that can host the SAR processing, calibration and control routines.

The feed system features an innovative piezo driven valve that saves volume, mass, cost, and energy with respect to state of the art alternatives. The feed system also features a low mass plastic propellant tank that may be manufactured through additive processes.  This allows low cost, complex shapes that can maximize the use of available space inside volume-restricted spacecraft.  The feed system will be especially attractive for small spacecraft and CubeSats.\n\t\nIodine stores as a solid and sublimates at modest temperatures as the molecule I2, which allows many benefits with respect to traditional Hall effect thruster fuels such as xenon and krypton.  These advantages include higher storage density, lower storage pressure, the ability to test high power systems at space-relevant conditions in modest facilities, the capability to store propellant in space without active regulation, and the capacity to transfer propellant at low-pressure conditions in space.  In a space-limited spacecraft, using iodine instead of state of the art xenon could increase available delta-V by a factor of three (3) or more.\n  \nIn Phase I, Busek developed a feed system featuring the advanced components, which was integrated into the iSAT spacecraft form factor.  The system was then tested with an iodine compatible Hall effect thruster in relevant space conditions.  In Phase II, an improved feed system will be designed, built and tested.  Major Phase II technical objectives include developing an engineering model iodine resistant, piezo driven flow control valve, finalizing the feed system control architecture, identifying and evaluate commercial components to fill out the system, and building and characterizing the system.  At the conclusion of the Phase II effort, engineering model valves will be delivered to NASA for further characterization.",

CFDRC team proposes an inflatable airlock structure that employs unique fabric architecture capable of delivering the lowest mass and greatest versatility of any competing design. The proposed design features a completely integrated air beam inter-wall to passively generate the wall stiffness required for airlock depressurization?without the mass and bulk of aluminum pressure hulls or complexity of multi-structure adaptations of competing inflatable habitat architectures. This unique architecture utilizes a matrix of braided fiber tendons to contain the structure?s global pressure loads. The underlying woven fabric and gas barrier envelopes are thereby only exposed to minimal local shell loads where they bulge outwards between adjacent tendons. Working in pure tension in the absence of load coupling, the tendon array architecture has been shown to be statically determinate and auto-stabilizing under extreme deflection. The proposed airlock stows compactly for transport to the habitat further reducing logistic costs. Phase I effort focused on conceptual design of the airlock system, identification and evaluation of candidate materials, and characterization of the airlock system.

The proposed gyroscope is based on an innovative approach using Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCF) coils that reduces the major gyro error sources and enables a radiation hard sensor in smaller volume compared to state-of-the-art. \nPhase 1 addressed the feasibility of the PCF FOG concept, demonstration of critical components, performance/size tradeoffs, and preliminary designs of FOG-based IRU and IMU, leading to a prototype gyro to be designed and built in Phase 2. In particular, Phase 1 involved a comprehensive study of available state-of-the-art PCF and associated components. Based on this, three different PCFs were obtained and extensively tested for suitability in small gyro applications emphasizing tight bending diameters and temperature tests. The tests demonstrated that the technology is sufficiently developed to enable implementation of advanced PCF-based FOGs in the near future. \nPhase 2 will (1) implement selected PCF for the gyro application, develop and evaluate components including the PCF coil, modulator and polarizers, and develop the required support infrastructure and tooling, (2) perform performance modeling and trade-offs followed by a complete PCF gyro design, (3) evaluate low-power solutions for the light source and electronics and preliminary valuation of unique electronic miniaturization designs, (4) deliver a tested and validated gyro sensor and electronics, and (5) design a compact open-loop PCF FOG-based 3-axis IRU system.\nThe Phase 2 strategy includes a development and integration plan, potential demonstration opportunities, program schedule, transition activities, and estimated costs.

        "abstract": "For X-Ray optics, polishing the mirrors is one of the most costly steps in the fabrication of the system.  BeatMark software will significantly decrease the cost of X-Ray mirror production. BeatMark will allow for parametrization of surface metrology data, which will be used as feedback for polishing parameter optimization and metrology experiment planning. By providing the parametrized optical surface description, BeatMark will optimize the costly polishing-and metrology cycle and enable numerical simulation of the performance of new X-Ray mirrors performed by NASA. BeatMark will help fulfill the requirements for sophisticated and reliable information about the expected surface slope and height distributions of prospective X-Ray optics before the optics are fabricated. As we demonstrated in Phase I, an optical surface can be thought of as a stationary uniform stochastic process and modeled with optimal Invertible Time Invariant Filters (InTILF). It was further shown that the modeling of one-dimensional (1D) slope measurements allows highly confident fitting of the X-Ray mirror metrology data with a limited number of parameters and a 10-15% reduction of required length of metrology profiles.  Theoretically, a reduction of 50% is possible.  In Phase II, we will conduct field tests to assess what reduction in metrology is practical and implementable. With the parameters of the InTILF model developed in Phase I, the surface slope profile of optics with a new specification can be forecast reliably. BeatMark will also process 2-D metrology data and provide a polishing optimization method, based on analysis of the mirror quality response to the polishing parameters. Our Phase I studies indicated that the optimal InTILF modeling describes the mirror surfaces with very few filter parameters and high spectral accuracy.",

        "abstract": "As the air transportation system becomes more autonomous in the coming years, there will be an increasing need for monitoring capabilities that operate in the background to identify anomalous behaviors indicating safety or efficiency deficiencies. Today, these behaviors are largely detected after an incident has occurred. In July 2013, an Asiana Boeing 777 flew too low approaching San Francisco International Airport (SFO), its tail hitting a seawall and crashing into the runway. Three people died and 180 were injured. \nThis type of anomalous behavior (i.e. foreign pilots consistently flying too low into SFO on visual approach) could have been detected prior to the crash because the data was available, but no one was looking at it. Metron proposes to develop a semi-autonomous background monitoring system to apply this type of data mining and data discovery to flight track data in order to identify opportunities for improvements to safety and efficiency in airspace operations. \nIn the Phase I effort, Metron demonstrated a proof-of-concept statistical approach that we call the Normalcy Score Broker (NSB), which uses historical flight data to develop models of normal behavior, and then applies statistical methods to combine multiple features into a single score for identifying outliers. Metron has used this same NSB technique to develop operational systems for customers in the land and maritime domains.\nIn the Phase II, we propose to extend the techniques to process at scale, whether for real-time streaming data or for efficient analyses on forensic repositories. In addition to generating new features associated with clusters of flights interacting with each other, we propose to incorporate greater context (e.g., flight behavior in the presence of convective weather) and learning techniques to reduce false positives based on operator feedback on the relevance of the reported anomalies. We will test and evaluate our software on the NASA Cloud-based SMART-NAS Test Bed.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Protective masking of part surfaces is critical during the component repair process.  Whether using Arc wire, Plasma spray, HVOF, cold spray, grit blasting or tumbling the operator needs to be able to define the repair area on the component.  Traditionally this has been done using plasma taping which is a very labor intensive process.    Traditional cast masking can change the way a shop operates.  In addition to the time reduction, cast masking provides a more repeatable process since a mask with consistent geometry does not rely on an operator taping the components.    The manufacturing of cast masking is a time consuming process.  Additive printer technology has enhanced the ability to provide customers with better traditional cast masking however customers are requesting directly printed masks.  The ability to print a complex mask such as an airfoil or dovetail that a customer can directly apply to a component will significantly reduce the lead-time for masking development.  Current lead-times for development masks are measured in weeks not days.  The ability to send a file to a 3D printer to print the finished mask is a benefit that every customer wants.; BENEFIT: Masking is a broad category consisting of specialized urethane and silicone masks of various shore hardness.  The existing masking products are custom cast urethane and silicone molds. Currently there is not a lot of 3D printed masking available that fits a specific customer application.  Occasionally 3D printed parts meet niche masking needs but on an extremely limited basis.    Many customers have expressed an interest in printed masking and would support product development and in shop testing.  Additional applications exist beyond aerospace in multiple industries including automotive, medical and power generation.",

For example, UAS platforms such as the ScanEagle or the Sierra require at least one operator to handle the routing / navigation tasks for the aircraft and another operator to handle and operate the mission-specific payload. In this setting, the UAS platforms actually become a force-divider instead of a force-multiplier. The requirement of multiple operators for each individual UAS platforms is problematic for commercial applications where the high cost of human operators would inhibit many key applications such as package delivery from becoming financially viable. \nTo address these issues, Opto-Knowledge Systems Inc (OKSI) and Analytical Graphics Inc (AGI) are joining forces to design, demonstrate, and deliver a robust multiple Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) semi-autonomous command and control tool that will enable a single human operator to manage multiple UAS platforms concurrently. Though there has been significant research into the single-operator multiple UAS control paradigm, there are currently no existing commercially available tools for this application.

        "abstract": "Polyethylene, and ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) in particular, is an outstanding material for radiation shielding in the sense that its extraordinarily high hydrogen content both minimizes the production of secondary ions during exposure to energetic radiation and captures neutrons. Its low density and high wear resistance also make it attractive for the structures of manned spacecraft and extraterrestrial habitats. However, its use in structures is limited by its flammability and poor mechanical properties under load compared to other structural materials. While carbon fiber/UHMWPE are an obvious solution, to date they have not proved useful because load is not easily transferred to or from UHMWPE, and because its melt state is too viscous to infiltrate fiber preforms. In this Phase II project, TDA will apply its recent advances in composite manufacturing to create a UHMWPE-matrix composite that has good load transfer to a creep-mitigating continuous fiber reinforcement. Such a composite will not only have outstanding radiation shielding properties, but also have sufficient mechanical properties to be useful as a structural material.",

        "abstract": "Frozen tissue samples represent the state of the art in tissue preservation in many molecular analysis techniques as well as in in membrane analysis using free-fracture techniques.  Rapid freezing eliminates the artifact caused by ice crystal formation within the tissues.  Ice crystal nucleation and growth occurs between 0?C and -20?C typically.  To avoid this damage and minimize destruction of proteins, RNA and DNA by lytic enzymes, cells or tissues have to be rapidly cooled through this temperature band.  This is typically done in an isopentane bath cooled by liquid nitrogen (LN2) to -150?C.  This 2 step process eliminates artifacts caused by ice nucleation as well as artifacts caused by nitrogen bubbles that surround the tissue as it boils if submerged directly into LN2.  While these open methods are acceptable for terrestrial laboratories, they would not be compatible with experimentation on the International Space Station.  Our proposed gaseous nitrogen-based Rapid Freezer clamp would provide an alternative means to rapid cool through ice crystal nucleation and growth temperatures without exposing the crew to the spill hazards of LN2 and chilled isopentane as well as the extreme flammability of isopentane.",

Expansions of tropospheric ozone measurement efforts, such as NASA?s TOLNet program, are critical to improve our understanding these effects. In response to this need, Bridger Photonics Inc proposes developing the most efficient, compact, rugged, low-power consumption and cost-effective UV ozone differential absorption lidar (DIAL) transmitter available.

To achieve this design goal, Bridger will apply innovations proven out during its Phase I effort and developed previously for its MIR series laser product. The overall project goal is to design, construct, and test an autonomous, production-grade prototype, two-wavelength ozone LIDAR transmitter.  The proposed transmitter will enable state-of-the-art continuous ozone LIDAR measurements without the need for a skilled operator.  It will also provide a long maintenance-free interval (> 2 years), and will cost under $200k per transmitter.

Combining this technology with a CBM+ implementation facilitates more effective opportunistic maintenance decisions and condition based scheduling thereby improving ability to avoid cost of non-required maintenance.

By using this technology to indicate when inspections and maintenance actions are actually warranted (enabling a CBM+ implementation) instead of by scheduled periodic inspections; aircraft reliability will be increased.

A key component of the Starshade structural system is a series of dimensionally stable composite cables (or spokes) that connect the center structural hub to the perimeter truss and largely determine the deployed shape and stiffness of the system much like a bicycle wheel.  There are many challenges in developing the Starshade spoke. Perhaps most notable is that meeting the CTE requirement necessitates accurate control of fiber volume fraction (resin content) to less than 1%. Also challenging is that meeting the stiffness precision goal of less than 0.5% variation between cables demands that minimal fiber fraying and damage be allowed during the tow spreading and alignment process and that the net cross section be made in one step with no required post-processing. Furthermore, meeting the length precision goal requires uncommon assembly and end fitting bonding methodologies. Finally, there are challenges associated with integrating such high-performance cables into the Starshade while ensuring snag-free deployment and proper on-orbit operation. The DS3 Cable technology addresses all of these challenges with a highly tailorable thermoplastic-tape design that uses Dual Resin Bonding technology for strength and dimensional stability at the end fittings.",

However, an additional objective of that contract to develop an improved HTPB polymer for propellant applications was not completed.  There is a significant need for a HTPB polymer that is reliable and that provides improved propellant properties particularly for tactical missile applications.  As a result, a second SBIR Phase II contract is proposed to complete this development effort.  Optimization of the current synthesis procedure is proposed to manufacture a polymer that will provide these improved propellant properties by modifying the molecular weight distribution.  In addition, modification of the synthesis to yield a polymer with more consistent reactivity is planned.  Evaluation of the candidate polymers in gumstock elastomers will be conducted to demonstrate improvement compared to standard HTPB products.

However, the hurdle of operation safety in the form of avoiding airborne collisions must first be overcome.  UAVradars LLC is proposing a small, lightweight, and low-power radar system designed specifically to give small UAS (< 55 lbs) airborne collision-avoidance sensory capability.  Radar is ideally suited for this purpose due to its all-weather capability to provide accurate position and velocity data.  The proposed radar is based on previous R&D funded by NASA and performed at the University of Kansas from 2012 to 2014.  This effort resulted the successfully flight testing of a large scale proof-of-concept radar that was then miniaturized as an academic demonstrating of the potential reduction in size, weight and power (SWaP).  The SBIR Phase I focuses on overcoming critical factors specific to commercialization needs that were left unresolved.  These were 1) replace the bulky user laptop controller with a small Raspberry Pi 2 to allow the miniature radar system to be installed on a sUAS; 2) move the radar operations to the ISM band to avoid FCC licensing complications; and 3) implement radar transmit encoding to allow multiple radar systems to operate in the same area without cross jamming.  The successful complete of Phase I indicated the radar commercialization feasibility which leads into Phase II.  The objectives in Phase II is to create a flight tested prototype.  This involves 1) maximize radar hardware performance; 2) create a target detection and tracking algorithm; and 3) perform radar flight testing to validate its capability.  By completing these tasks, the Phase II miniature radar system will be proven as a disruptive technology for overcome key sense-and-avoid barriers in NASA?s efforts of integrating UAS in the National Airspace System (NAS).",

The RSP technique is based on the differences in the polarization of Rayleigh-scattered light between atoms and molecules. The TAW technique is based on the determination of wave speed from the propagation of an acoustic wave generated by a laser spark from the focused beam of a pulsed laser.

DataSofts Work Plan takes a practical approach to rapidly delivering product functionality. We have fully defined the activities required to attain each of the project objectives. DataSoft follows an iterative product development methodology to address the needs for early functionality and evaluation units for lab experiments and subsequent field test events.

In Phase I, a preliminary GECKO hardware prototype was designed, built and tested. The ability of the robot to traverse challenging surface contours encountered in ship tanks was demonstrated, including concave corners and 180-degree convex edges. In Phase II, an enhanced GECKO prototype will be built and tested in a variety of ship tanks. The GECKO robotic maintenance system will improve safety, reduce cost and reduce manpower requirements associated with the maintenance of Navy ship tanks.",

        "abstract": "This Phase II SBIR addresses the need to eliminate the environmental and safety hazard associated with hexavalent chromium generated during conventional electrolytic chrome stripping. An integrated electrolytic FARADAYIC(R) Chrome Stripping/Recycling process will enable direct recovery of the stripped chromium metal from the electrolyte, return the electrolyte to the stripping process, and be a drop-in replacement for the current stripping process. Phase I demonstrated removal of chrome from high strength steel substrates using a weak acid electrolyte while eliminating hexavalent chromium, without adversely affecting the substrate surface. The process was scaled to 4x6 panels and the stripping rate was 1-2 mil/hr. A preliminary economic analysis showed that the process has the potential to meet DOD and OEM safety and economic requirements. There is a substantial reduction in energy use and up to an 88% savings in energy cost, which may be able to further be reduced. In Phase II we will optimize the FARADAYIC Stripping/Recycling technology, design and build a pilot-scale facility to strip larger parts, perform compatibility testing for functional performance metrics, demonstrate replating after stripping, develop the FARADAYIC Recycling unit technology to recover the chrome and enable a zero-discharge process, and further develop the economic analysis and transition plan.",

Resulting aircraft designs such as blended-wing bodies with distributed propulsion can provide the large reductions in emissions, fuel burn, and noise required to make air transportation growth projections sustainable.  The power density requirements for these electric machines can only be achieved with superconductors, which in turn require lightweight, high-capacity cryocoolers.  Creare has previously developed a Cryoflight turbo-Brayton cryocooler concept that exceeds the mass and performance targets identified by NASA for superconducting aircraft with high-temperature superconducting (HTS) materials requiring cooling to 50 K.  Here, we extended the temperature range of our cryocooler with an innovative new cycle concept to provide cooling to 20 K for MgB2 superconductors, which offer price and performance advantages for certain superconducting machines.  In Phase I of this project, we evaluated the performance advantages of our concept through modeling and preliminary component designs.  In Phase II, we will fabricate and test the highest-risk components to bring the overall TRL to 4.

The output from TOMO is not only a normalized metric, but the 4-D trajectories of all aircraft in an optimally-performing system.\nA key component to the success of any simulation environment is the quality of the metrics that it is able to report back to a user to allow informed decision-making. TOMO addresses the need to develop metrics that are comparable across scenarios by computing a 'baseline' for each scenario that represents the best that the system could perform given the operating constraints, weather, and demand. By normalizing metrics relative to this baseline, it allows for more direct comparisons across scenarios along multiple dimensions both in shadow mode and playback scenarios. When used in shadow mode, TOMO will identify the actions that should be taken to optimize for a given objective.\nIn addition to computing the metrics, TOMO's output includes descriptive information on how the trajectories in the scenario being simulated differ from those in the optimal solution, and provides insight into how system performance may be improved.",

        "abstract": "Resilient Ops, working in collaboration with Metron Aviation, Inc., proposes to develop a prototype system for planning Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) trajectories based on user intent and preference information. The system, called DRIFT-UAS (Distributed Resilient Framework for Trajectory Management of Unmanned Aircraft Systems), is intended to support autonomous Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) under Trajectory-Based Operations (TBO). It is composed of algorithms and information-sharing components that enable autonomous trajectory planning while optimizing system-wide objectives such as safety, efficiency, and equity. DRIFT-UAS works for a mixed environment (manned and unmanned aircraft), but special emphasis is placed on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). The immediate application is primarily targeted at lower-altitude aircraft (below 18,000 feet) but DRIFT-UAS would apply as well to upper altitudes.\n\nUsing DRIFT-UAS, flight operators and air traffic management iteratively exchange trajectory intent and congestion feedback to develop trajectories that are efficient and equitable, while preserving an aircraft?s autonomy in generating its own trajectories based on its internal objective tradeoffs. The feedback aspect of the DRIFT-UAS architecture separates it from other ?evaluators,? i.e., systems that check whether operating constraints are violated given a set of trajectories. Once DRIFT-UAS checks the proposed trajectories against system constraints, it provides each aircraft with information via a price update on levels of congestion and system constraints in space and time that would enable the aircraft to revise its trajectory if required. This two-way communication between aircraft and air traffic management on trajectory intent and feasibility results in better trajectories as well as clearer guidance to airspace users as to which trajectories are most likely to be available.",

Current gold isolation methods involve the consumption of vast quantities of sodium cyanide, where cyanide is contained in large tailing dams, posing an environmental threat as exemplified by documented breaches. In the United States there are gold deposits which have not been exploited because of technology limitations and environmental concerns. The technology being developed in this project will improve the profitability of existing mines, as it can be employed with only minor changes in plant design. It will also but will also lead to new jobs. Another opportunity is to extract gold from copper tailings dams. The proposed technology will potentially make cleanup of these sites profitable and can be applied worldwide. In the longer term, the process could be adopted in third world countries which still rely on mercury which pollutes, not only the environment, but also the food chain. The objectives of this Phase II research project are to (i) scale up the extraction of gold using both the heap and vat leach processes, (ii) optimize the crystallization of Au(III) in the presence of the natural product \u00e1-cyclodextrin, and (iii) isolate the gold. For heap leaching, it is proposed to operate at the 400-MT level, concentrate the gold salt and crystallize the gold-cyclodextrin complex. Scale-up will require designing the process to utilize existing equipment (built originally for the sodium cyanide process) and introducing new chemicals. For vat leaching, a small pilot system will be built to accept crushed ore as the feed, and the resulting gold-containing extract will be taken through the crystallization process. Optimization of the leaching agent, mass transfer, kinetics and materials consumption will be ongoing. Regulatory approval for vat leaching, once secured, can be applied on-site globally to demonstrate the environmental and economic benefits of the process. This technology has the potential to significantly make existing and new mining operations more environmentally sustainable.",

This integrated visual-tactile system will be 3-4 times more inexpensive ($20,000 purchase cost vs. existing $65,000-80,000 vision system), improve the speed and accuracy of current robotic handling systems, and facilitate the automation of repetitive, injury-prone manual tasks. By enabling new robotic applications and increasing productivity in current automation, this solution will help the U.S. maintain a competitive domestic manufacturing sector. In 2009 there were 36,190 logged repetitive motion injuries in the U.S.; the median missed work time from these injuries was 21 days (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics). This innovative solution will facilitate the automation of repetitive, injury-prone manual tasks and greatly improve the speed, accuracy, and cost-efficiency of current robotic handling systems. The immediate commercial applications are in industrial robotics, specifically robotics in agile manufacturing. In the long term, the technology will be applied in personal, healthcare, and military robots. The current market potential for tactile sensors for industrial robots is estimated as $576 million - $1.15 billion and expected to more than double by 2025. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will result in a combined visual-tactile system that will give robots an integrated sense of touch and vision, much like the hand-eye coordination of humans. It incorporates a technically novel compliant tactile sensing solution?a rubber ?skin? that can be molded into any form factor and is inexpensive and durable. This advanced skin technology can resolve object shape, contact/slip events, and forces of contacted objects. It will uniquely fuse visual and tactile information for object handling and pose estimation resulting in flexible robotic system that handles objects more like humans do. This approach addresses key weaknesses in vision-based robotic manufacturing, such as occlusion and dislodging when parts are grasped. Current industrial robots are restricted in their ability to handle small, irregularly shaped, soft, or fragile parts. Existing solutions rely on expensive and complex 3D-vision systems or repetitive manual labor. This solution is two-fold: (1) A new flexible tactile sensor that can be tailored to a wide variety of form factors; (2) Software to fuse the tactile data with a vision system to estimate pose of objects in pick-and-place tasks.",

In contrast to the complex mixture of fatty acids currently produced in the oleochemical industry, the technology developed in this project will deliver a product stream containing simpler mixtures of monounsaturated fatty acids, which will eliminate the costly separation cost and be directly used to synthesize cost-efficient high-performance lubricants. Due to the improved lubrication performance of these molecules, this technology will potentially increase the energy efficiency of industrial and transportation machinery. By utilizing biological carbon feedstocks and producing bio-degradable products, this technology has the potential to reduce the environment footprint of the lubricant industry. More beneficial impacts are anticipated as we expand the application of monounsaturated fatty acids into other industries, such as surfactants and polymers.

Colostrum proteins have both beneficial health and growth properties that may drastically decrease the dependence on antibiotics. Unfortunately, there is a limited supply of colostrum. Algae provide an affordable and scalable system for the production of the valuable proteins found in colostrum. Recently, it was demonstrated that the use of antibiotics in livestock animals caused the formation of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Colostrum proteins naturally stimulate the animal's immune system and allows them to improve their own ability to fight off infections and ultimately increase their rate of weight gain. The production of colostrum proteins at a large scale in an untapped market that has the potential to gain market share from the multi-billion dollar antibiotic industry. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of producing colostrum proteins in algae using biomanufacturing. Some of the problems associated with having the animal livestock industry adapt a new product is demonstrating cost and feasibility. To accomplish the goal of decreasing antibiotic use, this project will first focus on optimizing the production process to drive the cost of producing colostrum proteins in algae down. Next, work will be done on developing optimal formulations of colostrum proteins and testing them in mice models before moving to larger livestock animals. Once an optimal formulation is established, trials will be done in pig models. In the pig models, colostrum proteins produced in algae will be tested to determine their ability to assist animals in fighting off infections and also their ability to improve the animal's rate of weight gain. Finally, this project will strive to demonstrate that colostrum proteins produced in algae can give the same positive outcomes in animals when compared to animals given antibiotics. By accomplishing these goals, algae colostrum proteins can drastically decrease the dependence on antibiotics and their negative side effects.",

Global production of aluminum from bauxite ore currently accounts for 1% of global electricity consumption, and 2.5% of CO2 emission. Over the last 15 years global production has doubled, and is expected to continue to increase over the next decades with expanded use in automotive applications. To meet increasing demand while reducing the environmental impact of production requires cost effective means of removing contaminating metals such as iron from aluminum. Commercial application of the technologies investigated here would positively affect the global aluminum industry and reduce its environmental impact. Applied to conventional primary production, the technology can be used to increase the yield from bauxite, or allow kaolinite clays to be used for primary production. The former will reduce the environmental and economic costs of production, while the latter would allow domestic producers to reduce their reliance on imported bauxite. If the technology is applied to primary production using carbothermic reduction, the impacts on the global aluminum industry would be even greater. Greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced by up to 50%, and electricity consumption reduced by up to 20%. The objective of this Phase II SBIR research is to demonstrate a cost effective barrier centrifuge technology to remove contaminating elements from aluminum alloys. In the Phase I research we demonstrated the basic technology using a liquid gallium alloy instead of aluminum. In Phase II, we will fabricate an apparatus for handling liquid aluminum and characterize its purification efficiency and costs to own and operate. Using the barrier centrifuge to purify aluminum in secondary production would reduce the need for dilution by primary aluminum, thereby reducing the demand for the primary aluminum with a consequent reduction in electricity consumption, greenhouse gas production and waste disposal needs from the bauxite refining process.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a technology to transform swine manure into sustainable alternatives for petroleum-based adhesives, with a first opportunity in the asphalt market. This project builds on a successful Phase I effort as well as a prior Innovation Corps award. The major socio-economic impact of the technology will be in rural areas, as it will allow pig farmers to alleviate the burden of manure management and create a new revenue stream. This project also offers a novel approach to develop low-cost, durable, and eco-friendly construction adhesives, reduce the cost associated with manure management and lagoon maintenance, create new manufacturing and engineering jobs, and reduce our dependence on petroleum resources. Current practices for handling manure release carbon to the atmosphere, either from manure storage or anaerobic digestion of manure. In contrast, the proposed technology sequesters carbon in bio-adhesives, while passing nutrients to the effluents, bio-char, and grey water, which can then be used as fertilizer. The Phase I research results have shown that bio-adhesive is more durable, lower in cost ($0.50/gallon, as compared with $2.00/gallon) and more eco-friendly (lower volatile organic compound levels) than many petroleum-based adhesives. The core technology to be developed further in this effort uses thermochemical liquefaction to convert swine manure to bio-oil, followed by the polymerization of bio-oil to produce bio-adhesives. This technology will eventually enable use of the six billion gallons of swine manure that are generated annually in the U.S. to supply about 88 million barrels of bio-adhesive. As a result of the Phase I effort, a study of the effects of heating rate on the yield and quality of bio-adhesive was completed; this in turn, helped ensure that the conversion process takes place successfully, thereby addressing one of the main scale-up challenges. The resulting data were used as an input for the design of a pilot bio-reactor, including central heaters and a heat exchanger. After the design phase, the team began the fabrication and assembly of this bio-reactor, and followed up with multiple trials. In the Phase II project, building on these successful trials, we will complete the troubleshooting of the bio-reactor while finalizing the design and construction of the oil separation and polymerization column, and sampling valves.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in significantly reducing global carbon emissions using vacuum insulating glass. Vacuum glass is like a flat and transparent thermos bottle for windows. Vacuum glass has three times less heat loss than triple pane glass but costs no more to manufacture. This disruptive value proposition will drive rapid market penetration, regardless of energy price, and without the need for government subsidy. This project will produce vacuum insulating glass that will enable R-10 windows, consistent with the goals and schedule of the DOE Windows Roadmap. Immediate benefits include improved occupant comfort and reduced heating bills without thermostat setback. Furthermore, vacuum windows will be condensation-free and fog-free forever. The potential impact is huge. Buildings represent 40% of total U.S. carbon emissions. Near-universal use could reduce total U.S. energy use by 3% (about 3 quadrillion BTU/year), while adding no cost to building infrastructure. Germany, Japan, Australia, China, and Russia have vacuum glass development programs; a successful development under this project will ensure that the U.S. stays at the scientific and technological forefront of this technology, and participates in a large and growing market. This project will develop the use of plasma degassing to achieve a vacuum life beyond 20 years, a condition for private investment. Without adequate degassing, moisture attached to internal surfaces is trapped at the time of seal-off. Trapped moisture molecules will later outgas, causing vacuum decay. Traditional high-temperature bakeout is too costly for affordable vacuum glass. Bakeout takes hours, but plasma degassing takes minutes. A German vacuum glass development effort tried plasma degassing under vacuum, which is inefficient. In contrast, this project will use atmospheric pressure plasma degassing, which is both faster and cheaper. Building on lessons learned during the Phase I project, a plasma treatment protocol will be developed to produce VIG panes as large as 25% of the average residential window size. Working in parallel, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory will work to optimize the insulating performance of the design to enable an R-10 window for the DOE Windows Roadmap. Thereafter, an integrated pilot line will be assembled, able to produce vacuum glass units suitable for meaningful retrofit projects. Finally, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory will conduct accelerated life testing. Independent life data, combined with a successful operating pilot line, will help secure private investment for commercialization.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to enable affordable detection and enrichment of rare DNA or RNA molecules from a large background population. Currently, such detection is performed on expensive, dedicated instruments that have low sensitivity and are not able to enrich. The strategy is to encapsulate the fluorescently-identified target molecules in thin oil shells so that they mimic cells, and then process them on sensitive and high-throughput cell-sorting instruments that are commonly available. By offloading the detection and enrichment to such machines, all that is required by researchers is a simple tool that encapsulates the molecules in thin oil shells. Applications made possible by high sensitivity and enrichment are numerous, from rare pathogen or cell detection to target capture of uncommon mutant sequences with the goal of downstream sequencing. Between the reduced cost and expansion of capabilities, this approach is likely to become a widely adopted method. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a deployable instrument that allows high-throughput, low-cost quantitation of DNA/RNA molecules in a sample by interfacing with existing flow cytometry instruments. The initial objective is to quickly engineer all the functionality desired in that final instrument into a rough alpha version. Its features will include reliable droplet generation from iteratively optimized hard-plastic microfluidic chips, and automation via an advanced fluid handling system with precise feedback control. The second objective is to build the actual beta version for customer trials. The beta version will replace most of the off-the-shelf parts with streamlined, custom engineering and focus on reducing size and cost while still improving function through more iterative chip optimization. The final objective is to use the beta instrument to optimize the protocols and reagents for several applications using customer samples and benchmarking. At the conclusion of the project, the goal is to have instruments at customer sites generating data.",

cover the costs of these failures  As such  prescription drug prices have escalated at an alarming rate and show no signs of stopping  The need for successful drugs to cover failures also means that pharmaceutical companies primarily devote resources to pursuing drug candidates that have a large enough population to allow the company to earn a return on its investment  Thus  diseases that affect only a small portion of the populace are not investigated nearly as much as  say  oncology  cardiovascular or immunology  Current practice usually involves taking modeling techniques developed for small molecule research and trying to adapt them to biologics  However  this approach  more often than not  does not provide the scientist with predictions around feasibility and optimal drug properties  resulting in wasted effort pursuing leads that have\nno chance of making it through clinical trials  or to be reimbursed by payors  Applied BioMath has developed tools that address high value questions in the middle of the drug development pipeline  By coupling quantitative systems pharmacology techniques with high performance computing and sophisticated mathematical algorithms  we have proven an ability to predict optimal drug properties years before entering the clinic  For the past two years we have been offering our services to pharma and biotechs alike  to rave reviews  We have also been approached with inquiries to license our software  This project will fund the development of our proprietary algorithms and toolsets into a stable  standardized software platform  that can be automatically validated for GLP  for by biologics to develop their internal systems pharmacology models  At its heart  our toolsets are built on Kronecker Bio  an open source biophysical computational engine co developed by one of our Founders while pursuing his PhD in Biological Engineering with the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  This robust platform is currently in use  in its raw form  in the pharmaceutical industry but is limited in its adoption due to its lack of usability  quality contro and GLP validation  This project will focus on the application and presentation layer  allowing the underlying computational functionality to be easily accessed  utilized and understood  so capital requirements are less than a typical software development project  Achieving our goal of building this software platform is only the first step  What follows is a concerted push into the biologics segment  which we are currently seeding through our services offering and gaining a reputation as a firm that delivers high value on time  We have completed our second round of fundraising  raising a total of $   m between both rounds  This grant  plus the additional fundraising  will ensure that we are able to roll out our tools and assist drug companies in delivering best in class biologics  that meet unmet medical need  on an accelerated timeline to provide patients with a better quality of life  Better  faster  cheaper drugs    truly a win win in PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   To reduce the cost of drugs  identify fast failures  and accelerate the rollout of best in class biotherapeutics  analyses in the middle of the drug development pipeline  from LI to early clinical trials  based on mechanisms and biophysics  is needed  There are currently a number of open source tools that provide systems pharmacology models for use in research  However  a lack of a standardized and automated GLP validation scheme prevents the models from continuing through to development  A robust  systems pharmacology software platform  widely utilized by drug companies and upon which fit for purpose systems pharmacology models can be built  will greatly reduce the time required to get a drug to market  enable the development of best in class drugs  increase safety for patients and significantly reduce the development costs associated with biologics  We have developed proprietary mechanistic algorithms that we currently use to analyze assays and drug program data for our customers  These algorithms are naturally grouped into certain functions toolsets  These tools are applicable  depending on what questions are being investigated  across most all therapeutics areas  While our toolsets  InVitro Analyzer  Biologic Feasibility  Biologic Optimizer \nBiologic PKPD  Biologic Mechanistic Covariants  are currently in alpha stage  being used to create fit for purpose models for our clients   they are being used in industry to fulfill our servces contracts  We are looking to create an industry standard platform  leveraging our proprietary algorithms and toolsets  that will allow drug scientists to create fit for purpose models that can be easily validated for GLP use in IND applications  We have sampled the market and estimated a potential target audience of over         users  worldwide  We arrived at this number by  reviewing the Top     Pharma companies by revenue  determining employee count from those companiesandapos  annual reports  using our Founders knowledge of select large and small pharma and biotechs and its employee count and number of employees that could use our software  segmenting the list into groups based on revenue  extrapolating on a percent basis each companyandapos s applicable target audience  assumed companies outside the Top     had one quarter       of the applicable audience as the    th largest company and then summed these estimates  This produced a number of over         potential customers  For validation  we determined that the number of people  globally  employed in the pharmaceutical industry is                  www statista com

Using all available environmental and navigational data, WARP will assess environmental impacts to planned/executing flight plans and generate alerts and recommendations for those plans based on expected environmental impacts.  Operating in conjunction with existing and emerging mission planners and ground control systems (GCS), WARP will use a combination of rules-based/heuristic and simulation-based approaches to assess environmental impacts to UAS flight plans and provide I&W and recommendations for each UAS to avoid negative environmental impacts and take advantage of positive environmental impacts.  WARP will also provide real-time environmental impact assessments during mission execution, assisting ground-based pilots, and eventually UAS autonomous controllers, in performing dynamic re-planning for safer and more efficient flight.",

        "abstract": "Providing a reliable supply of safe drinking water is a critical requirement for space exploration. Systems that provide recycled treated water aboard the International Space Station, and that will supply water aboard future spacecraft, are inherently complex and can be susceptible to biofilm formation and microbial contamination. Further, it has been noted that pathogenicity and virulence of microbes can increase in microgravity environments. These factors, along with the high consequence of sickness in the remote space environment, make rapid, reliable methods of detecting microbes at low levels a critical need. Rapid microbiological detection systems have taken dramatic steps forward in the last two decades and today detection of even a single organism is possible in less than one hour. Unfortunately, development of rapid detection methods has far outpaced development of sample concentration and preparation techniques, which are necessary to enable detection of low microbial concentrations in drinking water. Currently, without sample concentration, rapid detection techniques alone produce results that are hundreds to thousands of times less sensitive than the minimum desired detection limit for microbial water contaminants. InnovaPrep proposes development of a rapid microbial concentration system designed for use aboard the International Space Station. The system will concentrate microbes from up to 5 Liters of potable water into volumes as small as 200 uL, providing concentration factors as high as 15,000X. It will be based on technologies developed and commercialized by InnovaPrep, but will contain innovations to allow for operation in microgravity. Large volumes of potable water are processed through a hollow fiber membrane filter concentration cell as microbes are captured within the lumen of the fibers. Following capture, the microbes are efficiently eluted using a novel Wet Foam Elution process and then delivered to a rapid detection system for analysis.",

        "abstract": "Functional robustness, resulting from superior engineering design, along with appropriate and timely mitigating actions, is a key enabler for satisfying complex mission goals, and for enhancing mission success probability.  Fault Management (FM) is a crucial mechanism to ensure system functionality from system design through the operational phase of a mission. FM is implemented with spacecraft hardware, on-board autonomous software that controls hardware, software and information redundancy, ground-based software and procedures. Given that most NASA missions require highly complex systems, at least a basic level of fault detection and isolation capability is almost always added on to them to protect against thousands of potential failure modes. It is therefore imperative to treat FM like any other engineering discipline and formalize the tools, metrics and best practices to ensure a uniformly high quality of implementation of FM across all NASA missions. The proposal to utilize recent advances in the theory and practice of FM, and in particular in the theory and practice of FM metrics, to enhance the ability of system and FM engineers and operators to measure and document the value, cost and risks associated with the FM design. This SBIR is aims to utilize existing capabilities of TEAMS toolset and extending it as necessary to enable it to compute a range of FM metrics, quantitative assessment of an FM design and V&V of the FM activities. As schedule and resource pressures build, there comes a need to reduce the amount of planned testing while guaranteeing a degree of confidence in FM design. By defining a methodical approach to identifying and assigning priorities to tests, one can define a minimum set of tests required to certify FM (i.e., incompressible test list). This SBIR also seeks to develop a Prioritized Validation Test Suite that ensures that critical risks are detected and appropriate FM Mitigation Strategies are employed to minimize the risk.",

        "abstract": "The Nitrous Ethane-Ethylene Rocket with Hypergolic Ignition (NEERHI) engine is a proposed technology designed to provide small spacecraft with non-toxic, non-cryogenic, high performance, hypergolic propulsion. When passed over a warm catalyst bed, gaseous nitrous oxide and an ethylene-ethane gaseous blend combust instantly. A small 1 N thruster can be designed to provide small satellite propulsion systems with a specific impulse of approximately 300 seconds. Both propellants are self-pressurizing, capable of delivering feed line pressures in excess of 800 psi at room temperature, and 400 psi if cooled to 0?C. For longer duration missions, both nitrous oxide and an ethane-ethylene fuel blend do not require thermal heating to maintain a liquid state, and as such, can be stored on Earth or in space for in-definite periods of time with no parasitic power drain required to maintain a liquid propellant. Compared to other available chemical propulsion systems, a NEERHI system offers a cost effective solution as other hypergolic engines use hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide which are toxic and dangerous to handle, increasing ground costs. As an added capability, the NEERHI engine has the ability to operate as a monopropellant engine if the catalyst be is heated with a bipropellant reaction, increasing the lifetime of the catalyst bed and reducing heating loads on the engine. The fuel and oxidizer have nearly identical vapor pressure curves, allowing them to be stored in compact common-bulkhead tanks.",

This is especially true for the production of high-value target molecules. This application will establish a platform to reprogram natural allosteric transcription factors to specifically recognize new target small molecules, resulting in intrinsically coupled sensor-actuators programmed to a user-defined target. The platform includes three main stages, followed by specificity tuning: 1) computationally predict a large number of sensor candidate designs for response to a target molecule; 2) assemble large libraries of predicted sensor genes from microarray-synthesized DNA; and 3) evaluate the designs for new ligand binding performance using a three-tiered, high-throughput screen. We then mature the response of the candidate sensors for higher activation and to reduce promiscuity for the original effector. Natural allosteric transcription factors encompass a large range of effector molecules, so this strategy is broadly extensible to many target molecule classes. Successful completion of this application provides a robust platform to reprogram allosteric transcription factors to serve as sensor-actuators for user-defined applications.",

In order to achieve optimum radiator performance, the face sheets of these radiators should present waste heat loads as isothermal sheets pointed to the sink of space. The current state of the art designs do not meet this requirement and rely upon heat pipes to axially carry the waste thermal loads while radiating fins, with typical thermal gradients and losses, provide thermal distribution away from the heat pipes via simple conduction. Under Phase I, Peregrine has successfully demonstrated an alternative design which promises to be lower in mass while improving performance based upon pulsating heat pipes (PHPs).  PHPs can directly acquire and then readily distribute thermal loads across the face of radiator panels to create highly efficient near isothermal designs. PHPs are an autonomous, self-contained, low profile, lightweight, high performance thermal transport system based upon heat of vaporization.\n\nPhase II will characterize a titanium/water pulsating heat pipe system, build prototypes of a Pulsating Heat Pipe (PHP) radiator for a 1 kWe FPS, and also build a conventional heat pipe design in order to provide a side by side comparison of performance increases of PHPs versus the conventional design.

There has recently been a significant upturn in the use of fast responding Pressure-Sensitive Paint (PSP) technology. Fast PSP, which offers a means of acquiring unsteady pressure data at millions of locations on a model surface, has long been viewed as a disruptive technology. Recent advancements in fast CMOS camera and LED technology have facilitated the realization of this long promised capability. Data at an individual pixel can be extracted and processed as traditional pressure tap data to identify mean, rms, and spectral content and full data sets can be decomposed spectrally to present the amplitude of the pressure fluctuations spatially at a series of frequencies. Acquisition of the data is only one portion of an effective fast PSP system. Fast PSP systems generate thousands of images in seconds, and each of these images represents a sample of up to one million fast pressure sensors. For maximum productivity, the data must be collected, processed, and a preliminary analysis conducted in near real-time to allow users to identify flow features of interest, and modify the test plan to maximize tunnel test time. The data processing tools must include fast processing of the data and automated analysis tools to identify key flow features in near real-time.

This understanding is of national importance because it is a necessary step toward developing the ability to measure and forecast the \"space weather\" that affects modern technology.  The high cost of space access and short satellite lifetimes below 500 km make traditional satellites uneconomical for performing these measurements.  Therefore, it is desirable to develop smaller and lower-cost sensor/satellite systems, such as CubeSats, so that the largest possible number of distributed measurements can be economically made in this region.

This instrument is enabled by CTD's game changing deployable composite boom technology that provides lightweight, stiff, straight, and thermally stable booms capable of being stowed within a CubeSat form factor. The proposed development will also provide the CubeSat community with the capability to include one or more deployable booms with lengths greater than 5 meters for future CubeSat missions.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The proposed work, URIEL (Unified Representation and Inference for Exploitation of Links), aims to simplify the work of intelligence analysts in discovering and exploring latent relationships from multiple sources of massive amounts of information. URIEL will support 1) automated extraction, transformation, and load at scale from multiple data sources, including document archives, social media, still imagery, and video, 2) integration of the resulting graph-structured content into a scalable graph database, and 3) invocation of latent relationship discovery algorithms on user-specified subsets of this content and visualization of the results. Key strengths of our approach include:  1) Tractable information integration by alignment to a simple common schema that specifies only a small number of entity types (e.g., people, places, things, groups); 2) Incorporation of probabilistic methods for discovery of latent relations specifically designed to accommodate noisy inputs from error-prone ETL engines and not necessarily conforming to a curated relation schema; and 3) A focus on scaling to high streaming data rates (e.g., thousands of social media posts per second) and large overall data volumes (tens of terabytes of relational data, potential scalability to petabytes for imagery and video).; BENEFIT: We believe that URIEL has the potential to offer intelligence analysts in many organizations new, useful capabilities for finding connections in diverse multi-source data, and is also has private sector applications to business intelligence.  Our primary target for initial commercialization is transition to the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC), however we are also pursuing multiple other commercialization avenues, including transition via AFRLs E2AT program to PCPAD-X.",

The ESG gripper couples an electrostatic adhesive with an adhesive element inspired by gecko feet.  When the electrostatic and gecko adhesives work together, a positive feedback cycle is created that, depending on surface type, can be greater than the sum of its parts.  As the gecko adhesive engages, it brings the electrostatic adhesive closer to the surface, thus increasing its adhesive force; in turn, the electrostatic adhesive helps engage more of the fibrillar stalks of the gecko adhesive.  Previous experimental results have shown that the combination adhesive technology can provide up to 5.1x greater adhesion that an electrostatic or gecko-like adhesive alone.\n\nThis body of work will result in two hardware and software deliverables for transfer to NASA:\n1.A piezoelectrically driven rig to automate and normalize the post-treatment process for improving the gecko adhesive (Q3CY1)\n2.An improved industrial electrostatic gecko gripper with sensing and control software for an industrial robot.

Not only has CTA shown outstanding performance metrics, but it does so in a manner that is scalable, reliable and offers compact stowage.\n\nThe proposed innovation is a solar array design consisting of a single central truss structure flanked by tensioned flexible photovoltaic blankets.  This configuration has been shown in multiple analytical studies to be the most mass efficient for a cantilevered solar array.  Phase I results confirm that CTA has very low structural mass which, with state-of-practice cell technology, allows the platform to deliver excellent specific power.  For example, sub-200 kW systems show specific power approaching 190 W/kg and mega-Watt versions of CTA still produce better than 150 W/kg.\n\nThe CTA stowed wing achieves the ?compact? attribute due to the fact that the two primary components of the system, the boom and the PV blankets, though by different methods, both stow into highly volume-efficient packages.  The individual boom segments all nest neatly inside one another while the PV blankets stow into compact Z-folded stacks.  The result is a system that is capable of delivering compactness in excess of 100 kW/m?, far beyond expectations.  \n\nThe CTA system, although a new solar array configuration, is shown through Phase I research to have high reliability.

The work on a second NASA code will also serve as the ultimate field test of the broadness and ease-of-infusion of the proposed technology.\nWe have secured complementary funds in the amount of $500,000 to increase resources and ensure that the proposed Phase II proposed will be successfully accomplished.",

        "abstract": "Immune marker panel tests can provide significant information for understanding and addressing many areas of health and wellness and disease conditions. However, conducting large clinical studies to identify the significance of panel based biomarkers has been hampered primarily by the logistics of acquiring quality samples from clinical subjects and extracting and measuring the valuable markers on the downstream analytical platforms.  Additionally, the transition from clinical study to clinical test has been hampered by the lack of consistent technologies and methodologies used for both settings. The Nanotrap technology can address both of these requirements.  Ceres Nanosciences proposes to develop a technology platform to address the need for both improved sample collection methods, extraction protocols and improved downstream detection limits (>100-fold improvement) of low-abundance and highly labile cytokines as part of an immunome panel. A baseline immunome study will be completed using the developed technology to assess immunome biomarker levels in healthy patients over a one year period.",

In Phase I the feasibility of using the methodology to analyze CMC components using only experimental data obtained from flat coupons has been demonstrated by comparison with limited amount of experimental data.  The proposed Phase II effort aims to extend the applicability of the model to include other issues relevant to aircraft operating conditions, such as general multiaxial loading, delamination, effect of geometric features like ply drop, and effect of fabric wrinkling and yarn waviness.

The high pressure EOC is based on proven electrolyzer technology demonstrated at Giner and delivers a continuous stream of dry oxygen with a highly controllable oxygen pressure (0-3600 psi) by feeding a low pressure humidified oxygen stream into the cathode side of the stack where oxygen is consumed.  The generation of pure oxygen at 3600 psig is particularly applicable for filling tanks used for extravehicular activity (EVA).  The benefits of using this technology rather than a standard high or large pressure differential electrolyzer stack include: 1.) significantly reduced membrane degradation resulting in an improvement in stack lifetime, 2.) increased safety as there is no risk of producing a combustible gas mixture in the event of gas crossover through the MEA, and 3.) simplified balance of plant (BOP) for the reason that typical liquid cathode feed electrolyzer stacks require sophisticated water management.  Giner further simplified the high pressure EOC BOP by integrating a low pressure static vapor feed electrolyzer (SVFE) into a shared-end-plate stack.",

Advanced Systems & Technologies Inc. proposes an optical non-contact sensor fusion concept which, for the first time, enables direct capture and observation of full-field non-stationary dynamic structural vibrations (SV) and unsteady radiated sound fields or transient flow fields around the structure of interest. SV depict the flow of energy in a structure and provides an unambiguous identification of structural noise sources and sinks. Additionally, the ability to capture and correlate the acoustic/flow field data with the structure borne intensity, offers an unprecedented and rapid diagnostic capability for noise source characterization and evaluation of noise abatement systems. In addition to being non-intrusive the measurements are fast, can be made at operationally relevant bandwidths, which extend to the ultrasonic domain, and provide deeper insight into the complex structural dynamics which are the root cause of noise emission.",

Our \"CloudTurbine\" innovation eliminates the distinction between files and streams.  \nStreaming and static data have long been considered separately. Whereas streaming data protocols continue to fragment, a great unification of approach for static data has occurred. The paradigm for file-sharing services is simple:  (1) put data in a local file folder, (2) it automatically shows up at other linked systems.  Wouldn't it be nice if one could unify an approach for streaming data while leveraging the file-sharing cloud infrastructure?  This is precisely what we propose. \nCloudTurbine is a streaming data interface to file-sharing and file-transport services such as Dropbox and FTP. It delegates much of the data transmittal, security, and server resources to the third-party service.  It eliminates the distinction between files and streams, and enables a simple, cost effective new paradigm for streaming data middleware.\nPhase I demonstrated the features, utility, and performance of the prototype CloudTurbine to be very appropriate for a wide range of data-streaming applications.  A significant performance issue is the inherent latency imposed by file bundling plus transfer time. Testing has proven this to be tractable, with low latency (2-5s) for several file sharing services, and very low latency (10-50ms) for protocols such as FTP and mapped drives.\nWe propose an Open Source CloudTurbine web portal as a hub to provide this technology to NASA, scientific, and industrial communities.  Following the legacy of the earlier-generation DataTurbine, we will vigorously move to establish a self-sustaining Open Source community which provides CloudTurbine access, development, services, spin-off products, and community support.",

Semplastics has developed a novel, innovative ceramic material which is lightweight, low-cost, and ideal for application as a mirror substrate. High-thickness, high-stiffness objects with excellent dimensional stability, low density, and low coefficient of thermal expansion can be manufactured in one piece through our energy-efficient process. Semplastics is proposing to extend prior research and manufacturing process development to produce larger-scale circular mirrors. This innovation will reduce mirror costs per square meter by an order of magnitude over current approaches based on glass or glass-ceramic solutions. As a part of the Phase II effort, Semplastics will deliver to NASA four large mirrors (up to 0.6m in diameter), sealed to address the residual surface porosity using one of two different coating systems, with ground and polished surfaces. At the end of Phase II, we will have matured and developed our production processes such that we are ready to establish the capability to produce mirrors of one meter diameter or larger.",

NASA?s stated aim is to use high power density/high efficiency PEBB devices to streamline design and introduce size, weight, cost and efficiency savings.  The formidable challenge is to design such PEBB devices that use materials that can function in Extreme Environment conditions. The proposed high power density/high efficiency PEBB solution employs ceramics, striction materials and wide bandgap semiconductors as to meet these Extreme Environment operation challenges.  This design eliminates transformer magnetics and opto-isolators (required for galvanic isolation) and eliminates external circuits and components as to provide lower complexity, enhanced performance, and much higher SWaP specifications than currently available. These ?smart? PEBBs incorporating new design and novel materials can now provide NASA design engineers with a whole new level of self-monitoring capabilities as to include voltage, current and temperature self-sensing at the device junction level.

The high clutter, object burial, and heavy marine growth often characteristic of shallow environment sites present a challenge for the detection and classification of munitions. Historically, the Navy has focused on integrating acoustic sensors into UUV platforms for mine countermeasures (MCM). More recently, fused approaches involving augmentation with low noise magnetic sensors have improved detection and classification performance and reduced false alarms. Innovative magnetic sensor systems capable of providing acoustic clutter rejection are thus needed. Our approach incorporates a novel magnetic sensor array to augment the target detection and classification capabilities of current UUV systems. The development of new atomic magnetometer technology has led to significantly reduced size and power consumption, enabling a new generation of highly sensitive, miniaturized sensors for multiple naval applications. The integration of these new Micro-Fabricated Atomic Magnetometer (MFAM) sensor systems into field-proven UUVs represents substantial progress in the probabilities of underwater threat detection, classification and identification in these challenging environments.",

NASA has determined through various studies that ISRU will be critical for both robotic and human exploration of the Solar System. ISRU is also viewed by commercial Space companies as a significant source of revenue; volatiles (mainly water) could be mined and sold as Hydrogen/Oxygen fuel to satellite operators to extend spacecraft life.\n\nTraditional ISRU architecture follows methods employed in the mining industry on earth: material is mined, crushed, transported, crushed again, processed, and waste is disposed of. However, mining concrete-hard ice and icy-soil is difficult without using explosives. Volatiles will get lost during crushing and transportation, and robotic material handling, as shown by the 2008 Mars Phoenix mission, is difficult. For these reasons, we propose the Planetary Volatiles Extractor (PVEx) Corer, which uses a drill based excavation approach and an integrated volatiles extraction plant. PVEx successfully addresses several aspects: drills can penetrate hard materials, there is no need for material crushing and transfer, if volatiles sublime, they will flow directly into the capture system. PVEx can also work with hydrated minerals.\n\nUnder the SBIR Phase 2 we propose to mature the technology from TRL 4 to TRL 5/6, and in turn ready the system for NASA's next HEOMD and SMD missions, as well as commercial planetary missions.",

        "abstract": "Modeling and simulation on high-end computing systems has grown increasingly complex in recent years as both models and computer systems continue to advance. The majority of coding and debugging time is not spent defining the problem physics but instead in balancing computations between multiple heterogeneous devices, handling communication of data, managing distributed memory systems, and providing fault-tolerance. Often, the resulting programs are barely readable as the details of the work being performed are obscured by hardware-specific setup and communication code that dominates a program's codebase. Even worse, the code used to balance computation, manage data communication, and provide fault-tolerance is re-implemented in each piece of an application even though it performs the same tasks across those sections of the software. This makes software more difficult to maintain and upgrade, and hinders porting to new hardware platforms as they become available. The time spent improving, modifying, or debugging these device specific code paths and common code sections could be better spent improving kernel performance or adding new features.\nTo address the problem of separating physical science from computing science, we are developing a solution that decouples the problem definition from the platform-specific implementation details. This is accomplished by dividing the computation into distinct tasks, each of which takes some defined input data and produces some output data. These tasks can then be connected into a task graph by defining their dependencies on each other. This task graph describing a particular code can then be used to automatically manage data and schedule work across heterogeneous devices without requiring further user intervention. Therefore, to make use of new hardware, the user need only port any tasks that might take advantage of the new hardware, and all scheduling, data management, and synchronization required are handled automatically.",

Widespread access to frequent, high-resolution Earth observation imagery has created the need for innovative tools like ModelLab that will help individuals and organizations to effectively access, analyze, edit, and visualize remotely sensed data in transformative new ways without years of specialized training or ongoing investments in proprietary software and technology infrastructure.  The Phase II production application will be built as an on-demand, browser-based service that provides a unique assemblage of online authoring tools, searchable libraries of geospatial modeling functions, educational materials, distributed computing capabilities enabled by the open source GeoTrellis framework, and access to NASA and other sensor data that can be applied to contemporary geospatial challenges in a broad range of domains. Further, it will both simplify and shorten the development process for a host of model-driven software applications by providing developers with a growing catalog of well-crafted models to build and innovate from.  Specific goals for Phase II include adding a searchable gallery of geospatial models that can be harnessed to perform specific tasks, enhancing the user experience, adding support for user data upload, extending the data repository with national and global-scale datasets, providing access to NASA APIs, enabling multi-band processing capabilities, and performing iterative testing with an expanded Advisory Team and a larger group of students and potential customers.",

        "abstract": "As the size of composite parts exceed that of even the largest autoclaves, new out-of-autoclave processes and materials are necessary to achieve the same level of performance as autoclave cured composites.  As an alternative to OOA prepreg systems, infusion of dry fiber preforms made by automated dry fiber placement (ADFP) can mitigate out-time issues and shelf-life problems combined with lower cost manufacturing.  Although improvements in ADFP products have continued, use and application of these ADFP products have been limited due to the necessary balance of processing and performance of the infusion resin.  This is a result of not only the low permeability of the ADFP product preforms but also the inadequate damage tolerance and micro-crack sensitivity of the developed composites.  Accordingly, Applied Poleramic, Inc. proposes to develop a novel low viscosity, long pot-life infusion resin for use with ADFP product preforms that results in cured performance similar to that of unidirectional Hexcel 8552 prepreg parts.  Specifically, the infusion resin will be capable of significantly lower infusion temperature (less than 150 &#8304;F) as compared to current commercial infusion resins along with improved fracture toughness. This innovative epoxy infusion resin will enable large complex composite structures to be developed using ADFP product preforms with lower manufacturing risk, reduced production time, higher part quality, and a new level of performance not attainable with current commercial infusion resins.  Ultimately, the technology will lead to a new generation of low cost composite materials, critical to future NASA space programs and missions.",

(CRG) proposes to continue efforts from the 2015 NASA SBIR Phase I topic H14.03 ?Reversible Copolymer Materials for FDM 3D Printing of Non-Standard Plastics.? CRGs offers NASA the ability to reprocess space mission waste packaging plastics as an In-Situ resource for in space manufacturing via Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) type 3-D printing of replacement tools, parts, and devices.  This innovation is enabling for space exploration, the application of CRG?s reversible thermoset (RVT) polymers combined with a plastic recycling, blending, and extrusion process will allow current and future packaging materials to be processed into a copolymer blend filament suited to FDM 3-D printing system. This approach offers two implementation routes including; (1) An RVT additive that can be combined with existing waste packaging during a reclamation process to produce 3-D printer filament and (2) A RVT based replacement packaging material that can be directly reclaimed into 3-D printer filament.  The material properties of 3-D printer filament from the RVT-based reclamation process can be tuned for mechanical performance (stiffness, flexibility) by adjusting the blend ratios of reclaimed waste packaging:RVT.  This will provide NASA with a means to generate 3-D printer feedstocks with varying mechanical performance from on-hand packaging plastics without the need for separate 3-D printer material payloads.  CRG has already demonstrated the efficacy of RVT additive in reclamation of NASA?s packaging materials in Phase I by producing a co-polymer blend of RVT with NASA packaging, producing a FDM printer filament with the reclaimed packaging, and successfully 3-D printing the resulting reclaimed packaging material.  CRG?s proposed approach to further develop thermally-reversible polymer materials to reclaim NASA?s packaging will provide a material and processing technology readiness level (TRL) of 5 at the conclusion of the Phase II effort.",

        "abstract": "In this Phase II SBIR program, Southwest Sciences will continue the development of small, low power instrumentation for real-time direct measurement of carbonyl sulfide (OCS) in the atmosphere, especially targeting airborne measurements.  The instrument is based on a room temperature interband cascade laser (ICL) operating in the 4800 - 4900 nm region.  This laser has a substantially reduced (by a factor of 40) power requirement compared to quantum cascade lasers operating in the same region and should be better-suited for atmospheric field instruments.  Phase I concentrated on characterizing the sensitivity and precision that can be achieved for OCS measurement, using this laser in a laboratory prototype.  Phase I also demonstrated direct measurement of ambient carbonyl sulfide in the local outside air, at levels of about 450 parts per trillion.  Phase II emphasizes development of an airborne-worthy prototype instrument that can be field tested during the Phase II performance period.  Carbonyl sulfide is the most abundant naturally occurring sulfur species in the atmosphere.  The lifetime of OCS in the troposphere is believed to be several years, allowing its transport into the lower stratosphere where it is photochemically oxidized to sulfate particles. Improved understanding of the tropospheric - stratospheric exchange of OCS is needed to gain a better understanding of its role in sulfate particle production. In turn, the sulfate aerosol layer may significantly influence the earth's energy budget through increased solar scattering. Existing instrumentation for measurement of OCS is bulky and expensive and is complicated by several indirect steps. In contrast, this R&D effort will result in an instrument that measures OCS directly, in real time, with time response of a few seconds or better. At the conclusion of Phase II, Southwest Sciences will manufacture and sell commercial instruments for OCS measurement to NASA and the broader atmospheric research community.",

NASA customers include active structures like space-based deployable telescopes. Phases I/II advance MFC actuator materials to TRL 6 or better for space. \nImplications of the innovation\nWhile the piezocomposites needed for active control have flown and are space qualified, their performance has not been quantified under minimal thermal protection to enable large deployable precision structures like 10?30 m class space telescopes. Data is needed on the viability of piezocomposites as control actuators for deployables. MFC actuators also enable structural health monitoring (SHM) methods that expand the potential commercial market.\nTechnical objectives\nCVS uses a nanosatellite for LEO tests.

We then demonstrated recycling of these test samples into 3D printer filament.

SIFT's Playbook(tm) interface approach provides high-level, goal-based tasking for multi-agent autonomous missions.  SIFT's Cooperative Intelligent Real-Time Control Architecture (CIRCA) automatically synthesizes correct-by-construction real-time, closed loop discrete controllers for multi-agent autonomous missions.  To fully realize the potential of CIRCA and Playbook, we must extend them to handle CPSs with complex, nonlinear dynamics.  Recently, Professor Ed Clarke's group at Carnegie-Mellon University (CMU) has developed a novel approach to verification of nonlinear hybrid systems.  CMU's dReach/dReal system uses \"delta-Complete\" approximate reasoning methods to model check and verify hybrid system models including nonlinear constraints, ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and discrete dynamics.  SIFT and CMU will team to build Hy-CIRCA, a system that will automatically synthesize and verify closed-loop hybrid controllers based on high-level mission specifications.  Hy-CIRCA will incorporate advances in reasoning about hybrid non-linear systems, hierarchical task network planning, SMT solving, and controller synthesis.; BENEFIT: The Hy-CIRCA project has potential benefits in three areas:  (1) assured mission control of teams of multiple autonomous systems, the direct topic of the proposal, through construction of the integrated Hy-CIRCA system; (2) improvements in the state of the art in hybrid (cyber-physical system) verification for non-linear systems through development of improved versions of CMU's dReach/dReal tool; (3) improved planning facilities through development  of improved versions of the SHOP2 HTN planner.  Commercialization opportunities include licensing the Hy-CIRCA software to space and defense contractors.  Another route would be to integrare the Hy-CIRCA software into software design tool suites such as Matlab/Simulink, SCADE, ESTEREL, or Modelica.",

arising from pancreatic leakage such as peritonitis  sepsis and death  The current state of art pancreatic surgical resections have an unacceptable pancreatic leak rate of         This is because there are no FDA cleared or approved sealants or devices found to be safe or effective for sealing this organ  The current standard of care is anything but standard because of the use of off label

We will leverage recent breakthroughs in the performance of midwave and longwave infrared FPAs based on the InAs/GaSb/AlSb material system in which QmagiQ has played a key part. In these spectral bands, this novel sensor already offers performance comparable to mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) but at a fraction of the cost due to the leveraging of commercial growth and process equipment. Our goal is to extend that benefit into the shortwave infrared. Using the best material currently available and a novel bandgap-engineering design and process, we will fabricate FPAs and measure how the antimony-based sensor compares to state-of-the-art shortwave MCT in terms of quantum efficiency and dark current. In Phase I, we developed the basic building block - a high-performance SWIR photodiode. In Phase II, we will develop FPAs in a variety of formats and deliver them to NASA for evaluation for its astronomy and planetary missions.",

That goal has inspired innovative space-based coronagraphs that aim to collect spectral data from earth-like planets orbiting stars in distant solar systems. NASA's SBIR Solicitation topic Proximity Glare Suppression for Astronomical Coronography calls specifically for small stroke, high precision, deformable mirrors and associated driving electronics scalable to 10,000 or more actuators. This research aims to overcome the two major technical problems that affect yield and lifetime of the micro-electro-mechanical system deformable mirrors (MEMS DMs) that currently define the state of the art for high-resolution wavefront control: (1) keyhole voids occurring during manufacturing (reducing manufacturing yield) and (2) field emission damage that occurs during device operation (reducing operational lifetime).  In this project, the technical solutions to these problems that were demonstrated in the Phase I project will be integrated into a full DM wafer-scale surface-micromachining batch production run to make the first 100% working 2048-element MEMS DM. As a byproduct of the process enhancements developed in Phase I research, this run will feature unprecedented surface smoothness and exceptional device reliability and lifetime in addition to high yield. The devices will be produced in a form factor that can be used with the heritage coating, packaging, and testing technologies. They will fit into existing packages and will be controllable with existing driver technology. Consequently, they will allow rapid insertion of these new high-reliability DM devices into appropriate NASA test beds.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of technology for the intracellular delivery of biomolecules directly into cells. This microfluidics-based platform has the potential to become an enabling technology for intracellular delivery, which may be used to accelerate drug discovery R&D by allowing reliable, efficient delivery of diverse material classes without having to engineer the material or the cell to natively uptake these molecules. Such capabilities could allow pharmaceutical companies to assess the efficacy of drug candidates faster than ever before, especially with integration into high-throughput robotic workflows that are already well-established and efficacious. The technology could dramatically reduce the time to market for new drugs by decoupling determination of a candidate's activity from the cell's affinity for the molecule. It also could facilitate a deeper understanding of biological processes and pathways. Initial studies with leading drug developers and academic laboratories towards this goal have been very encouraging, and, in the future, the platform could potentially enable robust engineering of cell function for cell-based therapies targeting a diversity of diseases including influenza, cancer, and even autoimmune disorders. This SBIR Phase II project proposes the continued development of the intracellular delivery technology to address relevant applications in drug discovery R&D. New drug discovery is often hampered by the inability of membrane-impermeable drug candidates to enter the cell cytosol, necessitating exogenous materials for delivery such as strong electric fields or viral vectors. However, these materials tend to cause off-target effects or toxicity, presenting a need for a technology that can facilitate delivery without altering post-treatment cellular function. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a platform geared towards market adoption of microfluidic hardware as the standard method for transfection and intracellular delivery. During Phase II, the platform will be fully-characterized, validated, and verified in order to produce the consistent, repeatable results necessary to achieve market entry. In addition, research is planned to demonstrate the ability of the platform to support drug discovery R&D by developing the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system for use with this intracellular delivery technology.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the introduction of high-speed wireless modems usable subsea and significant cost reduction of deep-water operations ? industry experts estimate savings of nearly 20% of deep-water operations through the availability of subsea WiFi. Today, there is no broadband wireless communication available underwater. In the deep ocean, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) require a tether for communication and a support ship for tether management; sensors and systems must either be physically connected, or retrieved from the deep sea to exchange data. An ROV support ship costs about $120k/day leading to over $7B spent on ROV support ships in 2013. The proposed megabit-per-second technology would allow ROV manufacturers and operators to cut the tether on many of their vehicles. Wireless ROVs can move unencumbered throughout coverage area, piloted from anywhere (e.g. from Houston), without expensive surface vessels. The proposed wireless modem technology connects ROVs and machinery to wired infrastructure, enabling safe operation of heavy subsea machinery without the possibility of cables or tethers getting tangled, causing damage or worse. This project will create 10 new jobs in the next three years, with many more to be added as the production scales. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project proposes to develop a faster and more reliable wireless communication system for the sub-sea industry. Current state of the art communication links for the deep ocean are either tethered, requiring long, bulky, and expensive cables to connect machinery and systems, or have extremely low data rates, enabling only the most rudimentary of tasks. The proposed underwater wireless communication system will provide WiFi-like data rates in the Mbps (megabits/sec) range ? 100 to 1,000 times faster than existing underwater wireless communication technologies - and enable video streaming and real-time control of subsea infrastructure, machinery, and mobile underwater vehicles. Since radio signals do not propagate far underwater, the proposed technology uses sound waves, as whales and dolphins do, for communication. The speed of sound is 200,000 times slower than the speed of radio propagation, and mobile acoustic transmitters and receivers hence suffer from severe Doppler distortion. The proposed technology dynamically measures, tracks, and compensates for this distortion, to enable wireless communication at data rates never before possible underwater.",

Although it is estimated that up to 95% of the waste stream could be recycled, only a third of the 250 million tons of municipal solid waste that are generated each year in the United States is currently diverted. Greater diversion would provide immense savings in landfill and processing costs, and benefit the environment as well. Tens of millions of pounds of greenhouse gas emissions from virgin material mining may be eliminated, and pollution from landfill waste reduced. The existing sorting process is expensive and unprofitable, requiring human workers to manually sort debris, an extremely dull, dirty, and dangerous profession. This innovation has the potential to eliminate these trade-offs between cost and environmental damage. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will create a scalable, integrated robotic system that autonomously sorts material for recycling. This advance in autonomous systems is made possible by a series of innovations in robotics: (1) tremendous improvements in both computer vision and robotic manipulation, allowing for the system to be deployed with virtually zero retrofitting in existing facilities; (2) new motion planning techniques that allow for trajectories to be generated in real time, customized for the characteristics of the waste, safety, and any uncertainty in individual objects? position;&#8232; and (3) modern machine learning techniques that allow the system to classify waste at levels approaching human performance, with a continual training signal obtained via human supervision.

Industrial enzymes are a growing, multi-billion dollar green industry that reduces energy, water, and harsh chemical use while improving process efficiency in many sectors. Despite the broad use and success of industrial enzymes, their application and economic impact has been severely limited by narrow thermal and chemical operational ranges available. The company has developed heat and acid stable enzymes that significantly expand the reach of enzyme applications. The goal is to develop an initial product for the dairy cleaning market that will have the potential to increase production due to faster cleaning, achieve better removal of protein contaminants and biofilms, reduce water usage, and reduce food product exposure to chemicals and chemical waste. Better cleaning with enzymes has the potential to prevent food-borne illness, and decrease water use, while increasing food-processing profits and providing a biodegradable alternative to chemical cleaners. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of using the first practical protein expression platform to produce hyperstable enzymes for commercial use. Although the genes from extreme organisms have been studied for over forty years, their commercial potential has not been realized due to their incompatibility with traditional protein expression systems. The unique hyperstability of enzymes produced using the company's technologies indicate that enzyme stability is not encoded entirely by gene sequence. In Phase II, the goal is to develop more comprehensive cleaning formulations and test these with laboratory and field trial methods established in Phase I.

The technology created during this Phase II project is expected to increase the quality, value, and accessibility of medical ultrasound, which would in turn reduce medical imaging costs in the US healthcare system. Furthermore, the company's technology is expected to bring ultrasound to more clinical settings and improve system-wide efficiencies in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project results from the advancement of telerobotic control technology for subsea operations. As humans deploy and maintain ever more complex underwater hardware, conduct subsea scientific sampling and exploration and develop natural resources in hostile, deep and remote locations, the need for ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) is increasing. ROVs have transitioned from basic transport and inspection tools to mission critical machines for construction, maintenance and intervention. Despite advances in sensing and machinery, significant challenges persist which have plagued the industry with high costs and unacceptable downtime, as well as safety risks. Limited situational awareness, data deluge and inadequate manual operator controls combine to create high rates of equipment breakage, unpredictable and inefficient task completion and high mission overhead. This work is developing innovative products for 3-dimensional visual awareness and computer assisted control systems for subsea teleoperated robots. Divers can be replaced in hazardous situations by telerobots using this technology. The rate of untoward incidents and their severity will be reduced for a large range of subsea activities. Economic benefits include reduced costs, new employment opportunities, competitive advantages and contributions to the national technological infrastructure in subsea operations. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will address fundamental challenges of connecting higher-dimensional data from remote environments to intuitive controls. Its intellectual merit is the refinement of a collaborative approach to command and control allowing ROV pilots to communicate seamlessly with each other and the robotic system. This will be done by developing several foundational innovations that, separately, enhance capabilities (and may become individual products), and that together derive immense value to the customer. These technologies are in the areas of: (1) Pilot Interface/Control room software; (2) Sensor fusion and processing; (3) Task assistance and workflow management; and (4) Manipulator and vehicle control. Successful implementation of visualization, sensor fusion, control methods, and haptic virtual fixtures serves as an excellent demonstration example of these technologies. With these technologies combined into a single software platform and integrated with a robotic system, increased performance, predictability, and safety can be achieved in a way that surpasses what is currently possible for purely automated or manual robotic systems. Although this work is focused on underwater operations, it can also be extended to terrestrial applications, such as industrial assembly, welding and machining, nuclear maintenance and robotic dredging and excavation.",

Atomic force microscopy is a workhorse technique for providing nanometer-scale information of materials, but its performance is compromised by viscous damping when operated in fluid. The encased cantilevers to be developed in this project significantly reduces damping, leading to high force sensitivity and performance which is identical to AFM imaging done in air. This aids quantitative interpretation of data and simplifies instrument operation. Encased cantilevers are a drop-in replacement, permitting the transformation of existing instruments into cutting-edge tools simply by exchanging the probe. The impacts of these products will be felt in fields from biology to clean energy to materials science. The first technical objective of this research is to create new cantilever geometries that push the performance of our devices to the theoretical limits. The Phase I research resulted in a novel low-cost technique to fabricate encased cantilevers, thanks to the development of specialized semi-automated processing and quality control tools. The next technical objective of Phase II research is to further reduce fabrication costs by improving yields, increasing batch size, and implementing more manufacturing automation. We expect to demonstrate low-cost processing methods in which many high quality probes are fabricated efficiently.

Corrosion will cost the US economy over $1 trillion in 2015. It is highly desirable to develop more effective anticorrosion technologies to reduce this huge economic cost of corrosion. The most effective anticorrosion pigments in use today are based on heavy metal pigments, such as chromates, lead compounds, and zinc/zinc compounds. Environmental, health, and safety concerns are driving the elimination of heavy metal pigments. The proposed new product will not only reduce toxicity introduced by current heavy-metal based anti-corrosion pigments, but also provide much improved corrosion protection. The project is especially targeting replacement of the epoxy based zinc-rich primer coating systems that are widely used on highway, marine, and energy infrastructures. Solving the poor processibility of environmentally friendly conductive polymers should enable open up a range of new applications beyond anti-corrosion coatings such as electrostatic dissipation, electromagnetic interference shielding, static resistant fibers, conductive inks, toners, and adhesives, etc. The intellectual merit of the proposed project lies in using advanced knowledge and understanding of anticorrosion coatings. It is generally assumed that organic coatings act as barriers to water and oxygen at the coating - environment interface. But corrosion of metals is an electrochemical reaction process that relates to both cations and anions. The present proposal suggests developing an ion barrier anticorrosion coating system: conductive polymer nanoparticle pigmented epoxy primer with a topcoat. The combination of the primer and topcoat constructs a barrier to both anions and cations, that inhibits the electrochemical corrosion reaction, therefore, provides efficient corrosion protection to the metal. This system will not use heavy metal anticorrosion pigments any more. If present proposed research succeeds, it will demonstrate how an ion barrier coating provides corrosion protection to a metal substrate, and how to formulate an ion barrier anticorrosion coating, and lead to the next generation of anticorrosion coating.",

ATA is proposing to tailor the latest state-of-the-art commercial image compression algorithm, the Main Still Picture Profile of the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard, for medical imagery.  HEVC has been shown to exceed the compression performance of existing compression algorithms commonly used for medical imagery by 44%.  With this considerable performance gain as a starting point, ATA will tailor the HEVC image compression algorithm for medical imagery to achieve a 30:1 compression ratio while retaining diagnostic quality.  ATAs innovative Medical Imagery Tailored HEVC (MITH) CODEC will be a sound entropic compression algorithm with built-in quality control and image enhancement to ensure diagnostic quality while maximizing compression.  In addition, ATAs innovative compression solution will include novel features to further optimize the compression of medical imagery in terms of both compression ratio and quality.  The development of such technologies will support and maintain the medical communitys robust telemedicine capability in military operational medicine missions without jeopardizing missions of the military operational force.",

        "abstract": "The use of non-native substrates for GaN-based devices leads to devices with high densities of defects stemming from misfit dislocation formation due to lattice mismatch and large values of wafer bow stemming from thermal mismatch. The latter is particularly problematic as one attempts to grow device films on large area substrates. The high defect densities give rise to degraded performance and reliability, while the wafer bow can be problematic to device fabrication as well as to growth of e.g. InGaN at lower temperatures than underlying buffer layer temperatures, reducing device yields.\n6. General statement of how this problem is being addressed: The technology proposed utilizes HVPE films grown on an engineered substrate.\n7. What was done in Phase I and Phase II? We have demonstrated the FLAAT concept using 2\u201d, 4\u201d, and 6\u201d substrates and have demonstrated the engineered substrate under Phase II. LED device results on groups of 6\u201d wafers showed >90% yields in a production setting. We have also designed various components which will be utilized on the production HPVE tool to improve throughput, uptime, diameter scalability, and reduce cost.\n8. What is planned for the Phase II project? The Phase IIB project asks to build the prototype production tool.\n9. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The technology can provide the quality of freestanding GaN at the cost of a GaN template so many types of devices can be impacted by the availability of the FLAAT templates. We have funding and purchasing commitments from two major LED manufacturers and envision the technology being adopted by power electronics manufacturers as well.",

As a result of\nthese developments, these devices will be able to perform energy-resolved neutron detection\nand imaging at pulsed neutron sources, detecting individual neutrons with a spatial resolution of\n25-50 \u03bcm and with ultrafast timing resolution of ~100 ns for epithermal neutrons.\nThe pulsed structure of the new and more powerful neutron beams coming online\nenables measurement of neutron energies through the time-of-flight (TOF) method. The unique\ncapability of MCP detectors to measure the energy of each detected neutron provides a\ncapability to conduct experiments across a very broad neutron energy range simultaneously \u2013\nencompassing epithermal, thermal down to cold neutron energies. Simultaneous detection of\nmultiple Bragg edges, for example, can enable highly useful measurements in crystallographic\nstructure, strain, phase, texture, and compositional distribution. The proposed enhancements in\nMCP epithermal neutron response resulting from this program, combined with a separate DOE\nSTTR Phase IIB for NOVA to commercialize larger area (>100 cm2) vacuum-sealed and tileable\nsquare format cold and thermal neutron-sensitive MCP imaging detectors, could complement or\npotentially even replace the large array detectors currently implemented at large neutron\nscattering facilities.\nWork at Argonne National Laboratory\u2019s Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) group, guided by\nNOVA, has continued its excellent progress in the Phase II program, enhancing the sensitivity\nof NOVA\u201ds MCP cold and thermal neutron detectors well into the epithermal neutron energy\nrange. Using atomic layer deposition (ALD), we continue to refine the application of submicron\noxide films of Hafnium, Tantalum, and Samarium along the inner microchannel walls of the\ndetector. In Phase IIB, we will conduct additional neutron testing and full characterization of\nongoing improvements to the MCP detectors, working with the neutron facilities (SNS/HFIR)\nand staff of the Detector Group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\nMoreover, our recent marketing studies suggest that successful commercialization of\nepithermal neutron-sensitive MCP detectors will require that we provide a \u2018user-friendly, turnkey\u2019detector system. Our newly developed epithermal MCPs will be sealed into an image tube,\nwhich will have the unique feature of having an externally mounted imaging readout capable of\nultrafast event time-tagging \u2013 thus dispensing with cumbersome and unwieldy vacuum\nequipment for active pumping of the detector and readout.\nFinally, we include in the Phase IIB a new task not previously proposed in Phase II,\nenabled by the energy range enhancement of NOVA\u2019s MCP-based neutron imaging detectors.\nWe will assess the integration into a \u2018benchtop\u2019 system, of NOVA\u2019s epithermal imaging detector\nwith highly intense compact and portable neutron generators, which have recently advanced in\ncapability. If successfully developed and refined, this integration could finally make available\ntrue portable neutron imaging and radiography for non-destructive evaluation (NDE).",

Such CALPHAD databases are an essential component of any materials design effort and will offer quantitative predictions of phase stability. The HEA database will be based on experimental data as well as exhaustive high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the mixing enthalpies for all combinatorially possible FCC, BCC, and L1 2   ternary solid solutions.

The feasibility and commercialization of HEA turbine blades will be examined on full-scale prototypes, with full heats of the alloys produced by a specialty alloys producer and blade components tested by an IGT OEM. Phase II will also include extension of the HEA CALPHAD database with additional elements and phases from high-throughput DFT calculations.

Such compression  often results in a residual chirp, which has a detrimental effect on the  lasing  capabilities  of  the  FEL,  such  as  lowering  the  output  power  and  widening  the bandwidth of the resultant light. Methods exist for removing the chirp from the bunch, either through running RF accelerating cavities off-crest, or by employing wakefields in long sections of  beam pipe; however, such techniques are not always available or economical, and they lack the flexibility to adequately attend to varying input conditions.\n\nTechnical Approach \nIn  response  to  this  problem,  RadiaBeam  proposes  to  create  the  first  versatile  commercial Dechirper system, based on an adjustable-gap corrugated insertion device, ruggedized for high- average-beam-power   applications.  Tuning  the  Dechirper  by  adjusting  the  gap  between  the corrugated  plates  applies  a  near-linear  corrective  wakefield  of  regulated  strength  across  the length of the beam bunch and enables not only a removal of the undesired chirp, but also an unprecedented degree of control over the longitudinal phase space.\n\nPhase II progress to date \nA  full-scale   prototype   Dechirper   consisting   of  two  2-meter   long  modules   was  designed, fabricated,   and  installed   in  the  beamline   at  the  LCLS.

The Dechirper Phase IIB prototype will be equipped with beam position monitoring diagnostics, cost-engineered, and ruggedized for high average current operations.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits \nThe proposed Dechirper will improve XFEL performance  by maximizing  the achievable  X-ray brightness and enabling the generation of longitudinally tailored X-ray beams for specific needs of the Users. The Dechirper system developed in this project will be delivered to the flagship US XFEL facility, LCLS-II, and, upon acceptance, will result in commercial sales of multiple units to\nthis and other XFEL facilities worldwide.",

Control over mixing of granular and particulate composites (e.g., particles in a polymer matrix) to achieve homogeneous mixtures is essential in many important functional material systems and applications, including energetic materials, vast array of functional filled-polymer resin systems and pharmaceuticals etc. The capability to predict homogeneity and microstructure as a function of mixing parameters can provide a powerful process control tool. It can also significantly simplify and accelerate the development of new formulations of particulate composites. By replacing expensive trial-and-error based methods that are used currently, such predictive capability, particularly when implemented using desktop computers, will lead to significant savings in development time, materials and other costs in many different industries with widespread impact on military and commercial applications; BENEFIT: There are many processes in the military and in industry that require mixing and blending of particles into a carrier matrix.  Examples include the pharmaceutical, food, and plastics industries. Mixing and creating an even distribution of the powder into a matrix is critical to the proper processing of these materials.  The ability to predictably and consistently achieve homogeneous mixing by controlling mixing parameters is of high importance.   Typically this is done by trial-and-error to find the proper mixing parameters for the system.  The model that is being developed will save money by reducing the time needed to develop the mixing/blending procedures and parameters.",

But the unmanned multirotor does not have the range and endurance to compete with the manned systems. \n\nAurora Flight Sciences believes that the Passive Miller Cycle (PMC) Series Hybrid System is a viable way to achieve the range and endurance required to penetrate the manned vehicle market. The PMC, like the typical Miller Cycle, uses delayed intake valve timing that allows the expansion ratio to be greater than the compression ratio; reducing pumping losses and giving greater energy extraction. But the PMC does not use a positive displacement supercharger. The delayed intake valve closing also allows the PMC greater quench in the combustion chamber to confront the fuel droplet issue associated with small engines. The delayed valve timing also allows the generator in the hybrid system to be optimized for power generation while still being used as the engine starter.\n\nBased on the models developed in the Phase I program, Aurora will design, procure, and integrate the components required to demonstrate the Passive Miller Cycle (PMC) in a series hybrid architecture. The test system will be used to calibrate Phase I models and design a multirotor using the PMC hybrid system that will be able to perform police and news gathering missions.",

Automated upset recovery technology will reduce reliance on a human operator to mitigate hazards posed by Loss of Control (LOC) due to upset, leading to greater operational freedom. This technology is critical because LOC due to upset is one of the main causes of accidents in manned aircraft and is already emerging as an important causal factor in UAS accidents. LOC of an UAS operated at low altitude poses a hazard to people and property on the ground and is a barrier to relaxing operational restrictions. The Phase I research has developed a recovery system that replaces the perception, cognition, and decision making of a skilled operator with a two-stage automated recovery architecture and an innovative upset detection system. The decision about when to activate each stage of a recovery is difficult to make at design-time, so the upset detection system employs a novel statistical testing framework that combines at run-time numerous pieces of data including vehicle attitude, rotational rate, and controller performance to answer the question: Has an upset occurred? During Phase I, the recovery system was evaluated in a high quality simulation of a small fixed-wing vehicle.  All hardware needed for flight testing was obtained, and systems integration work was performed. The proposed Phase II effort will focus on flight testing of the recovery system, including tests with multiple vehicle designs. The Phase II team includes a flight testing and commercialization partner with a track record of safe, legal, and effective UAS inspection operations in support of commercial customers.",

MON-25, with 25% of nitric oxide (NO) and 75% nitrogen tetroxide (NTO, N2O4), allows lowering the oxidizer freezing point to -55 C, which is a close match to that of the fuel, MMH (which is around -51 C). While toxic, this propellant combination is hypergolic and allows operations over a wide range of temperatures, particularly in extremely cold environments as those envisioned for many future missions. \n\nFor NASA deep space and Moon/Mars missions, such as lunar lander and Mars ascent vehicles, the introduction of a micropump in the propulsion system provides significant performance benefits. For missions with high delta-Vs, the system wet mass is greatly reduced, or at fixed total wet mass, scientific payload mass increases. For example, in the case of a lunar lander (delta-V > 3,000 m/s), a two-stage configuration can be replaced by a pump-fed single-stage system of the same mass while the pressure-fed would have to be larger.\n\nFlight Works is proposing to develop and characterize micropumps suitable for 5 lbf and 100 lbf MMH/MON-25 thrusters.  These will be used to perform pump-fed MMH/MON-25 hot-fire test demonstrations of the technology under representative environmental conditions in order to reach a TRL 6 by the end of Phase II.",

There has been a recent surge in research for sensor nodes powered by energy harvesters, however most applications are limited to low-frequency, low-bandwidth applications. There is significant interest in developing new sensing concepts that provide continuous monitoring of high-frequency transient events indicative of failures in hydraulic pumps, actuator/valve systems, and bearings for the U.S. Navy.

The radiation species of greatest interest are light ions (particularly protons), heavy ions (such as iron-56) and neutrons.  International Scientific Technologies, Inc., in conjunction with The College of William and Mary, proposes the use of regolith combined with hydrogenous polymers to develop radiation-shielding structural materials for habitats.

The innovation is the development of polymer-regolith composites and their efficient fabrication for structural radiation-shielding materials to protect humans on deep-space missions.  The anticipated result is the creation of composite materials that combines in situ resource utilization (ISRU), i.e. regolith, with a hydrogenous polymeric matrix.  Additives, such as boron, could be included to enhance absorption of neutrons generated by interactions of GCR and SPE particles with shielding materials.

        "abstract": "X-ray optical components are required to perform a new level of material characterization at the nanometer scale and are  critically  needed  for  the  advancement  of  emerging  nanotechnology   and  other  cutting-edge  applications. Development of reflective and transmissive X-ray optics, able to reduce the spot size down to a diameter of few nm, is a significant  achievement  that may spur new frontiers  in nanotechnology,  metamaterials,  biology  and medical science and keep the US position of a global leader in cutting edge scientific research and development. However, the manufacturing of multilayer Laue components for X-ray optics by physical vapor deposition (PVD) requires unprecedented precision and accuracy and presents a significant process control challenge. Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) is a promising method for accurately determining the deposition rate and composition of the deposited materials. Currently no AAS system provides the accuracy, portability and ease-of-use for adoption in the manufacturing of X-ray optics. Multiple other new-generation thin film technologies require an urgent solution to the same process control challenge.\n\nIn this SBIR Phase I project AccuStrata will create a novel AAS prototype, installable on a broad variety of PVD systems for manufacturing of X-ray optics, to provide accurate and reliable deposition rate and film composition measurements   for  dynamic  feedback   control.  The  AAS  prototype   system  comprises   two  major  parts  \u2013  a reconfigurable  hardware module located outside the PVD chamber with hallow cathode excitation sources, and a portable  fiber-optic-based  distributed  monitoring  frame  installed  in the  area  surrounding  the  deposited  substrate inside  the  deposition  chamber.  The  deposition  area  is  monitored  by  several  beams  simultaneously  to  derive information about the atomic distribution over the entire substrate area for precise deposition rate monitoring. The prefabricated  and  optically  aligned  frame  structure,  installed  inside  the  deposition  chamber,  eliminates  errors associated with window deposition, changes in chamber pressure, and other process factors. The unique shielding design will minimize contamination of the optics resulting in very low long-term drift.\n\nDuring Phase I the prototype system will measure the atomic flux density in a configuration of 3 optical beams near the substrate and provide real-time information about the deposition rate and its fluctuation. The unique fiber optic design provides for superior protection from undesired deposition on the system components and allows easy configurability, facilitating subsequent commercialization in other fields where PVD processes are involved (optics, semiconductor,  aerospace,  medical,  automotive,  etc.).  Based  on  its  existing  software  platform,  AccuStrata  will develop  user-friendly  software  for real-time  process  analysis,  which will further be developed  during  subsequent Phase II, to create a close-loop in-situ AAS process control system. The system can be easily expanded to more complex beam configurations, such as of 3x3 mesh. It will have the capability to monitor two material concentrations simultaneously  and  deploy  multiple  fiber-coupled  hollow-cathode  light  sources  as  needed  for  various  materials required for manufacturing of X-ray optics.",

        "abstract": "One of the key parameters affecting the role of atmospheric aerosols in global climate is aerosol hygroscopicity, which describes the water uptake of aerosol particles.  Hygroscopicity affects the\nscattering of light by individual particles; it is important to heterogeneous chemical transformations; and it plays a significant role in the formation and microphysical properties of clouds, all of which are important to global climate. Current measurement approaches are slow and tedious, requiring many\nminutes to assess the size change for a single particle size and humidity setting, and many hours to measure the entire water-uptake growth curve.  This slow response makes such measurements prohibitive\non aircraft platforms, and more generally limits the measurements to smaller particle size range, where number concentrations are higher, and scans are faster.\n\nHow this Problem is Being Addressed\nWe propose the near-instantaneous measurement of particle hygroscopicity through a relative-humidity\ncontrolled Aerosol Mobility Imaging system. A basic Aerosol Mobility Imaging system combines the\nFast Imaging Mobility Spectrometer developed at Brookhaven National Laboratory with the laminar flow water condensation methodologies developed at ADI.  Developed with DOE STTR support, the Aerosol\nMobility Imaging system separates, enlarges and images individual particles to provide a complete\nmobility particle size distributions measurements over a wide size range (e.g. 10 \u2013 400 nm) with 1-second resolution. With the addition of relative humidity control, our RH-AMI will provide rapid measurement\nof the entire hygroscopic growth curve.\n\nWhat is to be done in Phase I\nWe will develop a humidity scanning system that will facilitate near real-time measurement of particle\ngrowth as a function of relative humidity and size.  Operated with an upstream mobility size selection device, our proposed system will provide the complete spectrum of particle size change at a selected relative humidity within seconds.  Further, by capitalizing on the two-dimensional mobility separation concept of the wide-range instrument, we will be able to make simultaneous measurements at more than one relative humidity value, thereby always providing a reference, or possibly a complete humidity spectrum at once. We estimate that size-resolved hygroscopicity for dry particle sizes from 10 nm to\n400 nm can be obtained every few minutes.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits\nCommercial applications span a wide range of atmospheric aerosol research uses for which rapid\nmeasurement of aerosol hygroscopicity are needed.  It will allow scientists to better assess the magnitude of airborne particles\u2019 impact on radiation, cloud formation, and global climate, and hence provide the information needed to better cope with a changing climate.",

        "abstract": "The size-dependent concentration of airborne particles plays a critical role in the direct scattering and absorption of light, and in the physical characteristics, lifetime and spatial extent of clouds. These factors affect the earth\u2019s radiation balance, and hence climate. Yet these effects are not adequately quantified, in part because of insufficient data on the size and concentration of atmospheric aerosols. Assessment of the global extent, size and concentration of airborne particles requires more portable instruments than currently available.\n\nHow the Problem is Being Addressed:  Proposed is a miniature sensor, suitable for UAV and tethered balloon deployments, for the real-time measurement of the size distribution and concentration of airborne particles in the critical size range from 10nm and 1000 nm in diameter.  Our sensor will combine two novel technologies: (1) the opposed migration aerosol classifier developed at the California Institute of Technology; and (2) the self-sustaining laminar-flow water condensation particle counter and collector developed by our firm.  The opposed migration aerosol classifier provides particle size-selection based on electrical mobility in an inherently compact form.  The self-sustaining water condensation counter provides single particle detection, does not require liquid fill reservoirs, and can be operated in any orientation.  Both technologies are compatible with devices small enough for UAV or balloon\ndeployment.  Reported parameters are particle number distribution, total number concentration, geometric mean diameter.  Because our system uses electrical mobility sizing, it provides a measure of particle\nphysical size, and is independent of particle refractive index or density.\n\nWhat is to be done in Phase I:  Preliminary work presented in the proposal shows successful application of this approach to measurements in the size range from 10nm to 200nm at urban concentration levels.  In Phase I we will (1) extend this size range to span from 10nm to 1000nm, (2) increase the sample rate to provide fast time response for remote, background level particle concentrations and (3) demonstrate the precision and accuracy through comparison with bench-top instruments. In Phase II we will design, construct and test an integrated system that we will be suitable for UAV monitoring.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits: The fields of use for the proposed instrument range from atmospheric aerosol research, climate research, epidemiology studies, air quality monitoring, industrial process control, and industrial hygiene.  Currently there are no tools for measuring particle size and concentration from UAV or tethered balloon platforms, or in micro-environmental and industrial spaces where ultrafine particle exposure is of concern. As an unobtrusive long-term monitor our device will provide a tool for community monitoring in schools, offices, and homes, or serve as a more compact instrument for ground-based particulate monitoring.",

The development of novel cyclic organic synthons capable of being used as building blocks for the self-assembly of porous, Langmuir- Film (LF) derived nanomembranes has lead to the development of large, supported membranes.  The LF derived nanomembranes provide for exquisite solute selectivity and theoretically provide the minimal energy barrier to solvent passage. Manufacturing technology is needed to move the porous nanomembranes from the bench top to industrial scale production.\n\nA novel design of a small scale, one atomic thick layer batch-continuous membrane manufacturing device that uses the inherent properties of a porous nanomembrane for deposition will be designed, bread-boarded and tested. Standard testing conditions will be developed to demonstrate that automated batch-continuous nanomembrane preparation is possible. This will lead to development of full scale nanomembrane and membrane production in later phases.\n\nPHASE I\nA validated test method for demonstrating successful single Langmuir LF formation will be developed using current. laboratory scale (~6.5cm2) LF formation technology.  Different geometries of LF zone barriers will be designed, prototyped and tested using our large (232cm2)monolayer film preparation device (and the validated test method) to demonstrate, parallel, simultaneous LF and nanomembrane formation by the formation of many, (6.5cm2) LF in the large device followed by crosslinking of the LF to yield nanomembranes.

        "abstract": "Due to enormous growth of Internet traffic, the scale and responsiveness required for delivering applications to end users can be cost-effectively  achieved by the increased adoption of cloud-based, virtualized services built  by widespread use of compute, storage, and network virtualization.   Therefore, IT  infrastructures of enterprises, R&E networks (e.g., DOE ESnet), and commercial network operators are evolving from tradi- tional, centralized, on-premise-only infrastructures to distributed and heterogeneous  ones that incorporate resources from private and public clouds, where multiple tenants share the same physical resources. This introduces new challenges in maintaining end-to-end visibility  and resource planning to provide predictable infrastructure performance.\nLegacy planning solutions typically  depend only on aggregated traffic volumes, and run the planning process in quarterly/annual  cycles. As networks become heterogeneous and virtualized, resource planning needs to be a continuous  process, by accounting for application performance and traffic data, tenant Service- Level Agreements (SLA),  etc.  Network administrators  need to predictively  manage performance of the network infrastructures by planning ahead in case  of failures and congestion  issues as well as take  into account  the application/service performance trends along with  historical traffic  data for future capacity planning.  Therefore, for the next generation of distributed,  multi-tenant  networks, a new approach for resource planning is required to satisfy application and end-user performance.\nIn this Phase I SBIR project, Ennetix intends to develop NetM, a new, cloud-based approach for resource planning for distributed, multi-tenant networks by leveraging comprehensive network performance models. NetM modeling and planning solution will be applicable to two important planning problems \u2013 (1) Contin- gency Planning and (2) Long-Term (i.e., Capacity) Planning. In Contingency Planning, NetM will focus on issues such as detecting critical elements, impact of critical element failures, emulating failure/\u201cwhat-if\u201d sce- narios, recommendations during failures, etc. In Capacity Planning, issues such as classifying  infrastructure based on performance, SLAs (of end-users/applications) impacted by underperforming elements, projected measures to improve performance, scenario-based planning, upgrade timeline, etc. will be addressed.  NetM will be built  on performance measurements (collected by perfSONAR services), traffic and topology data, and other network metadata. During Phase I, Ennetix will develop essential components of the NetM solu- tion, and conduct feasibility and scalability studies to evaluate the effectiveness and performance of NetM in resource planning for large, distributed network infrastructures.\nThe proposed solution will greatly benefit network administrators and managers at DOE and other gov- ernment organizations through a new approach for network resource planning which considers application and end-user performance along with traffic data and significantly reduces capital expenditures. The wider benefits of this effort will  extend well beyond the  immediate DOE scientific community, and on to other enterprises, network operators, and cloud-service providers. In particular,  many commercial cloud-service providers and enterprises can leverage the proposed cloud-based service to proactively plan for their dis- tributed network infrastructures.",

While energies of 30-50 MeV are achievable by SRF technology, finding an electron source, able to survive under MW electric loads and provide an average current of 1-10 mA, is important. Meeting these requirements would open a novel way to supply the U.S.\u2019 high demand for medical isotopes, such as Tc-99m, using accelerator technology. The natural way to simplify and integrate SRF architecture with the electron source would be to place the source directly into the SRF cavity. It is impossible to do using photo- and thermionic cathodes. Thus, a cold and dark cathode compatible with operating temperatures of a few kelvins is highly desirable.\n\nHow the problem is being addressed:\nWe propose a  simple, robust and scalable field emission cathode (FEC) fabrication technology.  Our\nmaterial of choice is ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) in the form of a thin film. UNCD has been proven to be a highly emissive material being stable under heavy electrical and heat loads. Thus, it is suitable for high repetition rate/CW applications. We have preliminary tested a planar UNCD FEC in a normal conducting 1.3 GHz electron gun. Electron emission from the UNCD planar surface with excellent emittance, energy spread, and stability was confirmed. A peak current of ~100 mA was achieved. At high repetition rate/CW operation, this current serves as an average current estimate for SRF applications.\n\nWhat will be done in Phase I:\nIn Phase I, we will create predictive models of UNCD FEC performance in SRF injectors for the electron-\nion collider at Brookhaven National Lab and for Mo-99 production linac facility at Niowave Inc. Then we will design custom cathode plugs with deposited UNCD emitters on top. We will attempt synthesis of a layered hybrid superconducting system boron-doped UNCD films on Nb substrates. If successful, their superconducting transition temperature will be measured.\n\nApplications and benefits:\nThe proposed UNCD FEC technology can greatly benefit scientific programs within DOE, such as eRHIC\nat Brookhaven National Lab. Commercial applications include (1) electron accelerators for rare isotope production vital for medical diagnostics to replace obsolete nuclear reactor technology and (2) compact tunable (from vacuum UV to X-ray) bright inverse Compton scattering sources, vital for biochemistry research and the semiconductor industry (UV lithography).",

Hexavalent chromium is a known\ncontaminant of concern at multiple industrial and Department of Energy sites across the United\nStates.\nHow the Problem is Being Addressed: Research has focused on developing and field testing\nadvanced prototypes of a cost-effective, cable-deployed, submersible hexavalent chromium\nsensor designed for extended service in groundwater monitoring wells and other aqueous\nenvironments, and capable of continuous real-time, long-term measurements while generating\nno wastes. Continuing work focuses on developing a market ready, modular system for\ncustomized field installations and data telemetry.\nPhase I and Phase II Results and Accomplishments: Hexavalent chromium in groundwater\ncan be measured using near-ultraviolet absorption spectrophotometry. Interference caused by\nsuspended particulate matter (turbidity) is accurately compensated by measuring the amount of\nultraviolet light scattered by the turbidity. Submersible prototypes capable of measuring\nhexavalent chromium concentration, with simultaneous correction for turbidity, were produced\nduring the Phase I investigation. During the Phase II investigation, sensors were successfully\ntested in wells at the Washington state Hanford Site. Results led to multiple technological\nadvancements such as the addition of solar power for each sensor, a more compact design, a\nprogrammable measurement schedule, and data telemetry via cell modem to an off-site\nvirtual data logger. The sensors include programmed correction for turbidity and pH effects.\nThe Phase IIB Project: Major proposed tasks include re-designing the prototype mechanical\nstructure to reduce cost and enhance ease of manufacture, and upgrading the electronics to\nsupport remotely programmable data acquisition and fully networked well-fields featuring\nremote telemetry from a local hub. Also, one or more large-scale field demonstrations will\nshowcase the effectiveness and utility of the sensor. Demonstrations, in cooperation with\npotential sensor customers, will be implemented at sites with known hexavalent chromium\nplumes and existing monitoring wells. Results will be published as case studies in peerreviewed\njournals.\nCommercial Applicationand Other benefits: This sensor system will be a valuable tool in the\nassessment of environmental fate and transport of hexavalent chromium and can be used to assess the effectiveness of remediation techniques.

        "abstract": "For a gasification based energy system the cost of the air separation unit represents 12 \u2013 15% of the installed capital costs and requires a significant amount of power resulting in lowered operational efficiencies. Consequently, there is a significant opportunity for lowered capital costs and improved operating efficiencies for new oxygen generation technologies that can replace existing cryogenic systems. One of the most promising new technologies under development currently is advanced ion-electron mixed conductors (IEMC) for oxygen separation from air. Statement of how this Problem or Situation is Being Addressed To advance IEMC technology, the potential for significant reductions in operation cost and for improving efficiency is improved oxygen permeation rates through the IEMC membrane. The primary ways to achieve that goal are decreasing the membrane thickness, developing a new material with higher ionic conductivities than current materials, improving the surface kinetics of the electrode reactions and/or lowering the cost of manufacture for producing these complex membrane structures. In this proposed project, HiFunda and Georgia Institute of Technology will develop a new IEMC membrane material with improved ionic conductivity and surface kinetics over state of the art materials in conjunction with improvements in the manufacturing process through advancements in plasma spray technology. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits The two main applications of high temperature membrane technology are the production of high purity oxygen as a valuable chemical and as a reactant for various (partial) oxidation processes such as methane conversion. The IEMC technology is in direct competition with the well-established and energy intensive cryogenic distillation. Process engineering and economic evaluations of IGCC power plants comparing IEMC membrane based oxygen production against cryogenic air separation found significant overall benefits for using the IEMC membrane. IEMC membrane units were projected to decrease the installed capital cost of air separation equipment by over a third and the installed capital cost of an IGCC facility by 7%, while improving efficiency and reducing the power requirement for air separation by approximately 35%. This efficiency increase also produces an associated reduction in carbon dioxide and sulfur emissions. These benefits will be translated to the public through lower cost for goods and services in addition to lower cost energy. Finally, making low cost oxygen available in these industries results in cleaner power production and reduced emissions of polluting gases.",

Often these devices are operating in environments with large differences in temperature and pressure: from the high vacuum and cold of space to the high temperature and high pressure inside a deep water oil well.\nHere, a transducer capable of measuring the nanomechanical properties under a wide range of temperatures and pressures is proposed, in conjunction with a rapid scanning stage, and variable pressure chamber for the mapping of material properties from cryogenic to 1000\u02daC and from milliTorr to kiloTorr. This will combine cutting edge data acquisition, thorough system calibration, and transducer design in Phase I, for the production of a next generation nanomechanical measurement instrument occurring in Phase II.\nScanning probe modes will include quantitative stiffness/modulus mapping, force-volume, conductance, and thermal resistance mapping. Stiffness mapping will be achieved using a small amplitude force and displacement signal to measure the true contact stiffness/modulus. Force-volume measurements will be performed using the throw integral to the transducer, allowing approach distances as high as a micrometer or as low as a few nanometers. Conductance mapping can be achieved by biasing the sample or the probe, while thermal resistance and simple calorimetry are accomplished using a very low mass thermal sensor. In addition, the system will be capable of nanomechanical testing in both forward (indentation, compression) and reverse (tensile) modes.\nMany researchers in energy related fields have expressed a clear need for state of the art technology instrumentation to study the limits of materials. The broader impacts of such an SPM platform proposed here is that researchers from a variety of research areas; catalysis, mechanics of materials under extreme conditions, solid oxide fuel cells, and solar cells, will be able to utilize these new capabilities.",

        "abstract": "The Department of Energy (DOE) seeks useful methods of generating intense beams of reaccelerated rare isotopes for the next-generation Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), currently under construction at Michigan State University. Stopping high-energy, heavy-ion reaction products in fast-release solid catchers is an important method to be developed for realizing intense beams of short-lived isotopes of elemental or molecular species. Short-lived isotopes are expected to play a key role in unraveling the mysteries of nuclear physics, nuclear astrophysics, and fundamental interactions at low energies.\nGeneral statement of how the problem is being addressed:\nThis project will develop refractory, porous oxide monoliths as catchers, which retain open porosity after extended heating at high temperatures. The goal is to ensure that the oxide catcher retains open paths between grains for effusion of atoms or molecules from the catcher to the ion source in order to harvest unused rare isotope beams. Noble gases and reactive molecular species are targeted in these measurements. Simulations will be used as a predictive tool for the transient species of interest.\nWhat was done in Phase II:\nPhase II successfully established production methods to yttria-stabilized zirconia and hafnia disks (1\u20132 mm). The disks retained open, interconnected porosity (~50%) on the meso- to macro-scale upon heating to 1500 \u00b0C for up to 7-days and remained mechanically robust to handling. A very sensitive residual gas analyzer commissioned off-line showed excellent detection of 13CO molecules released from oxide nanopowder doped with 13C isotopic powder and on-line release of implanted 4He.\nWhat is planned for the Phase IIB project:\nMore rigorous screening of candidate oxide catchers is planned in Phase IIB, to ensure sintering-free operation in isotope production conditions. On-line release studies will be conducted with light stable beams (4He, 13C) to downselect candidates for in-flight fragmentation reactions with 7Li and 18O to release 6He, and convert-and-release 16CO, both radioactive beams. Another goal is to adapt the porous oxide catcher technology for improved targetry in radioisotope production.\nCommercial applications and other benefits:\nMarket need for these hot catcher materials exists in beam line facilities and FRIB for rare isotope production. Other potential markets include generation/delivery of radioisotopes to diagnostic and cancer therapy centers.",

        "abstract": "While  modern  transmission  electron  microscopy  (TEM)  is  an  incredibly  powerful  tool  for nanoscience and biology, in terms of information theory it is extremely inefficient; the information obtained per electron striking the sample is a small fraction of what information theory says it could be. Not only does this slow down data acquisition, it also greatly increases the radiation dose to the material being studied, which means that today's most advanced atomic-resolution analysis methods can only be readily performed on the most radiation-tolerant materials, leaving most biological systems almost completely in the dark. Especially given the importance of emerging bio/nano hybrid technologies for advanced energy applications, this is a serious problem across a vast range of applications.\n\nHow the Problem is Being Addressed:\nCompressive sensing, a fast-growing field that applies data compression theory to the acquisition of data rather than just the storage and transmission of data, can solve the problem by making optimal use of the information provided by each electron. Data are collected in a series of optimized spatial masks instead of pixel by pixel, using the same kinds of advanced high-bandwidth sequencing and control systems that recently produced the IDES-exclusive commercial technology called Movie Mode Dynamic Transmission Electron Microscopy. Combining this with high-dimensional acquisition modes including spectrum imaging, scanning diffraction, tomography, and time resolution should make it possible to acquire vast information-rich high-resolution data sets even on radiation-sensitive organic materials.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits:\nAfter demonstrating feasibility in Phase I and developing a fully functional prototype system in Phase II, IDES will be able to start marketing a compressive TEM product immediately to its already- developed early adopter market while simultaneously producing an inexpensive hardware/software TEM accessory that adds compressive sensing capability to virtually any existing TEM, with vast applications in materials science, nanotechnology, energy materials, and biology.",

        "abstract": "The increased accessibility via remote login, along with steadily growing numbers of HPC users and projects, poses a challenging question for HPC system management: How to secure HPC systems and protect the data inside these systems? There are several challenging issues that prevent the direct deployment of existing personal computer or cloud security tools in HPC systems: 1) The overhead introduced by existing security solutions must not degrade the high computing performance, and security solutions for HPC systems must be lightweight and have small footprint; 2) security design for HPC can be tailored particularly to such platform environments (e.g., the leadership class HPC in DOE) in order to optimize the efficiency and minimize the overhead as the HPC systems generally have static software and/or hardware configurations; 3) as HPC systems are mission-critical computing infrastructures that accommodate a large number of remote login users from distinct locations, strong defense must be deployed to empower HPC systems with the capability  of  preventing  potential  zero-day  attacks  via  remote  login  access  that  exploit  previously unknown vulnerabilities; 4) data leakage prevention in HPC systems is even more critical than protecting data in personal computers or commercial clouds as data stored in HPC systems is export-controlled and even related to national security. As a result, providing strong cyber security tools to protect the data and prevent tampering in HPC systems is of critical importance to DOE\u2019s HPC systems as well as other national HPC facilities. Nonetheless, despite such emerging demands, there are still no comprehensive software design and implementation to systemically address cyber security issues in HPC systems.\nStatement of How this Problem or Situation is Being Addressed: To address this critical need, Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) proposes to develop a Secure and Lightweight Computing Environment (SELECT) software tool for DOE\u2019s leadership class HPC systems. The key innovation is to integrate both coarse-grained security and fine-grained security with low overhead to provide real-time tampering and data leakage detection regardless its source, which can be outsider attacks, insider attacks, or even user mis-configurations.\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits: We envision that the proposed techniques, tools and software have a significant impact on the cyber security enhancement for HPC systems. In addition to the security enhancement, the result of this STTR effort can be extended and tailored for HPC systems in other government agencies and industry and to optimize the efficiency and minimize the overhead.

Costs include learning programming languages, storage systems, and computing paradigms, as well as significant hardware and administrative costs of setting up  and maintaining the needed environments for data storage, transfer, and computation.\n\nHow this problem is being addressed\nGoBig unifies and simplifies big data tools in two important areas: unified user interface to big data software and hardware stacks, and streamlined deployment and modularity to various types of cloud and HPC systems. Data is managed through the extensible Girder data framework, an open-source project started at Kitware which provides a unified interface to many distributed storage systems along with access control and extensible plugins. Romanesco manages analyses and workflows that span programming language boundaries. The results are then persisted in Girder to be\nmade available for further analysis or visualization. Instead of managing and supporting multiple user endpoints to various big data toolchains, user management and authorization for multiple systems may be managed by GoBig\u2019s account credentials.\n\nWhat is to be done in Phase I\nTo demonstrate the feasibility of the GoBig system in Phase I, we will show system modularity by extending computation support in GoBig to Hadoop, HPC clusters running MPI, a queueing system, and a distributed data system. We will also add Julia, Java, and Scala to the analytic programming languages supported in GoBig, and demonstrate the applicability of GoBig to a computational science domain.

This will all be performed utilizing Kitware\u2019s proven practices for agile, durable, and sustainable software.\n\nCommercial applications and  other benefits\nBecause GoBig is open-source and extensible, the community that will grow around the aforementioned tools will foster agility and innovation while reducing maintenance cost over time. The development model used for open-source projects has also been\nproven to scale to thousands of developers while maintaining a high  standard for quality. We will encourage the participation of developers who can add abstractions for\n \nmore data storage and processing systems.

A highly-sensitive instrument that is capable of in-situ measurements of the flux density of individual species such as silicon, aluminum, and metal-silicides is desired.\n\nAll of the commercially available in-situ growth monitoring techniques has certain limitations for this application. Of these, the Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) approach seems to offer the most advantages. In this technique, a UV light beam, matched to the absorption energy of the species of interest, passes through the flux coming from the source, and the attenuation resulting from resonant atomic absorption is measured. The attenuation is proportional to the atomic density within the illuminated volume, and therefore can be used to determine the deposition rate. By simultaneously monitoring multiple species, the film composition can be tightly controlled. However, in order to produce an instrument that meets the stringent requirements set forth for this particular application, significant development is required to overcome certain limitations of previous AAS instruments.\n\nk-Space therefore proposes to develop an advanced, multi-species, AAS-based film growth monitor that is robust and non-intrusive, with very low long-term drift, high material selectivity and sensitivity, fast response time, and wide operating pressure range capable of covering both ultra-high vacuum (UHV) and sputtering processes. k-Space will be drawing on its considerable experience in developing custom in-situ metrology solutions in order to deliver a cost-effective system that can be commercialized for\nother flux monitoring applications. The proposed instrument will be capable of providing highly accurate control of deposition rate during the fabrication of many thin film structures. With its high sensitivity\nand long-term accuracy under continuous operation, it should find immediate application in the fabrication of MLLs, as well as many other thin-film products including lasers, photovoltaics, and LEDs, to name a few. It is expected that the proposed instrument, when successfully developed, will become a standard tool for both the R&D and manufacturing of thin-film devices.",

        "abstract": "One of the main roadblocks to higher efficiencies for warm-white LED light sources is spectrally-wide red-emitting bulk phosphors, which emit a significant amount of their energy either in the far red or infrared where the eye\u2019s response is poor or zero.  Consequently, employing these phosphors (along with bulk green-yellow emitting ones) will result in desired warmer light sources, however, at the expense of lower efficiency.  Colloidal nanocrystals have been touted for years as a solution to this problem; however, they still suffer from unwanted quenching of the quantum efficiency and increases in their spectral width at the elevated temperatures and excitation levels that are attained during operation of high power LEDs.  We recently formed a new and novel class of high efficiency non-toxic nanocrystals which overcome these long-standing problems with nanocrystals. Prior to product introduction, the nanocrystals need to overcome their main limitation (which is common to all nanocrystals) of insufficient\nlong-term stability. We will deal with this issue by modifying the structure of the nanocrystals, thus highly reducing the degree of nanocrystal oxidation which is the main source of their poor lifetime stability. The work will consist of optimizing the nanocrystal composition, while maintaining the nanocrystal\u2019s very good spectral and quantum efficiency properties at elevated temperature and optical flux. Accelerated lifetime testing will be performed on both nanocrystal- based films and LEDs containing the red-emitting nanocrystals, in addition to green-yellow emitting bulk phosphors. The main goal of the Phase I work is to have less than 10% intensity\nloss after 500 hours of accelerated testing for both nanocrystal-containing films and LEDs. Given these results, Phase II activities will further optimize the LED lifetimes into the desired range of tens of thousands of hours and complete any required scale up of the synthetic process. By combining the advantaged optical performance with the required product lifetime specification, our non-toxic on chip nanocrystals will be direct replacements for current bulk phosphors, thus enabling LED efficacy to further increase by up to a factor of 1.4, while improving the lighting color quality and enabling custom light sources. These performance advantages will enable both commercial and consumer customers to lower their general lighting energy costs, obtain higher quality lighting, and reduce their carbon footprint.",

Methane is the major component of shale gas with vast quantity and is very stable. In addition to using methane as fuel, converting methane to value-added chemicals has been extensively studied in recent decades, such as steam reforming and partial oxidation to syngas, oxidative coupling to ethylene, and selective oxidation to methanol and other chemicals. Among them, SMR is the only process used today, while the other approaches are still far away from commercialization because the low product yields make them uncompetitive to the SMR. Commercial SMR catalysts are Ni/Al2O3  pellets and rings promoted with MgO and CaO. It is known that SMR is a highly endothermic reaction and the process is energy intensive. The reaction rate and syngas yield are normally controlled by the heat transfer in the process. In order to improve the syngas productivity, NexTech will develop structured catalysts for improving heat transfer and mass transfer in this project. The powder catalysts will be synthesized at NexTech to improve their intrinsic activity. After the catalyst formulation is optimized, the most active catalysts will be adapted to metallic substrates for enhancing heat and mass transfer and reducing pressure drop. It is expected that the syngas productivity will be increased significantly on the advanced catalysts when they are applied to conventional fixed-bed reactors as compared to the current state-of-the-art catalysts.",

        "abstract": "Driven by bandwidth hungry technologies such as online video and cloud computing, the skyrocketing growth of global data traffic has no sign of halting. The total amount of content passing through the world\u2019s networks will increase from 800,000 petabytes in 2009 to 35 zettabytes in 2020. To meet the world\u2019s endless appetite for bandwidth, dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) system with hundreds of wavelengths has been deployed and proved to be successful. However, including more wavelengths in these systems without sacrificing non-regeneration distance and cost will soon become unrealistic due to nonlinear phenomena and noises. Since each wavelength channel in a DWDM system (usually operates at ~  10  to  25  Gbit/sec)  only uses  less than  0.1  percent  of  its potential  capacity, increasing single carrier data rate is an apparent choice. The single carrier data rate is primarily limited by the electronic time division multiplexing (TDM). At data rate beyond 100 Gbps, electronic multiplexing must be abandoned.  At ultra-high bit rates beyond 1 Terabits per second (Tbps), it is only possible to perform TDM through all-optical means based on third-order nonlinearity. Plenty material platforms have been investigated, such as silicon-on-insulator and silicon nitride, but so far none of them could meet the speed and low energy consumption requirements satisfactorily. In this proposal, Omega Optics, Inc. and the University of Texas at Austin propose an all-optical TDM system using graphene oxide infiltrated subwavelength silicon waveguide ring resonator with femto-Joule all-optical switch per bit for up to THz region. Due to the extremely large Kerr coefficient of graphene oxide and tight confinement of photons in the subwavelength structure, the nonlinear parameter \uf067 of this hybrid waveguide can be as large as\n3.9x106 W-1m-1, which is more than four orders of magnitude larger than silicon. Therefore, the switch is capable of achieving Tbps speed with less than 1 fJ energy consumption per bit, which is more than three\norders of magnitude smaller than THz switches reported so far.\n\nThe proposed all-optical TDM, when operates at 1Tbps (~ 1% of the potential single carrier capacity), will increase the bandwidth of current DWDM systems by 100 times, which can meet the bandwidth demand for next 20 years without deploying new fiber cables. Even higher speed can be achieved simply by multiplexing more low speed channels.  In addition, benefitting from silicon photonics technology, the proposed TDM system can be mass produced by semiconductor manufacture technologies, which will significantly reduce the cost. As the explosive growth of data traffic continues, the demand on optical TDM is believed to increase substantially. Due to its uniqueness in speed and energy consumption, the proposed TDM is believed to have a vantage position in the market.",

        "abstract": "A major challenge in successful development of unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFC\u2019s) is the bifunctional air/oxygen electrode. In proton exchange membrane-based systems, the number of stable elements at electrolysis potentials is extremely limited, restricting the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) / oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst to PGM-containing compounds. Proton OnSite and Rutgers University therefore propose a non-PGM, bifunctional OER/ORR catalyst system for alkaline exchange membrane (AEM)-based unitized regenerative fuel cells. Our proposal aims to bring together the advances in non- noble electrolyzer catalysts developed at Rutgers, and Proton\u2019s expertise in AEM electrolyzers, regenerative fuel cells, stack development and integration. The advantages of alkaline URFC\u2019s are as follows:\nLower cost non precious metal catalysts Lower cost bipolar plate components Lower cost balance of plant components\n\nObjective and approach for Phase 1 project:\nPhase 1 will focus on electrochemical synthesis, analysis and application of synthesized catalyst powders with the objective of obtaining maximum stability and performance while eliminating PGM content on the oxygen side of the cell. Furthermore, concurrent cell development will be conducted in order to characterize and enable fuel cell and electrolysis on a single cell\nplatform by optimizing catalyst ionomer ratio and loading, as well as flow properties of water through the anodic and cathodic\ncompartments of the URFC. Electrocatalysts developed at Rutgers have been previously evaluated by Proton in AEM electrolysis cells, with performance on par with Proton\u2019s state of the art precious metal catalysts. To be successful as a URFC these electrodes will have to perform the additional catalytic tasks of ORR in fuel cell mode. Preliminary data from Rutgers shows promise in this regard, and there is much to more to be gained by further catalyst optimization and the utilization of transition metal supports. The end deliverables of the Phase 1 effort will be an understanding of catalyst-ionomer-polymer- electrode structure-property relationships necessary to develop a high performance alkaline membrane URFC based on a non- PGM oxygen electrode.\n\nCommercial  Applications and Other Benefits:\nFor commercial energy markets, the main roadblock to implementation of regenerative fuel cells is the capital and operating cost of the PEM electrolyzer and fuel cell stacks. Alkaline exchange membrane-based fuel cells and electrolyzers offer a much more cost effective platform due to the potential use of non-noble metal catalysts and cheaper stack components. Further, a combined\nfuel cell and electrolyzer system, a so-called unitized regenerative fuel cell (URFC), decreases the total amount of stack and BoP\ncomponents.  Combining the fuel cell and electrolyzer stacks and integrating the balance of plant has the potential to result in significant additional cost savings to enable these markets. The electrode developments being pursued here should be easily integrated into the full scale stack as elements are proven. There is nearly 100 GW of wind energy generation in Europe and limitations are already being experienced in grid management, requiring energy storage. Hydrogen provides a dispatchable energy storage media and can serve an existing need to capture stranded wind energy resources. Next generation products could also include subassemblies and systems for telecommunications backup power systems, and for air independent energy storage devices for underwater and high altitude unmanned platforms.",

Capital and operational costs over the lifetime should be favorable vs. the klystron costs. These challenging requirements are beyond what is currently available on the market.\n\nB. Technical Approach\nThis project will develop a solid state replacement based on high electron mobility GaN transistors in a Class-F amplifier with precise in-phase coaxial combiners and highly efficient step-down conversion based on an invertor with novel high voltage insulated-gate bipolar transistors. A water cooling system conformal to the dividing-combining architecture enables optimal performance conditions and long lifetime. High reliability and convenient maintenance of  the  architecture  is  provided  by  the  so-called  graceful  degradation  feature:  failure  or malfunction of one (or even more) transistors in the output array will not cause shutdown of the entire unit.\n\nC.

The Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory is currently being upgraded, with one emphasis being hard X-rays for real-time measurements of materials. While a variety of high-performance direct detectors are available in the 8 to 12 keV energy range, currently there are no suitable detectors that provide the high X-ray absorption, fast timing, and micrometer-scale resolution needed for hard X-ray HSI. This problem will be further exacerbated as more hard X-ray beamlines become operational.\n\nf) Statement of How this Problem is Being Addressed: Through the use of two technologies developed recently at RMD, we propose to demonstrate a novel hard X-ray HSI detector that simultaneously overcomes sensitivity, timing, and spatial resolution limitations of current detectors.\n\ng) What is to be done in Phase I: We propose to develop an ultrafast, bright, high-efficiency scintillation detector for time-resolved hard X-ray HSI applications. Specifically, we propose to develop novel transparent optical ceramic scintillators which are superior in all performance metrics (such as absorption efficiency, light output, decay time) compared with other scintillators currently being used in hard X-ray imaging. Furthermore, a novel laser pixelation technique developed recently at RMD will be adapted and improved to realize an unprecedented micrometer-scale resolution in the scintillator. Both the pixelation and scintillator fabrication technique proposed here have been proven to be robust, cost-effective and high-throughput methods that could easily be scaled up. The proposed project will concentrate on larger-area detectors for imaging and radiography applications on nanosecond time scales, and will allow a push toward higher detective quantum efficiencies (DQEs) over a wider band of X-ray energies than can presently be obtained with available phosphors.\n\nh)  Commercial  Applications  and Other  Benefits:  Example research areas that stand to benefit  from  the  proposed  development  include  measurements  of  strain  and  texture  during thermo-mechanical deformation, studies of composite materials, studies of layered systems, such as those with applied protective coatings, and dynamic studies of materials under extreme stress. Due to its extraordinary properties, we expect the proposed scintillator array technology to see widespread use in important synchrotron applications and have high commercial appeal.",

The volume of water required for these operations is a major concern. Industry is actively seeking methods to reduce water usage and increase the amount of gas recovered per unit of water used to stimulate the formation. There is substantial evidence that the rate and method of flowback of the fracturing fluid has a significant impact on the amount of water recovered and well productivity.\n\nProposed Solution:\nREI proposes to develop a multiphase Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model and an accompanying reduced order model (ROM) tool to predict flowback of the fracturing fluid from a well over time. The ROM tool will use a database of CFD solutions to provide quick estimates of the flowback rate and the potential impact on future gas production. The ROM will be designed to allow field operators and fracturing service companies to optimize the amount of water injected during stimulation, recover more of the injected water and increase the expected ultimate recovery of the natural gas in the formation.\n\nPhase I Work Plan\nREI will develop a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of the Flowback process using\nthe ANSYS/Fluent commercial CFD code. A database of CFD model solutions for flowback will be generated. A reduced order model (ROM) tool will be created using the database of CFD solutions. The CFD solutions and ROM tool will be benchmarked against field data.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits:\nThe completed ROM tool will allow field operators and fracturing service companies to (a)\noptimize the flowback rate and recovery of the fracturing fluid (primarily water) before stimulating a well and (b) history match real flowback data with the model to better understand the geometry properties of the produced fractures. This will result in less water usage per fracturing job, higher recovery rates of water from the well, higher initial production rates and higher ultimate recovery of the resource. This will allow the United States to continue to lead in natural gas production while lowering the amount of water used.",

Arctic summer sea ice retreat is unprecedented (9.4 to 13.6% per decade).   Numerical simulations predict a nearly ice-free summertime Arctic after the middle of the 21st century.  \nIt is now well established that clouds and aerosols have a major impact on warming in the Arctic and a concomitant reduction in sea ice.   Mixed-phase clouds, which contain both supercooled water drops and ice, are prevalent and persistent in the Arctic. Yet, relatively few in situ cloud measurements exist in mixed-phase clouds.  \nHow the Problem is Addressed: To date, research aircraft have accounted for the modest dataset of in situ measurements in Arctic clouds, but research aircraft are expensive to operate in Polar Regions, have limited duration, and present safety concerns. In contrast, unmanned aerial systems (UAS), which include small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV\u2019s) and tethered balloon systems, can operate for extended periods of time in the Arctic without risk to human life.  \nRecent technological advances in small UAV have been impressive, including flights into hurricanes and across the Atlantic Ocean.  Electrically-powered UAV are also making rapid gains in performance and duration due to improved composite designs and advances in battery technology.  However, miniaturized sensors to measure cloud and aerosol properties lag behind the development of small UAV.  \nThis proposal is to develop a lightweight (5 kg) instrument package containing sensors to measure cloud microphysics, aerosols, position, three-dimensional winds, heading, aircraft pitch, roll, yaw, ambient temperature, humidity, airspeed and altitude.  \nWhat will be Accomplished in Phase I and Phase II:  Phase I research will provide solid-model designs, ray-tracing and laboratory tests of all components of the miniaturized instrument package.  In Phase II, SPEC build and flight-test the instrument package on a small UAV provided by Vanilla Aircraft LLC, a leader in the design and fabrication of small unmanned aerial vehicles, or a Scaneagle provided by the DOE.  Flight tests will be conducted in clear air within the Ft. Pickett restricted airspace, and in mixed-phase clouds at Ft. Pickett and/or the DOE facility at Oliktok Point, Alaska.  \nThe miniaturized instrument package will take advantage of SPEC\u2019s previous experience developing microphysics probes for research aircraft, and advances in electronics that facilitate miniaturization of computers and signal conditioning.  SPEC developed the cloud particle imager (CPI) in 1997 and its 2D-S (stereo) optical array probe in 2004. Both of these instruments have been installed on over twenty research aircraft.  Highly-miniaturized versions of these instruments will be incorporated into the instrument package.\nBorrowing from it previous experience, SPEC will design and fabricate a combination particle probe that incorporates 1) a forward scattering probe that measures the size of particles from 1 to 50 microns, 2) a CPI that has a digital camera with 256 gray levels and at least 3-micron pixel resolution in the sample volume, and 3) a precipitation imager with 25 micron pixel resolution that fully images rain and ice particles out to 3.2 mm, and sizes all particles out to 1 cm.  An off-the-shelf optical aerosol particle sizer that measures from 0.2 to 10 microns, a cloud condensation counter (CCN) developed at Scripps Institute and an ice nuclei filter system will be included, along with sensors for position, winds and state parameters.  The instrument package is anticipated to weigh less than 5 kg and consume less than 50 W.   A CPI with the highest possible (submicron) pixel resolution for imaging very small ice and large aerosols will also be developed and tested. \nCommercial and Other Benefits: Improvements to climate prediction models require better measurements of the properties of Arctic clouds and aerosols.  A highly-miniaturized instrument package will be designed, built and installed on a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and deployed at Oliktok Point on the North Slope of Alaska, or other Polar location (e.g., Svalbard).  A successful demonstration project in Arctic clouds will establish the viability of small, electrically-powered UAV to make long-term in situ measurements of the properties of aerosols and Arctic mixed-phase clouds, which predominate in the Arctic.  The miniaturized instrument package developed in Phase II and installed on a small electrically-powered UAV will find application in other areas, including measurements of the near-field properties of volcanic ash and measurements of aerosols on battlefields and in urban areas.",

Currently, simulation technologies require large computational clusters and/or were designed for use by experts.  Furthermore, many industrial flows span a wide range of pressures which make application of continuum or rarefied methods to the entire flow field infeasible.   These barriers have hindered the effective use of simulation to advance technology involving rarefied flows in manufacturing.\n\nStatement of how this Problem or Situation is Being Addressed:\n\nSSI proposes to leverage the DOE-funded Stochastic Parallel Rarefied-gas Time-accurate Analyzer (SPARTA) software within a web-enabled cloud computing graphical user interface (GUI). The approach will dramatically decrease the associated costs for process design and optimization by eliminating the costly hardware and set-up time for high performance computing.  Additional hardening and \u201cshrink wrapping\u201d of the code will be done by insertion of automatic, adaptive routines, which will also help eliminate the need for an expert user. The new routines will maintain a high level of physical fidelity and numerical accuracy, so that the software can be effectively used by general users.\n\nWhat is to be done in the Phase I:\n\nIn Phase I, we will develop a proof-of-principle prototype that allows execution of the SPARTA library through an easy to use, web interface.  To establish feasibility, we will apply the software to a number of industry relevant flows.  Through discussions with our commercial partners, we will develop a detailed Phase II plan that will include an extensive beta test of the commercial product.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits:\n\nThe proposed software will have a wide application to simulate many internal and external flow processes that are of great interest to manufacturing firms, pharmaceutical companies, and aerospace corporations. These  simulation  capabilities  will  provide  a  direct  benefit  to  both  the  manufacturers  and  the  US community of consumers through a reduction in cost and advancement in product designs in many industries, including microelectronic manufacturing.

With this approach, the best characteristics of two different materials can be fully exploited, such as the excellent conductivity of the backbone oxide and the excellent stability and catalytic activity of the surface layer.  Previous efforts to produce surface functionalized powders using segregation or infiltration processes were unreliable and difficult to implement in large scale.\n\nStatement of How this Problem or Situation is being Addressed:\nThis SBIR project will demonstrate an alternative approach to produce surface functionalized powders based on fluidized bed technology.  Fluidized bed processing is a well established technique, which is used in a variety of commercial applications.  Structured Materials Industries (SMI) has developed a variation on this technology, known as Fluidized Bed Chemical Vapor Deposition (FBCVD).  SMI is presently implementing and commercializing FBCVD technology as a scalable and economical process to deposit surface coatings on powder materials in large scale.\n\nWhat is to be Done in Phase I:\nIn Phase I of this SBIR program, SMI will use existing capabilities to produce trial quantities of powders with a variety of coating thickness and compositions.  SMI will partner with FuelCell Energy, Inc. (FCE) in this SBIR program.  FCE will process SMI's surface functionalized powders into cathode materials, and fabricate small scale fuel cell stacks for testing.  The deliverables for Phase I will include the demonstrated feasibility of using FBCVD to produce surface functionalized powders for SOFC cathode materials, and an assessment of the technical and economical benefits for fuel cell implementation.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits:\nFuel cells offer the potential for nearly a two fold increase in the efficiency of converting fossil fuels to useable electrical energy.  In addition, fuel cells produce far fewer pollutants such as NOx, compared to conventional technologies for utilizing fossil fuels. The development of reliable and efficient fuel cells will reduce emission of green house gases and other pollutants, reduce consumption of fossil fuels, and reduce US dependence on imported oil.",

Measurements have demonstrated the potential to generate electron beams with the high repetition rate and QE required for FEL and next gener- ation light source applications, however, high-fidelity simulation capabilities are needed to enable detailed understanding of the physics of electron emission from rough surfaces that affect QE dy- namics, response time, and dark current properties of photocathodes.

Such machines, estimated to cost as much as $500M\u2013$1B,  will require polarized particle beams; and high polarization improves experimental efficiency. To reduce the risk associated with building these machines, and to ensure the desired high polarization, scientists need accurate simulations  of the spin dynamics. While codes exist for simulating spin dynamics in particle accelerators, none include a realistic, self-consistent treatment of the beam-beam interaction. In the context of electron-ion colliders, this interaction can have a profound effect on the electron beam polarization.  It is therefore essential that scientists develop a realistic understanding of how the beam-beam interaction will affect machine performance.\nStatement of how this problem is being addressed\nWe will couple together the capabilities of two separate codes: one capable of performing fast spin-orbit tracking in storage rings, and another capable of self-consistent 3D simulations of the beam-beam interaction. The latter code will be extended so that it also tracks the spin degrees of freedom for particles in a simulation.  We will couple both inputs and outputs of these two codes, so that scientists can study in detail the effect of multi-pass beam-beam collisions  on the polarisation of both beams in a given design for an electron-ion  collider.\nWhat is to be done in the Phase I\nDuring the Phase I project, we will take a code that is capable of self-consistent 3D beam-beam simulations and extend it to include the spin degrees of freedom and also implement spin integration. We will identify how best to connect the input and output streams of this code and a traditional spin-orbit  tracking code so that scientists can perform multi-pass simulations. And we will implement a simple version of a particle-field  updater as a prototype  for simulating laser-gain media.\nCommercial applications and other benefits\nThe proposed software development will directly benefit scientists working to design the electron-ion collider required for fundamental advances in experimental nuclear physics. In addition, the work done to include spin integration in the beam-beam simulations  can be further  extended so as to simulate the dynamics of laser gain media. This new software capability will significantly extend the range of lasers that can be simulated, and it will have particular relevance to the simulation of both high-power and short-pulse-length lasers.",

Currently, Oil recovery rates are less than 7% on average, while gas recovery rates remain around 25% of total recoverable reserves. Furthermore, currently, hydraulic stimulation processes utilize large amounts of water, which must be treated and disposed of during flowback.\n\nHow Problem is Being Addressed\nThis Phase I SBIR will develop engineered stimulation fluid alternatives and modifications to slickwater fluids that provide the controlled application of force independent of flowrate to widen and extend fracture networks.   The ability to stimulate with higher degrees of control and expand fracture networks that are not in the primary tensile direction (eg, shear fractures).   The addition of materials that expand the fluid volume in-situ during completion is the approach being taken\n\nActions of Phase I\nThe phase I program will characterize the underlying kinetics and effectiveness of the novel stimulation fluids, and will experimentally determine the engineering design basis for their use.   Methods of controlling the rate and under what conditions (timing) the expansion force is delivered into crack networks will be experimentally verified, and their function and resultant fracture conductivity after stimulation will be measured using API reference methods in the laboratory to demonstrate feasibility and support transition to scale-up and field trials.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits\nThis program will develop unconventional stimulation fluids that have improved control over crack widening and extension compared to current fluids used in the oil and gas industry.   This ability to produce improved fracture network conductivity with lower water use can potentially increase oil recovery by 20-40%, and are also applicable to the development of the 200,000 exojoule enhanced geothermal energy sources available in North America.",

Surface NMR has been proven as a powerful geophysical technique for quantitatively measuring porosity and permeability, but to date the technology has been cumbersome with low signal-to-noise (SNR) and slow measurement speeds that limit the ability to efficiently survey large areas.  We will transform surface NMR into a rapid mapping technology through novel advancements in hardware, acquisition methods, and processing algorithms that will yield order of magnitude improvements in measurement speed for wide area hydrogeologic characterization.\n\nPhase I Tasks: The Phase 1 research will establish the feasibility of obtaining high quality surface NMR data in vastly reduced measurement times with mobile deployment platforms.  We will first establish the feasibility of novel acquisition and processing innovations to increase the available SNR with reduced measurement durations.  We will further develop and demonstrate hardware improvements to enhance system mobility and surveying efficiency.  Finally, we will directly demonstrate the feasibility of rapid surface NMR field measurements to map hydrogeologic properties using land-towed and airborne platforms.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits: Completion of this technology in Phase II and beyond will deliver rapid scanning surface NMR as a commercial product for sale, rental, and services in the booming market of geophysical mapping instrumentation sales and services.  This technology will be of tremendous value to any company, government, or public agency engaged in contaminated site remediation, groundwater resource evaluation and development, or compliance with environmental standards.  In particular reducing survey times and increasing the reliability of hydrogeologic mapping, will reduce site characterization costs, allow improved decision making, and will ultimately improve project outcomes and profitability.

Providing Gbps wireless connection is a challenge in last-mile networks as the data-rate of Wi-Fi technology is limited to a few hundreds of Mbps. Visible light communication (VLC) is a potential alternative data communication technique for wireless applications that uses optical energy to provide simultaneously lighting needs and data transmission. This technology transmits data using the lighting systems that are already in place for the illumination of indoor environments. VLC is a strong competitor to other communication approaches such as Wi-Fi due to the fact that it can be integrated with the existing lighting system and offer a compact, dual-use, and energy saving solution. VLC systems are challenging to design because they must provide both high speed communications   and   also   fulfill   the  lighting   requirements   of  the   indoor  environment. Furthermore, the modulation bandwidth of the available white LEDs is limited to 50 MHz and transmitting Gbps data using these LEDs requires sophisticated modulation and coding schemes. VLNComm, along with the University of Virginia (UVA), has successfully developed a new coding scheme that not only enables the VLC system to achieve hundreds of Mbps data-rates, but also is able to fulfill all the requirements of the lighting standards.\nVLNComm aims to further develop the coding schemes so that the VLC system can support 1\nGbps wireless connections and demonstrate the feasibility of the concept during Phase I under the subtopic \u201cd.

Advancement in this technology will provide a double incentive for implementing economical LED lighting systems. VLNComm will use tri-chromatic white LEDs to broadcast the data at Gbps rates inside the indoor environment, and will use infrared light for the uplink connection. VLNComm will provide small USB modems to VLC users to plug into their laptops/computers and connect to the VLC network. VLNComm will consider three options to connect the LED lights and panels to the internet: a) electric grid using Power Line Communications, b) Ethernet cable and c) Optical Fiber.

Nitric acid oxidation produces significant quantities of nitrous oxide (N2O), a GHG regulated due to its contribution to global warming and ozone depletion. Thus current methods for production of widely-used chemicals such as adipic acid form petroleum-derived sources are unsustainable and environmentally unfriendly. Developing methods that enable high- yield synthesis of adipic acid from renewable feedstocks, with better economics, smaller environmental footprints, and greater sustainability than existing petroleum-based processes are greatly desirable.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the development of a novel biosynthetic pathway for the high-yield, and environmentally benign production of adipic acid from renewable sources such as biomass-derived sugars and intermediates. For this SBIR Phase I project we will focus on demonstrating successful in vivo synthesis of adipic acid via the novel pathway. This involves 1) Identification and biochemical validation of enzymes catalyzing the individual steps in the proposed adipic acid pathway 2) In vivo adipic acid pathway validation.\n\nThe proposed adipic acid pathway if successfully commercialized will enable environmentally benign industrial production of bio-based adipic acid that will be significantly less expensive than its petroleum derived counterpart. This will afford increased profitability for the chemical industry, offer cost-savings to consumers on everyday products made from adipic acid such as carpets, airbags, apparel and many other nylon fiber products, reduce GHG emissions, and promote environmentally sustainable  manufacturing practices.  Bio-based  production  of  this  traditionally petroleum-derived chemical will also foster energy security and independence in the US (by reducing oil imports) and afford an additional revenue generation option for the agricultural community, while creating new jobs in an environmentally sustainable and socially beneficial way.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Microbial fuel cells (MFC's) use metabolic reactions inside bacteria as a source of electrons. Wastewater treatment processes with MFC's employ bacteria to generate electrical power produced as they anaerobically breakdown organic materials captured from wastewater. FTL Labs Corporation (FTL) proposes a powerful new enabling technology for deployable wastewater treatment using high-capacity flow-through microbiological fuel cells developed and proven in the laboratory of Dr. Caitlyn Butler, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. \"ElectroSeptic\" is based on technology that has been tested at the gallon per day level in the Phase I program. ElectroSeptic has been created with real-world return-on-investment as a primary design goal. Excellent performance is achieved through a self-optimizing bio-electrode approach and innovative flow-entrained charge transfer. ElectroSeptic sequesters nitrogen and extracts energy from the wastewater continuously emanating from human populations without aeration.BENEFIT:The proposed technology, when implemented, will allow a significant enhancement in low-energy, modular wastewater treatment. In addition to this important application to the U.S. Department of Defense, civilian markets such as agricultural and industrial food processing wastewater treatment may develop as a significant market for the resultant technologies. In applications that require low-power, on-demand, effective wastewater treatment, FTL Labs s (FTLs) ElectroSeptic wastewater treatment technology can find a growing market.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The Air Force spends $4.5 billion annually on aircraft maintenance related to corrosion.  The source of this corrosion frequently is airborne chlorides that settle on metal parts and sensitive avionics and then absorb moisture from the air to create an electrolyte that promotes galvanic corrosion.   The proposed work will design, fabricate and test a Corrosion Mitigation System (CMS) that supplies at least 75 lb/min of deeply dried and highly filtered air to parked or stored aircraft and aerospace ground equipment (AGE).  The CMS will apply a technology that integrates liquid-desiccant contactors into a compressor-based, direct-expansion (DX) air conditioner to produce a system that can deliver air with a dewpoint that is more than 10 degree F lower than the air conditioners suction temperature (i.e., the proposed system will deliver deeply dried air with a dewpoint of 32 degree F while operating with a 44 degree F evaporator suction temperature.  The high suction temperature reduces the work performed by the compressor leading to very low power requirements that are projected to be 40% to 50% below those of commercially available systems that perform a similar function. Once proven at the smaller scale, the liquid-desiccant  CMS technology can be scaled up to become a highly efficient means of maintaining larger shelters at relative humidity below 40%.  The technology will also be very competitive in the segment of the HVAC market that addresses humidity problems within buildings; BENEFIT: In addition to reducing the high maintenance cost imposed by chloride-induced corrosion, the technology at the core of  a liquid-desiccant CMS will have import HVAC applications.  High humidity frequently leads to an uncomfortable and unhealthy indoor environment.  While corrosion may be less of a problem, humidity-induced mold can lead to very large maintenance bills for building owners.  A version of the liquid-desiccant CMS that  delivers large volumes of dry ventilation air could be a much lower cost alternative to technologies now used to control indoor humidity in very humid climates.",

The generated results can be organized into V&V arguments, and evidence chains. Establishing traceability of these artifacts provides values throughout the life cycle.  Defects can be removed during the design stage, legacy components can be characterized and tightly integrated into architecture models, and continuous system verification can be performed by checking the correctness and integrity of the evidence chain, from system design to code artifacts. Modular safety assurance cases can be constructed to capture the evidence chain for use in certification of systems.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to offer custom crafted digital voices for text-to-speech applications. Each one of us has a unique voiceprint - an essential part of our self-identity. Though the quality of text-to-speech technology has improved, voice options remain limited. For the 2.5 million Americans (and tens of millions worldwide) living with voicelessness who rely on devices to talk, access to a custom digital voice is a game changer. It's the difference between a functional solution and being heard, uniquely, as oneself. Enhanced opportunities for social connection increase quality of life, independence, and access to educational and vocational resources that can narrow the gap between those with and without disability. This immediate unmet societal need, coupled with the increasing proliferation of devices that speak to us and for us, creates a compelling, timely and significant commercial opportunity for high quality, personalized digital voices that can be produced at scale. By leveraging the company's crowdsourced human voicebank and proprietary voice matching and blending algorithms the technology has the potential to empower everyone to express themselves through their own voice. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project builds on the company's NSF-funded research and Phase I results that support feasibility and commercialization of a customized voice building technology. The text-to-speech market, encompassing assistive technologies, enterprise and consumer applications, is currently valued at around $1B and is rapidly growing and ripe for innovation. To create custom voices, the company leverages the source-filter theory of speech production. From those who are unable or unwilling to record several hours of speech the company extracts a brief vocal sample - even a single vowel contains enough 'vocal DNA' to seed the personalization process. Identity cues of the source are then combined with filter properties of a demographically and acoustically matched donor in the company's voicebank. The result is a voice that captures the vocal identity of the recipient but the clarity of the donor. Phase II technical objectives address the need for 1) customer-driven voice customization, 2) quality assurance of crowdsourced recordings, 3) voice aging algorithms, and 4) targeted donor recruitment algorithms. These advances will help secure the assistive technology beachhead and spur innovations for broader applications such as virtual reality, personal robotics, and digital persona for the Internet of Things.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be an improved cybersecurity posture among industries that rely on mission-critical computing systems that are difficult to patch and/or monitor. Many technical failures on these systems, including information breaches, equipment malfunctions, and malware infestations, stem from longstanding problems that go undetected. This project develops nonintrusive measurement and analytics tools that give IT operators operational visibility into high-assurance assets, increasing confidence in their correct operation. This project will reduce losses due to unscheduled maintenance across industries, improve the trustworthiness of embedded and semi-embedded systems such as software-based medical devices, and reduce the business risk of breaches and malware damage at organizations that rely on hard-to-manage devices. This project also advances the state of the art in detecting rogue software execution and other anomalies through nonintrusive side channels, such as observing power signals collected on a wall outlet. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to extend operational visibility of IT departments into mission-critical computing equipment using a novel combination of nonintrusive signal collection and machine learning. From infusion pumps to Internet routers to retail point-of-sale terminals, organizations rely on fixed-purpose computing systems. With this reliance comes three key risks. First, the effects of unscheduled interruptions to critical systems ripple outward to other business areas. Second, critical systems are often incompatible with constantly changing mainstream tools such as host-based antivirus and intrusion-detection systems. Third, critical systems often lag behind other systems patch levels because they are rarely taken out of service for patching. This project addresses these challenges by providing nonintrusive monitoring for critical systems in situ, reducing the risk of unscheduled downtime due to abnormal behavior. The company's monitoring hardware and software observe software execution from the vantage point of the power line, requiring no modifications to monitored systems and extending the ability of operators to understand what critical systems are doing.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in enabling wide range of commercial applications of bulk metallic glasses (BMG). BMGs are novel metallic materials that are fundamentally different from, and advantageous to conventional alloys. They are stronger than most crystalline metals, but at the same time shapeable like plastics. Additional benefits of BMGs include extremely high precision of parts, increased complexity and elimination of expensive machining. Use of BMGs will provide broad opportunities for manufacturers in areas such as watch making and precision mechanics, electronics, biomedical, nano-imprint, defense, aerospace, and automotive. The current barrier to industrializing BMGs is non-availability of practical feedstock material such as BMG sheets. Technologies that we are developing as part of this project include BMG sheet fabrication and thermoplastic forming (TPF) of final components for a variety of applications. Using sheets, manufacturers can leverage BMGs unique processability to fabricate complex shapes at highest precision and ease through thermoplastic forming methods. Our technology also has significant societal implications. It will empower innovative small and medium size U.S. companies by bringing them a novel manufacturing technology that is highly versatile, energy efficient and low in capital investment. This project is based on the recent scientific discovery of BMG sheet fabrication using the thermoplastic forming technology. This is a low-force, high-rate deformation method with great potential for large-scale commercial manufacturing. We expect that our findings will lead to a better understanding of TPF-based processes. Specifically, for multi-step TPF-based sheet fabrication, the proposed work will reveal process stability and how it is affected by processing parameters. Proposed research will also determine the effects of TPF-based processing on mechanical properties of BMGs, will help identify suitable BMG alloys for sheet fabrication and provide insights into their commercial feasibility. In addition, the proposed work will also enhance theoretical understanding of BMG sheet fabrication and help develop a predictable and quantitative model description. Such models can allow prediction of alloy-specific processing conditions in industrial settings in the future. Finally, this project will result in a commercially viable sheet fabrication process and apparatus for BMG sheets of unprecedented sizes. It will significantly advance opportunities for bulk metallic glasses in a wide range of applications, bringing two decades of academic discoveries to the commercial arena.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project includes applications ranging from peak load shifting, grid buffering for renewable energy input, frequency regulation, and chemical conversions. As the percentage of energy from renewables on the grid increases, energy storage will be essential to stabilize the supply and demand. Currently, 20-40% of wind energy is often stranded due to the inability to capture the energy in the peak generation periods. Germany, Europe, Japan, Korea, and other countries are funding significant efforts in energy storage projects. Energy storage is also a critical need for all of the United States armed services, including microgrids for forward operating bases. While batteries can demonstrate very good round trip efficiencies, they suffer from self-discharge, capacity fade, and high cost. Flow batteries separate the reactant and product storage from the electrode active area, enabling higher capacities through merely adding more storage. Many systems have not been practical in the past due to low energy density values, but fuel cell and electrolysis developments have provided pathways to higher energy density. Advances in these areas would find immediate commercial interest, and address key strategic areas related to energy security and grid stabilization and resiliency. The objectives of this Phase II research project are: 1) flow field design for balanced fluid distribution in both operating modes and minimization of shunt currents; 2) selection of catalysts and membranes for reversibility, durability and efficiency requirements; 3) integration and testing of Proton components with the Sustainable Innovations embodiment hardware; 4) scale up to a full size stack and operation in both modes at SI; and 5) development of a performance model in collaboration with SI based on the final configuration. These objectives address present limitations in energy storage solutions.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop an imaging flow cytometer to enable high-throughput, precision analysis of biological cells for the drug discovery and biotechnology industries. The goal for this project is to provide order-of-magnitude throughput improvements versus other high content cell analysis technologies, which will ultimately lead to an increase in the efficiency of drug discovery. A high throughput imaging flow cytometer is an ideal solution for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, as well as flow cytometry core facilities, because of the demand for higher throughput cellular analysis. In addition to drug discovery, the imaging capability of this flow cytometer will enable researchers to perform rare cell detection with higher precision than is currently available, and ultimately, in vitro hematology and oncology diagnostics using imaging flow cytometry. Finally, a high throughput flow cytometer with an order of magnitude greater throughput will dramatically reduce the time researchers spend in flow cytometry core facilities, ultimately enabling a general increase in biomedical research productivity. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to improve the efficiency of drug discovery by introducing a higher throughput, high content screening (HCS) instrument. HCS investigates the effects and associated mechanisms of action of therapeutic compounds by measuring multiple parameters from individual cells, typically using imaging. Although HCS has been highly effective in discovery new drugs, it, unfortunately, has significant throughput limitations. Namely, HCS requires data to be collected at the single cell level versus the population level. Typically, low-throughput readout techniques, such as flow cytometry and fluorescence imaging, are used to collect this data. This project aims to alleviate the speed limitations associated with imaging in drug discovery by introducing a high-throughput imaging flow cytometer capable of performing sub-cellular imaging at the speeds of traditional high throughput screening. The project leverages a high-speed fluorescence imaging modality based on frequency domain multiplexing, which was developed and demonstrated in Phase I, to provide market-leading imaging performance. Expanding this technology into a full flow cytometer by the end of Phase II, the goal is to have a 3-laser, 10-color imaging flow cytometer ready for researchers performing HCS as well as the general biomedical research community.",

With no parting lines, the technology represents a significant advancement over current state of the art molding and 3D technologies for certain applications. As this represents an entirely new field of research, not merely an extension of solid freeform fabrication (SFF) techniques, it opens and enables wide research areas in engineering and chemical disciplines. More imminent is using the technology to create capillary electrophoresis (CE) chips that vastly reduce the amount of reagents, provide previously unattainable properties, and at a significantly lower price. By doing so, the technology will accelerate and broaden the adoption of microfluidics which are currently used in applications such as forensics, genomics, drug making, drug analysis, clinical diagnostics, biosensors, and environmental testing, among countless others. This project automates and expands a novel platform technology to manufacture high resolution micro parts.

Each human body is unique, and the fitting approach is often reduced to trying on products in-store or in-clinic. While this approach works to some level, increasingly more purchases are made online, and a similar trial and error method leads to a high return rate for retailers and a significant time burden for customers. The fitting system Eclo is developing will dramatically reduce the shipping costs for online retailers and increase the convenience for online shoppers. Additionally, the virtual fitting technology will help remove the dependency of companies on brick-and-mortar stores and to reduce the cost of goods by half in some cases. Furthermore, the technology proposed is the key for mass manufacturing of custom garment since all geometric properties of the body will be readily using smartphones. The databases of body scans could also be used for designing better products. Lastly, the shoe scanner in this project requires a small scanner head design for internal volumes; this technology can be tailored to making endoscopes for medical or rescue applications. This project will prepare a virtual fitting system for commercial use in online shoe retail and address a 25% return rate. The virtual fitting system will give online shoppers a size recommendation based on scans of their feet. A foot scanner allows users to obtain a 3D model of their feet by taking a video with a smartphone. This process will be made simple, robust, and user-friendly with the aid of augmented reality. Using smartphone sensors and strategically selecting images from videos will make this process fast and accurate. A shoe scanner scans the inside of shoes and will be upgraded to also scan the outside of shoes. A fitting algorithm will be developed to detect important features on feet and shoes to make size recommendations.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that it will dramatically increase the efficiency of communications networks. Commercially, the ability to dynamically, adaptively and optimally route traffic on data networks will lead to network cost savings ranging from 60% - 70% for network service providers. Critically, the project leverages the recent industry shift towards software-defined networking (SDN) that is projected to become a $45 billion market by 2020. The excitement behind SDN is driven primarily by the promised performance benefits of better traffic control. By bringing to market its provably optimal, dynamic and adaptive traffic control algorithms, the company will be uniquely positioned to capitalize on this market opportunity. The immediate resulting social impact will be that end users will have access to faster, cheaper and more robust data networks. In the longer term, efficient software control of networks will enable rapid innovation in networking leading to new network applications that have not even been envisioned yet. The project also enhances technological and scientific understanding by commercially verifying the company's solution to a longstanding open problem in networking - namely, whether an easy to deploy, dynamic, adaptive and optimal routing algorithm can be found. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on delivering commercial, smart, traffic control algorithms that can unlock the full capacity of modern communications networks. Today, due to unprecedented traffic growth, network operators face major challenges in the form of efficient resource utilization. The problem is that the inherent randomness of data traffic has led to network designers over-provisioning networks to the point where they run at 30% - 40% utilization on average. The company's competitive advantage is a new algorithm that allows it to optimally manage traffic variations by adjusting network routes in real time while retaining the scalability and simplicity of today's protocols. The goal in this project is to build on the beta tests from Phase I by developing an enterprise-grade, cloud-based network control application that is ready for general market launch. To this end, the company will start with small commercial deployments at selected test partners. Feedback from these deployments will be used to iron out any issues before general market launch. By the end of the project, the company anticipates generating significant revenue from initial customers as it continues to innovate and maintain its current lead in developing SDN control plane software.",

        "abstract": "Surface-to-air missiles represent a serious threat to both military and civilian aviation. However, development of more effective countermeasures requires realistic simulation of the missile plume over a wide range of observation distances to improve recognition capability. Accordingly, the purpose of this program is to design and build a next generation, extended range pyrophoric fluid valve (ERPV) for the Air Force Towed Airborne Plume Simulator (TAPS) to improve its reliability and performance. This initiative will insert Active Signal Technologies novel high frequency actuation and valve technology into the TAPS to provide the required dynamic range and frequency capability to modulate the pyrophoric fluid flow for more efficient and advanced testing. A development effort lasting approximately 24 months is envisaged to mature the technology and transition it to Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC). Active Signal will build prototypes capable of delivering the necessary dynamic range and frequency response. AEDC will test the final EPRV in its wind tunnel. Deployment of the EPRV aboard the TAPS will enable the Air Force to conduct airborne tests of its Advanced Infrared Countermeasures. This will enhance range capabilities at the Center for Countermeasures at White Sands Missile Range with the goal of improving Aircraft Survivability.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the ability of the haloacetic acids (HAAs) analyzer proposed here to change how superintendents of drinking water utilities go about understanding their drinking water treatment plants. The HAAs analyzer will allow superintendents to continuously map, monitor and then optimize their drinking water treatment practices using detailed and high quality measurements on the federally-regulated HAAs, which are carcinogens. Optimizing of the water treatment practices using the HAAs analyzer will reduce chemical usage (save money) while simultaneously providing the highest quality drinking water for their customers by minimizing HAAs. The commercial U.S. market for Drinking Water chemicals, contract operations, consulting/engineering, instrument and testing is $19.3 billion. The entire U.S. Water industry market is $86.4 billion. The major target of this proposal is the 28,643 traditional community water systems serving 90 % of the U.S. population. Some water systems struggled to meet Stage 1 Disinfection By-Product (DBP) regulations. Stage 2 of these regulations is stricter. The DBP regulations address long-term (decades' timescale) exposure to HAAs. Superintendents can use the proposed HAAs analyzer to understand hourly, short-term variations in their treatment plants to enhance long-term minimization of HAAs. This project will commercialize the first state-of-the-art instrument for fully automated, on-site process monitoring of the drinking water disinfection by-products known as haloacetic acids (HAAs). The HAAs analyzer proposed here has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of water treatment through reduction of treatment chemical usage at the water treatment plant while simultaneously improving and stabilizing water quality with respect to the carcinogenic and federally regulated HAAs. Currently, most drinking water treatment plants use contract laboratories to determine HAAs concentrations in the distribution system. This approaches can take 2 - 3 weeks to return the results at a significant expense for the equivalent hourly data provided by the proposed HAAs analyzer. The research objectives for this Phase II SBIR proposal are to develop components for the HAAs analyzer to enable long-term, maintenance free operation with minimal operator intervention. Simultaneously, costs will be reduced for both construction and operation of the HAAs analyzer to establish commercial feasibility. The anticipated results will be a HAAs analyzer that will provide water treatment personnel individual and Total HAAs concentrations once per hour, on-site and automatically.",

The detector is based on the use of a metallic lithium-6 sensitizer layer paired with a thin-film CdS/CdTe heterojunction to detect the alpha and triton charged particles produced by the n + Li-6 reaction. This patent-pending detector has high sensitivity to thermal neutrons and extremely low sensitivity to gamma rays; it is light weight, robust, impervious to pressure variations, not susceptible to microphonics, operates at low voltage, and is scalable to large areas.  In Phase I, Lithium Innovations has confirmed low-noise operation of these detectors with area greater than 5 sq.cm. and gamma rejection of greater than one million. In Phase II our team will extend its Phase I success to develop a portable neutron detector package in a small, hand-held configuration with neutron sensitivity of approximately 10 counts/(neutron/sq.cm.).  The advances made in Phase I from DNDO have fully leveraged the combined technology of Lithium Innovations for handling and processing isotopically enriched Li-6 and the technology of Lucintech Inc for fabricating monolithically integrated thin-film solar modules.  This innovative technology will be demonstrated to deliver a new generation of neutron detectors that will revolutionize the field of thermal neutron detection, monitoring, and imaging.",

        "abstract": "AOSense proposes to develop a cold-atom gravity gradiometer for nonintrusive, passive detection of shielded special nuclear material (SNM) within a human occupied vehicle.  Both SNM and SNM shielding consist of high-Z materials that are substantially denser than background.  Theoretical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of gravity tomography for identification of shielded SNM.  The proposed gravity detection approach is fully passive and safe to vehicle occupants.  Furthermore, gravity detection of SNM is complementary to existing radiation detection methods. The fidelity of gravity detection improves with thicker SNM shielding.  The proposed highly-sensitive, stable, and fieldable gravity gradiometer will measure minute gravity field fluctuations to detect shielded SNM rapidly and with high detection fidelity. For Phase I AOSense designed and tested key components of the gravity sensor.  For Phase II we will complete sensor subsystem build and integration. Laboratory and field testing will follow in Phase III of the proposed project. The proposed gravity gradiometer has numerous commercial applications: airborne gravity survey for mineral and oil prospecting, ground-based surveys to monitor water tables, and gravity-compensated inertial navigation.  Compared to existing state-of-the-art gravity gradiometers, cold-atom sensors offer substantially improved stability, sensitivity, and SWaP at reduced complexity and cost.",

State University (NCSU) performed analysis and experiments to determine if the proposed approaches would provide the require functionality.CCR investigated potential coatings to address arcing issues with RF sources subjected to stand-by operation. CCR identified a mechanism whereby the impact of barium oxide contamination could be mitigated by reducing or eliminating the availability of oxygen using a sputtered coating. Two potential coatings were applied to focus electrodes for the SPS-49 klystron. The effectiveness of the coating will be confirmed during the Phase I Option and the Phase II program.The program demonstrated that a coating could be applied to the internal surfaces of an RF source assembly to dramatically reduce corrosion. Analysis showed the coating was successfully applied to the internal device structures, confirming the effectiveness in achieving uniform and conformal coatings in complex structures.The Phase II program will complete the development of these two technologies, including integration into products used in Navy systems. Prototype products will be tested to confirm program goals are achieved.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The useful life of medium caliber gun barrels is dominated by fatigue cracking initiated early in the weapons deployment. Fatigue cracks worsen in severity throughout the life of the barrel until they reach a critical size, indicating end of life. During the Phase I effort, Luna demonstrated that eddy current (EC) techniques are effective in detecting both machined and fatigue-induced cracks inside gun barrels. EC-based measurements performed on several medium caliber barrels were not influenced by the intricate rifling profile of the bore of the barrel while remaining sensitive to cracks ranging from under 0.02 inches to greater than 0.375 inches. In the Phase II effort, Luna proposes development of an EC-based prototype with artificial intelligence post-processing algorithms for complete autonomy in assessing fatigue condition within barrels. A man-portable prototype for use on flight lines will be assembled, allowing for barrel evaluation without requiring their removal from the aircraft. Based on a multi-frequency excitation scheme, an improved design of the probes, and a trained neural classifier, the prototype will identify the number of existing cracks around the barrel circumference and assess their individual depths and locations.; BENEFIT: This project directly addresses the need for increasing savings and reducing maintenance cost of medium caliber gun barrels. Maintenance time and costs will be reduced by increasing barrel usage and reducing barrel replacement frequency. Currently, medium caliber gun barrels are retired when a maximum number of rounds is reached, often leading to premature removals. The developed system will allow for continued barrel usage throughout its entire useful life. The overall anticipated result of this effort is development of a new tool for assessing the condition of medium caliber gun inventory, replacing todays statistically-based gun retirement protocol with a condition-based inventory management protocol. The proposed technology has broad market potential and meets a significant economic and national security need. Anticipated commercial uses include pipe inspection in the electric power, marine propulsion, and petrochemical industries.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Quantitative ablation recession rate measurements of heat shield surfaces are essential for evaluating the performance of heat shield materials. Currently, these measurements are limited to two-dimensional images that focus on the nose tip regression rate. For wedge testing, recession rate is determined by comparing pre- and post-test measurements, and therefore, recession rate as a function of time can only be obtained by conducting separate tests with progressively longer run times. We propose a real-time 3-D surface mapping capability for arc jet models based on the concept of stereo photogrammetric reconstruction of the surface using projected structured light patterns onto the surface.  Imaging in this high temperature reactive flow is degraded by emission from the surface and reactions in the flow which result in significant spectral content. Recently, ISSI has demonstrated image-based measurements of particle dynamics in Solid Rocket Motors using narrowband illumination and short exposure times to reject the broadband emission from the flow and surface. The resulting 3-D surface maps of material recession as a function of time would allow more effective ablation performance evaluations of advanced high-temperature materials and enable validation of computational models of material response.BENEFIT:It is noted that the market for ablation coating regression in hypersonic flows is limited, however, the fundamental technology that is key to the proposal, optical surface topography has applications in a variety of industries. A system that provides accurate measurements of surface geometry, even in the presence of noise may be of value aeronautical and bio-medical engineering. For ISSI, the most obvious customer base are existing wind tunnel operators who have an interest in higher performance model deformation systems. The surface-imaging systems that are key to this program could have significant impact on the model deformation applications. ISSI is a key commercial source of PSP technology worldwide, with customers in the US, Japan, Korea, and several countries in the EU. Total sales from this technology are now over $1,000,000 per year with significant growth seen each of the last 6 years. Several commercial customers have expressed interest in model deformation capability. With our current market position, ISSI will be able to market this new capability to existing customers as well as develop new customersts.",

This project develops comprehensive data analysis methods that connect individual histories of parts and systems in a unified framework, enabling early identification of bad actors that contribute disproportionally to system failures. The developed methodology can provide specific and actionable guidance aimed at restoring the system performance in a cost effective manner. Phase I of the project demonstrated the feasibility of the approach for data from USAF aircraft fleet and one of the major LRUs used in this fleet. The approach was used to build the ROCOF trends and identify bad actors in the population of the units.  Phase II will develop prototype software tool implementing the analytics and ready for integration with the AF enterprise IT systems.; BENEFIT: The developed analytics provides effective measurement of reliability trends of fielded repairable systems based on existing maintenance data. With the developed method, even short term changes can be successfully identified through monthly and daily trends across the fleet system and modular subsystems. As a result, significant cost avoidance can be achieved during operation of those systems by making more informed decisions about the maintenance actions and operations and facilitating more efficient use of available resources.",

The imagery is fused and registered to a common reference so that exploitation algorithms, such as change detection and event monitoring, are reported with accurate geographic coordinates. The system, called SatTel, is implemented as open source software that is designed to run on the cloud with web-based analyst tools for defining intelligence queries. These queries arise from tasks such as monitoring weapon test sites, and receive timely responses due to SatTels ability to aggregate images based on an integrated portal to access multiple vendor archives. The imagery to satisfy intelligence queries is selected using a rule-based algorithm that matches exploitation algorithm data requirements against available image attributes such as resolution, viewpoint and atmospheric effects. The image fusion process results in useful intermediate products including: a high resolution digital elevation model (DEM) and a controlled orthorectified image base map (CIB). These products are exported in standard formats such as GEOTIF and NITF. The image exploitation algorithms include: global change detection, event triggers and vehicle tracking and are exported as attributed shape files, a format accepted by many current analyst tools, such as ArcGIS.BENEFIT:Oil and Gas energy, Natural Resource management: agriculture and forestry, Insurance, Fleet management, Real estate, city planning and engineering",

DEBS incorporates advanced security measures, among them continuous sensing, tamper-resistance and authentication, that will prevent the physical attacks and counterfeiting of seals that plague users of disposable bolt seals today. DEBS will operate like an ISO-17712 market-standard disposable bolt seal, and its $15 retail price, simple operation, and maintenance-free design will facilitate large-scale adoption across all container shipments without increasing workload or impacting the flow of goods. \n\nFindings or Results\nPhase II builds on the progress made during Phase I and will produce final DEBS prototypes for testing and approval by DHS. These prototypes will incorporate all of the features required in a commercial DEBS device. The proposed work culminates in a technical report that will include all of the design and production files needed for large-scale manufacturing of DEBS.\n\nPotential Commercial Applications\nThe global market for DEBS is +100 million seals per year. DEBS can be immediately deployed across market segments such as in-bond cargo, transit cargo, maritime cargo, CSI ports, and others that can benefit from tamper-proof intelligent seals. Its low-price and simple yet effective operation will help drive DEBS penetration into other container markets worldwide.",

Creare is developing a Seabed Imaging System (SIS) capable of providing detailed information on both the topography and composition of the seafloor. The SIS is intended to be mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to provide data that can be used to supplement and constrain acoustic performance models. Data from the SIS will assist in estimating sonar penetration depth and the magnitude of acoustic image degradation due to clutter.The Creare SIS provides fully automated data processing and balances the need for high spatial resolution with low power consumption. The small footprint of the system facilitates mounting in the REMUS 600 AUV. During Phase II we will develop a fully functional version of the system and perform testing in the laboratory and in a series of open-water environments. Final system performance will be demonstrated during autonomous bottom surveys with the REMUS 600.",

This approach offers the opportunity for crafting molecularly defined vaccine nanostructures that stimulate a specific primary response that is prolonged by the antigen production by transfected cells.  Cell targeting and stimulation may also serve to direct whether an antibody or a cell-mediated response occurs following vaccination. Development of this platform resulted from in silico modeling, and PNL proposes to expand its InSequeo modeling software to create virus-inspired DNA origami (VIDO) vaccines.  Based on the availability of recombinant antigens, their gene sequences, and reagents for detection, PNL proposes to demonstrate the first VIDO vaccine using the HIV-1 antigens: 1) HIV-1 Gag as a T cell mediated immune antigen to direct T cell responses against the virus, and 2) an HIV-1 gp140 Env Foldon construct to generate neutralizing antibody (Ab) responses.  Results from these studies can be applied to the development of vaccines against other viral and bacterial pathogens that have proved difficult to control through vaccination.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project will evaluate and qualify the application of multifunctional biocompatible wound dressing developed in the Phase I for the controlled delivery of analgesic drugs to burn wounds. Burns are among the most painful and debilitating battlefield wounds faced by the US warfighter. Severe pain is felt during treatment and rehabilitation, especially during dressing changes, debridements, and skin grafting, and continues through long-term follow up. Opioid drug administration via oral or parenteral routes is the primary and most effective way of treating pain in burn patients. However, the systemic use of opioid medications in burn patients is complicated by the side effects such as tolerance, hyperalgesia, hemodynamic instability, respiratory depression, and dependence. Therefore, beside the systemic administration of analgesics, topical analgesics are required to control pain efficiently. Burn wounds can turn deadly when infection sets in. Thus, pain and infection are the two major complications associated with burn injuries. In the Phase I effort, a single patch device that can be used to alleviate pain and as wells as to prevent infection in burn injuries was developed. The Phase I in-vitro and animal model studies unequivocally demonstrated the technical feasibility of this burn wound dressing patch in pain control and antimicrobial applications. In the proposed Phase II study, efficacy of the patch will be demonstrated and validated the for pain control in an in-vivo model that replicates burn injury induced pain. Phase II study will include development, testing and demonstration of a prototype form of multifunctional wound dressing. The safety of the dressing material will be demonstrated with respect to biocompatibility and toxicity for securing regulatory approval for human use. The Phase II project will be followed by pre-clinical testing and validation of the topical dressing product by the US Army. Phase III will consist of clinical trials designed to test the safety and efficacy of the Phase II product in burn pain control.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Radiation hardened microelectronics is a continuing requirement for DoD and commercial spacecraft. The generational gap between commercial devices and space rated devices keeps widening due to ever increasing qualification costs and complexities inherent in smaller geometries and advanced processes. Radiation hardened computing capability is an even harder problem due to the constraints imposed by current spacecraft systems requirements. On-board computing is increasingly desirable due to payload heterogeneity and increasing amounts of data produced by payloads and sensors.     To address this opportunity, IDEAS-TEK will use a low cost ASIC flow in Phase 2 to build the 32-bit RISC designed in Phase 1 in a radiation hardened integrated circuit (IC). The ICs main radiation hardened features are: Immunity to destructive latchup, total ionizing dose tolerance > 300 Mrad (Si) up to 1 Mrad (Si), Single Event Effect (SEE) immunity to 60 MeV and operating temperature range from -55 C to +125 C.     The objective of the program is two fold: 1)To build a trusted, radiation hardened 32-bit RISC processor and 2) to demonstrate a cheap path to build trusted, radiation hardened digital ICsBENEFIT:The programs main benefits will be the demonstration of an inexpensive, publicly available path to develop trusted radiation hardened digital ICs and the creation of an inexpensive radiation hardened 32-bit RISC ASIC that can be identically replicated on programmable logic devices.  Both benefits address current AFRL - and the aerospace community in general - needs.   The program will boost the radiation hardened IC market by allowing different design teams to generate new designs by either using open source components and libraries or licensing it from publicly available sources.    Both goals of the program have their main commercial applications in the civil and military aerospace markets.  The RISC processor can be used as a reliable computing engine while the inexpensive path to trusted radiation hardened silicon can be use to design and implement digital and mixed signal ICs to fulfil different mission profiles.  Additionally the RISC processor can be used in nuclear applications, while its embodiment in other hardware platforms (e.g FPGAs) can be used in fault tolerant applications (automotive, medical) where reliability is a priority.",

APS will use highly abundant and globally available RF signals of opportunity (SoOPs) to provide error-growth-constrained position in GPS-challenged environments.  APS employs an SDR architecture which allows it to use a broad variety of terrestrial and space based SoOP sources in a low weight/power package.  Dismount position as well as SoOP position estimations are shared between dismounts using existing low-bandwidth, latency tolerant radio links.  The light-weight APS module is easily worn by dismounted military forces; can operate on batteries for extended periods of time; can operate in day or darkness, in inclement weather, and in environments with little or no infrastructure such as remote deserts and forests.  The project will develop demonstrable technology within the first year, achievable due to the significant progress and risk reduction that has been carried out under previous contracts, and the use of standard interfaces for component integration (IS-GPS-153/standard NEMA outputs).BENEFIT:GPS receivers (including MGUE) are becoming ubiquitous in modern devices, systems and networks.  In many cases, GPS receivers operate in challenging environments where GPS operation is impaired/denied.  Technology from this effort has the potential to provide accurate, reliable and persistent PNT in these challenged environments.  Transition opportunities for the subject navigation technology are numerous in the commercial location sector, the public services sector, and the DoD sector.  In the public sector, emergency first responder personnel lack a robust location system which hampers search and rescue operations.  There are also equally compelling needs in the commercial sector, where wireless mobiles equipped with GPS for E911 positioning suffer from very poor yield indoors and in dense urban areas.  The last few years have witnessed explosive growth for revenue-bearing location-based navigation technology and applications, all of which suffer from poor performance for the same reasons, and ultimately cost companies lost potential revenue.  One of the most promising developments that will aid in bringing the subject technology to broad commercial use is the increase in portable computing devices that now contain built-in GNSS and components such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, WiFi, and multi-band radio frequency transceivers.",

Fortunately, technical advances in navigation sensors and algorithms can reduce dependence on the venerable, yet vulnerable, GPS system. Inertial sensors are becoming increasingly smaller and more accurate. Low cost, powerful embedded computing platforms enable real time implementation of sophisticated techniques that process large quantities of data. As a result, image based navigation and RF ranging systems are rapidly increasing in maturity. Together, these systems offer the potential to greatly reduce or constrain growth in PNT error.

PNT and accuracy will be displayed on a Rockwell Collins MicroDAGR, even when GPS is not available, and this data will be output in standard formats, such as NMEA.

It is the most significant threat to voice systems and by far the most likely form of voice-based DoS. TDoS attackers use SIP, free IP-PBXs, call generators, and spoofed calling numbers to cheaply and anonymously flood their victims with calls. The attackers have the advantage, because attacks are easy to generate, victims often have a small number of critical phones and attendants that are easily overwhelmed, and have little capability to mitigate the attacks. \n\nThe state of the art in mitigation is largely static black and white lists in PBXs, SBCs, and service provider networks. Plus, by spending just a little more effort, attackers can make their attacks much more complex and difficult to mitigate. Soon the ability to generate very large distributed TDoS attacks will also be possible, increasing the list of potential victims.\n\nThe proposed project will define a defense and robust prototype for these types of attacks. A robust defense approach consisting of 5 levels of filters, which inspect the calling number, SIP signaling, use network probes for some calls, and using Turing Tests and content analysis for other calls, all configured with flexible policies and business rules, will be defined.

One hurdle in the development of new drugs, is their relatively low effectiveness due to poor water solubility limiting formulation choices and/or limiting cellular uptake. Forming drug nano particles, by way of controlling the drug crystal formation process, is one tool to overcome this low solubility hurdle. Acoustical energy has been shown to aid in the formation of drug crystallization however, current acoustical technologies are not able to reliably achieve the crystal size and distribution needed for many new drug candidates. A reliable method for nanoparticle drug production will allow better and more effective drugs to make it to market. Additionally, the Pharmaceutical industry is transitioning from batch to continuous flow manufacturing processes. This has significant impact on cost, responsiveness, and quality control of the drug supply chain, and will enable more rapid and lower cost drug development and manufacturing. The proposed project will develop equipment and processes that enable the continuous manufacture of drug nano and micron sized particles by controlling the crystallization using a novel focused acoustical field. Focused acoustics has the advantage of delivering a highly efficient, controllable, scalable energy field to the crystallization zone.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the democratization of manufacturing through democratization of design and simulation technologies. Geometric design systems and CAD tools are now widely available as standalone systems or cloud-based services, but simulation technologies remain inaccessible due to high cost, tedious data preparation, and demand of expertise in structural simulation. This project aims to make structural simulation widely available to both novice and expert users as a low cost fully automated service that requires no preprocessing or data conversion. The cloud-based simulation service is a disruptive technology that will make structural simulation widely available to communities of makers, as well as manufacturing enterprises, leading to dramatic improvements in performance, manufacturability, sustainability and cost savings. Wide adaption of simulation tools is also an important ingredient of STEM education and workforce development. This project will address the technical challenges identified in Phase I of the project, focusing on the goal of making cloud-based structural simulation service easily accessible and widely used. The key ingredients of the proposed approach are: (1) Development of novel user interaction modes and scenarios that enable rapid creation, composition, and editing of structural simulations by novice and expert users; (2) Guided interactive interpretation and exploration of simulation results aimed to not only to convey and explain simulation results, but also to engage the users into improving their designs by creating improved simulation scenarios. (3) Context-integrated simulations, where automated simulations are fully integrated with other services and delivered seamlessly within the context of common design or manufacturing applications, such as shape design, 3D printing, or manufacturability analysis.",

Our revolutionary moisture management technology utilizes a novel 3D microfluidic transport principle to move sweat from the skin to the outside of clothing, where it can drip away or be controlled. Compared with conventional moisture wicking products which are based on capillary absorption, our technology allows fabric and apparel products to remain lightweight, always dry, highly breathable and never-saturated. ATACAMA?s technology is designed to provide the wearer an improved regulation of body temperature and comfort level during high intensity activities, contributing to both performance and safety. This project aims at solving the current problems of moisture-management products that are inadequate when dealing with large amount of moisture (e.g. sweat). In high sweat or high heat situations, apparel can become quickly saturated with moisture, leading to a wet, heavy, sticky feeling that impacts the performance of the wearer. Our proposed research aims to develop a broad range of textiles that can continuously transport moisture, so that fabric remain dry, breathable and lightweight during high intensity physical activities in hot and humid environment. Utilizing the large-scale manufacturing process developed in Phase I, ongoing research efforts will focus on the implementation of the technology on a broad range of fabric materials (e.g. polyester/polyurethane blends, cotton). As well, scientists at ATACAMA will optimize designs of the fluidic channels based on body sweat mapping research and will further enhance the robustness of the fluidic network. A series of breakthrough textile products (e.g. fabrics and apparel) integrated with optimized and robust 3D microfluidic-enabled moisture management technology will result from the completion of Phase II.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a new tool revealing important information regarding skeletal muscle strength and health. Muscle weakness is a pervasive problem across our society, including people with joint disease, aging people, obese people, and people with neuromuscular disorders. All of these problems affect muscles across the body in different and non-intuitive ways; however, to date there has not been marketed technology that allows for quantitative measurement of muscle size on a muscle-by-muscle basis and specific analysis to address the muscle weakness problem. Due to the current high cost, the initial targeted customers will be elite athlete organizations, with the goal of using the technology to improve performance as well as to provide more quantitative metrics for predicting injury susceptibility and make return-to-sport decisions. However, with research and development to bring down the cost, the ultimate goal is to make a broadly used clinical tool for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of health conditions related to musculoskeletal disease and mobility, which will have broad societal impact. The proposed project will provide a major advancement in image-based modeling and data analysis tools in order to allow high-throughput imaging, rapid and accurate segmentation of muscles and efficient data analysis. Currently, physical therapists, athletic trainers and strength and conditioning coaches only have very blunt tools to assess each individual?s strength and very limited information about the optimal muscle profile. Therefore, training and rehabilitative approaches are developed via experience and trial and error. The technology proposed here solves these problems by making using of an image-to-model pipeline to quantify muscle size and provide valuable and actionable information based on the quantification. However, the obstacles for a wide adoption of this technology include specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols and lengthy image segmentation process. In the previous funding cycle these two problems have been addressed with substantial technology advancements. The proposed activities in this funding cycle will continue the technical development process to further bring down the cost with improved image segmentation process and provide additional value with advanced data analysis. It will ultimately be a revolutionary tool to improve muscle health.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to commercialize high-strength thermoplastic composites reinforced with cellulosic nanoparticles (CNs) as a replacement for heavier glass&#8208;reinforced composite materials for structural automotive components. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to create sustainable, high&#8208;performance nanocomposites. Expected weight savings is between 13 and 20% per component. Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations require significant increases in fuel economy for vehicles, which has led carmakers to look for innovative ways to shed vehicle weight. It has been shown that for every 10% in weight savings, vehicle fuel consumption is reduced by 7%. The target application is to replace heavy glass reinforcement in polymeric composites with CNCs for car parts, providing lighter weight vehicles with increased fuel efficiency. On&#8208;going research into CN materials has resulted in significant reductions in cost (with more reductions expected), making CNs an increasingly attractive functional natural nanofiller, the processing of which will provide jobs in both the manufacturing and the technology sector. Successful implementation of CNs into composites could not only lighten vehicles and reduce environmental impact, but also transform a waste stream into value-added materials, reducing the amount of waste produced by these industries. During the SBIR Phase I period, the company showed that lighter thermoplastic composites reinforced with cellulosic nanoparticles could meet the tensile strength values of glass-reinforced composites with much higher loadings, thereby saving part weight. The Phase II grant will allow the company to scale up the manufacturing processes necessary to produce these lighter, more sustainable composites for the automotive industry. Furthermore, the company will improve performance of these materials in order to attain performance parity with higher&#8208;loaded glass&#8208;reinforced parts and potentially to compete with ultra&#8208;high performance materials such as carbon fiber composites and metals. This technology will be produced using efficient and economical manufacturing processes, allowing this to become a true drop&#8208;in technology for automotive part-makers.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Patch management is one of the main enabling technologies in maintaining a high degree of security for IT systems.  Often the patch requires a higher level of privilege to apply, making the patching operation itself a potential target of exploitation.  The update or patch might require a reboot or perceivable system downtime, which becomes an issue for level 1 or 2 mission assurance category systems.  Additional patch management software also exposes the patched system to additional risk, which is magnified if that additional software is running at a privileged level.  Ideally, the patch or update would be applied by a trusted, privileged entity that is free from tampering or exploitation.   Such requirement is particularly desirable in a virtualized hosting environment where virtual machines (VMs) run on top of a hypervisor.  To address this critical need, Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) proposes to further develop the Versatile Live Patching System (VLPS).   The VLPS updates a target system with new code or data for its software.  VLPS can patch two levels of execution: guest kernel and guest applications running in the guest VMs.  VLPS is a framework of tools that matches mission patching requirement with a stealthy yet privileged patch deployment approach.    ; BENEFIT: VLPS can be directly applied to the military and security contexts. The ability to live patch a system reduces its downtime and patching at a lower privilege level increases the operation security of the system. Both government and commercial organizations will benefit from the development of VLPS for cyber security and mission / business success reasons.  The effective security of Government cyber security development programs is decreased due to the delay in patching systems.  Patching of virtual machine is often at a much lower level of compliance due to VM sprawl. VLPS can be applied to any information technology system. Any DoD system using VMs would benefit from VLPS.    VLPS has significant commercial potential for applications such as corporate security design, information security, and cloud configurations.  End users of VLPS include network security tool providers (e.g., Symantec, McAfee, SourceFire) to minimize the client software required for their patch management systems; information security consulting companies (e.g., NSS Labs) to enhance the introspection services they provide; and large commercial organizations including financial (e.g., Bank of America, Citibank), retail (e.g., Amazon, Overstock), and healthcare (e.g., United Healthcare, Humana).",

Restoring vision to soldiers suffering ocular trauma injuries is critical to restore their overall quality of life and allow them to return to the front lines . The current standard of care for ocular surface injuries involves the application of human amniotic membrane to the injured site. While extremely effective at stimulating repair, the required processing is expensive and makes application of the membranes difficult in military hospitals and other emergency situations. In order to address the challenges associated with ocular trauma treatment, Luna Innovations is developing a unique biomimetic ocular biomaterial that consists of aligned nanofibers that support a scar-reducing, growth-stimulating hydrogel that will promote native ocular surface regeneration. This material will be compatible with both traditional and sutureless adhesion techniques and will have the potential to release therapeutics into the injured defect site in future product iterations.",

        "abstract": "AN/SQQ-89 surface combatant active sonar processing does not currently leverage off-board transmissions from other combatants in the strike group. Leveraging off-board sources using bistatic (or equivalently multistatic) sonar will improve AN/SQQ-89 strike group ASW capabilities in a number of tactically relevant scenarios, some of which are discussed in the Phase I report. A system using both bistatic and monostatic sonar has several advantages over a system using only monostatic sonar. It decreases time to detect, improves detection, increases detection ranges, increases holding times, and improves tracking performance. It also reduces environmental impact because multiple ships detect from one ships transmissions, thus reducing the required number of active transmissions for a particular ASW mission. Strike group robustness is increased because it is possible to respond to a transmitter failure by using another ships transmitter for continued target prosecution. This SBIR primarily leverages known AN/SQQ-89 active transmissions for enhanced ASW operation. Requirements and a concept of operation for AN/SQQ-89 bistatic processing are proposed for development. Example high-payoff bistatic detection scenarios are discussed and proposed for further development and performance evaluation. Additional acoustic processing functionality required for bistatic processing is proposed for coding and performance evaluation.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Landing gear platings, such as low hydrogen embrittlement (LHE) zinc nickel (ZnNi) and cadmium (Cd) are designed to protect the base material from the environmental effect of field use. Inherent to the electroplating process is the introduction of hydrogen into the high strength steel (HSS) aircraft component, which can cause hydrogen embrittlement (HE). Currently the plating processes are followed by hydrogen embrittlement (HE) relief bake for a minimum of 23 hours at 375 F +/-25 F.     SBIR Phase I testing determined that it is feasible to reduce the bake time required to remove hydrogen absorbed during the electroplating processes from HSS landing gear components. Decreased bake times would result in significant reductions in OO-ALC overhaul workflow times, energy usage, depot process inventory, and new spares costs.  Reduced processing time will lead to significant cost savings for the USAF and industry.     In this Phase II SBIR effort, ES3 will demonstrate that bake time reduction will be viable for processing landing gear after electroplating operations. A sufficient amount of testing will be conducted to ensure that the reduction in process functions and performs to acceptable standards. Phase II testing will demonstrate the feasibility of HE bake reduction using various coupon geometries and test methods.  Initial testing shall be conducted on coupons consisting of 4340 air melt steel to provide acceptable test points for additional material tests to verify hydrogen bake out.; BENEFIT: ES3 anticipates the results of Phase II project will validate the reduction of HE relief bake to approximately 8 hours. The reduction of required post plating HE relief bake times will provide DoD and aerospace industry with a faster and more reliable means of LHE Zn-Ni, Cd, chromium or nickel sulfamate plating HSS structural aircraft components.  It also allows for significant man-hour savings, reduced process flow days and inventory cost avoidance.  This process improvement will lead to a reduction of the following 1) production floor space, 2) energy consumption, 3) oven maintenance and 4) possible missed bakes which cause re-bakes.",

A secondary aim is to pursue commercialization in the private sector, specifically in the context of Remeeting: a voice recorder that enables searchable conversations, to improve the effectiveness of recalling and sharing information from interviews and meetings.  The proposed work builds upon Phase I results exploring audio signal representations that retain only speaker identity or message content, such that enabling automatic speaker identification or speech recognition is mutually exclusive.  This capability is useful, for example, because it can minimize an individual's exposure to potential loss of privacy by protecting either their identity or the communicated message.  Phase II will further apply automatic keyword spotting and automatic speaker identification to diverse use cases within the homeland security mission, such as audio from body-worn cameras and facilitating compliance with statutory requirements for electronic surveillance.  Such capabilities could be used to trigger audio recording only upon detecting a configurable set of relevant words or speakers, with adjustable sensitivity controls.

For example, programs such as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Apex Next Generation First Responder (NGFR) program are redefining the technical toolset available to First Responders. Additionally, an array of communication systems and devices is presented to the First Responder. These devices include short-range voice radios, smartphones with broadband network access, sophisticated multi-band voice and data radios, and everything in between. However, the number of available communication devices, their potential incompatibility between groups and jurisdictions of First Responders, and the ever increasing amount of low-level data to process can distract, frustrate, and overwhelm the First Responder.\nA need exists for an intelligent communications interface that interconnects the variety of sensors and electronics worn or carried by a Next Generation First Responder with multiple communication systems. This device would be a communications hub - a central device that efficiently, securely, and resiliently routes incoming and outgoing information to the chosen destination using the best available communication medium. A communications hub would improve efficiency and effectiveness of information transmission while removing the burden of constantly communicating low-level but critical data, thus allowing First Responders to focus on the task at hand.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The space environment is rapidly becoming more contested as new countries become space capable and traditional space entities continue to push the envelope.  The evolving tactical nature of space has driven the need for real-time Threat Indications and Notifications (TIN).  ATA is proposing Launch Assessment Threat Indications and Notifications for SSA (LATIN for SSA) to address TIN requirements.  LATIN for SSA has identified non-traditional products not currently used for SSA launch TIN that will be beneficial in providing indications, threat notifications and launch event track custody if correlated and broadcast in a real-time manner.  LATIN for SSA will develop a real-time correlation engine to fuse non-traditional SSA data products and make tactical inferences based on the correlation of that data.  The LATIN for SSA capability will maintain custody of a launch event in and out of SSN coverage areas and determine when re-tasking of the SSN is required.BENEFIT:There are numerous anticipated benefits to ATAs Launch Assessment Threat Indications and Notifications for SSA (LATIN for SSA).  Real-time evaluation of event tasking and actual even observables provides indicators as the whether or not pre-launch tasking will sufficiently support event.  ATAs correlation evaluation provides real-time notification to the user when asset retasking is needed to observe an event.    ATA has been developing technology for the U.S. Government and Aerospace contractors since 1975.  ATAs success in generating additional revenue tied to our Phase I and Phase II SBIR projects has allowed ATA to grow and expand its business through Phase III commercialization and other spin-off contracts.  As reported in the ATA Company Commercialization Report, we have received 54 Phase I SBIR awards and 22 Phase II awards.  ATAs track record for commercialization of SBIR sponsored technology is excellent, resulting in a Commercialization Achievement Index of 95 and related cumulative revenues from sales and additional investments of over $42 million.    ATAs approach to commercializing LATIN for SSA is to work the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) to mature this effort and deploy LATIN for SSA within the ARCADE JMS suites.  In coordination with SMC, AFRL has developed the ARCADE environment to assist and mature SSA applications.  Within this environment, applications and application providers have the ability to mature their capabilities with operational data within standalone environments and on live operational networks Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet), and JWICS.  ATA will follow the AFRL and SMC ARCADE process for capability maturation and transition.",

        "abstract": "Software development usually involves the combination, adaptation and modification of proven software routines and code-sets in an iterative fashion. During this process, regression testing is performed to verify that the established functionality of the constituent codes is not lost and that latent defects (bugs) are not introduced. For complex software development projects, regression testing is an important and frequently used process. It is also expensive and inaccurate, being largely based on a subjective approach which depends on the experience and intuition of the software developer and QA personnel. The Software Change Impact Analysis Tool (SCIAT), developed by Trident Systems Inc., automatically tracks and analyzes the effects of changes to software, thereby providing an objective approach to identifying locations where regression testing should focus. This improves both the efficiency and accuracy of the regression testing. On this effort SCIAT will be updated to automatically identify the impacted paths through the software between builds, compare the paths to the code executed by each test, and defines the updates to the regression tests, at each level of testing and aggregated across all levels. This will allow SCIAT to be used to continuously and automatically evolve and update the regression test strategy.",

The proposed concept leverages a qualified ceramic matrix composite (CMC) as the outer shell that will withstand the aero-forces, high heat rates and other environments. Phase 2 results demonstrated that the addition a tuning material to the inner surface achieved transmission over a broader range of wavelengths and high angles of incidence. The proposed program will further develop the processes to achieve optimal results and qualify an integrated radome design for high speed flight profiles. The effort will also provide test data on the RF transmission characteristics of integrated radome. Affordability is improved because proposed CMC is the lowest cost, qualified structural ceramic material available today, and the processes to achieve other attributes such as erosion protection are also fully developed and cost effective.",

The L&R system has been analyzed to be feasible to launch and recover both surface craft, such as RHIBs and MK-105 sled, and underwater vehicles, such as the SDV and RMMV from the Afloat Forward Staging Base (AFSB). In this SBIR Phase II, the L&R system will be further analyzed by seakeeping analysis, dynamics simulation, finite element modeling, and scaled prototype testing in simulated wave environments in up to Sea State 4. The Technology Readiness Level (TRL) will be gradually raised to TRL 5/6 at the end of Phase II.

While several ADC architectures have been proposed, time-interleaved (TI) SAR (Successive Approximation Register) ADC, because of its low power and small silicon area, has become the de facto preferred design. Time-interleaving architecture is a promising way to improve the conversion rate in a given technology. It allows many channel ADCs to sample the incoming data sequentially while digitizing the input in parallel. Recent researches [1-3] in time-interleaved SAR ADC made impressive progress, pushing the conversion rate beyond 20GS/s with ENOB around 6b. The fastest time-interleaved SAR[5] to date reached 90GS/s, demonstrating that time-interleaved SAR is an optimum choice for high speed, medium resolution ADC. In this proposal, we describe in details the architecture, design, and simulations of a low-power, 8-bit TI-SAR ADC capable of operating at and above 64 GS/s, with better than 6b ENOB and an analog bandwidth of greater than   30GHz.",

The aircraft must then stay on-station for the duration of the mission to monitor, command, and receive data from the deployed sonobuoys. This requires a clear and uninterrupted channel of communications during all command downlink and data uplink transfers. The sonobuoy RF link is susceptible to interference, jamming, and eavesdropping. The new SG-90 link provides error correction for bit errors, but the link provides no IA-compliance; consequently, a hostile entity can intercept the sonobuoy data uplink transmissions. The UHF command downlink is similarly unprotected. The U.S. Navy has expressed the need for an Information Assurance / Anti-Tampering advanced signal processing capability to be built into its suite of Anti-Submarine Warfare sonobuoys and supporting air platforms. In addition, intelligent power management must be added to extend sonobuoy operating life to support data interrogation by the air platform for up to 72 hours following deployment. The purpose of this SBIR is to introduce IA/AT technology into existing sonobuoy designs that will secure the RF telemetry and command downlink, obscure and protect the sonobuoys processing parameters and capability, and improve mission capability and sonobuoy life by performing signal processing within the sonobuoy itself.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Orbit Logic and the University of Colorado propose the Heimdall System to schedule observations of known objects and search for and establish custody of unknown objects from the Maui Space Surveillance Site. The Heimdall System includes a modeling environment a scheduling engine, and a track prioritization component. Within the Heimdall System, Finite Set Statistics (FISST) methods will be used to prioritize observations of known objects and identify search areas for unknown objects that are then planned with specialized scheduling algorithms and configurable SSA-specific figure-of-merit scoring. The proposed Phase II effort will build upon the successful Heimdall System prototype which demonstrated track prioritization, system modeling, an SSA-specific figure-of-merit, and automated planning algorithms. Phase II will focus on Heimdall System optimization improvements and the integration of Heimdall System capabilities into MSSS planning operations.; BENEFIT: The Heimdall software for SSA sensor tasking will provide greatly improved performance over manual tasking, improved coordinated sensor usage, and tasking schedules driven by accurate system modeling and catalog improvement goals (reduced overall covariance, etc.). The improved scheduling performance also enables more responsive sensor tasking to address external events, newly detected objects, newly detected object activity, and sensor anomalies. Instead of having to wait until the next routine scheduling phase, events can be automatically addressed with new tasking schedules in near-real-time (within seconds or minutes). Perhaps the most important benefit is improved SSA based on an overall improvement to the quality of the space catalog. By driving sensor tasking and scheduling based on better system modeling, predicted information gain and other relevant factors, better decisions are made in the application of available sensor resources, leading to more appropriate observation schedules, an improved object catalog and better information about the objects of greatest interest. Another benefit of the proposed Phase II innovation is a new self-tuning Figure-of-Merit technology that will auto-adjust FOM weighting factors based on high-level goals (such as reduced overall catalog covariance and/or shorter lag time between the detection of a new object and follow-on observations).",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable the availability of a revolutionary manufacturing process for pharmaceuticals. The project consists of the development of novel process technologies, as well as the integration of these processes into an end-to-end continuous manufacturing line that can produce drugs continuously (24/7 basis). This is different from the current methodology that produces large quantities of drugs at discrete time points (e.g. large batch quantities are produced several times a year). A working pilot plant of this process demonstrated significant operational advantages with a marketed drug-production time was reduced from 200 days to 2 days, plant footprint decreased by 90%, projected costs reduced by 50%, while improving product quality. The impact on society will be considerable: patients will receive better quality drugs; drug shortages will be greatly reduced; and pharmaceutical companies will be able to manufacture and distribute their drugs in a much more cost-effective and efficient manner, allowing them to reallocate more capital to Research and Development (new drugs developed). Finally, it will be possible to relocate manufacturing plants and jobs back in the U.S. (more efficient processes = lower costs). The proposed project builds upon a successful Phase I SBIR project, as well as five years of collaboration between a premier research institution and a leading pharmaceutical company aimed at developing a novel continuous manufacturing process to overcome the limitations of the current standard, batch manufacturing. The first objective of this NSF project is to further develop two novel elements of a multistep, continuous manufacturing process (i.e. heterogeneous crystallization and electrospinning for solid dosage forms), so they run reliably under different operating conditions. This is important because commercial production requires that they perform consistently and reliably 24/7. Thus, these novel unit operations will be studied under different operating conditions and starting materials, while their design is optimized. Success will be defined when the unit operations achieve: 1) maximal operational efficiency, 2) industry standard manufacturing capabilities, and 3) qualification to be used across the Research and Development manufacturing spectrum. The second objective is to integrate these two units into a broader end-to-end continuous manufacturing process capable of producing high-quality pharmaceuticals on a continuous basis. The integrated process will also feature three unit operations on separation, filtration and drying that were developed during Phase I of this SBIR project.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project promises to deliver a convenient, sustainable, cost effective, and environmentally friendly bait for crustacean fishermen, worldwide. The patent- pending innovation offers a formulated, synthetic product that mimics scent cues released from traditional fish bait, while offsetting unwarranted ecological impacts of current practices. Specifically, scent cues can be released at variable rates to provide optimal results in addressing fishing methods and preferences in different conditions and regions. Given rising costs of fish due to competition with omega-3 supplements producers, as well as labor and frozen storage costs of obtaining wild bait, and vessel space needed for such bait when fishing, the new bait will save fishermen time, money, and inconvenience. Commercially, cost advantages are likely to generate significant demand in addition to the overall practical advantages. From a societal perspective, a sustainable, synthetic product can dramatically reduce \"net fishing\" for baiting crustacean traps. Thus, fish could be conserved in the oceanic food chain, and indiscriminate killing of sea turtles, dolphins and other by- catch would be diminished through reduced net fishing practices now employed in the capture of small wild fish traditionally used for crustacean bait. The objectives of this Phase II research project are: to optimize solubility kinetics of the attractant-releasing matrix; further characterize naturally occurring molecules released by traditional bait fish; and validate product performance to catch indigenous crustacean species in the United States. Field research would focus on concentrations of chemo-attractants required to optimize manufacturing formulation and direct costs. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity will be the characterization of the chemical basis for cues emitted by piscine, avian and mammalian tissue that most intensely attract crustacean species while developing a range of matrix formulations for optimally releasing such attractants in various fishing conditions. In addition to globally urgent considerations of by-catch and wild stock depletion, the industry has been struggling with bait sustainability issues. These challenges have intensified with federal and state agencies seeking court orders to regulate catch limits, resulting in reduced supply and higher prices of bait fish. These circumstances frame an ecological and commercial opportunity for this synthetic bait alternative. Reducing the need to capture wild bait fish, as well as delivering cost and logistical advantages to commercial crustacean fisheries are expected to drive rapid market penetration upon completion of product research and development in this Phase II project.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to deliver a cost-effective automated quality control (QC) system for manufacturing of radioactive drugs used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET). This system will replace current QC procedures, which involve 18 manual operations, 8 visual assessments, 6 devices, and 8 samples of radioactive drugs. The industry's current reliance on manual operation, subjectivity and untraceable records impedes progress in radioactive drug manufacturing and presents compliance risks. Therefore, introduction of an automated system combining all these tests on a single platform will facilitate adoption of PET imaging technology beyond top tier medical centers. By addressing a critical current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) compliance need in radio-pharmaceutical production, which cannot be addressed with any other solutions available today, this solution is positioned for rapid adoption. After adopting this system, it is expected that manufacturing facilities will realize 20% operating cost reduction and 50% reduction in time spent on QC-related activities. A reduced cost of compliance associated with introduction of automated QC will further contribute to the adoption rate. This project will open the door to new applications of plate reader technology, an approach which has been traditionally confined to the fields of biochemistry and diagnostics. This Phase II effort includes four technical objectives. Firstly, the approach will be adapted to minimize the required sample volume. Methods developed in Phase I of the project required 0.5 ml of sample, a value which is not optimal for small manufacturers. To bring this value down to 0.2 ml, test sensitivity will be adjusted, keeping in mind the potential dynamic range trade-offs. Secondly, we will design a plastic consumable that supports adoption by a commercial manufacturer. Current plastic prototype components are only suitable for academic sites with highly-skilled personnel. To reduce the amount of training required, and to expand the applicability of this method, a new plastic component will be designed in order to further automate sample loading. Third, we will optimize the formulation of the reagents to achieve a one-year shelf life for the consumable kit. The shelf life of the reagents developed in Phase I remains unknown. Therefore, accelerated stability studies will be performed to estimate the rates of decomposition processes, and appropriate changes will be made to enhance shelf life. Finally, we will develop a pilot production process for the newly-designed kit, in order to support early installations.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to produce a new type of computer memory called Ferroelectric Dynamic Random Access Memory (FEDRAM). FEDRAM is cheap and can be mass-produced in current semiconductor manufacturing facilities. It also uses much less energy than current-state-of-the-art memories, and enables electronic devices to be much smaller in physical size. Commercially, FEDRAM works best as an embedded memory, which means they are ideally suited for products such as mobile phones where the processor and memory are on the same chip. Additionally, the same block of FEDRAM can be configured for high performance applications in addition to longer storage applications. This means that future devices will adapt to maximize power, performance, and usability. Due to the factors of price, performance, and low power, once FEDRAM is proven to work, it can potenitally be adopted in nearly every electronic device. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the commercialization questions of Ferroelectric Dynamic Random Access Memory (FEDRAM). In SBIR Phase I, it was shown that FEDRAM cells can be manufactured in an existing foundry with no new materials or equipment changes, and that FEDRAM has leading performance characteristics. The next step is to prove the same characteristics in an array, which would be considered a minimum viable product; this is the goal of SBIR Phase II. By proving this array, it will be possible to quickly scale the FEDRAM memory array into embedded applications for commercial deployment. The performance characteristics to be demonstrated are read/write latency, switching time, endurance, retention, and energy use.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project allows for a more effective glaucoma treatment by adjusting eye pressure based on disease progression for each patient. In 2015, the US glaucoma market is estimated to be over $2 billion and our addressable market, glaucoma surgical therapies, is estimated to be $534M. The incidence for glaucoma increases with age, and as the baby boomer population gets older, there will be a growing need for glaucoma treatments. To treat glaucoma, patients undergo lifelong drug regimens, multiple laser procedures, and invasive surgical procedures. However, even with all these treatment options glaucoma patients still go blind from glaucoma. The proposed novel design and approach to glaucoma will personalize the treatment for patients and remove the need for numerous and costly procedures. Most importantly, the personalization of glaucoma therapy will optimize visual protection for every patient. The proposed project will validate the safety and efficacy of a glaucoma drainage device to adjust and set pressure in the eye. Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness and is only treatable by reducing eye pressure. Surgical treatments are unpredictable with suboptimal success rates based primarily on the choice of drainage site. The proposed novel device drains to a new area of the eye to avoid the complications and unpredictability associated with the current glaucoma surgeries. The device also can provide the first-ever personalized treatment for millions of glaucoma sufferers by fine-tuning pressure based on the needs of the patient throughout his or her lifetime. Phase I/IB studies have shown feasibility of the device with an adjustable component. However, its efficacy and safety have yet to be fully investigated. Therefore, in this Phase II research grant, we will optimize the device for safety and efficacy and perform the necessary preclinical testing according to FDA standards to further develop the product.",

This project will develop a low cost, small-footprint high-resolution nanomanufacturing platform for building optical devices that are traditionally manufactured using cleanroom microlithography. Compared with modern cleanroom approaches that require significantly more complicated and expensive facilities, this platform holds strong promise to build visible-to-infrared wavelength optical components that are both smaller and lower cost, in order to serve the fiber-optic sensor, telecommunications, and lens markets. If this platform can deliver optics components that meet specifications, demand could reach 8-figures for a single customer, thus transforming optics manufacturing across the entire spectrum of markets that use photonics: biomedical, energy, military, and consumer. If it meets the needs of the photonics sector, this platform could penetrate a much broader commercial marketplace such as information technology, nanoelectronics and personalized low-cost consumer devices. The scientific and technological understanding created by developing this platform could enable businesses to leverage low-cost US-based nanomanufacturing to address markets for advanced materials and components around the world. This project will commercialize an innovative nanomanufacturing platform for producing diffractive optical elements (DOEs) with potential to reduce component cost and size. Recently fiber-optic communications has expanded beyond its traditional function of long haul or backbone communications. Reducing the size, cost and complexity of optical components could allow DOEs to further expand their reach. Ideally the functionality of these components could be built right onto the end of an optical fiber. The proposed technology could allow true fiber-to-fiber components at a cost equal to or less than currently available optical components. It could further allow for sensing capabilities of \"lab on a fiber\" with the lab incorporated onto the end-face of a fiber.

Many modern manufactured parts, such as turbine blades, drive shafts, orthopedics, and various additive manufactured components require in-situ metrology with high resolution for accurate characterization during manufacturing and/or maintenance operations. Current high-resolution surface measurement systems are slow, vibration-sensitive and laboratory-based and thus are impractical for everyday use by manufacturing technicians. Meanwhile, shop-floor inspection is often only visual, and thus qualitative rather than quantitative, leading both to rejections of acceptable components as well as potential acceptance of failing ones. The absence of high-precision, in-situ metrology has hindered manufacturers from applying real-time data analysis and closed-loop process controls that can improve yields and reduce manufacturing costs. This research program will yield a hand-held, easy-to-use, robust, and quantitative shop-floor measurement system, allowing manufacturers to improve lifetimes, performance, and yield as they rapidly assess the features under test and feed the results back to improve process control. During Phase I, a breadboard system was designed and implemented using a polarization-based fringe projection method and micropolarizer phase-mask technology to achieve vibration insensitive measurement in a compact package. This Phase II program leverages that research to design a video-rate, compact, robust and portable system for handheld surface measurements in shop-floor environments. This will first involve improvements to measurement resolution with an improved optical design and new self-calibrating measurement modes; new optical elements will lower noise artifacts caused by imperfections in the earlier design and to reduce system size. Once performance of the new design is verified, an ergonomic, compact, robust, wireless housing for the instrument must be created to enable shop-floor use; the system must handle drops of over one meter onto concrete, have useful battery life for extended field operations, be light enough to not fatigue users and have intuitive controls and feedback. A final, critically important development effort will create automated software routines for measurement, analysis, and system diagnostics to enable adoption by unskilled personnel in manufacturing environments. Lastly, extensive applications testing in the field will allow optimization of the system to handle a wide range of potential use cases and environments.",

In addition, these new polymer/resin systems enable one-component, ambient-cure coatings to be produced. This means that highly protective coatings can be produced without the need for mixing multiple components together prior to application or applying heat or light to cure the coatings. The one-component, ambient-cure features of these polymer/resin systems largely eliminate waste and energy costs associated with coating application and lend themselves to the production of paints and coatings that can be applied by the average person. Compared to the current state-of-the-art in one-component, ambient-cured resins, these new polymer/resin systems provide dramatically shorter drying times, dramatically better chemical resistance, and much higher film hardness, while exhibiting excellent impact resistance and flexibility. The highly desirable properties of these new cost-competitive polymer/resin systems will enable commercial success, while their low solvent emissions and high renewable content will reduce impact on the environment. The objectives of this Phase II research project are to: 1) further optimize the polymer/resin systems to produce compositions that minimize solvent content and maximize performance, while meeting the cost constraints of the market; 2) put in place a pilot-line to provide potential customers with adequate sample sizes to enable their own evaluation of potential products, 3) generate weathering, corrosion, and storage/shelf stability data to further understand the application potential of optimized polymer/resin systems; and 4) optimize the polymer/resin production process to minimize cost and minimize production waste. By meeting these objectives, the Phase II project will result in the generation of new polymer/resin systems that will enable the development and commercialization of new paints and coatings that are one-component, ambient-cured, low in solvent content that exhibit exceptional properties, while being primarily based on renewable materials. Optimized polymer/resin systems will be provided to potential customers for their own internal evaluation. If necessary, feedback from customer evaluations will be used to modify polymer/resin system composition to meet customer needs.

Today more than 650 million globally, nearly 10% of the world's population, suffer from lung conditions like Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Currently, the most well-established method for lung function testing is spirometry, which requires the patient to conduct an unnatural breathing maneuver. In addition, spirometry cannot detect certain lung conditions. The proposed technology will be used without special breathing maneuver, and will be able to differentiate more lung conditions than spirometer. Since the proposed device can be used while the patient is breathing normally, it will also cater to currently under-served patient segments, e.g. young children and senior citizens, for detection and diagnosis of pulmonary conditions. By targeting a portable form-factor, the proposed technology will empower point-of-care pulmonary testing where it is currently infeasible. The proposed project will develop the first handheld implementation of the well-studied principle of forced oscillation technique (FOT), where an acoustic pressure wave is sent via the mouth to a patient's lungs and reflections are used to measure lung function. Thus, no special breathing maneuver is required from the patient. Cognita Labs will adopt a modular approach for product design, and develop product-caliber advanced and integrated devices, that will include hardware, tablet app and EHR integration. The design will include all the innovations developed during Phase I to reduce the device size and cost while increasing its measurement accuracy. The proposed device will further develop and integrate a new ultra-sound based non-invasive sensor into the device to significantly reduce the cost of the consumable (disposable mouthpiece) and ultimately the cost of test.

To achieve commercialization success, a solid portfolio of intellectual properties has been established. Seasoned business leaders will work with renowned scientists to incorporate cutting-edge technologies into drug, food & nutrition, and personal care products. The proposed project will substantially support the development of this new technology. The core problem/opportunity this technology targets is a large number of high-value whereas poorly water-soluble active ingredients that have been challenging the drug and food industry for a long time. For example, around 80% of drug candidates identified by modern drug discovery technologies are poorly water-soluble. For food, a large number of vitamins, nutrients, antioxidants, and natural colors are poorly water-soluble. Overall, poorly water-soluble compounds constitute an enormous formulation challenge. To address this need, this team has created a platform technology that is highly effective and non-specific. The goal of this project is to further develop the technology, scale up the synthesis of a core material, obtain the data on its safety profile, and advance the commercialization activities by providing prototypes to potential customers. This project will be conducted through close collaborations among the start-up company, a major university, and a number of major pharmaceutical, ingredients, food, and personal care companies. The deliverables of this project include the specifications of core material, initial safety evaluations, and prototypes provided to customers. This project will support the start-up company to form a solid foundation for commercialization and long-term growth.",

        "abstract": "SBIR Topic A14-077 highlights a well-known issue that, to some degree, haunts all multi-cylinder internal combustion engines: imbalance in power output between cylinders. The underlying reasons range from geometrical differences that impact the airflow entering each cylinder to manufacturing differences between fuel injectors to an array of aging effects in fuel/air delivery systems and the cylinders/pistons themselves. Cylinder power output imbalance leads to damaging vibrations that can reduce engine component life. The ideal solution to this problem is an adaptive load balancing control system that uses near-real-time feedback to adjust the fuel delivery to individual cylinders in order to maintain balanced output over a wider range of operating conditions and over the lifetime of the engine. Barron Associates, Inc. and its research partners propose to develop an adaptive-inverse based cylinder output balancing software application. The research team has decades of experience developing adaptive control systems and arguably the worlds preeminent facilities for diesel engine research and testing. The Adaptive Inverse Control System will be a small footprint software application that will be straightforward to apply to new engines since it will work alongside factory control software and it will require little up-front configuration or tuning.",

When spotting a new vessel, the imagery taken from submarines can be useful to construct three-dimensional (3D) computer-aided design (CAD) models of ships that can be used for identification in future sightings, for computer-generated simulations, and for capabilities assessment. Currently the task of ship recognition from images requires substantial human involvement, and model building is labor intensive. This project aims to develop a prototype Ship Shape system that computes 3D CAD models from submarine periscope imagery of ships, with operator involvement limited to 15-30 minutes per model. Based on our Phase I feasibility demonstrations, this Phase II project leverages current computer vision techniques, including image segmentation, sparse shape reconstruction, dense shape reconstruction, and CAD modeling with limited user interaction.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant    Modern day radiotherapy has developed in complexity to the degree that significant treatment errors are both difficult to detect and difficut to completely avoid  In the current day radiotherapy department it is common to have a large number of patients being treated with Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy  IMRT  techniques  When treating patients with these techniques it can be difficult to detect patient setup errors and\nvirtually impossible to detect beam collimation errors without the use of automated secondary checks  Incorrect dose delivery or dose delivered to the wrong area is also an ongoing treatment risk  Despite gains in the implementation of automated mechanisms for detection of errors the incidence of concerning treatment misadministrations is still significant  Treatment delivery errors in the modern era have been reported by several authors as occurring during from   to     of patientsandapos  courses of treatment  While most of these are judged to not be of clinical importance  the rate of significant treatment errors is still thousands of incidents per yar in the United States alone  Compromised radiotherapy treatments can lead to lower control rates and or higher complication rates  We will develop a system that will provide the radiotherapy clinic with the capability to completely and independently measure the geometric alignment and dosimetric compliance of an individual treatment fraction in real time as the patient is treated with any arbitrarily complex treatment technique  The system will consist of a high density cloak of radiation detectors deployed in a ring centered on the treatment apparatus isocenter and within the rotational circle of the head s  of the radiation delivery system  The detector cloak will surround the area within the patient being treated and will measure the radiation fluence both entering and exiting the patient  The dosimetric data acquired at the time of treatment will allow for the calculation of the complete dose distribution actually delivered to\nthe patient for each and every treatment session  The detection system will be physically and electronically independent of the treatment system thereby providing a truly comprehensive secondary monitor of the delivered dose  Development and clinical deployment of a completely independent treatment verification system for radiotherapy has the potential to significantly reduce radiotherapy treatment errors  The reduction of treatment delivery errors can increase local tumor control rates  reduce the rate of treatment complications or both  The ongoing compilation of actual treatment delivery compliance data will serve as invaluable confirmation of the benefit  or lack thereof  of newly implemented quality assurance techniques PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   This proposed device will have a significant impact on public health  It will catch human errors that heretofore go unnoticed  where the errors range from minor to life threatening and it will document the entire treatment course  thus providing essential data for quality improvement feedback  Conservative estimates range from    to    of patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment may benefit from the reduction of errors that could be achieved with the implementation of a completely independent dosimetric monitoring system",

pyridaben  a known mitochondrial complex    MC    inhibitor  As mitochondria constitute    to     of the myocardial intracellular volume  molecules that target mitochondrial proteins will be enriched and retained selectively in the myocardium  In pre clinical studies  flurpiridaz has shown a higher first pass extraction fraction than Tl     and Tc   m sestamibi at high flow rates  Thus  flurpiridaz can provide the opportunity to perform myocardial perfusion imaging with the improved resolution and quantification afforded by PET   PET has several technical advantages over SPECT including     routine measured attenuation correction  which decreases the number of false positives  thereby increasing specificity     high spatial and contrast resolution that allows for improved detection of small perfusion defects which decreases the number of false negatives  thereby increasing sensitivity  and    high temporal resolution that allows fast dynamic imaging of tracer kinetics  The latter makes absolute quantification of MBF possible  which has been shown to improve sensitivity for detection of multi vessel disease and evaluation of conditions that diffusely affect coronary circulation  Flurpiridaz also could provide improved clinical utility and\nease of use because of the longer half life      minutes  of an    F based agent compared to current PET MPI agents

industrialized countries  According to the latest andquot Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics        Updateandquot  published by American Heart Association  CAD is the single largest cause of death in the United States  In            million Americans were diagnosed with CAD and about         died of this disease  Prevention  early diagnosis  and treatment of CAD are essential to reduce the mortality   Assessments of regional myocardial blood flow have proved valuable for early diagnosis of coronary artery disease  These assessments can be performed in patients under rest and stress conditions with a radioactive labeled myocardial perfusion imaging tracer using Positron Emission Tomography  PET  imaging technique  The tracers that are currently available for PET myocardial perfusion imaging are not practical because they require expensive onsite cyclotrons or generators  Recently a novel PET imaging tracer F    Flurpiridaz has been developed that has the potential for overcoming the limitations that are faced with the current PET perfusion tracers  However  the method for quantification of myocardial blood flow with this agent is not developed yet   The overall

Instead of training procedural skills in isolation, we broaden the training scope to include learning problem-solving strategies, (e.g. diagnosing a problem and selecting a procedure to address it), metacognitive strategies, (e.g. assessing the effectiveness of ones current activities), and conceptual knowledge, (e.g. a cause-and-effect mental model of how a mechanical or electronic system works), all informed by current advances in learning sciences. We will create a compelling game-based maintenance trainer for a U.S. Navy Gun Mount currently in use in the fleet. We will utilize intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) as they provide a realistic task environment and enable individualized coaching.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Sleep deprivation, exercise, or continuous mental tasking are fatigue-related contributors in DoD mishaps.  Therefore, a critical need exists for fatigue detection technologies which are real-time, non-invasive, compact, portable, and accurate to aid decisions to replace or rest an individual as a preventative measure.  Certain compounds in human breath have been linked to disease states, and it is anticipated that fatigue affects breath composition similarly.  Our approach utilizes THz spectroscopy which is capable of detecting and measuring numerous breath biomarkers with absolute specificity, high sensitivity, and high throughput.  In Phase I, the THz spectroscopy detection method was validated against GC/MS methods and identified breath compounds  isoprene, dimethyl sulfide, and acetaldehyde  in sleep-deprived individuals that correlate well with results from cognitive tests measuring fatigue.  In Phase II, we will extend GC/MS and THz spectroscopy analysis in sleep-deprived subjects to acquire data for algorithm development to validate predictive capabilities of breath biomarker analysis for fatigue.  We will also build and validate a compact, portable, integrated table top THz chemical sensor capable of monitoring breath compounds in real-time.  Advratech is poised to collaborate with Boeing, WPAFB (Human Systems Division and AFRL/711th HPW) and TITUS during Phase II to accelerate commercialization of the proposed technology.; BENEFIT: The field of breath biomarkers is relatively unexplored compared to tests and diagnostics based on blood, urine, or other bodily parameters (i.e., EKG). The benefits and potential commercial applications of THz sensor technology address both issues of breath diagnostics and the detection of a wide array of compounds.  THz spectroscopic sensors are unique in their ability to achieve high sensitivity and near absolute specificity and are amenable to miniaturization, portability, and high-throughput.        We will refine our algorithms in Phase II for the putative biomarkers to develop a predictive capability of when an individual may be fatigued and a drop in performance may occur.  This non-invasive approach to detect fatigue will benefit DoD and commercial industries in which fatigue has contributed to accidents, i.e., commercial pilots and drivers.  Athletes and Special Operations Forces, who engage in strenuous training and sometimes irregular sleep, will also benefit from early fatigue warnings before conditions such as rhabdomyolysis develop.  Lastly, THz spectroscopy is ideal for environmental monitoring in the field as this technique can detect most light compounds with electric dipole moments.  Thus, with spectroscopic library, hardware and software development, THz sensors can be utilized in a variety of health, human performance, and environmental settings.",

Key innovations include the use of contingency policies to address classes of foreseeable battlespace disruptions, and a tractable approach to stochastic wargaming for COA analysis to inform selection of appropriate COAs. COASTeR will generalize and adapt the Phase I mechanism in several important ways. First, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of the Phase I coordination methodology beyond simplified air-to-ground kill chains to consider a wider set of missions, assets, and ways of employing them. Second, the wargaming capability will be extended to model metric time, capacitated resources, and multi-role assets.

The tools consist of an opposing force broadcast capability and an Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) monitoring capability which supports both electronic sensing (ES) and electronic attack (EA) functionality. The broadcast tools will support a wide range of commercial and military waveform synthesis and playback capabilities. The ES and EA tools will be based on Echo Ridges previously developed Software Architecture for Intelligent Jamming (SAIJ); an open integrated development environment (IDE) for EW. This capability will offer signal detection, identification, and characterization functions that may be used by warfighters to conduct effective EW.

        "abstract": "Use of  existing smaller prosthetic grafts for vascular repair and reconstruction after severe  trauma to the extremities is greatly limited by issues with stenosis and infection.  We propose treating the exterior of ePTFE vascular grafts with STAR biomaterial, a well-developed microporous synthetic tissue scaffold already in human use.   STAR prevents the usual formation of a constrictive fibrotic perigraft tissue capsule.  Mechanical constriction effects are  eliminated, permitting greater freedom for natural pulsatile and vibratory motion of the graft wall.  This suppresses progression of neointimal hyperplasia by alleviating compliance mismatch and providing more favorable stress conditions at the ePTFE-neointima interface.  The STAR biointerface also addresses the infection risk of ePTFE grafts; STAR biomaterial harnesses the bodys natural antimicrobial defenses by concentrating immune cells to resist infections.  These biological responses are regulated by the tightly controlled and optimized porous geometry and do not require use of added biologics.  Promising preliminary results suggest that this approach can lead to a major improvement  in clinical performance and reliability.  Phase II technical objectives are  demonstrating advantages of superior patency and infection control in an ovine arterial bypass model with controlled bacterial challenge, and performing needed  bench testing  towards qualifying  the novel graft design for human use.",

The work plan is intended to provide continued progress focusing on increasing knowledge about Knites Kinetic Spark Ignition (KSI) as an actuator for instability suppression, in expanding/magnifying its capabilities, and in understanding its operation while testing it in a wider test envelope. Design innovations, such as integrated igniter fuel assist, and further refinements will increase the authority of the KSI as an actuator. At the same time, expanding the test envelope of the augmentor simulator rig will improve confidence on the effectiveness of the technology under a wider range of conditions. Finally, employing an advanced suite of instrumentation to study the screech and its suppression will help understand the mechanisms on how the technology works and will make it easier to transfer it to a full size augmentor. The proposal includes characterization tests focused solely on studying features of the screech instability in order to identify and locate mechanisms that can be disrupted by the KSI actuator. It also includes bench testing of the KSI actuator upgrades and three screech suppression test campaigns in which the effectiveness of KSI design improvements can be evaluated. Through these activities, the technology level can be pushed forward and the probability of success of an eventual engine test will increase.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to facilitate the commercialization of low fat replacement EPG technology to help solve some of the largest obesity and related health issues facing the US while providing a patentable new additive platform for the $600 billion food industry. With high caloric density foods being the primary cause for the obesity epidemic, the facilitation of rapid development of 92% lower calorie fat replacers such as EPG will have a powerful impact on the health of a large portion of society, reducing health care cost for US citizens and providing a positive economic impact for the US. The highest initial impact will be the introduction of additive modified EPG fat replacers to the confectionary segment where the need for decreased caloric content is greatest due to the absence of compatible low-calorie fats. Locally, the development of this technology will result in growth of 20 + high technology jobs in South Carolina. During Phase II, Tetramer will work with undergraduates and high school students through the NSF Phase II supplemental programs, which have trained 25 undergraduate students and 9 high school students who have all gone into STEM careers. The objectives of this Phase II research project are to provide critically needed additive control technology to allow the dramatically reduced caloric intake (up to 92% ) of esterified propoxylated glycerol technology (EPG) to be used in many food products that today contain high calorie natural fats and oils. During Phase I activities, Tetramer discovered that the new EPG approach to mitigating the growing obesity epidemic in the US was hampered by the fact that being a new technology EPG processes differently than high calorie fats such as palm kernel oil or cocoa butter. This creates a manufacturing mismatch for a significant number of the products in the projected $2.6 Billion fat replacement market. To date the commercially available additives do not work, thus requiring a new additive molecular architecture ?toolbox? to optimize the processing variables. Tetramer will use it's synthetic organic chemistry and material science expertise to synthesize and optimize additives that will allow EPG?s to provide 92% lower calories, while still maintaining the same sensory, physical properties and processing efficiency as the natural oils they will replace. End use applications will be developed through collaborations with food industry leaders.",

The development of this system will address critical needs in a variety of disciplines for substantially improved detection sensitivity (particularly of low atomic number elements), higher spatial resolution, better analysis accuracy, and increased throughput. The proposed project is expected to impact the $ 900 million XRF market by further accelerating the rapid adoption of this tool, which has been utilized for a variety of research and industrial applications, including: development of advanced materials, toxicology of trace metals, mapping mineral distribution in healthy and diseased biological tissues, determining efficient oil extraction methods for specific reservoirs in oil & gas, monitoring mine efficiency by analyzing mine wastes, and chemical analysis of buried structures and packaging components in the semiconductor industry. Currently, achieving high spatial resolution mapping of elemental composition at the micrometer scale resolution with analysis sensitivity in the low parts per million (ppm) levels is only possible at synchrotron micro-XRFs, of which there are only a limited number of around the world, and which are often oversubscribed. The performance of existing laboratory micro-XRF systems is largely limited - in terms of focus size, focusing efficiency, and spectral response - by the x-ray optics which are employed.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to reduce the cost of solar generated electricity by increasing the efficiency of panels and reducing cleaning and maintenance costs. This improvement is created using a nanoscale glass coating that increases transmittance of single side coated solar PV glass and creates an antifogging and self-cleaning surface. These savings increase with photovoltaic device efficiencies as well, so as the next generation of solar cells will see even greater benefit from the proposed innovation. Reducing the cost per watt of solar generated electricity is one of the grand energy challenges and has immense societal and governmental impacts. The proposed project is one component of addressing that challenge. The technical advances made in this project will also be applicable to additional market opportunities in LED lighting and other cutting-edge markets. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project investigates the deposition of water-based nanoparticle solutions using industrially scalable methods and results in valuable scientific knowledge that is not currently available in the field. Nanoparticle-based antireflective glass coatings have been presented in both the scientific literature and commercial products. However, most coatings suffer from either high deposition costs, or a trade-off between durability and performance. In this project, methods to increase the durability of a low-cost, high-performance nanoparticle that were developed in the Phase I project are scaled to high throughput and low cost fabrication methods. The process/structure/property relationships of this novel coating will be investigated and lead to new scientific knowledge related to the large-scale deployment of nanoparticle based technologies. The coated glass will be subjected to industry standard reliability and durability tests. The expected outcome of this work is the demonstration of this technology at a pilot level with industry collaborators.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project will develop a computer-based tutoring platform that adapts its teaching strategy to each student by monitoring their brain activity. Access to individualized instruction by teachers or qualified tutors is limited for a vast number of students, particularly in disadvantaged areas and for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects. Computer-based teaching technology could meet this demand, but currently relies on indirect inferences of a student's state, and therefore lacks some of the key abilities of human teachers to assess a student during a lesson. This project will address this challenge by enabling the tutoring system to determine how hard students are thinking and their level of focus. This will be accomplished by measuring a student's brain electrical activity using a newly-developed headset designed specifically for school-aged children. Information derived from brain activity patterns will be used to guide tutorial topic selection, difficulty of the content and the level of interactivity. This project could lead to a significant advance in education technology by enhancing the adaptability of computer-based tutoring platforms and expanding the depth of information on student performance available to teachers and parents. Adaptive computer-based education is now a rapidly growing market, and the technology developed in this project aims to provide companies with a unique capability to improve their products and to meet the need for truly scalable individualized tutoring. The unique innovation of this project is to create a tutoring platform that closes the loop with the student by adapting its teaching strategy to the student?s cognitive state. To overcome the limitations of current adaptive tutoring systems, this product will measure the student's cognitive workload and engagement, and use this information to adapt aspects of the instructional strategy such as topic selection, content difficulty and interactivity in a closed-loop fashion. The goals of this project are to modify current brain-wave measurement systems for use by children and young adults, extend associated computational algorithms and validate them to an industry standard, and evaluate the effect of adding brain-based metrics to student models that are at the core of adaptive technologies. To meet these objectives, we will perform research and development to advance technologies for brain-activity monitoring, and conduct studies with students in grades 6 through 12 who will be tutored in subjects such as math, biology and history while their brain activity is recorded. The results will be used to determine the effects of using brain activity data to improve the adaptability of computer-based tutors and expand the depth of information available to educational data analytics platforms.",

Tablet devices are known to provide an interactive experience that has revolutionized learning for children. Unfortunately, while these tablet devices are intuitive to utilize and easy for many children, those with disabilities are largely overlooked due to difficulties in effecting pinch-and-swipe gestures. This project thus addresses a direct need in our society by providing an integrated educational experience, focused on math education that addresses the diverse needs of children, while providing a solution for variations found in their disabilities. The contributions of this project include 1) the design of accessible math Apps usable by K-12 children with and without disabilities and 2) the design of apps that adapt educational content and provide feedback to parents and teachers based on real-time analytics. Given that there are over 93 million children worldwide living with a disability and, in the United States, children with disabilities are entitled to a free appropriate public education, there is a large potential of making both a commercial, as well as a societal, impact in this space. This SBIR Phase II project addresses an unmet need by developing an innovative solution to enable children with motor disabilities access to mobile devices and Apps that could engage them fully into the educational system. This solution capitalizes on the availability of pervasive technologies by combining an accessible tablet interface and educational Apps that adapt to each child?s abilities in order to provide an accessible mobile solution.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a new analytical chemistry instrument for rapid quantitation of residual chemical impurities in complex mixtures. The target application for this project is the detection of genotoxic impurities during early drug development in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The instrument to be developed uses Fourier transform molecular rotational resonance (FT-MRR) spectroscopy to identify molecules based on their three dimensional geometry, which permits high chemical specificity. FT-MRR is a high-resolution spectroscopy technique that makes it possible to directly analyze gas mixtures containing a large number of chemicals without the need for prior chemical separation using chromatography - a time-consuming step of current analysis methods that requires significant technical supervision. As a result, FT-MRR based chemical analysis instruments have the potential to speed up innovation for pharmaceutical manufacturers by reducing analytical development cycles from weeks to hours during the high-throughput drug innovation process. Chemical analysis instruments using FT-MRR spectroscopy enable faster innovation in research and development labs with the added benefit of seamless method transferability to on-line process monitoring applications and routine quality control for final product release. The ability to transfer analysis methods into routine analysis is important to the industry goal of continuous manufacturing for pharmaceuticals. It is enabled for FT-MRR in part (yet critically) by the two main objectives of this Phase II effort: the development of sampling automation for FT-MRR and the design of a cost-reduced, targeted FT-MRR system. Concepts for both of these designs were successfully tested during Phase I. The intellectual merit of this project is the introduction of a new technique for chemical analysis that senses chemicals based on the absolute molecular structure, with no orthogonal analysis required. FT-MRR spectral fingerprints can distinguish molecular isomers, conformers, isotopologues, and even enantiomers. With this kind of absolute structure information, FT-MRR can enable new studies that trace chemical pathways with site-specific isotopic ratio information and chiral detection. Both concepts are otherwise very challenging with current technology. The FT-MRR instrument to be built for this project combines recent advances in high-power, solid-state millimeter wave (mm-wave) light sources, low-cost microwave synthesizer integrated circuits, and high-speed digital electronics to implement a time-domain, Fourier transform (FT) measurement approach. Standard methods for chemical sampling will be integrated to maximize the ease-of-use and robustness of FT-MRR instruments.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is a breakthrough in insect control for the agricultural industry. Provivi, Inc. intends to develop biosynthesis technology for producing insect pheromones, with a dramatic reduction in the cost of goods sold compared to existing syntheses. This will enable the use of pheromones beyond niche markets such as fruits and nuts: the target market for Provivi?s pheromone products are large acreage row crops. By introducing pheromone-based control as an inexpensive alternative in these markets, we are meeting a growing demand as conventional insecticides are becoming increasingly incapable of protecting crops due to insect resistance, regulatory constraints, and detrimental effects on beneficial insects. The societal and environmental benefits of using pheromones are numerous: pheromones are considered the safest possible insecticides with respect to human food consumption as well as environmental impact. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has characterized them as low risk. Our pheromone products will benefit consumers by creating a safer food supply with lower chemical residues, growers by introducing an effective and novel pest control solution and the environment by reducing the chemical exposure to the ecosystem. The objectives of this Phase II research project are to improve the selectivity and productivity of our prototype biocatalyst to target commercial performance, and to demonstrate pheromone synthesis from a cheap feedstock using this biocatalyst. PRovivi's proprietary biocatalyst utilizes a novel monooxygenase to catalyze a reaction not found in nature. The research product of this project will expand the scientific knowledge for this class of biocatalysts. Additionally, since this class of biocatalysts has not been optimized for commercial viability for the specific reaction of interest, this research program could provide impactful research learnings to achieve target commercial performance. These learnings include but are not limited to changes in the biocatalyst physiology, metabolic pathways and potential stress responses. This research could provide valuable knowledge for both commercial and academic biocatalysis research that utilize this class of biocatalysts.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to continue the development of a family of new nanostructured conductive additives for use in high-performance coatings and composite resins. Static charge buildup from the environment is a critical problem in a number of vehicular applications, which increasingly utilize lightweight components constructed from non-conductive plastic or composite materials. Static charge buildup interferes with electronic components, such as distributed sensors, so that mitigation of this effect is essential for safe vehicle operation. The design of lightweight vehicles using composite materials, which requires high-performing antistatic coatings, will lead to large reductions in fuel consumption and carbon emissions in transportation. In 2011, emissions from transportation accounted for 28% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Modern aircraft designs, utilizing composite materials, show more than 20% reduction in fuel consumption compared to traditional vehicles. Imminent increases in fuel efficiency standards in automobiles will also drive manufacturers to adopt the use of composite materials. The development of the proposed antistatic coatings is essential to enabling these new lightweight material technologies. The new additives are based on the synthesis of self-assembling nanostructures from conductive polymers and structure-directing agents. When successfully incorporated in commercial paints and primers, the conductive properties of the coating are enhanced without compromising adhesion and durability. In this Phase II effort, we will further optimize these additives, based on key customer requirements, and develop a plan to scale up their production tenfold with reduced waste and production time. Corrosion properties for marine applications will also be evaluated, and the product portfolio will be expanded to address follow-on applications.",

To model fretting fatigue crack nucleation and subsequent fatigue crack growth, the FRANC3D software was modified to include fretting nucleation models. These models, combined with finite element results predict fretting nucleation life and crack nucleation sites. Discrete crack insertion and growth is then simulated to predict total life. FRANC3D has been used to successfully simulate fretting fatigue in: dog-bone specimens, small scale dovetail specimens, a blade/disk assembly, helicopter transmission gear teeth, and a wind turbine shaft/bearing assembly. These simulations highlighted the need for additional fretting experiments, as fretting nucleation models require material dependent parameters. The Army Research Lab will conduct a suite of experiments on bare- and coated-steel dog-bone specimens with titanium fretting pins. This data will verify and validate the fretting nucleation models, and the FRANC3D simulations will provide benchmarks for simulating fretting fatigue in more complex components. Enhancements to the software will allow a straightforward transition from fretting nucleation to fatigue crack growth, thereby providing total life predictions for critical aircraft components.",

As more vehicles are added, the efficiency of the convoy can increase; however, if each successive vehicle uses the previous vehicle for path following, the convoy accuracy will gradually degrade. In order to improve the path following of successive vehicles, the phase I of this project showed that use of disturbance and off-path error information can improve the accuracy of successive vehicles by passing this information to the following vehicle. The phase II of this project will continue to build on this idea, utilizing more general disturbance estimations. Additionally, improving the dynamic models of the vehicles and using preview information of the path with AMAS sensors will improve prediction steps of the Kalman filter and path control in general. This project will utilize ASIs large assortment of equipment and vehicles with expertise from Auburn University and their AMAS sensor suite to ensure success of this project. Successful completion of this project will provide benefits to both manned and unmanned ground vehicles. Commercialization efforts will be an important part of this project.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Many turbomachinery applications have achieved improved availability, reliability and cost savings by incorporating health monitoring systems to determine the mechanical condition of key components in near real time. The goals of any health monitoring system are to ensure reliability by avoiding unplanned maintenance, to reduce operating costs by providing the information needed to plan repairs well in advance, and to improve safety by acquiring the data needed to monitor critical components. For health monitoring of turbine engine blades, blade tip clearance and vibration measurements are two of the most challenging tasks. Although blade tip measurement technology is constantly evolving, there is still an urgent need for accurate robust sensors that can survive the harsh environment of an advanced military engine. The goal for this project is to improve the state-of-the-art in health sensing technology for turbine blades. The objectives are to improve the durability of Mechanical Solution, Inc.s (MSI) microwave sensor, provide a realistic turbine engine environment in the laboratory, and validate the improved sensor. The Propulsion Instrumentation Working Group (PIWG) will be acting as an advisor for this project.; BENEFIT: This proposal describes the development of sensor technology that will be transitioned into Air Force Life Cycle Management Center programs. Advanced measurement systems support the objectives of the Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engine (VAATE) program, adaptive cycle development, and emerging monitoring and prognostic health management systems. The initial steps at transition will be taken during this project, and will be fully in place by the end of the project.",

We intend to manufacture an FDA compliant electrospinning system to produce peripheral vascular grafts based on our successful prototype system developed during Phase I.  The graft will be comprised of natural and synthetic polymers capable of in situ remodeling to leave a natural vessel upon complete healing.  When available, the lumen of the conduit will be pre-lined with stromal cells harvested from the patients adipose tissue.  These cells will migrate into the conduit to form a smooth muscle medial layer as well as an endothelium.     We believe that the regenerative cell populations found in adipose represents a clinically feasible source of cells for vascular-dependent tissue repair.

DZYNEs long-term objectives for MONARCH include migration into an ultra-deeply embedded implementation that can be hosted onboard a platform with nearly zero impact to available Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP). DZYNE has teamed with Management Sciences, Inc., (MSI) to help realize this objective through utilization of MSIs Embeddable Programmable Instrumentation Controller (EPIC) modules as an implementation medium for MONARCH.  This will provide an ultra-low SWaP ability to responsibly liberate onboard data in a secure manner for onboard processing with approved Apps that are hosted within a distributed application fabric that lives in the physical space between connector terminals and the wires they support.  To reach this end-state, MONARCH technology must evolve to a point where guarantees can be made regarding its stability, scalability, ease of use, and handling of secure data.

        "abstract": "In this SBIR program, Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) is developing a PCM-based ocean thermal energy harvesting system to provide reliable, renewable, on-board electrical power generation for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). This scalable system harvests energy from the natural temperature gradients that exist in the ocean. ACTs novel design efficiently extracts heat from the surrounding water at warmer depths, and rejects waste heat into the surrounding water at colder depths. The extracted thermal energy is stored in volumes of phase change material (PCM) and made available to an on-board thermal-to-electric power conversion cycle for continuous power generation regardless of depth. This novel design is flexible and adaptable in the design of the power conversion cycle, enabling scalability of the system from sub-watt for small underwater vehicles, to modular systems of up to 2 kW output. This technology could substantially increase the operational lifetime of underwater gliders and floats used for scientific measurements and surveillance capability. Larger ocean energy harvesting system can serve as underwater charging stations for autonomous vehicles, or provide power for other naval applications. This Phase II SBIR program will develop and test breadboard prototype systems for both small AUVs and larger power station applications.",

Anti-Jam (AJ) and Low Probability of Detection (LPD) communications systems can restore CNI functions while also providing enhanced capabilities like high bandwidth mobile ad-hoc mesh networking. Further integration of the AJ/LPD communications equipment with the jamming equipment then allows coordinated, efficient use of the spectrum to limit signal Anti-Fratricide (AF). While the highest level of AJ/LPD/AF capability would be provided by Free Space Optical (FSO) means such as laser communications, numerous problems like available aperture, coverage, and atmospheric effects, limit the utility of laser communications on tactical platforms, and do not provide the general solution to CNI availability that a fight in A2AD will demand. Optical communication is best suited to network backbone and relay applications; for the latter, hybrid routers capable of seamless, continuous routing of traffic across AJ/LPD and FSO will maximize availability and throughput in comparison to the common fail-over schemes, which are inefficient at best and ineffective at worst. Critically, the AJ/LPD/AF communications equipment provide precision navigation and identification functions, so that the communication system becomes a net provider of navigation and identification services, rather than being consumed by them. Fully integrated CNI using AJ/LPD/AF that can survive intense A2AD environments is a massive paradigm shift that few recognize and even fewer appreciate; yet the innovations developed here will enable the F/A-18 and similar tactical aircraft to fly and fight with impunity in denied environments far beyond current capabilities.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project addresses the issue that while mobile devices hold great promise for education, most of the kids' apps that claim to be educational ultimately amount to little more than brain candy. Furthermore, the few apps that are based on educational research are resource-intensive to develop and therefore have limited opportunity to scale their success. This project is building an educational platform that addresses the problems of both quality and scale in this market. It is creating a content enhancement system designed specifically for creating research-based educational content that allows developers and content studios to build mobile and web apps at a fraction (10%-20%) of the cost of traditional app development. The content built using this system is automatically integrated with analytics and personalization technology that tailors the content to each child based on the child's responses. The personalization technology applies methods from psychometrics and cognitive development to ensure that the content adapts to the child and facilitates learning in an engaging way. The project will deliver a large library of context-based and personalized learning content for preK and primary grades that parents know is based on sound research, and ultimately helps increase school readiness and learning outcomes. Given the growing demand for age-appropriate mobile educational content for children, this project has the potential to generate significant returns as a commercial enterprise and, importantly, through the economic gains resulting from improvements in educational outcomes. It will also give content developers the opportunity to economically develop and deploy new content that uses personalization technology, without having to build this complex technology themselves, thereby applying this innovation at a large scale. This SBIR Phase II project is building a mobile game-based learning platform to onboard high quality third-party children's educational content and enhance their effectiveness through analytics and personalization. To achieve this, the project is developing two significant technical innovations: (1) a cloud-based personalization engine that powers adaptive learning in varied educational contexts and (2) a content enhancement system to efficiently and economically enrich third-party children's content (in the form of digital assets, books, or videos) with interactive learning games that are powered by the personalization logic. The personalization engine will use machine learning techniques combined with statistical methods of psychometric assessment and principles from cognitive development. It will inconspicuously measure children's interaction with the proposed platform's educational content and dynamically adjust game-play to suit each user's individual skills, interests and educational needs. The proposed model of leveraging and augmenting the efforts of many content developers is a dramatic departure from existing content development paradigms in this space. The goal of the project is to substantially increase the scale and reach of personalized, research-based learning experiences on mobile devices and ultimately maximize the potential of modern technology to deliver dynamic learning experiences.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to enable the development and commercialization of single crystal piezoelectric Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) filters targeting the mobile wireless market, providing much needed improvements over the incumbent poly-crystalline technology in critical components used in all smartphones and other wireless devices. The technical advantage based upon this innovation in single crystal piezoelectric material provides improvements in key parameters that will benefit consumers of the smartphone, of particular note are component insertion losses which will result in increased battery life and reducing the complexity of the RF front-end. Additionally, the commercialization of this technology will address cellular component market demand not being serviced with the incumbent technology. There is a general lack of competition around the incumbent technology based on limited access to existing intellectual property. The technology developed under this SBIR will enable new participants in this growing market. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable the first comprehensive study of wide bandgap, group III-Nitride single crystal materials for bulk mode resonator technology. This technology is the fundamental building block of RF filter technology and addresses a critical need in today's RF frontends. The need arises from the filter's location (between amplifier and antenna) and performance (half the power is lost due to inefficiencies). As a result, components must be over-designed to accommodate for the filter loss. The excessive losses degrade battery life and drive higher thermal management costs in the system. To address this need, a more efficient, lower loss Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) filter with lower losses and dramatically improved performance is proposed and offers high payoff in the end market. The effort continues the design and simulation of single-crystal piezoelectric resonators to support resonant frequencies from 1 to 6 GHz. Piezoelectric materials are synthesized on 150-mm silicon substrates and fabricated into resonators and BAW filters using an experimental fabrication process flow and novel circuit designs.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project could be very significant for the field of light emitting diodes (LEDs) and other optoelectronics. This project is aimed at developing a solution based technology for depositing transparent conductive zinc oxide (ZnO) layers for use in LEDs and other optoelectronic devices. This ZnO deposition technology has potential to provide a lower cost and higher performance alternative to the physical vapor deposited indium tin oxide (PVD-ITO) layers that are currently used. The technology could be commercialized for LED manufacturing in only a few years. Lighting is one of the modern world's primary usages of energy and the adoption of high efficiency LED lighting has potential to significantly reduce lighting energy demand. By lowering manufacturing cost and improving performance, the technology developed in this project can help increase LED adoption and energy savings. In the longer term, this technology may also be used to lower manufacturing cost and improve performance of solar cells, impacting clean energy supply as well as demand. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is aimed at commercializing a technology which addresses the problem of Transparent Conductive Oxide (TCO) film performance and cost, in particular for light emitting diodes (LEDs) and other Gallium Nitride based optoelectronics. This proposal aims to bring a solution based method for depositing Zinc Oxide (ZnO) based TCO films to the point of commercial competiveness, with the longer term goal of providing significantly lower materials, energy, and capital equipment costs than current deposition methods and TCO materials. The approach being taken in the proposal relies on well understood characterization techniques as methods of determining successfulness as well as direct feedback from device manufacturers. The small business has the support and validation of strategic partnerships with device manufacturers eager to support this development of this technology.",

        "abstract": "Fatigue properties of metallic aerospace structures are improved significantly by cold working to impart favorable compressive residual stresses (RS) at and near the surface. In Phases I and II, Proto designed and developed a first generation x-ray diffraction (XRD) based NDI/E tool to measure RS distributions surrounding cold-worked holes in aerospace structures. Subsequently, Proto self-funded and developed an improved second-generation RS measurement (RSM) tool XRD. These tools work well on aircraft skins and exposed structures where the radii of curvature are large. However, those tools are quite limited in their ability to reliably measure RS on parts with complex geometries and to access tight and confined spaces of typical structures. The proposed third generation RSM tool is designed to overcome both of those limitations by miniaturizing the x-ray source, optimizing the detectors, and refining the probe design. The final RSM tool will be computer controlled, handheld and/or hand-placeable, and safe with integrated shielding. It will have a detachable small display on the probe for real time RS readout and will store measurements in a database for future analysis and tracking. The system will be small, lightweight, portable, rugged, and operate on 110 VAC for use aboard ship and in depots.",

Computational corrosion solutions are being developed by the ONR SBA Team. Our Phase 1 and Phase 2 programs successfully demonstrated that GalvanicMaster finite element analysis (FEA) accurately reproduces galvanic corrosion risk, location and relative severity in complex assemblies. Modeling has been validated against sustainment experience, and formal VV&A per MIL-STD-3022 is underway. GalvanicMaster now includes Time Stepping and resistive surface layers, permitting incorporation of paints, anodize, and corrosion products. We have developed a simplified approach usable by designers and non-FEA engineers for quick corrosion analysis and scoping. In Phase 2.5 we will formally validate both the simplified and FEA software, and integrate the simplified system into CAD. We will analyze a range of situations, including OEM and sustainment corrosion issues and experimental setups of SBA team members. We will further develop the data acquisition Best Practices and Data Management System to assemble the database. The FEA and simplified modeling approaches, as well as the underline data, will be available to SBA Team members and the sustainment community.",

        "abstract": "The objective of the proposed Phase II project is to develop a hand-held, rapid plasmonic biosensor -- a detector based upon surface  plasmon resonances (SPR) that incorporates a new class of supercharged proteins that functionalize a low-cost, disposable plasmonic  chip. Each protein is designed to bind to a pre-determined toxin with high specificity. Upon successful binding, the protein superfolds  relative to a typical immunoassay system, causing a correspondingly large change in the index of refraction immediately adjacent to the  surface of the plasmonic chip, that subsequently changes the transmission of light through the chip. In Phase I, we designed,  synthesized, and characterized a supercharged protein that binds the model toxin heme. This protein demonstrated a large bindinginduced  refractive index change that is calculated to correspond to a 1001000 fold improvement in SPR signal relative to commercially  available systems. In Phase II, these results will be extended to proteins that selectively bind to ricin, anthrax and sarin. Also in Phase  II, the hand-held optical module and plasmonic chip will be improved to increase performance and reduce cost.

The original battery met the electrical and safety requirements following environmental testing while also providing significant weight reductions when compared to the fielded Zinc/Silver Oxide system and the competing thermal battery. The development in the Phase I program demonstrated the battery systems ability to meet the ASM power and energy requirements via prototype cell testing. These tests led to a revised battery energy projection that surpassed the program goal of 200 Ws/g, with a projected mass of 7.9 lbs, well under the 13 lb maximum requirement. Phase II development work will focus on increasing battery design fidelity and validating the design via full battery testing with particular attention focused on low temperature performance.

        "abstract": "During recent conflicts, the U.S. has benefited from complete air dominance. Such dominance has allowed us to control or even eliminate many, if not most, sources of uncertainty affecting air missions. The command and control systems that have emerged from these conditions were designed to optimize their performance. However, as shown in [9], such an approach yields high performing but brittle systems, unable to tolerate severe or even moderate uncertainty. The current geopolitical environment indicates that in future conflicts we will not be afforded the luxury to completely control uncertainty. Denied environments, in which sensor and communication black- outs are long compared to the mission time constants, are particularly challenging. The trend to substitute sophisticated and unaffordable platforms with a team of cheaper simpler ones, including unmanned assets, further complicates the situation. As the mission team gets fragmented by these blackouts, local knowledge of the battle situation becomes stale and opportunities for coordination are limited, rendering current command and control systems inoperable.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Imaging applications such as persistent surveillance and tactical imaging require multi-megapixel imagers to achieve both high resolution and wide fields of view (FOV).  Since the pixel size drives the size of the lens and other components in the optical train, the pixel size must be small in order to keep the size and weight of the entire imager manageable for different platforms.  We propose to improve the hybridization process through a combination of processing and compression techniques to enable the reduction in ultimate pixel size to less than 5 microns.  We will validate our process through the fabrication of high definition infrared imaging arrays with a 5 micron pixel pitch.  These FPAs will be fabricated with 2 different detecting materials to demonstrate imaging in the SWIR wavelength range and the MWIR wavelength range.      ; BENEFIT: The ability to make FPAs with small pixels (5 um) in infrared materials will lead to cost reductions for infrared FPAs because (1) the raw material per die is less and (2) the lens assembly is smaller.  The lower costs and smaller size will lead to further deployment of infrared imagers across the services.  In addition, commercial applications such as thermography will see lower costs and will therefore expand their market.   In terms of performance, the smaller pixel will allow megapixel class imagers to be used in space-constrained applications such as gimbals.  The added benefit is that the lens size can be reduced because the focal length of the lens decreases proportionally with pixel size.",

Presently magnesium/silver chloride batteries and a number of different types of lithium primary batteries (e.g. Li/SO2 battery 260WH/kg, Li/Thionyl battery 450 WH/kg or Li/CFx battery) are being used or developed for sonobuoys. However, the costs of these batteries are very high and their peak power cannot meet the requirement (i.e. > 6500 W) for sonobuoy use. Moreover, these batteries tend to vent toxic fumes during high power discharging. None of the available battery chemistries provides sufficient power and duration for this particular sonobuoy application. Therefore, there exists a strong need to develop a new battery to serve this market. In this program, low cost electrochemical couples will be employed and, through a combination of a 3D electrode structure, bipolar configuration and polymer electrolyte, a high power, low cost and long shelf life battery will be developed. Additionally, this battery will not have the safety problems inherent in current batteries. In our Phase I work the feasibility of our innovative approaches has been successfully demonstrated and the performance of the battery has been demonstrated on the full cell level. In this proposed Phase II program, a prototype battery will be designed, fabricated and extensively tested. By the end of the program, prototype batteries will be delivered to the Navy for independent validation. We will commence the commercialization effort by working with strategic partners in order to enter into a manufacturing agreement in order to ensure successfully transition to the fleet.",

        "abstract": "Embedded devices are vulnerable to cyber attacks and their compromise can severely impair critical infrastructure and mission-critical systems. Power Fingerprinting (PFP) is a novel approach for integrity assessment of critical embedded systems which is capable of detecting malicious intrusions at all levels of the execution stack. PFP is based on fine-grained anomaly detection on the processor's physical side channels such as power consumption or electromagnetic emissions. PFP leverages signal detection and classification principles to provide a quantitative metric of trust. PFP enables security monitoring and integrity assessment on platforms that would otherwise not have the memory or processing resources necessary to do it. \nIn this Phase II project we will develop a commercial prototype of a remote PFP monitor to perform automatic detection and mitigation of exploited vulnerabilities in networked embedded control systems in critical infrastructure. The specific technical objectives include: 1) Leverage current PFP integrity assessment and intrusion detection platforms to create a commercial prototype for automatic detection and patching of exploited vulnerabilities in critical embedded systems. 2) Define and implement flexible mitigation strategies specifically tailored to critical infrastructure to be deployed automatically when an intrusion is detected. 3)\tProvide analytics on real-time feeds of broad PFP deployments to provide an enterprise level view of security status. The prototype will be validated in two industrial control platforms commonly used in critical infrastructure. A PFP-based automatic vulnerability detection represents a dual-use opportunity with a broad range of applications within the military, the federal government, and several commercial enterprises.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The Numericus Group, LLC has demonstrated during Phase I that our new approach to digital filtering vastly outperforms existing algorithms. At the heart of this new approach are algorithms that are guaranteed to converge and do not require an expert to oversee their operation, unlike many existing algorithms commonly used today. The new approach allows us to automatically design robust, highly efficient filters that achieve any target specifications within a user-supplied accuracy. These new algorithms represent profound advances in the state of the art in two primary areas: applications that push the limits of existing technology, and applications where automatic filter design is critical. Importantly, both types of applications are crucial to military users. During Phase II, we will transition many of these algorithms from prototypes to commercial software packages, and release this software through signal processing suites widely used in military and non-military sectors. We will demonstrate the superiority of our new packages over existing packages by using them to solve two challenging filtering problems from a classified SIGINT program that processes data from a USAF collector.; BENEFIT: Products developed during Phase II of this project will be released through signal processing suites widely used by military and non-military users. Thus, users will benefit immediately from this new digital signal processing technology. In particular, our new technology can improve throughput, reduce latency, and increase accuracy in many existing time-critical military systems--a fact that we will demonstrate on a real-world cutting edge SIGINT program that processes USAF data. Products developed during Phase II of this project also lay the groundwork for additional products to be developed during Phase III. Because our algorithms are robust and guaranteed to converge without the need for an expert to guide the filter design process, it is possible to use our algorithms to compensate for device-specific phase distortions. This capability has numerous military applications, which we will pursue during Phase III.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant   The human genome encodes     protein kinases that catalyze the phosphorylation of client proteins  Signal transduction mediated by protein impacts virtually all aspects of cellular physiology  from the coordination of the cell cycle and cll division to apoptosis  Not surprisingly  the deregulation of kinases is implicated in many diseases including diabetes  inflammation  cardiovascular diseases  tumor cell proliferation and metastasis  making them a target for drug development  Small molecule drug discovery targeting protein kinases has seen enormous success in the past decade with over    drugs approved for oncology and most recently rheumatoid arthritis with many more in the pipeline for diverse indications  However  the similarity of the ATP binding active site in kinases targeted by small molecules continues to make selectivity a significant concern in drug discovery and development  since a promiscuous drug is expected to give rise to undesired adverse effects  especially for long term therapy  In this Phase II application  we will develop a split luciferase based luminescent assay for kinome wide screening and profiling of inhibitors in a cellular setting  Currently  there are several kinome scale in vitro biochemical assays that are used for screening and identification of kinase inhibitors  but these assays do not provide any information on the ability of a molecule to cross cell membranes or engage its desired target in a cell  In addition  most biochemical assays use the catalytic kinase domain  thereby limiting the identification of potentially more selective allosteric inhibitors that bind sites distal to the AT binding site  We hypothesize that the development of kinome wide cell based assays  which are in its infancy  will meet a critical need  The cell based kinome assays proposed herein will allow for directly monitoring the effect of compounds on a target kinase to not only to ascertain cell permeability and cellular toxicity  but also to establish efficacy in the cellular milieu in the presence of other ATP binding proteins  Our goal is to render cellular kinase profiling assays both easily available and affordable  so that compound profiling in a cellular or native context can be done earlier and thereby lead to early identification of failures  resulting in many more opportunities for success and new and safer clinical candidates PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  The activities of the     human protein kinases are tightly regulated inside cells and their dysregulation has been implicated in many diseases  validating them as therapeutic targets  The challenge in designing drugs against kinases stems from their cross reactivity  which arises due to similar architecture of many kinases at the conserved ATP binding pocket  Screening compounds against a large number of kinases in their native cellular context can help develop a selectivity fingerprint  which can be used to make critical decisions for advancing a compound into the clinic and provide efficacious drugs  Our application will seek to develop low cost  sensitive  luminescence based kinase assays that measure direct binding of the target kinase by compounds inside cells and can be used for advancing the discovery of new and effective therapies for human diseases",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The overall objective of this effort is to develop technologies that extend sustainment modeling and simulation capabilities to support improved investment decisions throughout the weapon system lifecycle.  Specifically, the main objective of this proposed Phase II research effort is to develop the concept for a new simulation capability that enhances, combines and integrates simulation tools to provide an effective capability to model multiple processes and factors.  Frontier Technology, Inc. (FTI) proposes to accomplish this in a two-pronged approach:  1) develop innovative enhancements to existing simulation capability; and 2) develop an innovative sustainment modeling infrastructure that can serve as the basis for an integrated capability with other sustainment models and tools.  In the Phase II effort, FTI will extend the Phase I work that proved the concept of an integrated sustainment simulation capability. FTI will extend the Phase I effort in the areas of LCOM ATK software enhancements, integration software development, and topics for further case studies to develop and document a complete working prototype.  As in the Phase I, FTIs focus will be guided by the stakeholders and agreed upon case study. FTI will provide a demonstration of the simulation capability and validate the results with the case study.  BENEFIT:  This research is applicable to DoD and commercial industries employing complex maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO), and supply chain management (SCM) systems. These organizations must all adapt to the integration and use of simulation technologies to make their processes more efficient than they currently are. The solution that these organizations will seek must address the analysis problems of sustainment that can be adaptable, flexible, and easily integrated into existing models, and management and data systems.  This capability must be able to be implemented within the confines of the available budget and to preclude operational impacts that could jeopardize mission readiness, as well as the financial bottom line. A sustainment simulation tool suite that will accurately assess sustainment issues and conditions and enable rapid determination of optimal repair processes across the organization will enable users to operate their repair processes more efficiently compared to current capabilities, as they try to keep their fleets serviceable and safe, while minimizing operational costs.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:AMI shall build and test an installation of a Continuous Custody system during Transport of a satellite. Using a GFE shipping container, AMI would design and build a Continuous Custody during Transport (CCT) system based on the concepts from Phase I as well as our learnings from the Digital Assurance System project.     The proposed CCT system would include video capture and environmental sensors to monitor and record the status of the satellite being transported. When the satellite arrives at the destination, the data that has been captured may be uploaded for analysis.     The CCT system would be designed in Phase II based on GFE requirements and constraints as well as on discussions with the customer and partners. Sensors used in the final product would be selected from the list provided in the Phase I concept design. Output is routed to an on-board processor for threshold alerts and warnings, and offloaded when in communication to a recording and remote monitoring element.     The system would be designed and built at AMIs facilities, and implemented and tested by using it to ship a satellite or other payload from partner facilities in Tucson, AZ to Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, NM.  BENEFIT:There is very high latent demand in government agencies for effective Continuous Custody solutions, ranging from individual agency needs to the challenges of the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) which has a $13 billion budget and operates worldwide. Its procedures established for defense transportation and cargo movement are very complex: the requirements for foreign military sales are described in a 42-page document . The vision of Digital Assurance and Continuous Custody through video, sensors, and data systems is one with a promising future. The present SBIR Phase I effort and the proposed Phase II effort, along with AMIs contract with ORS, will help AMI build and demonstrate a compelling solution around the vision of Continuous Custody.    Demand is likely to be very high in the commercial supply chain and cargo industry as well. Security of high value cargo is a serious problem for the supply chain industry. In the US alone, estimates of cargo theft incidents in 2012 range from 946 to 1197, in shipments ranging from electronics to corn to metal. Current technologies for security in transport are limited to temperature and vibration monitoring and GPS tracking of the vehicle . Continuous Custody would be a valuable tool for this large industry.",

UUVs will be assigned missions to autonomously operate in large areas and may encounter previously unknown obstacles and events which require autonomous re-planning of course of action parameters, such as routes, depths or operational modes, in order to accomplish mission objectives. In light of this uncertainty, re-planning must optimize over the UUV objectives (e.g. minimize counter detection) and account for the resources available, such as how a new COA impacts power usage, while avoiding known and discovered obstacles. In order to address these operational needs, Adaptive Methods and the PSU Applied Research Laboratory propose to develop an Autonomy Framework suitable for use in UUV applications components compatible with that framework that demonstrate situation awareness and provides recommendation for near term COAs based on tactical situation, mission objectives, and platform risk assessments.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:In recent years, a number of technology companies have produced auto-stereoscopic 3D volumetric and light-field displays.    Qualifying their performance has been a subjective exercise as there is no common base for the determination of light-field display metrology.  Rattan Softwares Phase II program will develop practical, affordable, and repeatable evaluation procedures; create a suite of light-field metrology applications to qualify all 3D light-field displays; and produce results that can be used to evaluate all light-field displays regardless of their implementation.  To insure that the measurements are taken and managed in a repeatable manner, a Light-field Metrology Application (LMA) will be developed to characterize and qualify physical light-field performance.  A companion Human Factors Metrology Application (HFMA) will be developed for the psychophysical measurements.   Rattan Softwares proposed solution will play a key role in defining and qualifying the physical and psychophysical performance of light-field displays by defining and automating the light-field display metrology process.  These methodologies and applications will allow researchers and engineers to better understand the physical and human factor properties of their displays, removing much of the subjective nature of light-field display design and development.  BENEFIT:The initial commercial aspect of the Light-field Metrology Application may be limited due to the small number of available 3D light-field displays and related FoLD development projects.  Therefore, the commercialization of this effort will be accomplished by providing both software and services to companies and organization researching and developing light-field displays and related technologies.    The CCA, LMA, and HFMA will be available for licensing to both DoD and commercial entities with the Air Force Research Labs receiving their license under the development of the Phase II effort and according to SBIR guidelines.   Rattan Software FoLD metrology services will include:   CCA, LMA and HFMA operation and training.   Modification of the LMA image processing pipeline to include new filters for novel FoLD architectures and artifacts.   Modification of the LMA to include custom features, reports, and/or capabilities.   Customization of the camera gantry to allow for novel FoLD architectures.      Additional imaging system support.  The DoD has been researching, funding and developing novel light-field displays and technologies for over a decade.  The intended DoD use cases vary from real-time battlefield visualization and planning, security and surveillance, surgical simulation and training to telepresence communication.  While FoLD development is in its infancy, it is important to develop the methods, procedures, and metrics for FoLD metrology so that FoLD performance can be accurately measured, qualified, and reported.    The methodologies and applications presented in the Rattan Software Phase II proposal will allow researchers and engineers to better understand the physical and human factor properties of their displays, removing much of the subjective nature of development.",

The software package aims (i) to bridge the model-based protocol synthesis artifacts with the low-level implementations and the underlying communication and networking backbone while preserving the correctness guarantees, and (ii) to systematically and manageably interface operators/designers to autonomy protocols through a dedicated domain-specific language (DSL). The DSL will provide specification templates, operator tools, and type checking to detect specification errors before synthesis. We propose to explore techniques to overcome issues in scalability and simplifying specifications. We also propose to develop approaches to assist in certification as well as provide validation that the design and implementation are correct.; BENEFIT: We anticipate new approaches to specify and synthesize missions for multi-vehicle scenarios as well as artifacts to ensure the controller implementations are correct. Furthermore, our approach raises the level of abstraction for mission planners.

Following the successful completion of the risk reduction steps and overall CPR2 design, SDC will host a Preliminary Design Review to go over the design and plans for component manufacturing and validation tests. The component manufacturing and testing results will be reviewed at a Manufacturing Readiness Review that will serve as a gate to begin full-scale prototype manufacturing. SDC proposes for the Phase II Base program to culminate with the manufacture of full-scale prototype hardware and testing for operation with the cargo handling system. For the Option program, SDC proposes to focus on outfitting a full-scale prototype for structural testing, designing a structural test plan, and executing the structural tests.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The Level of Impregnation (LOI) of resin in prepregged composite materials is critical to the quality and performance of finished Out-Of-Autoclave (OOA) composites.  The widespread transition to OOA composites is reliant upon consistent material manufacture, which is jeopardized by the lack of a test methodology capable of accurately measuring LOI.  Test techniques currently in practice are inadequate and they cannot be applied inline during the manufacturing process, resulting in out-of-spec material remaining unidentified until the conclusion of production runs and creating unacceptable yield losses.  Air Force acquisition costs and total ownership costs are significantly reduced by the development of an accurate LOI measurement technology.    Nokomis has developed a unique nondestructive method for inline LOI measurements based upon air-coupled acoustic spectroscopy.  This Phase II effort will build upon the success of Phase I results, automating the developed LOI measurement technique, enhancing its accuracy, validating its performance, implementing it in a prototype system, and demonstrating its broad applicability towards material utilized by current Air Force programs, such as the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF).  Nokomis will validate the prototype systems performance against a range of relevant OOA composites through demonstration to the Government and industry stakeholders at the conclusion of the effort.; BENEFIT: Nokomis LOI measurement technology will increase mission assurance for Air Force programs due to enhanced system reliability.  Results will directly aid materials manufacturers by identifying out-of-spec material early in the manufacture process, providing substantial cost and time savings.  By transitioning the LOI measurement system to manufacturers within the Air Force supply chain, Nokomis maximizes the impact that the technology will have on improving Air Force system reliability while reducing acquisition costs and providing total lifetime ownership cost savings.  As Nokomis proposed test methodology can be applied inline, real-time results can be obtained on material LOI consistency over multiple production runs and across the manufactured roll.  Manufacturers can utilize real-time assessments to make immediate adjustments, reducing the quantity of material produced below specification.  This results in overall material, time, and labor cost reduction that facilitates the acquisition and sustainment of Air Force aircraft.  While development efforts will focus on addressing Air Force needs, Nokomis anticipates that the developed technology will provide similar benefits to other Department of Defense agencies that employ similar prepreg composite materials, achieving broad cost reductions across multiple programs. Nokomis will additionally pursue commercial markets such as domestic aerospace firms that utilize prepreg composites in modern airframes.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Zebra Imagings proposed approach for the HVD Phase II will advance the state-of-the-art Urban Photonic Sandtable Display Program (UPSD) light-field display architecture and incorporate the successful results of the AF131-023 HVD Phase I research.   The proof-of-concept HVD Phase II optical stack will consist of a 4K SLM under a planar array of hogel optics.  A design for a 90 hogel optical system will be developed comprising of a tightly arranged 2D array of hogels.  The drive electronics will be integrated into the optical stack and be located in close proximity to the SLM.  The integrated optical stack will represent the base field replaceable unit (FRU).   Optical stacks may be tiled together to create large displays with board-to-board interconnects providing data relay.  The HVD Phase II effort will use off-the-shelf (OTS) GPUs for hogel radiance image computation which will be connected to the driver board over USB or cabled PCIe.    The final program deliverable will be a multi-modulator proof-of-concept light-field display with an active area of ~752mm.  The light-field display will project a perspective correct, full-parallax, 3D light-field for all views within the projection frustum and can be used for a variety of collaboration, training or simulation applications.; BENEFIT: Like most disruptive technologies, the interactive LFD will bring science fiction 3D visualization into reality.  In the future, light-field displays will be in the center of every war room, command center, medical facility, research institute, and entertainment complex; and will provide the ability to collaborate with multidiscipline decision makers and stakeholders, increase their level of understanding and comprehension of complex problems, and allow them to make well informed decisions quicker and with greater confidence.    Target Markets  The 3D imaging and visualization market is forecasted to be a ~$10 billion dollar industry by 2018 with Defense/Security and Healthcare/Medical representing ~63% of the worldwide market.  Industrial, Architecture/ Engineering, Geospatial visualization and Media and Entertainment round out the rest of the market.  While the light-field display developed in this effort will be application agnostic and can be used for a variety of purposes, the initial markets will be for battlespace and medical visualization within government and commercial organizations.  Since battlefield visualization and sports visualization have similar requirements, visualization of sporting events (such as boxing/basketball) will be the first entertainment market addressed.   Medical  The largest commercial market is within medical education, surgical simulation, and medical training.   Zebra Imaging is currently establishing 3-4 working groups of medical experts to independently evaluate and determine market potential for a number of medical applications.  The working groups will determine 3-4 market application and derive requirements for each.  The resulting data will help prioritize and guide the LFD development.   DoD Applications  Applications with the DoD range from medical simulation and training to battlefield visualization.  Zebra Imaging has established relationships with a number of large government contractors including Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Electric Boat that have been instrumental in providing feedback and support in the development of light-field displays.   These companies will continue to advise on the future needs of the military from an integration perspective.",

However, the higher hydrocarbons and sulfur compounds in military fuel create significantly challenging for catalyst based reformer. An innovative non-catalytic thermal partial oxidation (TPOX) reformer has been developed at Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT). The proposed Swiss-roll reformer effectively recuperates the exothermic heat from the thermal partial oxidation reaction and enables super-adiabatic reaction temperature that promotes the reforming reaction without using a catalyst. The organosulfur compounds in the fuel can be converted into hydrogen sulfide that is easily removed by sorbent. With effective heat recirculation, high chemical enthalpy remains in the reformate (high reforming efficiency). The proposed reforming technology is very simple, compact, light weight, and minimized parasitic power consumption, and therefore it is well-suited for the applications such as portable fuel cell power generation.",

        "abstract": "Based on encouraging Phase I feasibility results, we propose developing a novel gene therapy approach to promote guided vascular regeneration in treating extremities after traumatic injury. Our approach is to provide thread-like implants comprised of aligned nanofibrillar collagen scaffolds loaded with Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) vectors (e.g., HGF DNA plasmid, modified mRNA) designed to enhance and guide neovascularization. Such scaffolds are produced using a proprietary process and fabricated to mimic native structure of the blood vessels inner wall, which promotes cell attachment, migration and can be used for delivering transcripts that are translated into therapeutic proteins with sustained biological effect in vivo. This local secretion of the HGF protein attracts endothelial cells (EC) and stimulates EC proliferation, helping to bridge the gap(s) in the vasculature caused by vascular and soft tissue trauma. Phase II will build on this programs earlier accomplishments, with a focus on further development, optimization and testing prototypes of both HGF DNA plasmid and modified mRNA, using these constructs in small animal models for both hind limb ischemia (HLI) and volumetric muscle loss, with the final optimized product defined and tested in a large animal model pilot study for HLI.",

In Phase I, we have established the overall architecture based on a comprehensive survey of clutter effects models. Key elements of the Phase I prototype demonstrated to the Technical Monitor include a generic radar model, radar effect models, clutter models, and an interactive graphical user environment for accepting radar/environmental parameters, and viewing radar screens. In Phase II, SPARC will be further improved and optimized by including the capability for receiving environment and radar control changes from simulators in the high-level architecture (HLA) federation and producing radar displays updated in a timely manner for the users terminal simulators. The Phase II prototype will include a multiuser software prototype for use by the radar trainer as well as trainees. POC will leverage existing relationships with Raytheon to transition the Phase II software prototype that will be ready for transition to military and commercial applications.",

Treatment process verification measurements are required to satisfy EPA regulations for the discharge of wastewater with common water quality assessments including fecal coliform load, biochemical and chemical oxygen demands, and total organic carbon. Using standard analytical techniques to monitor these measures of water quality typically requires a combination of lengthy test durations, technical expertise, sensitive instrumentation, and production of hazardous wastes. Leveraging experience with water analysis, fecal coliform quantification assays, and encapsulated microbe based sensors, Luna Innovations has designed and established feasibility of an automated platform for analysis of each measure in near real-time with minimal operational requirements or expertise.

Black tires and tracks, however, are in direct contrast to the vehicle and surroundings and constitute a large portion of the vehicle profile. To satisfy this need in Phase I Luna developed a durable, color-matching coating that can be simply applied to tires and treads and has been proven to reduce the overall vehicle signature, providing additional protection to the combat soldiers. The coating completely covers the tire and matches the vehicle body paint in color and specular gloss. It is easily applied with standard application methods such as spraying or brushing, and can be used in touch-up applications. The coating conforms to the elastomeric material of tire rubber and has been proven to outlast tires during endurance testing and not interfere with tire performance. The coating can be rapidly applied and cures quickly at ambient conditions to full properties limiting equipment downtime. In Phase II Luna will continue coating development through coating scale-up, environmental testing such as ozone and UV resistance and more extensive thermal aging, packaging trials, and full scale field assessment evaluations.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The primary objective of the Compact Heterogeneous-processor Array for Multi-Parametric Sensing (CHAMPS) project is to determine the utility of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) parallel-processing technology for small spacecraft high-performance computing platforms.  There are several important factors that need to be considered in order to make this determination.  First, we need to determine which technologies are best suited to the types of algorithms that are of interest to the DoD community.     For the Phase II effort, Innoflight proposes to continue building on the research of National Science Foundation (NSF) Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC) and other entities by examining specific candidate algorithms of interest to the DoD.  Second, we need to determine which technologies have power consumption characteristics that are suitable for small spacecraft.  As with mobile devices in the commercial world, small spacecraft typically have very constrained power environments.  Finally, we need to determine which technologies are suitable for use in the ionizing radiation environment of space.  For Phase II, Innoflight proposes to conduct radiation testing of candidate electronics piece parts in order to make this determination.BENEFIT:Innoflights Compact Heterogeneous-processor Array for Multi-Parameter Sensing (CHAMPS) system that is proposed for this SBIR effort will have a very broad range of possible applications for space missions.  Most spacecraft can benefit from improved processing capability as defined by the ratio of performance to power.      DoD space sensing missions can benefit greatly from enhanced high-performance onboard processing.  Increased spacecraft onboard processing leads to enhanced on-orbit decision making capability based on data fusion from onboard sensors.  Making decisions onboard the spacecraft rather than in the ground segment: (a) enables spacecraft autonomy; (b) enhances overall system response time; and (c) reduces the volume of costly space-to-ground communications bandwidth, which is required to achieve mission objectives.     The CHAMPS system will be designed from the ground up to be scalable for missions with varying processing requirements and available power.  This scalability will make CHAMPS useful not only for CubeSats but for larger platforms as well.  Therefore, it should be an interesting processing option for a wide range of DoD, NASA, and commercial spacecraft missions, most of which involve the reduction and fusion of sensor data as one of their key functions.",

In Phase I, detection, quantitation of multiple metals to < 5 ppb, munitions residues to < 7 ppb, and hydrocarbons to 1 ppb, was demonstrated in NIST soil, sediment and field water samples, with use of unique, environmentally-benign sensing electrodes fabricated for the first time. Sensing probes were reduced to 6x12x1 mm. In additional work done specifically for this proposal, detection of all analytes was demonstrated in water containing mud, humic acid, sump wastes.

AMC' is an advanced spectrum sensing/localization and signal discrimination/classification capability that will be further extended to expand the dictionary of SOIs and address weak signal detection in noisy environments. This technology will provide improvements for signal discrimination, advanced spectrum sensing, cyber-protected communication, and interference/congestion avoidance. AMC' is one of the building blocks for the AC4S development that will be realized as an integrated package operating on an embedded cross-layer routing framework using cognitive spectrum allocation and cyber-domain spectrum exploitation technologies developed under the SBIR program. This effort will allow the Air Force to further its technology base, by focusing on meeting 6.3 objectives for Air Force acquisitions and programs of record in concert with achieving resilient C2 in an anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) environment requiring centralized command, distributed control and decentralized execution.",

        "abstract": "Accessing a freight locomotive is one of the most basic, daily tasks performed by a railroad engineer. However, this task has historically been difficult due to several factors such as the first step which may be 19 inches above the top of the rail, weather conditions which may make the steps slippery, and the fact that the ground surrounding the locomotive may be uneven or covered in debris or ballast. Considering these difficulties and the aging workforce that must navigate these hazards, there are ample opportunities for injuries while accessing a locomotive.\n\nGS Engineering was awarded a Phase I SBIR to develop a device which could eliminate his hazard by lifting a worker from the ballast level to the deck of the locomotive. GS Engineering succeded in making such a device, and feedback from industry has been enthusiastic and positive with stakeholders immediately recognizing the value of such a device in making their workplace safer. \n\nGS Engineering is prepared to proceed to Phase II, where detailed design and integration can take place, followed by testing of the system aboard a locomotive in a revenue environment. This technology can then be transitioned to the industry.\n",

        "abstract": "Detection and track processing in Navy AEW Radar is compounded by the rapidly increasing number of wind-farms comprised of multiple turbines. Turbine blades exhibit large reflectivity and occupy portions of the spatial/spectral domain that radar systems have to operate within in order to detect and track mission critical targets (stealthy aircraft, slow-moving drones, numerous surface targets). This mission requires the development of advanced interference-rejection, detection and track processing algorithms. The improved performance of these algorithms comes at a cost - the requirement to better understand all sources of interference. Upstate Scientific proposes to demonstrate an innovative and minimally intrusive Wind-farm Airborne Radar Processor (WARP), to be used for the mitigation of clutter created by the aforementioned wind-farms. The innovation arises in the selection of training data in spatial-temporal filtering, false alarm control, and track processing for the rejection of wind-farm caused clutter and the detection and track processing of targets.",

The requirements of these applications have driven the development of new motion capture technologies to improve accuracy, automation, portability, and cost. There is no single motion capture technology that is well suited to all applications. Optical motion capture systems are extremely accurate, but are costly, time-consuming, sensitive to occlusions, non-portable, and are limited to indoor spaces.  Magnetic motion capture systems provide accurate orientation and position, but have limited range, low sample rates, and are sensitive to magnetic field disturbances. Inertial motion capture systems can overcome some of these limitations, but cannot provide absolute position and are sensitive to magnetic field disturbances. In Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of an innovative approach that fuses ranging sensors with our inertial monitors to continuously estimate orientation and position. Our primary objective of this Phase II project is to use this technology to develop a complete motion capture system that can be used to track human full-body kinematics in a wide variety of research applications that are not well suited to other motion capture technologies.BENEFIT:The commercial Ruby system will be ready for research and development applications requiring biomechanics analysis. This will include both civilian and military applications for which current motion capture technologies are poorly suited due to their limitations. Ruby motion capture will be especially valuable in clinical and military research that requires portability, automation, or accuracy in environments with magnetic field disturbances.",

        "abstract": "Relocating overhead utilities to the subsurface can effectively reduce safety hazards on national highways and other aboveground living spaces. A typical underground space is, however, congested with buried utilities especially in an urban environment. The recordings of those underground utilities are, furthermore, often inaccurate, incomplete, out of date, or even entirely missing as a result of insufficient surveying methodologies and inadequate as-built recording practices. Consequently, the utility construction industry is plagued by aggravating accidents caused by mechanical damages to buried utilities during horizontal directional drilling (HDD) and other construction related activities. In order to address these technical challenges, we have been developing the Robotic Utility Mapping and Installation System (RUMI), a comprehensive robotic solution that improves the safety and productivity of the underground utility construction. The overarching objective of the Phase II effort is to develop RUMI-2, the second robot prototype that realizes the innovative technologies conceptualized in Phase I, and demonstrate its capabilities in a relevant environment. The expected contribution of RUMI-2 to the utility industry is: 1) Accurate robotic 3D utility mapping and digitalization; 2) Precise robotic drill-head tracking with multiple magnetic dipole transceivers; and 3) Effective robotic HDD cross-bore/obstacle avoidance.

However, to foster widespread adoption, tools are needed to reduce the level of effort and cost associated with development and sustainment.

Using a guided authoring and maintenance approach, RACE will allow Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to create and maintain dynamic courses comprising both adaptive Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI) and simulation-based intelligent tutoring.  Further, the RACE approach will capture the data defining the courseware in a vendor-neutral ontology.  This will allow any appropriate delivery engine to ingest the representation and use it to support training.  During Phase II, Sonalysts will build on the solid foundation established during Phase I by building a fully functional Phase II prototype.  The Phase II prototype will be focused on providing real-time assessment and coaching.  Within this prototype, the performance environment will be supplied by the Standard Space Trainer (SST) and the intelligent tutoring components will be supplied by Sonalysts ExpertTrain tutoring engine.BENEFIT:This research will contribute significantly to the development of an adaptive training authoring tool set that will significantly lower the cost of development and sustainment for intelligent tutoring systems and adaptive IMI, facilitate SME involvement in the development and sustainment of adaptive training systems, address both knowledge and skill training requirements, support operations and maintenance training, and support a wide range of domains. In doing so, it will have tremendous appeal to customers throughout the DoD.  Sonalysts has ample evidence that demand for this capability is very high.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Landing gear components manufactured from high strength steel alloys require sacrificial protective coatings to perform safely in service. Cadmium has been the standard coating for such components for decades, but is a known carcinogen and has been targeted for elimination by the USAF.  An experimental Zn-Ni coating was tested in Phase I as a replacement for cadmium. Results showed the Zn-Ni coating had comparable performance to cadmium in the areas of corrosion, fatigue, and hydrogen embrittlement (HE) testing. The main objective of this Phase II.5 project is to demonstrate and validate a full scale prototype LHE alkaline Zn-Ni production plating line to ensure operational robustness of the process, which has performed well in small scale prototype production line tests.  Scale up testing is required to ensure that plating parameters, such as, current density, conformal anode requirements, bath agitation, plating bath stability, and coating uniformity are within specifications for landing gear parts in a full scale production process line.  During the installation of the full scale production line existing equipment located at Hill AFB building 505 will be demolished, removed, relocated and rebuilt to accommodate the 3200 gallon LHE alkaline Zn-Ni production plating line.  An initial site preparation meeting shall be conducted to organize the work flow to minimize down time of the current plating lines and relocation of equipment (i.e. perform major demolition, relocation, and installation work on long weekends when production is not operating Cd and iridite plating lines).  Upon final installation, the Zn-NI plating line will be qualified IAW USAF-DRW-201027456 prior to production plating.  Additionally quality conformance checks shall be performed during initial plating runs of landing gear components.  BENEFIT:  The USAFs landing gear depot repair facility is located in building 507 at Hill AFB, UT.  This facility uses a significant amount of cadmium during electroplating steel components.  Although IVD aluminum has been used extensively as an alternative for limited landing gear components, it has several disadvantages:       IVD is an external process  Internal Diameters (ID), such as Axle IDs, cannot be coated   The IVD chambers are high maintenance equipment   The IVD chambers are size limited  several large landing gear components will not fit physically in the chamber   The IVD chambers must be loaded with like-parts to produce specification results  loading the chamber in this manner is not possible in an overhaul environment.   The IVD coating is susceptible to Hydrogen Re-Embrittlement after exposure to aqueous cleaners.   The lubricity of IVD aluminum is different from Cadmium, with a significantly different torque-tension relationship for threaded joints & fasteners.    For these reasons, IVD aluminum coatings can never fully replace cadmium.  However, the Zn-Ni electroplating process would be a drop-in replacement for the existing cadmium.  Fully implemented, this would free up an entire section of the USAF landing gear facility currently dedicated to IVD operations.    The Zn-Ni process also has far lower environmental impact compared with cadmium, and will enable the industry to cease cadmium usage.   Ultimately, the results of this project will allow landing gear components to be plated with LHE alkaline Zn-Ni and comply with USAF environmental objectives as well as meet all performance requirements of the original designs.",

The solid state units sum up power by combining many Power Amplifier Unit (PAU) modules utilizing various conventional power combining schemes. These efforts have not reached a compatible, and thus not competitive, power output level to rival Klystrons. In addition, the complexity of the various high power solid state transmitter developments to date has further compromised their potential benefits in terms of life-cycle costs and overall reliability.

The framework contains two novel features that are essential for meeting the objective of quantifying in-service damage with respect to fatigue criticality: (a) A family of predictors of damage accumulation were defined and calibrated in which the predictor is based on a weighted average of a function of stress and (b) the procedure developed for predicting quantities of interest meets the technical requirements of simulation governance. The proposed work is to perform fatigue life predictions at the component level; augment the functionality of the computational framework to include 3D surface topography scans of flaws as input, perform uncertainty quantification to provide probabilistic fatigue life predictions based on the models of damage accumulation; and facilitate the integration of the computational framework into the Probabilistic Damage Assessment Framework software.",

Because the heating is muchfaster and more efficient than the currently used process for shipbreaking of submarinehulls and aircraft carrier hulls, the process offers the advantage of as much as a tenfoldincrease in cutting speed, while using 13% less oxygen per length of cut. Additionally, theheating speed nearly eliminates the time for heat to conduct to the adjacent metal, whichsubstantially reduces the emissions from the heating of coatings on the plate. Laboratorytesting showed emission levels at or below that required by environmental regulations.Two additional cutting processes, using the hybrid technology to augment the processoperation have been proposed and will be tested during the proposed Phase II andPhase II Option projects. In one case, initial testing showed that the technology coulddouble the speed of plasma cutting.

The use of solar thermal to generate power at residential level would offer a renewed encouragement to the solar thermal industry. With the ability to provide heat and hot water plus electricity, the solar thermal powered product would fulfill the energy requirements of a home single handedly. Most are familiar with the traditional perspective on the societal impact of a system like the Compact ORC - lower energy demand and reduced greenhouse gas. In addition the CORC positively impacts health and wellbeing by improving indoor air quality and providing affordable access. A number of clinical studies connect improved indoor air quality from efficient systems with a reduction in respiratory and cardiovascular conditions. Combining the health benefits of clean indoor air and improved living conditions, the downstream impact on healthcare cost would be enormous. This project attempts to solve the problem of high cost for renewable energy from solar energy, both PV and solar thermal, at the residential and light commercial level without government incentives. Solar thermal can provide heat and hot water but not electricity. PV can provide electricity but not heat and hot water. The Compact ORC concept can do both with Combined Heat and Power (CHP). Current ORC systems are bulky and inefficient and most importantly high cost. The objective of this research is to combine all of the components of the ORC in one compact, integrated, low cost package. The expander, pump, and generator will all be mounting on a common shaft. The evaporator and condenser heat exchangers will be mounted integral with the ORC reducing inefficiencies and packaging cost. There will be no external piping of components together. The result will be a compact unit that is cost and performance competitive with grid energy.",

Of particular note is removing the requirement that shipboard personal be required to edit configuration files and input data on a command line as both of these activities are error prone and can be confusing.

        "abstract": "Historically, the porosity associated with ceramic matrix composite structures has been viewed as a detriment for many missile applications. The standard practice is to perform several treatment/retreatment processes to reduce the porosity to an acceptable level while increasing the strength of the structure. The processing methods inherent to the production of many composite materials may provide an underexplored benefit with respect to vehicle drag reduction and engine cooling for hypersonic vehicles. Several research studies have been performed using plates with slots and holes. Depending on the mass flux rate of the cooling gas, heat transfer results incorporating staggered arrays of holes have been shown to become potentially worse than those measured without cooling. Thus blowing rate, hole-patterns, and testing conditions all play a part in determining the effectiveness of this thermal management technique. One of the benefits to be quantified is the achieved uniformity of the composite matrix ceramic porosity. The intent is to demonstrate that the closely spaced openings, associated with the composite structure, does not suffer from the same drawbacks experimentally observed with distributed orifices and slotted injection techniques. Or another way to quantify it would be a very dense hole pattern per unit area that releases very small amounts of gas (zero momentum) minimizing the strength or formation of the vortex pairs that typically degrades intended performance.",

TOMO technology enables rapid and cost-effective production of next generation turbine components.  It does so by leveraging the use of lithographic machining combined with traditional CNC tooling, a high-strength ceramic binder system, flexible conformal production tools, and a low-pressure ceramic casting process. The final products (cores and wax patterns) are produced using industry standard, foundry-ready materials and impose no disruption to the turbine supply chain. The technology also has the technical properties needed to produce an engineered integrated core and castings shell system. In Phase I, Mikro produced a number of test coupons and conducted casting trials to demonstrate the feasibility of using the TOMO process for design and production of an integrated core and shell system. In Phase II, Mikro will build upon the results from Phase I to optimize an engineered core and shell solution for an advanced airfoil, including coupon level and blade level casting trials.BENEFIT:Mikros innovative technologies will successfully integrate the casting core and shell into an engineered system which can optimize heat transfer and increase dimensional control of aerospace castings. This would enable an increase in design freedom for finer and more precise features that would dramatically improve airfoil designs (increase efficiency, reduce fuel consumption). The resulting system would also eliminate costly and time intensive production steps from the investment casting process (production cost savings, energy savings and surge capability benefit).",

Specifically, HiReS is capable of isolating and classifying 100s of diverse, possibly overlapping signals for multi-functional situational awareness. The innovations of the proposed HiReS system consist of: (i) robust, computationally efficient signal isolation, acquisition, and classification algorithms friendly to parallel processing hardware architecture; (ii) highly parallelized COTS-based signal processing hardware platforms based on a mix of FPGAs, DSPs, and GPUs; (iii) novel signal processing techniques to detect and classify signals with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs); and (iv) flexible, extensible system design for low-power configuration.

This effort will commence the transition of an enhanced, flexible ADEC capability supporting manual assessments of critical electronics and FPGA programming applications.  Nokomis will develop a Comparative Analysis Toolset (CAT) to increase system agility towards evolving cyber-physical threats that enables custom analyses to be performed by knowledgeable Air Force operators.  ADEC will be into an operational environment within the Air Force, with pilot activities conducted to validate system performance.BENEFIT:Air Force programs rely upon authentic electronic parts and programming applications for critical functionality.  This effort places an enhanced ADEC capability into a critical point in the Air Force supply chain where counterfeit and subverted material can be screened prior to their integration into Air Force systems.  Transition of this technology thereby improves information assurance and reliability of all supported Air Force programs and weapon platforms.  The ADEC technology inserted as a standalone tool in the nondestructive hardware inspection process is expected to provide the Air Force with a higher level of hardware assurance.  ADEC will enable Air Force operators to inspect and detect compromised components throughout the entire acquisition life cycle.  By providing reliable screening of counterfeit and intentionally modified electronics, ADEC is expected to provide improved reliability of information assurance systems and potential cost savings in the maintenance and sustainment phase.  The ADEC technology will further offer a new technical mitigation avenue for program risks related to both counterfeit electronic components and embedded malicious FPGA programming.  Beyond transition to the Air Force, the developed capability can be transitioned to the Navy, Army, and other agencies to provide similar benefit across critical DoD systems.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Sophisticated methods for infiltrating and compromising computer systems have continuously demonstrated their ability to defeat current operating system and network defenses. Computing assets such as the BIOS, hardware device drivers, and COTS hardware from non-trusted supply chains have been proven to include malware and/or Trojan horse applications. These subversive software programs provide attackers with gaping holes from which they can pirate software, exfiltrate data, execute processes, alter critical information, or control network end-nodes. The biggest problem with many of these attacks is that they reside in areas of the computer system which are not easily mitigated with software-only methodologies.   In response to this needs. Edaptive Computing, Inc. is enhancing already advanced techniques for providing comprehensive protection against such threats. The TrEMBlE solution can monitor peripherals, hard drive and memory for anomalies that operate below the level visible to standard virus scanners.  These protections can be added with relative ease to any standard desktop or server.  As a result, the TrEMBlE solution will serve as an unassailable defense for mission critical communication systems and any related computing resources that are part of the network.BENEFIT:As advanced communication systems become more deeply entrenched in the various branches of the military, it is even more important that its security be front-and-center.  These systems can be considered to consist not just of radios that form the links, but also the routers and servers that interact with and store the data in question.  They will continue to be used for a wide variety of missions ranging from battlefield ISR all the way to humanitarian mission support. What is needed is a reliable way to identify possible vulnerabilities and address them conclusively.  This is where the TrEMBlE solution fits into the overall picture.         The growing trend to move malware to lower levels is decreasing the level of trust in commodity machines. Our solution to this problem not only addresses specific Air Force needs, but it will provide a significant foundation for improving the trustworthiness of mission-critical systems across todays military and critical information markets. As a result, TrEMBlE will be beneficial to the DoD, Homeland Security, NASA and other agencies with common requirements. Importantly, our proposed solution can be transitioned effectively to the commercial sector by providing a method to improve the trust of computational resources to a variety of market sectors such as financial, healthcare, commercial aviation and communications.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:While being backward compatible with Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) Operation Systems (OS) and applications, system-level Virtual Machine (VM) only provides a coarse level for current generic compute cloud computation. As a result, current cloud requires a full-blown machine (system) level virtualization in each VM instance. However, many cloud computing requires finer grained resource allocation and sharing than at the system level. In this proposal, IAI proposes to implement a secure lightweight cloud computing environment (SLICE) to provide a much finer grained isolation and abstraction for cloud computing. First, SLICE will provide the process-level VMs which are much lighter than the traditional system-level VMs. Second, SLICE will enforce the security of VM by providing isolated execution. Third, SLICE will provide much finer grained resource allocation and sharing among distributed cloud nodes. In addition, SLICE enables the in-memory Map/Reduce processing and the native execution of cloud computing applications. In Phase I, IAI developed a preliminary SLICE prototype and evaluate representative cloud computing applications in SLICE. The evaluation results showed that a SLICE-based cloud can result in significant savings compared to current established cloud computing framework.BENEFIT:The potential commercial customers are sensitive data owners who want to adapt to the cloud technology but are frustrated by the flexibility, performance, security and privacy considerations. IAIs proposed technology can also be applied to other cloud-based distributed resource managements. In addition to our proposed technology, IAI has completed or is currently developing a range of related cloud-based tools. Integration of our proposed technology with IAIs current cloud-based tools broadens our product base and application to potential markets. End users of SLICE include cloud provider (e.g. Amazon), commercial organizations (e.g. Citibank, United Healcare) that use distributed applications to analyze their big data or to process streams. IAI has contacts within each of these organizations and will actively engage them during the program to generate interest in SLICE.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The U.S. Air Force (USAF) typically requires restoration of corrosion affected aircraft components in hard to access areas. These aircraft structure and components are typically manufactured from aluminum substrates, as well as other alloys like magnesium, titanium, and low alloy, PH and Cres steels.  Current repair techniques will inspect, clean, and then apply Corrosion Preventative Compounds to prevent/reduce additional corrosion, but limited access and/or complex part geometries hinder dimensional restoration in some applications.  Additionally, these traditional repair techniques may utilize and/or produce hazardous materials and waste.  Consequently, ES3 will develop a new cold spray repair technique designed to be portable, MIL-Spec approved, and provide controlled dimensional restoration using an environmentally-friendly, corrosion resistant coating application for limited access areas.    In Phase II, ES3 will conduct testing identified during the Phase I effort to accomplish successful development and validation required for future implementation of the low-/mid- pressure (up to 250 psi) cold spray repair applications for typical 7XXX, 6XXX and 2XXX series aluminum and magnesium substrates, conduct a Demonstration/Validation on aircraft components, and draft a cold spray application specification in USAF format.  Subject cold spray development will focus on portable repair techniques that can be used at depot and field level activities.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The objective of this effort is to investigate designs and possible options for a Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) flexible satellite for GPS to enhance PNT capabilities at a low cost.  A desired feature to help overcome GPS coverage issues due to terrain, spoofing, jamming and interference is to broadcast military signals at higher power than the civilian signals.  Under the Phase I SBIR effort we demonstrated a flexible digital signal modulation approach, termed FlexMod, which modulates large numbers of codes on a single carrier with flexible relative power levels while maintaining a constant envelope modulation output.      Under Phase II, we shall implement a FlexMod firmware module and assemble a test set including a prototype Digital Waveform Generator (DWG), GPS constellation simulator and High Power Amplifiers (HPA) for testing with civil and military GPS receivers.  This will be used to demonstrate the flex power performance of the enhanced FlexMod modulation method and evaluate the expected M-code power level that FlexMod could deliver with state of the art HPA technology to a GPS receiver through an earth coverage antenna in GPS III.BENEFIT:When combined with digital waveform generation and state of the art L-band high power amplifiers the FlexMod technology will allow for broadcast of multiple GPS codes (civil and legacy) and a high power M-code signal through a single antenna.  This would allow for delivery of NavWar high power signals under A2/AD conditions without requiring a separate spot beam on future GPS III satellites. Due to the cost effectiveness of this solution and the significant improvements this capability would provide, it is anticipated that significant interest will be garnered for this technology for future GPS III satellites and payloads.",

Based on Phase I efforts, it was concluded that the DC power consumption of the MAST SSPA is almost half compared with the conventional SSPA with a constant envelope multiplexing technique (i.e. 5-code CASM: coherent adaptive subcarrier modulation), and the average power added efficiency (PAE) of the MAST SSPA is 1.3 times higher than that of the digital pre-distortion (DPD) SSPA for 5.4 dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) GPS signal.BENEFIT:Power amplifiers are an integral part of all satellite communications, cellular phones, base stations, and radio systems.  They represent one of the most expensive component sub-assemblies in modern wireless infrastructure equipment: their cost, physical size, and performance in terms of linearity, efficiency, and output power are all important drivers in system design.  As transmitted waveforms become more complex (with higher peak-to-average ratios and higher signal bandwidths), new and innovative techniques and technologies will be needed to meet the challenges associated with these waveforms. The MAST solution is well suited for providing the necessary technology to meet these requirements by adaptively tracking the supply, which ensures the amplifier is running optimally, reducing the size of the power supply.",

Minimizing HPA cost is a primary design parameter.   LST has significant experience with flight HPAs and has 100 linearizers and HPAs in orbit.  LTI/LST has demonstrated its ability to provide a UHF space PA with the highest PAE reported in the literature.  LTI/LSTs work at UHF has shown that the key factors to achieving high efficiency are  device selection and circuit topology.  Its UHF PA required a higher linearity than specified for GPS.  However, GPS still needs some linearity.  Even small improvements in space can be important.  LTI/LST will use its expertise in linearization to give its HPA design a PAE advantage.  It has designed an L-band HPA meeting power and PAE goals using U.S. made Gallium Nitride (GaN) devices.  In Phase I, LTI/LST exploited its GaN HPA experience to produce a demonstration HPA exceeding design goals.  LTI/LST will use its knowledge of space hardware to insure a qualifiable design.  In Phase II, LTI/LST will design and fabricate a space-qualified HPA.    BENEFIT:Highly efficient high power amplifiers (HPAs) are needed for the transmission from satellites of GPS signals at L-Band.  Present transmissions require relatively low linearity (AM/PM < 2.5 dB/deg.) but a high power (400 watts).

Linearizer Technology, Inc. with its space hardware organization Linear Space Technology, LLC (LTI/LST) will use linearization to gain an advantage in power added efficiency (PAE) over non-linearized HPAs.  Linearization will also allow the proposed HPA to function efficiently with new modulation formats under consideration that will require higher linearity.  LTI/LST will use its relatively small size and the 300 plus years of spacecraft manufacturing experience of its staff to control costs.

The corrosion of metallic structures is an industry- and government-wide maintenance problem that has been rapidly spreading due to the increased amount of infrastructure and military assets that are aging.  The annual cost of corrosion in aircraft alone is 2.2 billion dollars.

Global Technology Connection, Inc.

The development of the universal power converter during the Phase II program will focus on three key areas: (1) electronics and hardware design, (2) control and firmware design, and (3) thermal management design. The electronics and hardware design will be optimized for high efficiency, high power density and 2-man portable weight with universal power conversion at a wide range of input and output voltages. The advanced digital controls and the real-time noninvasive prognostic / diagnostic capability for the power electronics and attached electrical machines will be implemented in a microcontroller, field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or a digital signal processing (DSP) system based upon the computational, memory and switching frequency requirements of the power converter. The advanced thermal management will combine the basic fluid and thermal dynamics of convection cooling with thermal energy harvesting capability of Thermo-Electric Generators (TEG).",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:This technology development effort focuses on introducing a prototype 2.4 meter aperture, deployable Satellite Communication (SATCOM) ground station.   Over the past three years, a pathfinder GATR tracking ground station was fabricated and tested by tracking different satellites in low Earth orbit at multiple frequency bands (S, X, Ka).  This Phase II SBIR effort focuses on maturing the tracker structure to meet the deployment dynamics and environmental rigors encountered in a military environment. All of the track stand hardware to include the base mount, the azimuth and elevation motors, and the outrigger arms will be re-designed to meet design objectives.  The technical data package required for manufacturing will be generated in this program. This contract will also mature the components necessary for uplink and downlink at a single operating band. Feed and feedmounts will be designed, tested, and built to accommodate these uplink and downlink frequencies.  An optimized tracking algorithm for the ground station will be designed, ensuring the control system provides accurate pointing of the inflatable antenna.  The tracking software interface will allow users to task the antenna for tracking.  Packaging will be optimized for human factors (weight, dimensions, center of mass) and environmental (I.e., temperature, shock, and vibration) considerations.BENEFIT:The Cubesat community has been focusing on developing smaller and cheaper satellites and less costly launch options.  However, as the number of communications and data gathering satellites in low and medium earth orbit increases, the need for satellite tracking ground terminals is increasing as well.  Over the next 5 years, the need to track and downlink payload data from LEO/MEO satellites will far outstrip the capabilities of current ground stations.  Most satellite tracking ground stations are in fixed locations on concrete pads, and are not transportable.  Those satellite tracking ground stations that are transportable are large, bulky, trailer-mounted, and therefore expensive to transport.   The revolutionary GATR deployable 2.4 meter tracking antenna can be shipped anywhere in the world via standard mail options (i.e., FEDEX) or as checkable baggage on commercial airlines.  The GATR tracking antenna can be further transported by SUV to remote locations and be operational within an hour.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:A radiation hardened via-configurable mixed signal array (RHVCA-1) is proposed to provide a rapid prototyping mixed signal platform for implementing radiation hardened and high performance custom analog system designs. In phase I the feasibility of implementing RHVCAs was investigated.  In the initial Phase II radiation hardened by design (RHBD) features were designed, fabricated and verified.  Total ionizing dose (TID) teting was performed on a RHBD VCA and on a comparable Triad commercial VCA to determine the radiation hardness.  Phase II results indicate the RHVCA concept is practically feasible and would provide and excellent means of developing prototype and production custom analog solutions for aerospace and defense applications. This Phase II effort will focus on the commercialization of RHBD VCA technology.  The two key objectives in phase II will be:   1. Development and verification of a RHVCA-1 RHBD VCA platform test device on IBMs CMOS7RF (0.18 CMOS) process containing analog and digital building blocks necessary to implement the RHVCAs.   2. Development and fabrication of mixed signal ASICs for commercialization using the RHVCA-1 VCA platform.    In the previous phase I and phase II STTR efforts, Triad worked with the University of Tennessee to research, design, prototype and test devices to further this research.  No part of this effort will be done by the University of Tennessee.  This proposal is submitted as an SBIR in accordance with SBIR Policy Directive, paragraph 4(b)(1)(i) exception.  BENEFIT:The advantages of VCA technology over full custom design are many.  They include the following primary advantages:  1. Rapid design and prototyping.  2. Fast and simple design changes   3. Significant reductions in size, weight, and power (SWAP).  4. Ease of intellectual property (IP) re-use.  5. Enhanced Reliability by integration of analog functions into one RHVCA on a commercially proven semiconductor process.  6. Mitigation of diminished manufacturing sources (DMS) issues. Once developed, a platform life cycle is expected to extend through the entire fabrication process life. Platforms will remain viable and in use indefinitely.  7. Lower total cost of ownership by using pre-developed and pre-tested VCAA platforms. Total cost savings per component are expected to be more than 50% leading to expansion of the product line offerings as well as funding the various qualifications required for space and national security applications.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Toyon proposes to develop a power-aware high-integrity navigation system for size, weight, and power constrained platforms, which provides improved electronic protection against broadband and narrowband jammers, as well as repeaters, spoofers, and multipath using a small-aperture antenna. Power-saving design changes are proposed to all aspects of the system, including the radio-frequency (RF) front-end, analog-to-digital conversion (ADC), anti-jam (AJ) GPS processing, correlation processing, and navigation processing. All changes are compatible with the Selective Availability Anti-Spoof Module (SAASM) and future Common GPS Module (CGM) processing. The navigation performance of the system is enhanced through new electronic support capabilities that include direction finding (DF), attitude determination, and jammer geolocalization. Anti-jam processing requirements are reduced by as much a 95%, depending on the specific circumstances. The highly integrated system design provides an ultra-tightly coupled (UTC) GPS/IMU architecture with the IMU and antenna having a common center-of-mass, thereby reducing lever-arm errors, and carrier-phase distortions are minimized through novel processing techniques. In addition, variable dynamic range algorithms reduce power consumption by matching the system dynamic range to the jammer signal power, thereby making the proposed Power-Aware Miniature Attitude-determining Anti-jam GPS/INS (MAAGI) system highly attractive for small platforms with severe size, weight and power (SWAP) constrains.BENEFIT:The Power-Aware Miniature Attitude-determining Anti-jam GPS/INS (MAAGI) system has the potential to revolutionize anti-jam GPS systems for C-SWAP-constrained systems in both civilian and military applications. The scalable design will permit the same architecture to serve diverse classes of platforms, thereby increasing the system utility and sales, and therefore reducing its cost. Furthermore, ultra-tightly coupled (UTC) GPS/INS systems have the ability to improve the anti-jam GPS performance of platforms whether or not they are capable of supporting large antenna arrays or have severe cost and power constraints.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Mayflower proposes an accurate and secure GPS time-aiding service for military receivers in challenged RF environments, namely the Leveraging Waveforms for an Accurate and Secure Time Transfer to Networked GPS Receivers (WATTR) to meet the objectives stated in the solicitation.  The Mayflower WATTR solution is a waveform agnostic secure precise time aiding service technology specifically designed for use in challenging RF environments (intentional / unintentional jamming and spoofing) suitable for deployment in a wide range of military as well as commercial applications. The Mayflower WATTR technology makes use of the features in the Data Link and Application layers of a communication network and hence is portable across a multitude of tactical and commercial waveforms. We have implemented and demonstrated some of the functional components of WATTR solution in the Mayflower Tactical MANET Testbed (TMT) and MEADOWS Software Defined Radio (SDR). In the proposed Phase II SBIR program, the Mayflower team will augment and enrich the WATTR technology, test and demonstrate it using both Mayflower TMT and WATTR Prototype System. We will ensure its commercialization in Phase II by working closely with proposed prime contractors, namely Harris and Thales.BENEFIT:Several commercial waveforms require a source of accurate time.  For instance, LTE requires accurate time to allow base stations in adjacent cells to sufficiently time-synchronized to perform coordinated beamforming to a set of mobile users; note that coordinated beamforming yields near-optimal downlink transmission rates.  Presently, LTE base stations can rely on co-located GPS receivers to obtain accurate time.  Given the presence of a GPS jammer (or a spoofer which a C/A code GPS receiver is particularly vulnerable to), these base station would fail to acquire accurate time, resulting in degraded quality or loss of service altogether. The proposed WATTR technology is applicable to these commercial waveforms in that it would provide an alternate source of accurate time to the associated communication infrastructure.  For example, in the case of LTE, a base station can maintain accurate time over long periods of GPS denial by employing co-located Chip Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC). We note here that many safety critical applications (e.g., police, firefighters, homeland security) depend upon the commercial wireless communication infrastructure in addition to general public (stock market, home security, transportation, weather alerts, etc.) and hence communication infrastructure has tremendous impact on the public safety and national economy.       The U.S Army (PD-PNT) is also considering using commercial smart phone technology (4G LTE) for Assured PNT (APNT) for situation awareness using the rich graphical user interface (GUI) of the smart phones and custom apps developed specifically for the military to interface with military GPS receivers. This approach attempts to address the warfighters expressed concerns of poor graphical user interface of the currently deployed DAGR receivers.  If this Army APNT approach moves beyond the R&D phase, the need for secure time transfer using commercial LTE waveform can also be addressed by the Mayflower WATTR technology.",

Given their existing limitations and shortfalls, it is unlikely that todays technologies and display metaphors will scale to accommodate the increased demands of multi-vehicle and mission management in the future. Building on research results and lessons learned, we propose a novel approach and interface (CAMI: Contextual Anomaly Management Interface) for anomaly management to support effective unmanned systems supervision.

The proposed research deals with production of oxygen for use by air independent solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) in unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs). Oxygen is produced via thermal decomposition of an aqueous lithium chlorate solution using waste heat from the SOFC. Efforts include demonstration of oxygen production at a 2 kW scale, demonstration of oxygen production with decomposition heat delivered via a closed circulating cathode gas loop, and demonstration of the oxygen system integrated with a 2 kW scale SOFC where SOFC waste heat supports oxygen production for use by the SOFC. An analytical effort will evaluate use of non-cryogenic hydrogen generation technologies to fuel an SOFC integrated with the oxygen generator. The aqueous lithium chlorate solution is a non-combustible, non-volatile room temperature liquid with excellent oxygen storage metrics. These characteristics provide enhanced safety, ease of handling, and rapid refueling compared to cryogenic liquid oxygen for UUV applications. The oxygen source combined with efficient JP-10 fueled SOFC systems can increase energy density from the 150 W-hr/kg typical of rechargeable batteries to 300 to 500 W-hr/kg. Higher energy density improves UUV mission endurance, enhancing mission capability for both military and commercial applications.",

        "abstract": "The Navy has for some time been moving toward computer-based e-learning systems to address both of these needs. E-learning systems minimize the need for lengthy and expensive chalk-n-talk training - enabling a wide range of skills and refresher training as needed. Todays computer based training (CBT) systems typically require trainees to proceed through a lengthy sequence of formal (usually written) instruction, exercise participation, and computer-based testing and feedback. The rigidness and rote nature of these e-learning systems diminish their training value  and indicate the desirability of an adaptive training approach.The Adaptive Gaming Environment for Submarines (AGE-S) addresses the need for adaptive training in the following ways: (1) AGE-S provides adaptive navigation through a course - driven by a statistical approach in which the difficulty of each question (or trial) is calibrated within a population, such that the performance of the trainee measured in-situ is compared to a population score to make a navigation decision, (2) AGE-S also addresses adaptive feedback timing (immediate vs. deferred), adaptive feedback type (process information vs. the correct answer), and adaptive modality (e.g. written, video, haptic).",

        "abstract": "Envisioned Navy applications ranging from shore-based microgrids to directed energy weapons pose energy storage performance, cost, and scalability requirements that far exceed the capabilities of todays technologies. Electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC) can meet most power demands ($/kW and kW/L) but cannot be used where high energy density is also required. As such, there is a need for a new electrochemical technology that can meet both high-energy and high-power demands using cost-effective materials. To address this need, ADA Technologies, Inc. (ADA) proposes to partner with PneumatiCoat Technologies, a leader in scalable atomic layer deposition (ALD) coatings, to develop an EDLC with high surface area nanocomposite electrodes modified with high dielectric constant metal oxide coatings. The resulting device will be readily scalable, consist of low-cost components, and be effective for tens of thousands of cycles across a wide operational temperature range.",

        "abstract": "Concentrator PV systems using highly efficient multijunction photovoltaic cells hold out the promise of very low-cost solar electricity generation, but their adoption has been hamstrung by the requirement for bulky mechanical trackers that add cost, diminish land use, increase maintenance, and exclude roof-top installations. The Stationary Wide-Angle Concentrator (SWAC) PV system will provides the missing link that is required for wide-scale adoption of concentrator systems. It achieves high solar concentration (500x) over a wide range of incident angles in a flat stationary panel that needs no mechanical tracking or control system.\nThe design, enabled by microscale manufacturing, uses a novel self-tracking optical system in which a thermally-reactive fluidic system automatically and internally adjusts the concentrator to maintain peak concentration without mechanical movement of the module. No additional control electronics or system maintenance is required. Such self-tracking concentrators can significantly increase the power output of solar power modules by allowing them to use high-efficiency photovoltaic cells and concentrating optics without incurring the additional costs of precision trackers and specialized mounting hardware. The concentrator itself is designed to be extremely low-cost due to low material usage, wide manufacturing tolerances, and compatibility with high-speed manufacturing. This design can potentially disrupt the PV industry by allowing high efficiency concentrator panels to outperform conventional silicon in environments with high direct solar resource.\n",

Stroke survivors often have considerable ankle impairments, including spasticity, contracture, muscle weakness and motor impairment, contributing directly to their impaired balance and asymmetrical slow locomotion. Early intensive rehabilitation post-stroke is critical in promoting neuroplasticity, which occurs immediately after stroke, and improving functional outcomes. The wearable ankle rehabilitation robot closely interacts with the user and provides (1) closely guided motor relearning based on progressive augmented feedback with simplified tasks, and sensitive detection of re-emerging motor output signals; (2) intensive combined passive stretching and active task-related mobility training with progressive postures of in-bed, sitting, standing, and locomotion, covering hospital wards, rehabilitation clinics, and patients home settings; and (3) quantitative assessment of improvements using neuromechanical and clinical outcome measurements.",
