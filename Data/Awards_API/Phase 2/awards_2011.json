        "abstract": "Micro Air Vehicles (MAV) have emerged as a critical need for the U.S. Air Force. MAVs are envisioned to conduct a variety of indoor and outdoor reconnaissance missions and must be highly mobile and man-portable. Furthermore, many of the envisioned missions for MAVs require significant endurance. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries are not capable of providing sufficient energy while remaining within the highly constrained mass and volume budgets for MAVs. As a result, significant advancements in lithium ion battery technologies (e.g., increased energy and power density) are required to enable MAVs to execute their intended missions. To address this need, ADA Technologies, Inc., proposes to continue advancements made in Phase I to develop advanced nanocomposite electrodes for lithium-ion batteries. When combined with a suitable ionic liquid electrolyte, the proposed technology will provide substantially greater energy and power density, cycle life and safety as compared to state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries. The proposed program will establish electrode synthesis protocols, relevant-scale electrode processes and ultimately design and produce full-scale prototype lithium-ion cells for integration into a target test-bed platform.",

        "abstract": "The current practice of training canines for explosives detection utilizing actual explosives requires qualified personnel that are trained to handle\nexplosive materials making the training both manpower-intensive and costly. The expense is further exacerbated by the need to handle and dispose of\nthe explosive material according to local, state, and federal explosives regulations. Finally, the nature of explosives creates a risk of injury to the canine\nand its handler. This is especially problematic for the highly sensitive peroxide-based improvised explosives such as hexamethylene triperoxide diamine\n(HMTD). These peroxides are unstable compounds that are sensitive to shock, friction, and heat. HMTD even reacts with most common metals in a\nprocess that can lead to detonation. Clearly, working with these explosives in pure form is extremely risky. To solve this problem the proposed research\nwill utilize porous ceramic materials in which HMTD is housed in a fashion that will inhibit or prevent explosive hazards while ensuring the\nmaintenance of a normal vapor pressure of HMTD without any confounding extraneous volatile materials that could interfere with canine training.",

Handheld instruments must be sensitive, be able to detect a wide\nvariety of target compounds in a matter of seconds, reliably discriminate between innocuous and harmful compounds, and be relatively inexpensive. A\ntechnology with great promise for addressing all of these requirements is miniature ion trap mass spectrometry (MIT-MS).

One of the biggest factors preventing the development of\ntruly low-cost and portable MIT-MS is the cost, size, mass, and power requirements of the high vacuum system required for its operation.

The objective of this research program is to continue the development and testing of a high-rate, high-shock, miniature data recorder.  The completed DSR data record will include 4 internal analog channels for measuring acceleration, weapon-case strain, or pressure and 8 external input digital channels for other user defined measurements.  High-sampling rates will allow for high- frequency content measurements (common in pyro-events) and novel shock isolation techniques to be employed to protect the data recorder from shock induced failures.  We propose to manufacture and support testing to validate, in realistic high-velocity penetration and pyro-shock environments, the capabilities of the DSR data recorder.

Only recently, however, has sufficient technology been developed to even begin exploring human applications. A key breakthrough was the discovery of the stem cell as a significant element for regeneration. Previous work has suggested that stem cells can be targeted and captured in a synthetic microfluidic system that mimics the molecular cell-adhesion mechanisms used by the body for physiological trafficking in the microcirculation. The scope of this project is to initiate a plan to translate this discovery towards the development of a microfluidic cell capture device (the CellSelect System) that is capable of capturing sufficient numbers of stem cells for practical regenerative biomedical applications. The objectives of this project are to further advance the optimization efforts that were initiated during Phase I of the research product as well as complete the design, development and pre-clinical testing of the initial prototypes that will be introduced to the market during Phase III. Additionally, during the course of the Phase II research, we will demonstrate that the stem cells captured using this technology possess superior engrafting capabilities, thus making them ideal candidates for use in regenerative medicine.",

This consolidation comes at a price, however: the interactions between the various software applications (apps) is hard to predict. The underlying operating system provides security mechanisms to isolate apps and control communication between them, but these mechanisms must be used correctly.    Tools currently exist to analyze apps in isolation to search for behaviors that might lead to violations of an expected security policy. However, none of these tools currently analyze collections of apps to determine how they interact in a deployed system.    Phase I of this effort has demonstrated that such inter-app behavior analysis is indeed feasible through the development of a simple prototype of a tool set we call FUSE. Our Phase II work will consist of maturing the FUSE prototype, building a more sophisticated user interface, and exploring new research directions to improve the scope and precision of the analysis.",

        "abstract": "In the defense industry today, high level SysML system models are used by engineers beginning early in the design process to functionally decompose the system being designed and to flow down requirements to sub-systems and components. Despite their usefulness, these system models are by and large descriptive models and not analytical (executable) models. In contrast, domain level engineers (structural engineers, software engineers, aerodynamicists, manufacturing engineers, cost analysts, etc.) routinely use a wide variety of sophisticated engineering analysis tools to analyze and design the subsystems and components that define the system. Unfortunately, these analysis tools are disconnected from the system model, and can&quot;t easily be used to predict performance or make important system level trade-offs. In this project, an integrated toolset will be developed that bridges the gap between systems modeling languages such SysML and commonly used engineering analysis tools. This will enable the performance of architectural, performance, manufacturability, cost, and risk trade-off studies very early in the design process where impacts on lifecycle costs are the greatest. It will also allow the design team to rapidly respond to inevitable changes in requirements and give them the ability to perform continuous analysis, simulation, and trade-studies throughout the design process.",

Phase II provides an end-to-end capability that will be validated in a realistic Field Demonstration and can be rapidly transitioned.

        "abstract": "Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) functions as virtual tutors that adapt to student responses. Such ITSs, however, do not yield student learning improvements equivalent to students tutored by human instructors. Ascertaining Un-Reported Affect (AURA) is a closed-loop, platform-independent&quot;front-end&quot;for informing ITSs with near real-time inferences of student engagement and affect during learning sessions to further improve student learning and minimize student frustration. AURA leverages low-cost, non-invasive sensors to monitor students without disrupting their learning experience. Such an approach enables the large-scale deployment of AURA to students using ITSs. The key innovation in AURA is the ability to serve as a modular component that informs an ITS of changes in a student&quot;s emotional or physical state that can affect the learning process by leveraging audio, video, and user interface feedback.  During AURA Phase 2 we will implement an engineering prototype composed of established signal processing algorithms selected during Phase 1. We will evaluate the prototype using operational data collected from student&quot;s interacting with a computer tutorial. AURA leverages 21st Century Technologies expertise developing systems for the military in speech and audio processing,  image processing, and creating machine learning algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Future high-performance integrated circuits in DoD satellite systems will require silicon-on-insulator (SOI) and non-planar nano-technology devices, such as MultiGate Field Effect Transistors (MuGFETs) or FinFETs, which can decrease pattern area of logic circuits below 50% of the conventional planar technologies. However, the single-event-effect (SEE) response of non-planar devices and circuits is unknown. To enable characterization and mitigation of SEEs in such technologies, CFDRC, in collaboration with Vanderbilt University (VU) and SEMATECH, is developing the following innovations: (a) First ever characterization, by modeling and experiments, of SEEs in nano-scale SOI and non-planar devices and circuits, including floating body effects and isolation-volumes related charge collection mechanisms; (b) New semiconductor physics models for the nano-technologies: microscopic charge generation in insulators, electron/hole transport in various insulators and insulator-silicon interfaces, implemented in CFDRC&quot;s NanoTCAD 3D/mixed-mode simulator; and (c) Simulation-supported design and validation of mitigation techniques for SEEs. In Phase I, representative advanced FinFET and SOI devices and circuits were successfully used for&quot;proof-of-concept&quot;modeling, validated with experimental data, and characterized for SEEs by means of 3D/mixed-mode simulations. In Phase II, we will perform computational and experimental studies to quantify the floating body and isolation volume related mechanisms, and implement improved models in the NanoTCAD simulator. SEE mitigation methods will be explored, verified, and demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "High Power Photodiodes (HPPD) are of significant interest to the military as they are critical components in photonic distribution systems. The key to developing a high performance HPPD is improving its linearity (OIP3&gt;50dBm), RF output power (~5W) and thermal performance while simultaneously maintaining a sufficiently wide bandwidth (~20GHz). These stringent performance criteria require innovations on the materials front as well as device architecture.   In Phase I, we showed orders of magnitude improvement in thermal performance can be obtained by introducing a high thermal conductivity material layer close to the absorber. Further, we explored high linearity III-V epitaxial designs to determine the optimal design that would meet the program metrics. In Phase II, we propose the development of an edge illuminated HPPD that is based on bonding two dissimilar materials a high linearity III-V epitaxially grown&quot;absorbing&quot;wafer to a high thermal performance, Si based,&quot;waveguiding&quot;wafer. The goal is to combine the benefits that III-V affords in band engineering with the superior thermal performance afforded by Si based substrates.

        "abstract": "Current offensive solutions to neutralize chem/bio agent facilities rely on blast and/or short-burst high-temperature neutralization but have the potential to produce severe collateral damage via agent release.  Our team proposes the Dispersed Energetics Coupled for Optimized Neutralization (DECON) Concept, an alternative concept to perform bulk neutralization of agents.  The DECON concept can be summarized as the generation and dispersal of a mass of controlled burning, but not flaming, material dispersed throughout the target.  While conventional weapons dump energy into the entire target very quickly, our concept would distribute energy generating material throughout the target that would adhere to agent storage containers.  By coupling directly to containers, the energy transferred to the container is maximized.  As the materials will burn at temperatures below container melting points and over the order of minutes, long term heating and neutralization of the bulk agent may be realized.  The Phase II effort will develop the DECON Concept from feasibility to a militarily and commercially viable system.  Our team will perform modeling and experimentation on energy transfer into agent stimulants, characterize long term neutralization properties of agents and stimulants, and execute the necessary experiments and trade studies to optimize the DECON Concept and prepare for a rapid transition into a Phase III program.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This document presents Optical Sciences Corporation&#039;s Phase II SBIR proposal for the development, fabrication, and demonstration of an infrared solar-lunar spectral simulator (SOLUSS) system using supercontinuum lasers as sources for space sensor exclusion testing.  The all-optical fiber supercontinuum laser system will be capable of efficiently generating the high solar lunar radiance over a broadband spectrum from the midwave to the longwave infrared.  The fiber optic design is the most compatible light delivery mechanism for cryogenic vacuum applications allowing precise control over stray light illumination and remote source operation minimizing environmental heating.  The broadband illumination system projection optics will present the accurate solar and lunar angular extent, while providing a uniformly illuminated work area for the sensor under test.  OSC&quot;s approach also incorporates hyperspectral modulation of the high flux output spectrum to support modeling the natural solar and lunar spectrums as well as more complex spectral signatures for Earth albedo, planets, stars, and various atmospheric transmission profiles.  BENEFIT:  The emerging technology of supercontinuum lasers will be utilized as a stable and programmable infrared spectral illumination source.  The Phase II research and development will result in a product establishing a new application for these emerging technologies.  The solar lunar spectral simulator (SOLUSS) system will significantly improve the state-of-the-art in high radiance infrared testing in space sensor characterization and hardware-in-the-loop testing within typical laboratory and cryogenic-vacuum environments.  The SOLUSS product, as well as the subsystem components, is marketable to the Department of Defense, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Department of Energy, the defense and aerospace industry, and possible biomedical applications.  These applications include infrared counter-measures; tunable infrared sources for spectroscopy and chemical detection; precision radiometric infrared illumination; active remote and security motion sensing; replace solar simulator systems using xeon arc-lamps; therapeutic, biological, and surgical programmable infrared illuminators; optical coherence tomography; ultrafast quantum cascade laser for ultrafast LWIR phenomena; and real-time optical metrology.",

We propose to develop a static analysis tool - termed SUIM - that verifies the semantic properties of an implemented user interface by statically analyzing interfaces described with a widely-deployed, device-independent user interface markup language. Our design includes a simple domain-specific language to codify user interface guidelines drawn from canonical resources such as Apple&#039;s Human Interface Guidelines. The SUIM tool will evaluate the specified guidelines on a user interface description, producing errors or warnings if the interface violates any of the guidelines. Organizations will be able to specify and distribute UI guidelines that can be integrated directly into the application development workflow, providing an unprecedented level of application consistency without restricting the programmer&#039;s development environment.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Regardless of age or service history, machine equipment at AEDC must be reliable and ready for operation when required by test and evaluation schedules. Condition based maintenance of rotating machinery using embedded instrumentation has proven to be an effective approach for increasing the reliability of plant equipment. It is anticipated that broader monitoring capabilities would result in operational improvements including increased availability, more effective labor utilization, and reduced maintenance costs. These benefits can be realized by a cost effective, rapidly deployable wireless sensor platform that can autonomously perform data collection tasks.  The system must be compatible with existing maintenance network systems, FIPS 140-2 data security, and DOD requirements for Information Assurance to ensure secure access and system interoperability. Within the proposed Phase II program, Luna will deliver a flexible, secure wireless monitoring platform with energy harvesting that meets AEDC requirements. Luna&quot;s device and system concept will be useful for both rapidly deployable, real-time machine troubleshooting, and long-term, autonomous runtime parameter and machine load estimation.  BENEFIT:  The value of Luna&quot;s sensor platform is its unique combination of features that are not available in any other commercial platform, including a high degree of application flexibility for both temporary and long-term machine monitoring. The objective of the Phase II program is to produce an application flexible, secure wireless machine sensor platform with extended endurance through energy harvesting.  The plant monitoring system would be a cost effective means to achieve expanded machine diagnostic capabilities that seamlessly integrates with existing AEDC maintenance networks. Luna&quot;s sensor platform mitigates both logistic and labor issues associated with batteries through energy harvesting, and eliminates cabling with secure, wireless, remote retrieval of machine health and runtime parameters. The benefit to AEDC is that the sensor platform is designed to be compatible with existing IT infrastructure, Air Force Information Assurance policies, and with DMSI MAINTelligence software. The reconfigurable and flexible monitoring product has been designed to meet the broadest possible range of machine monitoring applications.  The plant monitoring system would be useful in unattended monitoring of military plants, propulsion systems and infracture, along with large scale industrial processes common in metals, mining, pulp and paper and chemical process industries.",

The approach is to use water-dissolvable templates of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), which are replicated from master surface topography, coated with functional materials that are transferred to a substrate as an active component of the resulting nanopatterned device. A range of functional materials are considered including dielectrics, metal oxides, conductive inks, phosphors, ceramics, optical polymers, nanoparticle-loaded composite materials, sol-gels, specialized resists, monolayer and semi-permeable polymer films, and luminescent materials. In combination with a platform equipment technology, these processes for functional material patterning comprise a comprehensive nanolithography solution that should enable nanomanufacturing of a broad range of novel devices. The broader/commercial impacts of this project will be the potential to enable the nanopatterning of various functional materials that previously were difficult, not possible, or too costly to produce as high-resolution features for integration in advanced devices. Lithography technology, approximately a $10 billion market opportunity, creates dense circuitry and related nanostructures for high performance devices including semiconductors, displays, data storage, solid state lighting, solar cells, and biological sensors. In this project, the lithography procedure, which uses water-dissolvable templates and dry functional materials, enables an environmentally-friendly approach to high-resolution patterning, a foundational step in advanced manufacturing.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop commercial systems to economically purify produced water streams. Produced water is the water that is co-extracted from oil and gas production and is often ten times as voluminous as the extracted hydrocarbon. Phase II efforts will be focused on scale-up to fabricate a 200 gallon-per-minute produced water treatment system to effectively mine hydrocarbons from the fluid. The process uses a newly developed nano-engineered organosilica that rapidly and reversibly swells when exposed to organics, yet is hydrophobic and does not absorb water. The organosilica material is unique that it acts as a nanomechanical sponge extracting dispersed and dissolved hydrocarbons. The captured hydrocarbons can be recovered from the silica and the sorbent material re-used. Successful development of these water purification systems will allow for an entire new mechanism for produced water management. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project development is tied to the ability to treat numerous produced water streams which are currently difficult or expensive to treat, and to obtain a higher yield in the recovery of valuable products. Approximately 800 billion gallons of produced water must be managed annually in petroleum operations around the world. This treatment process will allow existing oil and gas production fields to meet existing or higher environmental discharge standards at a lower overall cost. The system will also reduce the impact or potential impact of the discharge of produced water in emerging markets with sensitive environmental concerns. From an economic impact the system will result in a higher yield for many oil and gas fields, by capturing for refinement valuable hydrocarbons which would otherwise have been disposed of as waste. Phase I results showed that 0.4-3.5% of a typical &quot;waste&quot; stream is composed of potentially valuable hydrocarbons which are not recoverable with existing technology. The recovery of these hydrocarbons, which are often the lightest and most energy-valuable compounds, such as toluene and octane, will increase the value of every producing well using this system.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop a system for automated classification of biological samples and discovery of biomarkers. The system will be designed to perform comprehensive pattern analysis of state-of-the-art biochemical separations generated by comprehensive two-dimensional chromatography (GCxGC) with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). The pairing of GCxGC and HRMS combines highly effective molecular separations with precise elemental analysis. A critical challenge for effective utilization of GCxGC-HRMS for biochemical sample classification and biomarker discovery is the difficulty of analyzing and interpreting the massive, complex data for metabolomic features. The quantity and complexity of the data, as well as the large dimensionality of the metabolome, and the possibility that significant chemical characteristics may be subtle and involve patterns of multiple constituents, necessitate investigation and development of new bioinformatics. The principal technical objective is an innovative framework for comprehensive feature matching and analysis across many samples. Specifically, the framework will incorporate advanced methods for multidimensional peak detection, peak pattern matching across large sample sets, data alignment, comprehensive feature matching, and multi-sample analyses (e.g., classification and biomarker discovery) with large sample sets. The anticipated result is a commercial system for automated multi-sample analysis. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be realized through improved informatics for biological classification and biomarker discovery. These tools will enable researchers to better understand biochemical processes and to discover metabolic biomarkers, which could lead to improved methods for disease diagnoses and treatments. These information technologies will foster utilization of advanced GCxGC-HRMS instrumentation, thereby contributing to the impetus for future instrument development. The informatics developed in this project also will be relevant for other classification problems involving multidimensional, multispectral data, including other applications (such as biofuels), other types of chemical analyses (such as multidimensional spectroscopy), and other fields (such as remote-sensing multispectral geospatial imagers). This project will contribute to national competitiveness in the global market for analytical technologies and will contribute to workforce development by involving students in research experiences through internships and student projects. Software developed in the project and an example dataset will be available to educational institutions to allow students to more easily explore biochemical complexity.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) system for the deposition of silicon layers for a solar cell to absorb sunlight and convert to electricity. Current PECVD processes face challenges that limit the quality and speed at which the silicon thin film can be deposited. This translates into higher capital cost and less efficient photovoltaic modules, thus higher cost. In this project, a novel microwave surface-wave plasma source for the PECVD processing step will be developed. This source has the potential to increase deposition rates by 10 times over the current state of the art, while maintaining excellent film quality needed for high energy conversion efficiency and long lifetime. The expected outcome of this project is to offer a technology with high processing speed that is suitable to manufacture advanced tandem and triple-junction solar cells with high energy conversion efficiency. The broader/commercial impacts of this project will be the potential to enable the manufacturing of high-efficiency thin-film silicon solar cells at costs meeting or exceeding the 2020 grid-parity goal of $1/Watt installed cost. Thin-film silicon uses earth-abundant, sustainable materials with inexhaustible supply of raw materials and no toxicity concerns. The solution provided by Starfire addresses a critical manufacturing challenge that has the potential to break the thin-film silicon bottleneck and enable its wide adoption.

The signatures contain important information on the lethality of the intercept and on the contents of the warhead (nuclear, biological, or chemical). The program objective is to develop an important MDA capability to enable an end-to-end simulation of the intercept signatures in the terahertz (THz) spectral region.  This Terahertz Typing Toolkit (TTT) software will use first principles chemistry and spectroscopy modeling to create a time-dependent signature from the nuclear and non-nuclear components of the expanding intercept debris cloud. The TTT software, which will be designed to assess the feasibility of performing Terahertz warhead typing, will enable modeling of the signal-to-noise/clutter ratio for a variety of engagement scenarios and detection system concepts. Based on the Phase I development and demonstration of an approach for modeling THz absorption and emission spectra from a missile intercept, the development of the TTT would be a significant and innovative first step in the design and implementation of a Terahertz warhead kill assessment and typing system.",

        "abstract": "The design of space-based optical sensors for detection, identification, and tracking of threat missile launches relies heavily on plume signature simulation models.  The development of very capable plume signature models traces back ~50 years. However, because of the complexity of the underlying physics and ever-increasing requirements for improved accuracy and speed, higher spatial resolution, and broader spectral coverage, there remain areas where existing models inadequately predict signatures of real systems.  In Phase II, Spectral Sciences, Inc. will address these deficiencies by developing innovative, advanced, physics-based models for integration into the current and next-generation state-of-the-art plume signature codes.  These include the legacy, SPURC, and next-generation, FLITES spectral simulation, and the high-altitude, SOCRATES-P, and low-altitude, RPFM, flow field codes.  The advanced models include search light scattering, solar and earth shine scattering, photon trapping, long path atmospheric transmission, hard body plume shine reflection, upgraded molecular spectral models, and speed and accuracy improvements.   The new simulation capabilities will be validated using existing, well characterized wind tunnel and field measurements of missile plume spectral signatures and imagery.   Finally, the new models will be delivered to MDA for integration into its threat scenario modeling and simulation framework.",

Using models and signal processing innovations for clutter and debris developed during the Phase I program, improvements to the current and future generations of missile defense radars and sensors will be demonstrated and tested for effectiveness and robustness. The proposed innovations are intended to be applicable to current and future BMDS radar signal processing architectures, and include modifications to the front-end IQ data processing, pulse integration, detection processing, and target tracking. A multi-tiered approach is necessary to control radar resource utilization and to ensure robust performance against a broad spectrum of clutter and debris, including staging debris/motor chuff during the ascent phase, countermeasures, and post-intercept debris (of interest for kill assessment and raid scenarios) during the endgame. The Phase II effort will focus on the application of the Phase I technology into a functional end-to-end multi-target tracking system in order to demonstrate performance in on a complex simulated radar scene, and on technology transfer to existing BMDS elements.  Additional advanced capabilities will also be pursued, especially with regards to transitioning the proposed technology to new all-active fully-wideband digital radar systems.",

A key requirement for this system is a global battle manager that efficiently and effectively coordinates the actions of the component sensors and weapon systems, and rapidly provides operators with engagement solutions. This is a significant challenge because of the close coupling that exists between battle management (BM) and sensor resource management (SRM). In this Phase II effort, we propose to develop an optimization-based global battle management algorithm that coordinates the actions of BMDS sensors and weapon systems, to maximize surviving assets while minimizing expended defense resources. The battle manager will (i) account for system coupling by operating in conjunction with the sensor resource manager, (ii) consider the unique capabilities of each asset, (iii) address the stochastic nature of the underlying optimization problem, (iv) allow for replanning upon receipt of additional data, (v) consider pre-planned operations by accepting external constraints in its search, and (vi) provide support to the C2BMC operators, who are tasked with fighting the ballistic missile battle. Furthermore, our joint BM/SRM algorithm will be tested extensively using the BMD Benchmark and challenging raid scenarios.",

This approach allows for rapid prioritization of additional data needs (i.e. cueing), subsequent ingest of cued data and calculations of tracks with potentially sufficient precision to develop predicted intercept points for target engagement.  SciTec has identified an initial set of features available in Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) and Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) measurements that can be used to enhance track correlation performance through our Feature-Aided Multi-sensor OPIR/UAS Software (FAMOUS).

In previous and current work, Ultramet has demonstrated the potential of fabricating rhenium-lined low-density graphite and carbon/carbon components, in combination with a carbon diffusion barrier interlayer to prevent loss of rhenium ductility and damage to the carbon-based support structure. This combination of materials will allow the benefits of flight-qualified rhenium to be retained at substantially reduced weight and cost. Rhenium offers high toughness and thermal and mechanical shock resistance that ceramic coatings cannot provide, as well as gas impermeability that cannot be achieved with ceramic matrix composites. In Phase I, Ultramet demonstrated the initial feasibility of a rhenium-lined graphite poppet for a long-duration hot gas valve being developed by Valley Tech Systems for Aerojet&quot;s SM-3 Block 2B SDACS. In Phase II, application of the technology will be expanded beyond SDACS valve components to also include thrusters for Aerojet&quot;s SM-3 Block 2B liquid DACS (LDACS). LDACS will require rhenium thrusters that are lined with iridium, and Ultramet is the only manufacturer of flight-qualified and proven iridium/rhenium thrusters. Design and analysis will take advantage of Ultramet&quot;s extensive experience in manufacturing flight components from rhenium for SM-3 Block 1A and from iridium/rhenium for commercial satellite liquid propulsion systems.

The algorithms proposed here will increase the coverage area of BMD airborne optical sensors and forward-based radar and fire control components.  In Phase I, PRA developed and tested track correlation algorithms utilizing atmospheric refraction and turbulence measurements and developed a preliminary algorithm for increasing handover probability.

Scientific Systems Company, Inc. of Woburn, MA, and its subcontractor, Lockheed Martin, propose a foundational, control-theoretic approach to such problems. It is based on the idea of mathematically modeling a multiplatform-multisensor-multitarget system as SINGLE, JOINTLY EVOLVING STOCHASTIC PROCESS. All relevant information regarding behaviors of all sensors, all platforms, and all targets are inherently integrated into the algorithm design at the outset. As a consequence, all major functionsdata fusion, detection, tracking, navigation, and control, etc., are inherently integrated into a single, unified system. Phase I showed the feasibility assessment by simulating rocket trajectories that account for precise targeting and the specific rocket characteristics of medium range rockets, accurate modeling for the I-2 interceptor, and derived multi-firing solution for neutralizing adversary rockets. The results indicated successful intercept and neutralization by detection and tracking using space based IR sensors for the first 50 seconds (with an accuracy of 300 meters) followed by aided tracking utilizing radars on board a destroyer such as AEGIS (with a resulting combined accuracy of 200 meters), and finally the KV IR sensor is utilized for a resulting total accuracy of 20 meters. Phase II work will emphasize development of more mature prototype interceptor-versus-missile algorithms, to be tested using more realistic environments and data, and at more realistic processing speeds. This will include development of a dual-use commercialization plan with special emphasis on developing working relationships with BMD contractors.",

Sensitivity to single photons is desirable for a low size weight and power (SWAP) UAS-borne active ranging receiver because of the limited laser pulse energy that can be transmitted, and the limited optical aperture available for signal collection. High rate operation is another requirement for a UAS-borne active ranging receiver, because accumulation of multiple pulses on target in a short span of time will be required to deal with atmospheric distortion and to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in photon-starved conditions. Since the distant target in a ranging application will subtend just a few pixels, asynchronous readout of only the pixels that fire will lower the computational burden of range processing by sparsifying the data. The proposed receiver will employ Voxtel&quot;s innovative single carrier multiplication (SCM) avalanche photodiode (APD) technology which can sense single photons in linear mode operation, and a custom readout integrated circuit (ROIC) that will stream detection events from the 88-format detector to a 64-channel time recorder/range processor implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) board.",

Specifically the nasal delivery device could reduce health care associated infections by providing a needle-free method of delivery of vaccines and therapeutics which are currently delivered by injection with all the attendant risks of transmission of blood borne disease through needle-stick injury and unsafe needle practices.  One of the most important potential benefits of needle-free delivery is the reduction of HIV transmission, by reducing the risks associated with needle-stick injury and unsafe needle practices, as above, but also by providing an efficient delivery system for mucosal vaccination.  A nasally delivered vaccine might provide a critical advantage by providing mucosal immunity to HIV in the reproductive tract, preventing infection at the entry site before the virus can damage the immune system.  Mucosal immunity from a nasally delivered vaccine may also knock down virus levels in the reproductive tract of infected individuals, reducing the risk of transmission. The objective of this potential project is to develop a unique ultra-compact intranasal nebulizer that can be inserted into the nares to provide extremely high delivery efficiency without a nasal prong. This will be an optimal platform for large-scale vaccination, as well as the intranasal delivery of other therapeutics.  The device will dramatically increase the fraction of the vaccine delivered through the nasal valve and to the immunologically sensitive regions of the nasal tract.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The process of readying a satellite for its operational service role once deployed from the launch vehicle can be an extremely time consuming process when employing traditional approaches  particularly for complex imaging sensors that require the manipulation of many controls to converge on the ability to acquire data products of sufficient quality to be militarily useful. The types of ground-directed checkout sequences that are traditionally applied to spacecraft have long latencies because of the availability of the space-ground link and the delays inherent in human-in-the-loop processes.   PnP Innovations proposes to address this barrier by leveraging certain aspects of the Space Plug &amp; play Avionics (SPA) data standards to create an automated checkout framework that can adapt to the inventory of spacecraft bus support components and mission sensors that comprise a mission. The resulting solution will be scalable and extensible to include a wide range of tactical missions of high value to AFRL and the Operationally Responsive Space office.  On-orbit planning and executive functions responsible for making autonomous platform-level decisions take advantage of standard checkout interfaces and component-provided metadata to support the rapid configuration of a satellite to mission needs.    BENEFIT:  The immediate application of the proposed architecture, techniques, and software is as an onboard system for tactical DoD satellites. We envision the technology as being utilized to foster greater tactical payoff to the DoD for SSA and for warfighter utility by reducing the time from deployment to fully functional operational service using satellite-resident decision  making to speed the checkout and calibration process.  The approach also has direct relevance to other space initiatives in the science and exploration including NASA&quot;s technology qualification platforms, observation platforms, and interplanetary missions.   The core technology associated with the modular software, supporting hardware, and tools infrastructure is applicable to many non-space applications. Military applications include command and control, air strike and mission planning, autonomous vehicle control and route planning, automated weapon platform subsystems control (e.g. submarines and B-2 bombers), transportation and supply planning and management, air traffic routing and air space management, spare parts allocation and distribution management, and numerous other wartime and peacetime applications. Commercial applications include industrial plant management, production line planning and control (especially robotic or automated production), control of large industrial facilities such as power plants and refineries, as well as many others.  We also foresee that the Testbench infrastructure we are developing will be of significant value to mission developers who wish to begin the process of developing autonomy capabilities for their programs well in advance of the satellite&quot;s assembly. The tools and the supporting infrastructure are intended to be cost effective so that they are affordable by a variety of commercial interests (including universities) while offering a direct path to a flight system.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Space Plug-and-play Avionics (SPA) initiative is designed to improve the ability of the US military to respond to rapidly changing operational needs by creating, integrating, and launching a new spacecraft in less than one week.  This would provide major benefits to war fighters on the ground, in the sky, and at sea.  SPA-1 ASICs using I2C as the transport interface will likely be the most proliferated endpoint for connection to the satellites&quot;many sensors and actuators.  Thus, the implementation of the SPA-1 ASIC must minimize size, weight and power without sacrificing performance.  In Phase I, American Semiconductor demonstrated the ability to meet these needs by designing a high performance 50MHz, ultra low power, radiation-hardened SPA-1 ASIC processor core in the 130nm Flexfet double gate CMOS process.  Operating at 0.5V, the Flexfet microprocessor core provides a 3X improvement in power over conventional bulk CMOS and a nearly 10X improvement in performance.  In Phase II, American Semiconductor will design, manufacture and test Flexfet SPA-1 ASICs.  This Phase II program will also provide an ASIC development platform and silicon proven building blocks for creation of other ultra low power, radiation-hardened ASICs in a US wafer foundry for use by DoD prime contractors.  BENEFIT:  There is a clear military requirement and desire for the technology to be developed under this Phase II SBIR.  Space has become a contested environment in which it is critical for the US to have a clear technology advantages.  The Space Plug-and-play Avionics (SPA) initiative is part of the Operationally Responsive Space goal of reducing the time from identification of a mission need to fielding an operationally capable satellite.  The importance of the SPA initiative was recently recognized by being named the 2010 Hot Technology Contest Winner for the Air Force.  In addition, AFRL has sponsored a number of SPA programs and a key driver in the development of the SPA standards.      For the Air Force to fully benefit from the SPA initiative, new microelectronics that implement the SPA protocols and standards must be developed to address the low power, high performance and radiation tolerance requirements of space.  SPA-x ASICs are fundamental building blocks for development of these plug-and-play satellites.  SPA-1 uses the I2C transfer protocol and is envisioned by satellite designers as the&quot;leaves on the tree&quot;, or most numerous SPA ASIM component, for connection to the multiple sensors and actuators employed on the plug-and-play satellites.  The current start-of-the-art for SPA-1 is implementation in a structured ASIC.  A structured ASIC is a good approach for development, but cannot meet the low power and performance specifications or mixed-signal capability developed in this program.  Dramatic breakthroughs in the area of low power electronics is crucial for continued advancement in radiation-hardened electronics for space and military applications.    Under this SBIR Phase II program, American Semiconductor will deliver SPA-1 ASICs built in the 130nm Flexfet CMOS technology to significantly reduce the size, weight, and power when compared to using the existing structured ASIC implementation.  Operating at 0.5V, a SPA-1 ASIC in the double-gate Flexfet CMOS technology will provide a 3X improvement in power over conventional bulk CMOS and a nearly 10X improvement in performance while also providing inherent tolerance to radiation.    The power and performance breakthroughs to be demonstrated under this proposal are also needed across a wide spectrum of commercial applications that include medical, distributed networks, and energy scavenging sensors, to name just a few.  This approach must be successfully commercialized to insure technology availability to defense programs, provide a stable supply base, and benefit from on-going development to sustain the technology.  American Semiconductor has a demonstrated track record supplying and supporting new technology as demonstrated by the company&quot;s selection as the 2007 Supplier of the Year Award for Technology from Boeing Corp.   The commercialization potential for this SBIR is along two paths.  The first commercialization opportunity from this proposal will be to market the Flexfet SPA-1 ASIC to both military and commercial satellite manufacturers.  Success of the Flexfet SPA-1 prototype will lead to development of more complex SPA-x variants such as the SPA-U USB and SPA-S Spacewire variants.    The second path is providing the Flexfet ULP CMOS process as a foundry offering to satellite and IC designers that need to conserve system power.  This has multiple sub-areas of commercialization such as foundry wafer sales, IP block licensing, and follow-on derivative product development and sales.  Along the second commercialization path, the first product to leverage the technology from this SBIR will be IP blocks in Flexfet CMOS complementary to the SPA-1 ASIM, such as SRAM, ADCs, and I2C interface.  These IP blocks allow designers to immediately utilize Flexfet CMOS to design ULP ICs that can further size, weight, and power (SWaP) advantages in satellite and other low power systems.  Success in this area will enable further development of IP blocks, which leads to faster, lower cost development of future ICs through the use of IP blocks proven in silicon and available to designers working with Flexfet.  The technology from this proposal will require little additional funding to bring to market.  Flexfet CMOS is in place and being used by customers today.  The SPA-1 ASIC developed in this program is anticipated to meet datasheet requirements such that silicon can be immediately started to fulfill customer demand for initial development.  Qualification and reliability testing for both commercial terrestrial and military space applications can proceed in parallel with delivery of initial prototypes.  Marketing and advertising expense will be necessary, but will leverage existing company efforts as much as possible.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Triton Systems Inc (TSI), in partnership with a military and commercial airframe OEM and inspection device and service providers, proposes to integrate proven automated scanning technology with multi-modal non-destructive inspection (NDI) techniques to enable the more efficient and reliable inspection of airframe structures.   The proposed TSI solution will utilize a systems engineering approach to coordinate all partner activities.   The Phase II proposal addresses the development of an automated, multi-modal data acquisition and analysis inspection system for Air Force airframes and their related structural defects.  The primary application for this automated inspection system will be the detection and documentation of crack and corrosion defects on the near and far sides of single layer skin components on C-130J aircraft.  The system will scan areas of interest on the fuselage and upper and lower wing surfaces. By integrating an automated scanner platform with simultaneous, multi-modal use of several high-productivity NDI techniques and automated analysis software, it will be shown that the implementation of this proposed concept can significantly reduce inspection time and cost while improving inspection reliability.  The feasibility for achieving these productivity gains and reliability improvements has been demonstrated in TSI&quot;s Phase I project.   BENEFIT:  Anticipated benefits include: Anticipated minimum 10 X improvement in scanning rates; faster total inspection turn-around times; less direct inspection labor content;        lower costs; higher inspection reliability provided by the simultaneous, redundant       inspection of the same area for the same defect by multiple methods. The proposed innovation can be applied to all military and commercial airframes.",

The success of the evolutionary validation strategy depends on the same phased definition of capability needs and system requirements, and the maturation of technologies that support evolutionary acquisition.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Busek proposes to develop a flight-prototype piezo microvalve useful for micro chemical thrusters that require precisely metered flow rates.  Deriving from a flight-qualified Busek microvalve and a successful proof-of-concept Phase I laboratory prototype, this proposed valve will be small, lightweight, and ready for flight qualification. It can linearly actuate thrust up to the 100 mN design point while consuming power as low as one milli-Watt.  In parallel to the valve development, efficient power converter electronics will be developed to provide the voltage necessary to operate the piezo actuator. Though designed for highly viscous green monopropellants, the valve will be equally adequate for regulating most liquid and gaseous propellants.  One unique feature includes an all-welded design that will accept inlet pressures over 500 psi. When coupled with a closed-loop control system, the valve can regulate flow with extreme precision while exhibiting no hysteresis.  Upon completion of the successful Phase II development, Busek will deliver a flight-like microvalve and electronics that are fully characterized and tested for operation in a simulated space environment.  Additional qualifications will include open/close cycling, vibration, and abbreviated life testing.  BENEFIT:  Many in the space industry desire to start phasing out hydrazine from monopropellant space propulsion systems due to its toxicity.  Hydrazine is also a primary choice for micro chemical propulsions like ACS.  Advanced green monopropellants, such as AF-315 and ADN, offer increased performance at much reduced toxicity. For green monopropellants to evolve into a major role in the space industry, they must be appropriate for ACS applications, and thus, a suitable feed system is essential.  The proposed microvalve will attract attention from the U.S. Air Force and NASA who have shown great interest in adapting green monopropellants for future satellite main propulsion and ACS thrusters.",

        "abstract": "The problem is that current high resolution penetrating RF sensors are incapable of reliably detecting obscured/buried threats to human life, and both military and civilians are dying as a result. Moreover, the high costs and productivity losses caused by destructive testing make this topic of extremely high importance. This SBIR addresses the key element that drives the performance&quot;the waveform, its generator, and the algorithms that compress it. ASI proposes to build a 1.5GHz bandwidth system in year 1 and a 3.5GHz bandwidth system in year 2. The innovative solution has high technical merit as it (1) mitigates range ambiguities; (2) minimizes sidelobes for a given resolution, (3) minimizes the power consumption, (4) minimizes harmful interference to other radio systems; (5) minimizes the radiated power required to achieve a given SNR; (6) maximizes the dynamic range; (7) is ultra stable so as to allow high performance coherent change detection over day/week time frames; (8) provides a user programmable spectrum (a) to spectrally notch frequency bands to avoid interference within any particular theater of operation and (b) to match different missions, and (9) offers new compression algorithms that offer low sidelobes, even with spectral notches.",

Precision glass molding technology can meet these demands through its ability to mass produce complex geometries with high degrees of accuracy and precision. Rochester Precision Optics (RPO) is proposing innovative research which will further advance molded optics technology and assist in the reduction of size and weight of optical systems throughout the optics industry. RPO will demonstrate the feasibility of creating novel surfaces such as diffractive and antireflection microstructures by producing and testing the performance of lenses with these features, and extending molding technology to encompass larger diameters and achieve higher manufacturing yields. We will also develop and optimize glass molding simulation technology to predict the behavior of the glass during the molding process. Such technology will lower the cost of molded optics and reduce the time required to develop new lenses.",

In Phase-II, we will refine and complete the design, manufacture the ROIC, fabricate the FPA, and test the completed product. One application issue presented by the DBCHI is the large gain variation across the array. Though off-chip gain adjustment is possible, an on-chip solution is highly preferred because of noise and dynamic range consideration. This technology will have to be added to the current ROIC design to compensate for this condition. A complete ROIC, including the peripheral electronics and supporting software will be manufactured in Phase-II based on the proposed technology. A prototype 640x480 ROIC chip will be fabricated as a proof of the design. The functionality and performance of the prototype product will be examined and characterized.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  We plan to develop an operation-ready version of the next-generation Direct Ascent Vulnerability web service with UDOP visualization. The DAV suite will include the dynamic predictive functionality and reachability service prototyped in Phase I and a new vehicle trajectory prediction algorithm to be prototyped in Phase II. The DAV tools take available data on the orbital catalog and missile models and utilize orbital dynamics to determine vulnerability windows of satellites to either a direct ascent launch or a satellite from another orbit. Reachability provides a running forecast of possible threats considering a database of missile models and sites and the dynamic predictive function provides real-time analysis for discrimination between a benign launch and an attack. The service provides live and exercise modes and can be used for what-if analysis or launch planning. The operational web service must be compatible with the JSpOC Mission System (JMS) architecture and accept various real message types including ILAM, T-3, and IBS messages, and handle special perturbations satellite elements. We will deploy the new service suite on AFRL&#039;s Battlespace Evaluation Assessment Space Testbed, or BEAST, and perform testing on real-time and prepackaged data sets as available to determine the accuracy of the satellite vulnerability predictions.  BENEFIT:  This technology will predict which satellites are vulnerable to a direct ascent launch in real-time, in addition to providing what-if and predictive analysis. The JSpOC Mission System needs services like this to assist in space situational awareness. The recent use of direct ascent launch against satellites by both the U.S. and China indicate that this is a real threat. This suite of services was designed for predicting satellite vulnerability from the beginning and will outperform terrestrial applications designed for surface-to-surface missiles. There is a potential commercial application of a portion of the toolset for launch planning and collision avoidance, in both MATLAB and standalone application formats.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Participants in Red Flag (RF) exercises must be familiar with specific procedures, conditions, and training rules for range safety. Preparing non-US participants requires foreign travel of USAF personnel, which is expensive in money, time, and personnel resources. Considerable savings could be realized with a foreign deployable pre-exercise training environment, requiring no in-country travel/participation by USAF personnel. To meet this need, under a Phase I effort we designed and demonstrated the feasibility of a Simulation for Ubiquitous RF Instruction and Readying (SUREFIRE). In Phase II, we will: 1) define scenario creation and training environment requirements based on the curriculum developed by our subject matter experts and an analysis of RF training needs; 2) develop a graphical scenario creation tool that allows RF Subject Matter Experts (SME) to create and deploy training; 3) integrate an existing simulation with intelligent hierarchically composable agents capable of naturalistic verbal interaction with pilots; and 4) evaluate the effectiveness of Red Flag preparation using SUREFIRE. SUREFIRE will provide a deployable and tailorable tool capable of supporting pre-exercise trainingfor both foreign and US personnelin preparation for Red Flag exercises.  BENEFIT:  Voice-enabled interactive agents can play a role in a wide variety of domains, from automated telephone receptionists (where they are currently used frequently) to commanding unmanned robotic vehicles. By integrating cutting-edge speech and natural language processing capabilities into Charles River Analytics&quot;user-friendly agent development environment, AgentWorks, we can broaden its market appeal. In addition, generalized tools for 1) rapid scenario generation can be created and are highly useful for customized training; and 2) real-time performance assessment feedback can support self-paced training in a variety of domains.",

        "abstract": "Lightweight silicon-based ceramics are leading candidates to replace heavier nickel-based superalloys for hot section components used in advanced gas turbine engines having increased specific power. Unfortunately, exposures of these materials to the high temperature combustion environments alter the effectiveness of thermally grown silica scales in providing protection from oxidation and component recession during service. Environmental barrier coatings (EBCs) are therefore required that protect the underlying ceramic substrate from environmental attack. Such coatings require good stability in the presence of water vapor, a mechanism for limiting oxygen/water vapor transport and high temperature phase stability. The nature of the silicon-based ceramic recession issue dictates that any EBC system must provide prime reliant performance to ensure full component lifetimes. To meet this goal, it is anticipated that the impact resistance of the current generation EBC coating systems will need to be enhanced. This has led to interest in advanced thermal/environmental barrier coating(T/EBC) systems having enhanced impact resistance over current state-of-the-art T/EBC systems. In this work, novel coating synthesis techniques that enable the deposition of T/EBC systems having materials, microstructures and architectures anticipated to promote coating system toughness and improved durability in environments having significant impact events are investigated.",

An associated full-duplex transceiver for up to 1 watt transmit power and -100 dBm receive sensitivity was designed by POC, as well as a passive attitude control mechanism that aligns and stabilizes the satellite in roll, pitch, and yaw, and ensures that the satellite is oriented in the direction of minimum drag with the antenna directed toward the Earth.

The performance of the prototype will be evaluated at a UHF antenna range and in a thermal vacuum representative of the envisioned low-earth-orbit.

Nanomaterials such as Al and B have been integrated into gun propellants resulting in increased burning rates, burn-rate tailorability, and efficiencies. The combined effect of these improvements would result in enhanced system-level performance in a variety of weapon systems. However, significant technical challenges exist with implementing nanoparticle technology in polymer composites. Particle agglomeration during mixing, particle size uniformity, process scalability, cost, safety issues related to free handling of loose nanoparticles, and particle stability (oxidation resistance) all offer unique difficulties. Scaling up the infrastructure required for proper handling and processing of nanoparticle propellants can be prohibitively expensive owing to the safety issues presented by loose nanoparticles, and the afore-mentioned processing issues are also magnified at larger scale. A solution that will offer processing techniques addressing these challenges is desired. The proposed technology makes use of a patented technique that yields nanoparticles typically 5&quot;10 nm in size.

Supporting MDA&quot;s engineering applications related to missile typing, discrimination, tracking, algorithm development, etc. requires estimation of many parameters by the plume models, which can be very expensive for complex targets that are not easily measured. High-fidelity, 3D plume modeling of threat systems is now at an advanced stage, utilizing a MDA-sponsored highly efficient, 3D CFD plume models; however, comparable capabilities are not available for corresponding RCS predictions. The Phase II will demonstrate an advanced 3D Vector Finite Element (VFE) RCS model for performing RCS predictions of 3D effects in plumes, which can strongly shift the Doppler spectrum of the plume from the hardbody return. The Phase II will demonstrate this 3D plume RCS modeling tool as mature for supporting production-oriented analysis, with applicability to the tracking of post-burnout debris for solid motors also.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The objective of the LCCE Program is the development of a flight-qualified LCCE that will support a broad range of mechanical cryocoolers of interest to the United States Air Force.  The LCCE will solve a fundamental acquisition problem, namely the absence of affordable, radiation hard cryocooler electronics.  A flight-design LCCE will be designed, fabricated, performance tested with cryocoolers, and subjected to environmental testing to achieve Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 by the end of Phase II.    The present state for space cryocooler electronics acquisition is characterized by point designs, which in turn leads to high costs ($1-2M typical) and long acquisition times (18 months typical).  Alternatively, non-radiation hard tactical cryocooler electronics are the other option.  Neither meets the requirements for cost-sensitive military spaceflight platforms.    The objective state is one in which a low cost (&lt;$300K in small lot built quantity, $100K goal), total dose radiation hard, SEL immune, high reliability, open architecture Cryocooler Electronics exists that support a wide range of cryocoolers of interest to the USAF and DoD.  The availability of that design will allow the USG user community to pick the mechanical cryocooler best suited to the mission needs rather than being constrained by electronics TRL and/or availability.      BENEFIT:  Infrared sensors are used in many applications across the Department of Defense including gun sights, targeting pods on fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, ground based and naval surveillance, unmanned aerial surveillance (UAS) platforms, and satellites.  The greatest sensitivity, particularly at mid wave infrared (MWIR, nominally 3 to 7 microns) and above, has traditionally been achieved with intrinsic semiconductor-based detectors.  These detectors, which include a broad range of chemistries among which the most common are indium antimonide (InSb) and mercury-cadmium-telluride (HgCdTe), require cryogenic refrigeration for operation.  New, competing Quantum Well Infrared Photodetector (QWIP) technology is starting to receive attention, particularly at NASA/GSFC; these detectors also require cryogenic refrigeration to achieve optimal performance.  The most demanding applications are the space-borne, high-performance cryogenic IR sensors.  In addition to the typical mass and efficiency demands of a military platform, a significant complicating factor is the need for radiation-hard components to survive the harsh space environment.  This is the primary cost driver on the IR sensor electronics, including the cryocooler drive and control electronics, because of the high component cost and the circuit design complications caused by limited radiation-hard parts availability.   The present approach across industry to meet these coupled performance and environmental requirements centers on custom, point-designs to meet each mission.  Each major IR sensor component and electronics module tends to be a point design to meet a particular combination of mission, spacecraft, and payload requirements.  This drives up nonrecurring engineering cost and results in long development timelines for each new system.  These long timelines and high costs are inconsistent with the procurement needs of ORS and other cost-sensitive space flight missions.  The LCCE Program is addressing this problem for the cryocooler electronics.  During Phase I, an architecture has been defined that is modular, scalable, affordable, and provides the critical cryocooler operational functionality that typically envelopes the needs of a low cost space mission (high efficiency motor drive and closed loop temperature control).  This architecture will be reduced to practice in Phase II, culminating in a flight-design Engineering Model immediately applicable for a wide range of DoD missions.",

The current engine modeling method for real time rotorcraft simulation relies heavily on empirical estimation and, hence, is severely limited by the availability of the data and also suffers from an inaccuracy in predicting the engine/drivetrain transient states. The proposed SBIR is dedicated to the development of a first principle based engine and drivetrain dynamics and control modeling method that will reflect rotorcraft propulsion system physics and provide an accurate simulation solution. The proposed solution will be rigorously formulated and applicable for generic turboshaft engine/drivetrain modeling. The formulation will consider the entire engine operational range including start-up, idle, started, and shut-down. The simulation implementation will also address the interaction with the engine fuel control dynamics and the drivetrain/rotor coupling for a fully integrated solution. The engine dynamic model will be developed in modular form so that it can be easily integrated with rotorcraft flight simulation programs or used as a standalone model as a plug-in in any analysis program in support of engine dynamics and engine control analysis. The physics-based solution thus developed will be tested and evaluated in an industry standard rotorcraft modeling and simulation program to validate the methodology in support of rotorcraft analysis and flight simulation.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The purpose of this SBIR phase II proposal is to validate design and material and process engineering that demonstrated feasibility of processing the adaptive thermal control material system (TCMS) that is capable of providing a radiation hardened space stable performance along with the needs of the charge storage capability. Through this proposal the several engineered TCMS concepts for the space craft protection are planned for the validation for the needed survivability and better protection of the space assets and the involved investments. Each of them can mature to various degree of readiness level per the planned efforts. The over all goals here is to develop and validate concepts for an adaptive TCMS that can protect spacecraft structures and payload electronics from high flux radiation doses from the natural solar storm induced events and possible manmade nuclear threats in a given orbit. The new TCMS designs as well as the processing approaches can provide the usual TCMS functions in reliable and space stable manner, plus a charge storage coating to meet the desired goal, where one can adapt to accommodate high dose of electron flux by storing and dissipating the charges per the designed time constants chosen for the material design. Under this new suggested approaches for the validation, the adaptive TCMS and ESD capable thermal control material system is allowed to accumulate as much charge as possible through a designed storage mechanism with the goal of maintaining surface voltage to acceptable small values, and with possible elimination of the dielectric breakdowns, and the electrical discharges. To fulfill this goal of the solicitation, various efforts for the validation of the TCMS designs are suggested to provide good passive thermal control performance by providing: low space stable Solar Absorbtance, &amp; high thermal emittance, good adhesion to various technologically important substrates and thermal cycling resistance for the needed operational temperature limits set by the mission orbital needs, along with the needed good electrical properties to assure low acceptable surface charging using currently available space stable material systems. The concepts that are adaptable to the current second surface mirror technology in conjunction with the suggested transparent space stable multilayer ceramic capacitor stack for the charge storage are also being considered for the validation. Finally, the suggested material design are expected to be validated to meet reliability needs of the space environment for a typical ten year mission lifetime and conform to the mission space qualification requirements including high vacuum, microgravity, radiation, atomic oxygen, low out gassing, and high launch loads. We anticipate the validation to be successful based on phase I results and also because most of the suggested material components are chosen from the materials that have been either already qualified as space materials or have some heritage of been flown on some missions for other intent.  BENEFIT:  Military Application:   Many DOD space and avionics systems, including communications and navigation satellites, could benefit from increased protection from the effects of space weather.   Commercial Application:   Space, avionics and terrestrial commercial systems, including satellites, aircraft avionics and automobiles, could benefit from sever space weather protection systems. Success in charge storage concept may open various market sectors due to the appeal of device technology for light weight and ultra high charge storage density along with the involved very small charging &amp; discharging times.",

Real-time hardware prototypes incorporating these algorithms will be developed in a two-step process. The first-generation BECAUS prototype, based on off-the-shelf field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology, will be capable of backend error correction of signal bandwidths up to 700 MHz, and input data rates up to 32 Gbps. The second-generation prototype, based on a custom application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), will extend the signal bandwidth capability to over 10 GHz, with input data rates exceeding 160 Gbps. POC will collaborate with the leading manufacturer of superconducting ADCs for this effort, ensuring a timely transition of the BECAUS technology to Navy software-defined receiver applications.",

        "abstract": "In this Phase II SBIR project, Daniel H. Wagner Associates will develop a full-scale prototype Feature Aided Association Module (FAAM) that will improve the accuracy of Track Management or Data Fusion systems when processing measurement data containing non-kinematic or feature information. FAAMs processing of the feature information will significantly improve the ability of the Track Management or Data Fusion system to create hypotheses that are more likely to contain the correct correlation decisions and to more accurately estimate the probabilities of correctness for each hypothesis. The underlying technical mechanism by which FAAM treats the feature information is a Bayesian Network (BN) based on the taxonomy of air targets and the types of measurements available for estimating the various attributes that characterize the targets. This BN estimates the identification/classification of each track, which permits a more accurate calculation of the association likelihood between a given track and a sensor measurement containing feature data. In Phase II, we will enhance FAAM to reflect more realistic sensors and taxonomy, to accommodate the processing of dependent data, and to use ID/classification evidence derived from kinematic data.",

Millions of people are infected every year, and thousands of fatalities are attributed to this disease. American military personnel and their allies currently stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan are being infected with leishmaniasis. An effective strategy to prevent the spread of this disease would be to determine whether the local sand fly population carries the pathogens, and if so, to use effective pest control methods to eradicate these populations. This could be an important strategy for controlling outbreaks, and for using pesticides responsibly to avoid potentially polluting the soil, air, and water. This would also mitigate the development of insecticide-resistant pathogens. The Phase I work conclusively demonstrated the technical feasibility of developing a highly sensitive lateral flow test strip to simultaneously detect both Leishmania infantum and Leishmania major. Phase II work involves optimizing the test strips to achieve greater detection sensitivity (85%) and specificity (90%), developing a complete field test kit, conducting an independent evaluation of the test strips, and conducting stability testing. Optimized test kits to perform 1,000 assays will be delivered to the contractor by the end of Phase II.",

Synthetic elements may also be used to fill in for failed sensors. The ability of a passive synthetic aperture sonar (PSAS) towed array system to achieve the performance of the equivalent fully populated array depends on the temporal and spatial coherence of the observed signals. In Phase I, we developed a mathematical framework for analyzing the PSAS system that takes into account the statistical properties of realistic broadband and narrowband signals and noise, developed a set of signal processing algorithms, and analyzed their performance on simulated data. The results showed that coherent processing gains are possible for narrowband signals, but the performance degrades to the performance of the physical array as the signal bandwidth increases. In Phase II, we will continue to develop the PSAS model and derive new signal processing algorithms to handle missing elements, multiple signals, and model uncertainties. The algorithms will be tested on simulated and real data and implemented in an architecture that is suitable for final system integration and deployment.",

To assist the retrofitted technologies, control software will be required to coordinate hardware efforts and reduce overall fuel consumption. Accordingly, our Phase I focused on the development of mathematical models, methodologies, and strategies for optimized power generation and allocation within an integrated shipboard system.

The significance of this innovation is the use of lidar sensors mounted above the water surface. Lidar is a mature technology that has been proven in numerous applications, including but not limited to airborne mine countermeasures. By mounting the sensors above the water surface the system is not susceptible to physical damage from debris, and issues involving cavitation from submerged systems will be completely negated. Further, the proposed innovation will overcome the physical limitations of sonar-based systems and provide the Navy with a robust and reliable solution that enhances the collision-avoidance capabilities of go-fast boats, RHIBs, and other manned and unmanned vehicles operating in near-shore and riverine environments. For example, lidar is extremely reliable at detecting sub-surface threats near the water surface whereas sonar has difficulty distinguishing legitimate collision-threats at the sea surface, particularly with respect to shallow draft vessels encountering floating or near-surface obstacles.",

To provide the highest quality data to stakeholders, systems should be calibrated by measuring the receive antenna pattern. For the typical HF radar, this measurement is currently made with a portable transponder on a boat 1-2 km away.  This method, while robust, is costly and limited by sea conditions. We demonstrated in Phase I that by associating AIS vessel identifications, which provide ship positions, with vessel radar echoes in HF radar data it is possible to reproduce the antenna pattern. The objective of Phase II research is to implement the method operationally. The prototype will consist of software to acquire AIS ship data and combine it with HF radar cross-spectra to produce antenna pattern measurements and their statistics.

Our computational models will use generative and descriptive data models to extract names from recognition results that may contains significant error.

Pathogenic viruses continue to devastate many fish and shellfish operations every year (ICES Mariculture Committee 2004, Lightner 2011).  To date, vaccines against aquatic animal viruses have generally provided poor protection, are too expensive, and/or must be injected intramuscularly (e.g., DNA vaccines).  In response, we will expand and intensify development of innovative biological adjuvant systems initiated in our Phase I trials.  We discovered that unique natural marine and terrestrial micro-structures bound to viral antigens can be delivered to gills and mucosal surfaces of salmon to boost specific immune responses against a viral pathogen.  We use a nanotechnology-based dynamic light scattering laser instrument to verify attachment of viral antigens or DNA vaccines.  Interferon-associated genes and specific antibody titers will be measured by quantitative PCR, ELISA, and virus neutralization tests.  Needle-less, immersion immunizations with test formulations will be assessed in fish for safety and efficacy.  Multiple, additional in vivo pathogen challenges will be conducted to evaluate new prototype vaccines for relative efficacy and commercialization potential in Phase III field trials.  ",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Space Computer Corporation (SCC) proposes to address two challenging problems that arise in the operation of space-based electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) sensor systems:  (a) On-orbit refinement and maintenance of sensor calibration, and  (b) Accurate geo-location of terrestrial imagery acquired from a space platform.  Our approach addresses both key areas identified in the SBIR topic solicitation by leveraging novel scene-based algorithms for which we developed proof-of-concept examples and processes during the Phase I program.  These concepts have the potential to be automated in on-board processor hardware. Successful development of these methods for space-based remote sensing applications would significantly reduce the timescales required to provide high-fidelity, precisely located image products from sensors deployed for Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) missions.  The proof-of-concept methods developed under the Phase I program were applied to surrogate airborne data as well as ARTEMIS imagery.  These methods are adaptable beyond hyperspectral imagers to other imaging modalities including push broom, whisk broom, staring, step stare, and other types of imagers.  The additional modalities will be developed under the Phase II program.  A stand-alone prototype implementation will be built to demonstrate the performance.  An embeddable prototype will also be developed to demonstrate maturity and flight readiness of the software.  BENEFIT:  Successful development of these methods for space-based remote sensing applications would significantly reduce the timescales required to provide high-fidelity, precisely located image products from sensors deployed for Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) missions.  Automated methods for precision pointing and geo-location calibrations is also directly applicable to existing sensor systems, such as SPIRITT, HYCAS, and COMPASS, as well as those under development, such as ACES-HY.  Scene-based radiometric calibration would also apply to these and other sensors.  We anticipate that future space-based images, including potential flight experiments will make use of the investment by the Air Force into this technology.  In addition to addressing pressing needs for DoD applications, commercial use of space-based imagery for GIS applications would also present a transition opportunity for the technology developed under this SBIR program.  We anticipate that our product will be useful to commercial imagery providers for both space-based and airborne imagers.  The commercial approach is to provide the tools and services to the sensor providers as opposed to consumers of the imagery.  The technology and software may be sold or licensed to these providers under our commercialization plan.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Microbial contamination in kerosene based aviation fuels has been a problem for the USAF since the 1960&quot;s. Antimicrobial effect of earlier used fuel system icing inhibitor (FSII) became an initial solution to this problem, but later, such fuel additives were banned due to their extreme toxicity towards humans.  Newer FSIIs, being more eco-friendly, do not possess the antimicrobial properties of their predecessors. Moreover, in the absence of any biocidal additive, the persistence and tenacity of the problem of microbial presence in kerosene based aviation fuels aviation fuel is ever-growing. Microbial contamination in fuel leads to filters clogging, fuel degradation, and accelerated corrosion. The damage caused along with the increase in maintenance cost because of this is unacceptable. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) hold great promise for solving filtration and separation issues for this application. The successful completion of Phase 1 has provided a highly effective MWNT based microbial filtration media. This media if coupled with the MWNT water/fuel separation media will eliminate water, a breeding ground for microbes, as well as microbes at comparatively low pressure drops.  BENEFIT:  The societal benefits include cleaner fuels, longer injector/ filter/ engine life, better combustion of aviation fuel, lower maintenance costs, new jobs, new products for export, and much more.   The anticipated market size for such a product is greater than $500M in a current total fuel filtration market of greater than $2B annually. The USAF is expected to be a major customer for the type of products obtained through this research and development. Likely customers, other than US military are large oil and gas companies, commercial aviation industries, and fuel storage/ transportation/ distribution agencies. Such a product would find application at various places in the supply chain network of aviation fuel, in particular and other fuels, in general.     Also, the research proposed here would also lead to future research in removing microbial contamination in fuels other than kerosene based ones, e.g. biodiesel and ultralow sulfur diesel fuel.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Weapon systems or other high value electrical systems within the US military are all subject to wiring faults and degradation.  Additionally, weapon systems are kept in service longer because of shrinking defense budgets, further compounding the risks associated with wiring systems.  The ability to detect and provide the location of existing wiring problems or pending failures is critical.  LiveWire Test Labs demonstrated during SBIR phase I that its Spread Spectrum Time Domain Reflectometer technology provided critical wiring diagnostic information and proved viable the use of this technology to detect and report the location  of intermittent faults and anomalous electrical system conditions.  Under SBIR Phase II LiveWire will develop an integrated weapon system diagnostic solution that will operate in real-time and provide wiring system health data within realistic weapon system operating conditions. The research will focus on maximizing intermittent fault location accuracy and providing a reactive coupling technique as specified by the Air Force. Additionally, LiveWire will address platform specific issues such as communication protocols, wiring topography, source and load characteristics, and existing prognostic indicators or metrics.  The integration of spread spectrum reflectometry into a weapon system will be fully demonstrated and specified, ultimately leading to implementation on specific high value systems within the US military arsenal.  BENEFIT:  LiveWire has developed cutting edge technology that operates in&quot;real-time&quot;to detect and locate intermittent fault conditions in live sensitive and high noise environments (e.g. live LV and MV electrical power lines, communication lines, sensor lines, as well as other cable and wiring applications).

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This Proposal is on development of chemistry of mixtures of methylphenanthrenes  (I) as a media for hydrogen storage. Previous research, performed in Phase I, have established the routes by which such mixtures can be generated. Their hydrogenation over Ru catalyst has been shown to result in perhydro derivatives (II). An analysis based on measured properties of those hydrogenated mixtures demonstrated that they satisfied the DOE 2010 requirements for the hydrogen storage material due to their high hydrogen content and other properties such as low melting points, high boiling points, non-flammability, and low toxicity.  The purely chemical part of the Phase II will concentrate on such aspects as 1) Search for an inexpensive source of I; 2) Study on transformation of the alkanes II back into I with concominant hydrogen evolution; 3) Study of an aerial oxidation of the I into methylphenanthrenequinones III and utilization of the released heat to drive the dehydrogenation process II &amp; #8594;I; 4) Hydrogenation of III into II that will recycle the hydrogen storage media. An engineering part will concentrate on building up a series of prototype devices of increasing complexity that will evolve hydrogen from II. The simplest reactors will use an outside source of heat (like heating mantle) to drive the endothermic dehydrogenation process; more advanced devices will utilize the heat from the oxidation process I &amp; #8594;III to drive the dehydrogenation reaction. An ideal reactor will combine dehydrogenation and oxidation steps performed in different compartments for the continuous generation of hydrogen.   BENEFIT:  If sucesfull this hydrogen storage technology could revolutionize the battlefield as well as civilian infrastructure transitioning to a hydrogen economy.  This Phase II program will demonstrate a viable liquid chemical storage of hydrogen that can use existing liquid fuel infrastructure to achieve greater than 5% hydrogen by weight system capability for existing and future hydrogen fuel cell applications. Ideally this technology could eliminate petroleum based combustion fuels from use in the field.",

In Phase II we will work with the government sponsor to integrate AVESA into the Robotic Collaboration ATO Soldier Machine Interface (SMI) (or another SMI as determined by government sponsor). Using an SMI with AVESA, a soldier can command a small robot to enter and search a structure and return to its original location. During and upon completion of its mission, the visualization and mapping data collected by sensors aboard the robotic platforms will be transmitted and displayed to the SMI. AVESA is designed to work with a variety of sensors; while cameras form the base of the visualization tool, if a LADAR is present on the robot, then that information will be able to be displayed as well. The soldiers are then able to analyze the information prior to entering the structure.

The technology will accommodate a variety of input and output options: Input: (1) typing, (2) scanning, (3) screen text transfer, (4) sensor-enabled glove (the AcceleGlove?), (5) 3-D camera, (6) speech recognition; and Output: (1) text, (2) sign graphics, (3) sign video clips, (4) speech. The Instant ASL Communication System, as it is called, has two access modes: DVD, Web or local server-based access. This hardware/software system also will enable the user to edit, print, select appropriate signs when more than one match the English word and vice versa, ?hide? signs when support is not wanted, retrieve sign graphics/videos through an index, and generate flashcards and sign/word matching worksheets. The product will include a translation lexicon of 24,000 English words/phrases and 8,000 signs. Many deaf children are challenged by reading since this process largely depends on auditory understanding. Teachers of the deaf frequently reinterpret text into ASL or enhance it with signs to render it more comprehensible to their students. Research has shown that incorporation of signs with text provides a multimodal approach to the development of early literacy skills that utilizes multiple intelligences and learning styles. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is largely reflected in its effect on the Deaf community and those who interact with them. ASL is a visual/gestural language distinct from English. Many deaf people who rely on sign language do not have good facility with English. Because English is an auditory mediated language that depends upon phonological code, reading achievement scores of deaf children usually fall far short of those found among hearing children of comparable abilities. An interesting aspect of the low reading skill levels displayed by deaf students is that while they may not understand a sentence in print, they may understand it perfectly presented in ASL. This product will be tremendously useful to teachers, business personnel, speech/language pathologists, etc. who have a need to support understanding of English text with ASL signs for purposes of literacy improvement, curriculum enhancement, or communication. This product will enable English users to type, scan text, or paste screens text and have output in text with ASL graphics and/or video support. Inversely, deaf users will be able to sign to it and obtain English text and audio output. As a server-based translation service, there will be considerable impact on the ability of deaf individuals to be integrated into society at large for employment, education, and social purposes. Improvements to the AcceleGlove? will have implications to other fields of R &amp; D, such as robotics, telemedicine, virtual reality, and defense.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to continuously produce multilayered microcellular from recycled polyethylene terephthalate (RPET) for rigid printing substrate applications. There is an increasing demand for sustainable substrates in the printing sector, which is America&#039;s third largest manufacturing industry. PET is the most recycled plastic in the United States. However, only 28% of the 5.15 billion pounds of water bottles used annually are currently recycled. Products made from RPET could utilize this untapped resource and in turn, could be recycled again, making them environmentally sustainable. The proposed approach is to fusion bond thin microcellular RPET sheets into thicker panels, thereby eliminating the need for a bonding adhesive, which in turn eliminates volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions that cause indoor air pollution. In Phase I of this project we established lab-scale feasibility for continuous fusion bonding of microcellular RPET sheets to produce such panels. In Phase II, we will build a production-scale laminator that is capable of producing microcellular RPET panels with a size of 4&#039; x 8&#039; at a speed of at least 8 feet/minute. The commercial feasibility of manufacturing this product will be established by developing a detailed cost model. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to satisfy the printing industry&#039;s rapidly growing need for sustainable products. The microcellular RPET panels to be developed are targeted for use in rigid printing substrate applications. Compared to current materials, the advantages of these panels include significantly higher post-consumer recycled (PCR) content, zero VOCs, premium printability without the need for surface treatment, enhanced barrier properties against mold/mildew/corrosion, excellent conformability, and compatibility with end-of-life recycling. The Phase II research will focus on using RPET as a raw material due to the immediate positive environmental and economic impacts. The resulting increase in the use of RPET in high-value applications will thereby provide an economic stimulus to the recycling industry. The results of this research will also expand the application frontiers for solid-state microcellular plastics technology and enable collaborative research to develop further markets for these lightweight materials in other industries such as construction, transportation, and maritime. Finally, the new technology resulting from this research will preserve resources for a sustainable environment, enhance the competitiveness of the US plastics industry, and create new job opportunities that will benefit society as a whole.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to continue the development of carbon-ceramic membranes with excellent propylene/propane separation performance. The membranes serve as the enabling technology to be used in an environmentally benign and economically viable membrane process to separate propylene from propane for a variety of important petrochemical and refining processes. These composite membranes contain thin selective layers of a newly-developed microporous carbon material. The rigid structure of the material confers the membranes with exceptional resistance to plasticization. This allows the membranes to retain high mixed-gas selectivities at challenging industrial conditions. The mixed-gas propylene/propane selectivities and stability of the membranes achieved in Phase I work are far superior to those of previously examined polymer and facilitated transport membranes under industrially relevant conditions. In Phase II work, membranes developed in Phase I will be further optimized, and then used to produce prototype commercial-size modules for propylene/propane separations. In addition, this research is expected to increase general understanding of carbon-ceramic membranes and their potential for use in an array of other chemically and thermally challenging gas separations that are not possible with conventional polymeric membranes. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the use of the new carbon membranes for propylene recovery from polypropylene and propylene derivative reactor purge streams. This technology has important economic potential, considering the large volumes of propylene, polypropylene and other propylene derivatives produced annually in the petrochemical industry. With successful development and demonstration of the membrane-based processes, their potentially much larger applications include propylene/propane separations for monomer production at steam crackers and recovery of propylene from fluid catalytic cracker off-gases in refineries. The cost of making ceramic membranes is higher than that of polymeric membranes, but the savings from lower process energy requirements will easily outweigh the increased membrane costs. If successful, the new membranes will make membrane-based olefin/paraffin separations technically and economically attractive for use in conjunction with, or in place of, distillation.",

But some foods, such as chocolate, dairy products, meat, and spices, contain components that inhibit the PCR assay. Current strategies for rapid pathogen testing in these foods include long cultural enrichment steps followed by dilution of inhibitors and/or labor intensive sample preparation (DNA extraction) to remove inhibitors. Inhibition-resistant DNA polymerases and food-specific PCR enhancers represent elegant, high-tech alternatives to dilution or DNA extraction. They could be integrated into existing rapid-detection systems to facilitate rapid accurate testing in inhibitory foods. The broader impacts of this research are reducing the number and severity of outbreaks of food-borne illnesses in the United States due to early detection of food-borne pathogens. Faster, more accurate detection of pathogens will save time and money for food manufacturers, and reduce the need for costly product recalls. Technology developed here could also extend the disciplines of forensics, where recovery of small amounts of DNA in the presence of a variety of inhibitors is critical, and national defense, where rapid detection of biological agents used as weapons could save lives.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further develop a two-terminal, electronically-programmable, nonvolatile memory array using materials commonly found in integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing. Each element is smaller than a single transistor and is formed using standard IC layers. This results in a three-dimensional (3D) integrated memory (3DIM) architecture achieved using a single substrate without need to assemble multiple die or wafers together with advanced bonding techniques. The ON/OFF conductance ratio and switching speed of these devices exceed the performance of competing technologies. Current flows through nanometer-sized regions of the device, and, as a result, the memory elements will scale to smaller dimensions without reducing the current through the device, thereby resulting in a dense memory array architecture with improved signal-to-noise ratio for each subsequent IC technology. The proposed overall program will include integrating a passivation layer, connecting each element with an isolation diode, optimizing device architecture to minimize footprint, and implementing 3DIM control and drive interface electronics. The program proposed herein addresses the topic by providing material innovations for improved performance in electronics where nano-scale semiconducting filaments are fabricated within a dielectric material for commercial data storage applications. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project are in the areas of microelectronics chip manufacturing for wireless, mobile internet and other portable devices using nonvolatile memory. Memristive device arrays impact numerous commercial markets including flash and embedded memory, and offer orders of magnitude more density as compared to conventional memory. By implementing massively dense 3D memory array architecture on a single substrate, there is no need to fabricate multiple substrates and bond them together, thereby simplifying the fabrication process, reducing manufacturing cost and increasing yield. In addition to portable devices, the proposed device may find applications in space-based earth sciences and astronomy since it is tolerant to x-ray and heavy ion radiation. Some recent approaches to achieve 3D memory on a single substrate have not been successful due to problems with external fields causing bit errors and low signal-to-noise ratio, or because device operation is based on thermal, ionic transport, or phase-change mechanisms that are inherently slow. The proposed memory elements are controlled using electrical signals rather than thermal or chemical energy, making them highly efficient and faster than competing technologies. Memory arrays will be fabricated in a commercial foundry and scaled to smaller dimensions throughout the Phase II project.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and test real-time process monitoring systems to support manufacturing of miniature digital cameras. Rapid growth in unit volume of digital cameras for cellphones and consumer goods has outpaced the industry?s manufacturing process monitoring technology. Except for simple pass/fail outgoing quality tests, high volume camera manufacturers lack any system for in-line, real-time monitoring of production errors that cause low yields, high production costs, and delay new product introduction. The Real-time Camera Analysis and Process Tracking algorithm, ReCAPT, integrates with existing production equipment to identify manufacturing errors and trends before product quality is compromised. ReCAPT leverages outgoing QC data, along with novel design-aware algorithms to identify assembly and fabrication errors and improve the manufacturing process. The Phase II objectives include optimizing the data collection hardware and pre-processing software, automating and generalizing the algorithm initialization, and integrating ReCAPT into the production environment through improvements to the algorithm?s robustness. With a key commercialization partner, ReCAPT will be tested multiple times in actual production environments with potential customers reviewing the results. The results will determine the achievable improvement in production efficiency, and quantify ReCAPT?s economic value to manufacturers of digital cameras. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project involves improving yields in the production of miniature camera lenses. Over one billion miniature digital cameras produced annually supply the explosive growth in cell phones and other mobile consumer electronics. The pursuit of cost reduction has led to development of wafer-level manufacturing where thousands of camera lenses are simultaneously fabricated, affixed to a wafer of image sensors and then diced ? potentially eliminating the need for individual component assembly. By improving yields and lowering costs, ReCAPT will enable the rapid adoption of wafer-level and other automated, capital intensive camera manufacturing technologies. The broader impact is the development of manufacturing technologies that rely on automation and precision engineering instead of manual labor, enabling US companies to gain traction in the growing $15 Billion annual digital camera market. The statistical manufacturing process data supplied by ReCAPT enables real-time control of manufacturing, reduces new product risk, and allows more aggressive development of innovative camera technology. Sold as an enhancement to existing automated manufacturing equipment, the ReCAPT software product will increase profit for component manufacturers, improve product performance and performance consistency for consumer goods manufacturers.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will produce a commercial prototype of a new 3-dimensional (3-D) imaging technology capable of measuring 3-D surface profiles up to five orders of magnitude faster than existing techniques. 3-D imaging technology is increasingly used for many applications, but current approaches have slow acquisition speeds and cannot accurately measure certain types of objects and scenes. The proposed technology will dramatically advance the state of the art in 3-D imaging speeds from a few Megapixel frames per second up to MHz frame rates without sacrificing metrological precision. At the same time, this approach enables surface profilometry of objects and scenes that are difficult or impossible to measure with existing techniques. The approach uses an innovative projection system to illuminate a scene with patterned light and simultaneously acquire multiple images of the scene. The 3-D image is reconstructed from the acquired images using novel, robust, pixel-independent algorithms that improve accuracy for diverse illumination, object reflectivity characteristics, and minimize the number of images required for an object-independent reconstruction. This Phase II program will build on successful Phase I feasibility demonstrations to produce a complete system suitable for beta deployment at a customer site. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will emerge when the technology is used in applications that boost productivity, increase security, improve health, and advance the progress of science. Commercialization will initially target the research market, where scientists and engineers studying mechanics, aerodynamics, robotics, and ballistics require the ability to image dynamic systems in 3-D to validate models, to provide feedback in the design process, and to verify performance of prototype designs. A second target market is manufacturing, where trends towards 100% testing and increased use of 3-D measurements will drive the need for high-speed 3-D imaging capability to improve efficiency, quality, and yield. Beyond these markets, the proposed technology could serve a variety of other unmet needs for high-speed 3-D imaging, such as facial recognition, haptic vision for the blind, robotic navigation and object recognition, entertainment, and others. Because the proposed technology offers unprecedented measurement capabilities in terms of speed, resolution, and versatility, it holds the potential to reveal new phenomena that were previously inaccessible, giving researchers a new tool for understanding our dynamic 3-D world.",

The intellectual merit of this project is in its use of an innovative approach to positioning, mapping, and ablation for atrial fibrillation patients, negating the need for excessive catheter rotations and/or serial point ablations. This new technology significantly reduces user variability, procedural time, and the resultant cost burden on the hospital, physician, insurance payer, and patient. The research objectives for this project are to design and develop an improved prototype that enables verification of balloon-to-tissue contact; design and develop a 2nd generation radiofrequency generator capable of powering 20 electrodes; refine catheter design to increase reliability/robustness and sheathing capability; and develop 2nd generation handle that allows for the balloon extension. All of these changes will be validated through in vitro and in vivo testing. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is an improvement in the treatment of atrial fibrillation, which is the most common heart rhythm disturbance encountered in clinical medicine, accounting for 1/3 of hospital admissions for cardiac rhythm disturbances. It is estimated that nearly 2.6 million individuals are currently afflicted with atrial fibrillation in the United States, with a projected increase to nearly 4.4 million people by the year 2030. Given the significant public health and economic impact of atrial fibrillation, there is an urgent need for practical and cost-effective approaches to treat atrial fibrillation. This technology aims to answer this need, providing an improved method of treatment for patients as well as highly-marketable technology that will save hospitals time and costs burdens.",

These films and products should remain free of EA** when extracted by common solvents and food simulants, and remain EA**-free after the stresses of manufacturing and exposure to common-use stresses (microwaving, thermal cycling, and UV light).

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop and commercialize cost-effective high performance macromolecular antioxidants based on Polnox&#039;s proprietary &quot;dual type moiety per molecule&quot; (DT-mPM) technology for sustainable-alternate bio-oils. Oxidative stability presents a key issue for industrial bio-oils. These oils, which are derived from bio-resources, have inferior stability compared those derived from fossil fuels. In particular, fuels and lubricants derived from plant-based polyunsaturated fatty acids are especially prone to severe oxidation. It has been demonstrated in Phase I that the DT-mPM antioxidants are significantly more effective in combating degradation of these bio-oils vs. state-of-the-art commercial antioxidants. The current, state-of-the-art, commercial antioxidants do not meet the challenges posed by plant-derived bio-oils. Current antioxidants were developed to protect petroleum lubricants and are simply not capable of meeting the stability issues posed by bio-lubricants. This proposal addresses the key steps involved in the product development of antioxidants for bio-lubricants; namely, (a) molecular design optimization, (b) cost-effective process scale up, (c) preparation of pound scale of lead antioxidants identified in Phase I, and (d) product storage stability. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to play an important role in reducing the nation&#039;s dependence on foreign oil and providing a cleaner environment by reducing the pollution of air, soil, water, and the eco-system. Societal benefits from the increased use of bio-lubricants include less potential for environmental pollution (e.g., from loss during use or improper disposal of waste lubricants, accidental oil spillage during industrial use, or off-shore drilling) as well as reduced dependence on imported petroleum as a raw material. However, as oils are developed from renewable alternate energy resources, there are some inherent issues to be addressed: (1) thermo-oxidative stability, and (2) pour-point properties. By addressing the thermo-oxidative stability problem of bio-oils through the development and commercialization of new high performance antioxidants, this will enable the production of higher quality alternate oils that are biodegradable and environmentally safe.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Space systems routinely employ cryptographic protection of their communications links. This is necessary, not only to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information transmitted by or via a spacecraft, but also to protect command and control functions for the spacecraft. Cryptographic services in a spacecraft are generally provided by dedicated box-level encryption control units (ECUs). ECUs currently employed suffer from excessive size, weight, and power consumption, which presents a significant integration obstacle for small spacecraft. This Phase II project will implement an advanced high-performance, low-power, small form factor plug-and-play ECU suitable for employment on space vehicles ranging from tactical satellites down to CubeSats. The size, weight, and power benefits provided by this ECU will conserve resources that may be used to improve payload functionality, mission lifetime, or other objectives, while plug-and-play will enable dramatically shorter and less expensive system integration.  BENEFIT:  Athena will market the ECU product and technology to military and commercial satellite producers. Applications for this technology range from large multi-payload satellites to the smallest experimental space vehicles, and even interplanetary science missions. The ECU technology may also be adapted for terrestrial secure communications applications.",

In Phase I, POC successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed methodology by assembling and testing the prototype, which accurately measures strain distribution on composite coupon surfaces under fatigue and thermal load. The results were used by Materials Research &amp; Design, Inc. in their predictive model to calculate thermal and mechanical strain distributions. In Phase II, POC will optimize the Phase I prototype, advancing it to a full-scale TSSM system with the integrated predictive model, allowing accurate mapping of strain and temperature distribution in a hot, mechanically loaded composite structure and estimating damage progression with a low degree of uncertainty. TSSM capabilities will be demonstrated in inspection of composite structures under conditions experienced in modern gas turbine engines.  The tested Phase II system will be delivered to the Air Force for further evaluation. By the end of Phase II we plan to reach technical readiness level (TRL)-4/5.  BENEFIT:  Beyond quality assurance and quality control of composite structures for military aircraft, where the benefits of this methodology are obvious, TSSM will offer benefits in inspection of composite materials and parts in land-based propulsion and power-generation systems, particularly in the automotive and boating industries.",

        "abstract": "Security in and trust of sensitive information communication has been a critical issue as long as humans have been sending messages, but the increasing reliance on computer networks to transmit sensitive information has brought these matters to the forefront like never before. Old methods of trusted couriers and sealed envelopes are no longer sufficient for todays complex networks where the integrity of paths and destinations cannot be assured. Numerous solutions have been proposed to address these issues, but few have proven effective or tractable, and fewer still have proven to be both. Leveraging its experience in information security, anti-tamper, and data protection, Pikewerks proposes to extend GalaSec, its distributed security and trust system. GalaSec is effective at preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data as it flows across networks, supports integration into existing environments, and provides peers with the ability to verify remote trust across a wide array of platforms and environments. This system will advance the state of the art in secure communication and remote attestation by enhancing cipher key rotation/mutation and remote attestation technology. Following the completion of Phase II, GalaSec will be a TRL 6 product on its way to deployment in real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "With the ongoing involvement of computers in all facets of modern society, both private and public organizations increasingly rely on computer networks to support key portions of their critical infrastructure. Consequently, those networks contain increasingly more sensitive information, making them prime targets for would-be attackers. The goal of a typical intrusion detection system (IDS) is to protect such a network by identifying attempted attacks, alerting administrators of malicious behavior, and defending against known exploits where possible. If a previously unknown exploit is detected, it is often left to the network administrator to manually thwart the attack and protect any uncompromised nodes. Unfortunately, this task can often be tedious and intractable as it may require a deep understanding of the exploited vulnerability and how to correct the underlying system. Pikewerks proposes a high-performance solution capable of detecting and adapting to this increased level of threat. This proposed system will advance state-of-the-art IDS research by functioning as a fully-automated, instruction-level, host-based intrusion detection and prevention system designed to support self-healing, self-hardening network architectures against zero-day exploits.",

Rotary engines, due to their inherently high power density, have become popular as Unmanned Arial Vehicle (UAV) propulsion systems. The rotary engines high specific power places very high loads on critical components, leading to wear which ultimately leads to loss of power and efficiency. The apex seal is a critical component of the rotary engine, used to seal the high combustion pressures. It is also vulnerable to accelerated wear at the high engine speeds typical of UAV applications. The design of apex seals has not changed much since the original designs dating back to the late 1950s. This one single component of the rotary engine has the potential for significant improvement which will result in greater efficiency, power-output and reliability of the engine. Patrick Power Products, Inc.(Patpower) has 12 years of rotary engine development experience, including development of heavy fuel variants of rotary engines. The PatPower engines use conventional apex seals but we are sensitive to the seals limitations and, as such, have developed potential improvement concepts.

It would be beneficial to the tube launched community if the beginning design stages of UAS development included the capability to support multiple sensors, payloads, and launching systems. In this way, expansion of the UAS capabilities or the integration of newly developed subsystems would not require a redesign, yielding a truly adaptable UAS for many payloads and missions. Brock Technologies SHARK UAS refined under this Phase II effort will address these issues with its modular sensor payload bays, extended battery capacity, and quiet propulsion system.

One of the most prevalent operations to remove material, achieve the desired surface finish, or enhance part quality is bulk and finish grinding.  For typical cutting speeds, conventional synthetic or oil-based coolants are sufficient to remove the generated heat; however, as the processing speed is increased to improve productivity, conventional coolants cease to be effective due to film boiling of the liquid coolant and the formation of an air boundary layer around the grinding wheel, preventing coolant penetration into the machining zone.  As a result, the expensive workpiece may need to be scrapped or the process speed decreased, increasing overall cycle time and cost.  Our approach to address this issue is to develop the novel Cryogenic Grinding System (CGS) that uses our proven approach to remove heat from the grinding zone, increase processing speed, and improve part quality.  During Phase I, we will develop a proof-of-concept system, demonstrate its benefits, and plan the scale-up and insertion of the technology.

In the case of 1U CubeSats communications payloads are needed that draw less than 50mW of power.  The Vulcan Wireless LPC-SDR meets these requirements by architecting the radio from the ground up for low power.  The processing and RF front end all needed significant development to meet this performance specification.  The LPC-SDR radio is designed for the Unified S-Band frequency operation.  The form factor will fit a 1U CubeSat form factor and will have a PnP SPA interface to support rapid integration.  Even with this low power the radio is capable of legacy interoperability with USB/STDN ground stations.  More advanced capabilities are also available to the LPC-SDR system such as spectrally efficient waveforms and high data rate downlinks.  BENEFIT:  Low power software defined radios will allow small spacecraft to carry out missions while still using the legacy infrastructure.   With interoperability of small spacecraft with existing infrastructure more mission utility can be gained from this new class of small satellites.

        "abstract": "This project has two objectives: bridge the gap between subscale and full-scale insensitive munitions (IM) experiments, and identify an optimal set of IM subscale tests. Size, shape, and boundary conditions are critical to the outcome of IM tests. Consequently, subscale experiments are insufficient to determine IM properties of munitions. Full-scale experiments are expensive, and can be performed only late in the development cycle. Thus, developers cannot depend on full-scale tests for design optimization, while subscale tests are insufficient. Consequently, conservative designs are adopted. A physics-based coupled thermal-mechanical-chemical model is proposed to resolve this setback. This model can represent complex geometries, boundary conditions, and mix of materials (e.g., energetic component, and inert structural materials such as liner and casing). The scale gap is bridged in two steps. First, the model is applied to simulate subscale tests. Then, having succeeded in the first step, simulate full-scale experiments. The obtained predictions will be deemed reliable because of the generality of the approach, and the success in simulating subscale tests. Having the model will also permit the undertaking of sensitivity analyses of subscale tests. These studies will enable modifying, or replacing, tests so as to better span the performance envelop experienced by full-scale munitions.",

For this project, Yardney has approached making a safer battery by incorporating modeling and testing, and based on that moving forward towards larger cells for Navy applications. Though a goal is to make a Li-ion cell incapable of failing, reality has us accepting a cell failure, but preventing that occurrence from propagating. Improvements include materials internal to the cell to decrease the risk of an event and its magnitude upon such an occurrence, and then considering cell geometry and inter-cell separators to 1) remove that heat as rapidly to a&quot;safe zone&quot;as possible, and 2) to block a majority of the heat from causing a neighboring cell to also reach it&quot;s activation energy for thermal runaway.

This non-traditional system dramatically lowers the mechanical stresses on the towed array while providing great flexibility in control and drive systems. Additionally, this concept is very amenable to various installation locations on the submarine.",

        "abstract": "Emergency position indicating radio beacons (EPIRB) currently have very short operation lifetimes (=48hrs) due to the limited onboard battery power. The ability to harvest ocean energy could greatly enhance the operational lifetime of EPIRB, and hence increase the probability of rapid search, rescue and recovery of crew and equipment.   Trex Enterprises, teaming with Ultra Electronics-Ocean Systems (UEOSI), proposes to develop a self-powered, submarine-deployable EPIRB (SEPIRB) for submarine deployment. The energy capture mechanism will employ a miniaturized version of Trex&quot;s proven wave energy harvesting technology and will be capable of efficiently generating 15W, even at low sea states. The harvested energy will be utilized to directly power a transmitter that relays a situation report and current GPS location to rescue commands at 30-minute intervals. Excess power will be stored in an onboard rechargeable battery to assure uninterrupted operations. To ensure full compliance with SEPIRB functional requirements, Trex plans to team with UEOSI, a recognized leader in undersea defense electronics and the only manufacturer to deliver SEPIRB devices to the US Navy. Under Phase II, Trex will design, demonstrate and deliver two SEPIRB prototypes to NAVSEA.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The accurate tracking of resident space objects (RSO)s depends on the rapid estimation of orbits using the knowledge gained from sparsely sampled observations of satellites under the influence of interacting gravitational, solar radiation pressure and atmospheric drag effects. While there are many established sequential estimators that can perform real-time orbit estimation and provide the associated covariance, the RSO tracking problem presents special difficulties. The current estimation technique tends to be applied with limited tracking data for a wide variety of orbit regimes when there is little or no information included in the estimation process on the RSO&quot;s mass, shape, radiative properties, or attitude. In addition, it is likely that the uncertainty distribution for many RSOs is not Gaussian and cannot be represented accurately by a covariance matrix that has been developed with an assumed Gaussian probability density function. The AGSF algorithm developed under Phase I is designed to be scalable, relatively efficient for solutions of this type, and able to handle the nonlinear effects which are common in the estimation of RSO orbit states. In addition, information theoretic metrics in conjunction with AGSF were examined for data association purposes. The AGSF and corresponding observation association methods were evaluated using simulated data to determine their performance and feasibility. Combined with an innovative space surveillance network (SSN) simulator, these algorithms will be developed and tested for their applicability to improving the speed, accuracy and responsiveness of RSO tracking.     BENEFIT:  Currently, the SSN uses the NORAD SGP4 orbit models for predicting satellite positions that do not have the associated covariance estimates. PDS will provide a performance assessment of utilizing these innovative orbit estimation and RSO track association algorithms developed under this project by testing their accuracy and responsiveness of RSO tracking against realistic use cases generated with an innovative high fidelity space surveillance network (SSN) simulator. Once these algorithms are validated under&quot;real world&quot;simulations, PDS will test and validate these algorithms with actual SSN data. PDS intends to work closely with the Air Force in transferring technology for their critical objectives. The primary DoD end-customer for these algorithms is the JFCC-Space through the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC), which detects, tracks, and identifies all man-made objects in Earth orbit. Through current program experiences, PDS understands the acquisition process involved in transitioning algorithms from concept to validation, development, testing, (SMC SSA Technology Branch) and deliverance of an operational product to the warfighter (AF Space Command).",

In Phase II, we propose to develop and prototype the UPNAV technology with field tests and demos. The key components of the proposed solution include (i) a synchronized timing and asynchronous measurement packer (STAMP), (ii) unified aiding information drives (UAID), and (iii) a reconfigurable integration filtering engine (RIFE). A variety of sensors are encapsulated into classes in the RIFE library, each representing a generic type of sensors (rather than a specific one) defined by the type of measurements they offer for navigation purpose. The plug and play functionality is realized by identifying a new sensor&quot;s measurement type, instantiating a sensor object from its class, and then retransforming the filter. Additional quality control and adaptation measures are applied to ensure transient performance. In Phase II, an operational prototype with a selection of sensors will be built with data collection capability for algorithms tuning, performance evaluation, and finally field demo.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Impact Technologies, LLC, proposes to develop and demonstrate an intelligent and systematic methodology to troubleshooting that aims to improve current practice and expedite the diagnosis/repair cycle. An expert decision support system will be developed to assist the maintainer in navigating through complex system interconnections while reducing the variability of coupled components/subsystems into a well understood series of steps. The enabling technologies borrow from Case Based Reasoning and Model Based Reasoning to integrate troubleshooting practice with technologies from Condition Based Maintenance. The vision is the development of a rigorous and automated diagnosis and troubleshooting system that will optimize maintenance, repair, and overhaul of complex assets.  BENEFIT:  In a typical military or industrial environment, complex systems (machines, aircraft, etc.) experience fault/failure modes that must be diagnosed accurately and rapidly in order to sustain a high level of operational availability. Considerable downtime translates into loss of productivity and increased maintenance costs. Current diagnostic and repair techniques rely on either evidence from a machine&quot;s internal checks (fault indicator light or code) or an alert from the machine&quot;s operator. An&quot;expert&quot;then observes the faulty system, determines the root cause of the problem, and composes a work order to schedule people, tools/equipment, or materials for repair and maintenance. If the problem is not diagnosed correctly and repaired, the troubleshooting and repair task is passed on to other technical personnel until a successful solution to the problem is reached. Unfortunately, these methods often do not offer sufficient information for the accurate and rapid diagnosis of the problem and rely heavily on the experience of the maintenance technician. Additionally, the formal and informal knowledge that the traditional troubleshooting approach relies upon is extremely difficult to maintain due to the transience of the workforce.      Information management technologies, combined with proven techniques for knowledge extraction, evidence-based reasoning, and continuous learning offer a potential solution to this diagnostic dilemma. Impact Technologies, along with experts from the Georgia Institute of Technology, proposes to develop an intelligent and teachable system that learns through experience to provide expert decision support for field maintenance. This intelligent system will, over time, become the&quot;learned expert,&quot;or&quot;esteemed colleague,&quot;to the diagnostician.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Red Flag is a multinational exercise featuring aerial combat flight operations.  Due to the complexity and scope of these exercises, participants require a significant amount of spin-up in advance of their arrival.  Specifically, there are a number of logistical and safety related that a pilot must learn and abide by.  These rules govern ground operations, marshaling, rules of engagement, special instructions, airspace and noise restrictions.  SoarTech brings a complete training solution based on several foundational technology components to that we have developed to address these issues.  During Phase I, SoarTech developed and demonstrated a proof-of-concept prototype of a portable Red Flag practice environment - RedRef.  RedRef is a multi-featured simulation environment with which Red Flag pilots can rehearse representative scenarios, perfecting their understanding of and adherence to Red Flag domestics so that they are proficient prior to the actual Red Flag exercise.  Key components of this prototype included an integrated flight simulator, autonomous synthetic aircraft, interactive controller elements, and embedded knowledge for detecting conflicts. The RedRef prototype will be a distributable software package that can be easily be installed and used by international Red Flag participants, which includes a medium for loading newly authored scenarios by Red Flag personnel.  BENEFIT:  he prototype developed as a result of this effort is specifically targeted by the customer as a tool for multinational participants of Red Flag exercises.

AFRL runs several exercises each year involving combat flight training research, such as the Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) research program, which could benefit from a pre-program trainer such as RedRef.

        "abstract": "In Phase I of this SBIR program, QuesTek successfully demonstrated a novel thermomechanical processing technique to enhance the bending fatigue resistance of Ferrium C64 steel. A systems-engineering approach was followed to identify key microstructure attributes (e.g., nonmetallic inclusions) that control the mean and minimum fatigue resistance of the aforementioned steel. Through carefully devised experiments, QuesTek successfully optimized the thermomechanical process. Coupon scale fatigue testing was pursued to demonstrate enhancement in fatigue resistance.In Phase II, QuesTek proposes to build on the Phase I effort to scale up the thermomechanical process to actual test gears. Furthermore, QuesTek will attempt to optimize the thermomechanical processing for other steels of interest to ARMY such as AISI 9310, pyrowear X53, Ferrium C61 and Ferrium M54. Both single tooth bending fatigue and axial fatigue tests will be performed to demonstrate property enhancement. Additionally, mechanistic process modeling specifically targeting hot deformation such as forging and other thermomechanical processing will be identified and implemented; the model is envisioned to provide support to framing key processing parameters that maximizes fatigue resistance. The envisioned thermomechanical process will be complementary with other fatigue-enhancing processes such as peening.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Air Force has established a target of making space photovoltaic (PV) systems, lighter, less complex but also more efficient, robust and lower cost than present generation space cells.  With multi-junction cells being the candidate of choice, Eclipse proposes to optimize and demonstrate its transparent conductor technology (EclipseTEC/PVTEC) materials as a new electrode, displacing expensive other conductors (such as indium-tin oxide) used in many thin film devices, with the benefit of being able to be tailored to maximize transmission at precise UV, visible, and near IR wavelength(s) of interest.  In this program, Eclipse Energy Systems proposes to optimize its visibly transparent metal-like self-structured conductor with plasmonic waveguide effect technology as a superior, low cost conductor for solar cells.  During the phase II effort, the Eclipse PVTEC will be matured via modeling and process optimization for one or more specific PV multi-junction cells.  The goal of the program is to minimize the absorption and reflection of the top surface PV metallization system and maximize the efficiency of each PV cell.  Metallization absorption of ~2-3% or less, 100 ohms/sq sheet resistance and transmission of 80% or better (95%+ as a goal) at the wavelengths of interest.  BENEFIT:  The commercialization of the PVTEC conductor could go into many markets including space, military, civilian and domestic power application for utility power. Eclipse&quot;s initial partnership is with Emcore to replace their metal based cell metallization with PVTEC.   This could increase the efficiency of the cell to about 34%. This would reduce array size and overall weight of the satellite system. The volume of this marked is projected to increase as shown in Figure C1. Eclipse would provide the technology through some type of licensing agreement with Emcore. Equipment and manufacturing process development for manufacturing would be done jointly by Eclipse and Emcore. For terrestrial applications the PVTEC metallization could be designed to fit several terrestrial solar cells giving increased efficiency. Emcore is in the terrestrial solar cell business too, so we could easily transition to that type of cell. Most of these systems are utility based for power generation. At a time when we have completed our work on space cells, we will endeavor to look at the terrestrial cell business. Further applications could be made with other makers of solar cells, but this would require new agreements to be cast. Overall concentrating solar cell market trends are given in Table C1 through 2015.",

We also propose to utilize the context and existing workflow of the warfighter to adapt the visualization and streamline user interfaces to support the need to markup and provide feedback on this data.  Our proposed system, Milieu, will dynamically construct semantic resources by exploiting corroborating evidence from a variety of heterogeneous sources.

The memristor devices can be formed in the interconnect layers of a conventional IC so that the area available for underlying transistors is not affected. This approach results in a 3D architecture achieved using a single substrate without the need for bonding multiple die together with flip-chip or through-silicon-via technologies. Furthermore, the memristor devices are much smaller than single transistors for any given technology node, and will scale to smaller dimensions as IC technology continues to progress towards smaller and smaller transistor sizes. The two-terminal memristor devices have numerous advantages including on/off conductance ratios greater than 104, reversible and fast switching, long retention times and immunity to current-induced degradation. In addition, their inherent simplicity makes them highly compatible with Si-based microelectronics technology, leading to a 3D architecture that can be readily transferred into semiconductor products at the most basic, integrated circuit level.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  A joint experimental and computational project using a carefully designed, flexible test article is proposed to assess the velocity-coupled combustion response of a representative liquid rocket injector element to transverse acoustic disturbances. In the proposed Phase II, the response of an injector flowfield at supercritical pressure conditions will be simulated, measured, and reduced into a combustion response model applicable to current USAF interests in oxidizer-rich staged-combustion (ORSC) engines. The program directly builds upon Phase I feasibility demonstrations, where the experiment and companion high-resolution CFD simulations showed qualitative agreement on the strong interactions between the transverse waves and the injector flowfield. By taking advantage of our significant ongoing studies of the mechanisms that cause longitudinal instabilities in ORSC engines, this proposal offers an unprecedented opportunity for developing a comprehensive nonlinear combustion response model, validated at realistic conditions, that includes both pressure- and velocity-coupling mechanisms.  Key tasks in the proposed effort include the design and fabrication of the experimental combustor; simultaneous and spatially-resolved measurements of the dynamic heat release and flow structures under simulated unstable conditions; hybrid RANS-LES simulations of the experimental configuration and their validation; reduction of the experimental and computational data into approximate combustion response models; and reporting.  BENEFIT:  With the exception of fuel-rich staged-combustion hydrogen-fueled rocket engines, combustion instability has been a problem for essentially every rocket engine. It may be the most severe technical risk for rocket engine development programs. We offer a revolutionary approach to mitigating this risk by exploiting and combining the exponential growth in computing power, advances in computational algorithms, and a recent experimental breakthrough that allows measurement of stability parameters under simulated unstable conditions to obtain and calculate information critically needed for accurate predictions.  This reduction in risk could reduce the rocket engine development time by a factor of five, reduce the cost of engine development by over an order of magnitude, and, perhaps most importantly, help eliminate the severe aversion to risk that has hindered the development and use of truly innovative propulsion devices. If this approach is successful, it will represent a new paradigm in rocket engine development and be used by every engine developer.  Related commercial applications that could use the technology demonstrated here include gas turbine propulsion and power generation, image analysis,  and any other fields that use reduced-order modeling of complex physical phenomena.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project creates a powerful drug discovery technology that uses an innovative fragment-based approach to identify small molecule inhibitors of difficult targets. Though many peptides can disrupt protein-protein interactions, conventional screening technologies are rarely successful at identifying small molecules that do so. In this project peptides are transformed into smallmolecule drugs through an iterative, systematic, empirical screening approach, whereby a small molecule can be evolved to harness key binding properties of peptide-based inhibitors. This proprietary technology, Chemotype Evolution, will be applied to the anticancer target p53-HDM2. The Phase I/IB grant demonstrated that peptides can be deconstructed into baits suitable for performing Chemotype Evolution. In Phase II, Chemotype Evolution will be used to convert these peptide-based baits into novel, potent, completely non-peptidic inhibitors of the p53-HDM2 interaction. Moreover, the flexibility of the technology will be increased by adding additional chemistries. The broader impacts of this research are two-fold. First, the inhibitors discovered could lead to new drugs for treating cancer. Second, their identification will validate a drug discovery technology that can be applied generally to difficult targets. Routine transformation of peptides into small-molecule drugs would create a wealth of profitable opportunities. Scientifically, this technology will advance the field of molecular recognition and provide a rapid and cost effective method for creating chemical probes to investigate biological pathways. The societal impact will be substantial, as the technology will facilitate the discovery of drugs for unmet medical needs, particularly where conventional technologies have failed.",

Algae will be utilized initially for livestock feed and in future for bio-fuel. The project targets an emerging global market for construction of on-farm algae infrastructure. At the consumer level, the market is driven by favorable consumer response to Omega-3 health benefits in meat, milk, cheese and eggs. The broader impacts of this research are: to increase scientific and technical knowledge of algae production for animal feed; to grow, harvest and utilize algae strains that might otherwise be overlooked; to improve consumer health, especially cardio-vascular health, and reduce obesity; to meet the demand for algae in livestock feed; and to construct algae facilities which will be able to expand into bio-fuel production when oil extraction technologies mature. On-farm algae production conserves energy and protects the environment by using less water, fuel, and fertilizer than land-based farming.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an software system directed at financial institutions (lenders and investors) that will provide them with actionable, realtime intelligence into the health of private companies. The technology being developed will scan and parse millions of structured, semi-structured and unstructured information sources searching for signals of a private company&#039;s health. Then, based on context, it will algorithmically process, categorize and assess the sentiment and strength of these disparate signals to offer a comprehensive, coherent and real-time view of a private company&#039;s health, its likely financing needs and best fit financing solutions from a financial institution?s product portfolio. Using the company&#039;s line of products, financial institutions will be able to look at private companies in a fundamentally different, smarter, more scalable and data-driven way that empowers them to efficiently and intelligently make critical financing and capital allocation decisions. Specifically, they will have the potential to able to identify the right private companies in real-time and will be armed with intelligence they can use to offer them appropriate financing solutions. The system&#039;s ability to process a diversity of structured, semi-structured and unstructured information sources and programmatically derive measures of company health would have profound positive effects on the precision, rigor and scalability of institutional lending and investment into private companies. Today, the private company financing market is built on highly imprecise and imperfect heuristics that result in high business loan default rates, or at its worst, bank failures as occurred in 2009. The downstream impact of this is that small businesses do not get the financing they need as evidenced in 2009 when, according to the Federal Reserve, only 40% of private small businesses that sought bank financing actually received the funding they needed. Per the Small Business Administration, businesses with fewer than 500 employees account for more than half the nation&#039;s employment and nearly half of GDP. As a result, it is critical that healthy private companies which are an economic catalyst have access to financing. Unfortunately, without credible, actionable, scalable and real-time information which distinguishes between healthy and unhealthy private businesses, financial institutions remain at an informational disadvantage. This increases their risk, which in turn hinders growing, healthy private companies from receiving the financing they need. If successfully deployed, the technology being supported by this proposal has the potential to make a significant impact in the marketplace.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will complete the development of reusable, self-encapsulated animated characters for use in 3D virtual environments. 3D characters are difficult to develop because of the inflexibility of current motion representations. Presently animations are compiled into characters using a static data structure. This makes the addition of new animations an off-line, time-consuming process. Using extensive motion annotation, our technology allows applications to link together animations at run-time. The end-product objective is a network of 3D mobile applications that run on multitouch-enabled devices like smart phones. The technology enables 1) transfer of characters within a growing network of applications (i.e., &#039;plug and play&#039; characters), 2) user selection of animations to use in each application, and 3) character control through a novel multitouch-based interface. Intellectual merits involve creation of a character authoring and control interface, and analysis of alternative, flexible representations of character animation at the semantic level. This project will have broader impact in three areas. First, multitouch is a new interactive paradigm that will become ubiquitous through the proliferation of smart phones and tablets. This project will investigate multitouch schemes for intuitive control of complex, articulated models such as 3D humanoid figures. Second, this project will advance our understanding of semantic categories for human motion. Such labels are important for motion synthesis and motion recognition. Third, this project will develop methods for building virtual environments incrementally. Virtual environments are used widely in entertainment, training simulations, virtual worlds, and other 3D applications. The company will develop technology for adding new assets in a scalable manner.",

This proposed approach will use atomic layer deposition (ALD) to deposit highly uniform ceramic thin films on commercially available MCCs.  The ALD coating will provide corrosion resistance and erosion protection for the micro-channel, thereby increasing reliability. To increase the strain tolerance of the ceramic coating and eliminate any pinholesin the coating, the micro-channel surface will be pretreated with an organic self assembled monolayer (SAM). The SAM will provide an ideal surface for ALD bonding, improve uniformity by masking surface defects in the metal, and provide compliance for mismatch in thermal expansion coefficient.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Terrorists use a variety of messages, as well as a variety of communications media, to sway impressionable people to their viewpoint. The internet is a very effective emerging medium by which terrorists can spread their ideology. The internet allows propaganda to be disseminated in the form of blog posts, open forums, and multimedia content such as videos. Although the communication models used in propaganda are well-studied, measures of effectiveness relating to the internet have yet to be fully explored.  IST proposes an innovative tool for Measuring Online Use of Social Exchanges for Terrorist Recruiting and Action Propaganda (MOUSETRAP). MOUSETRAP integrates Middle Eastern cultural and communication models into social interaction analysis for measuring the effectiveness of terrorist recruiting and propaganda dissemination.  The social network metrics are tailored for extracting a social network structure from the activity on a blog or forum, and analyzes how the dynamics of this structure aid in propaganda dissemination. The metrics are calculated with respect to a given social context or propaganda content, such as religious doctrine, fear, or culture warfare, thus being able to integrate easily into culturally-specific communication models.    BENEFIT:  There are a broad range of uses for the underlying MOUSETRAP capabilities, spanning several user communities in the DoD, Intelligence Community, and other government and non-government organizations. Each user community will have unique requirements, fortunately our proven approach to systems engineering ensures adaptability. In order to ensure success, Team IST will initially focus on delivering MOUSETRAP to the US DoD PSYOP/MISO community. Preliminary discussions with DoD personnel and research into existing and planned systems show that a system which helps analysts to identify and understand hidden messages and communication models present in terrorist webspace, and the mechanisms by which propaganda spreads online in specific cultures is instrumental in achieving PSYOP/MISO strategic, operational, and tactical objectives, MOUSETRAP will fill this gap.",

        "abstract": "Current minimally invasive surgery and laparoscopic surgery (MIS/LS) training standards encompass only baseline hand-eye coordination and cognitive skills, and do not fully address the surgical skills required to perform particular procedures. To address these issues, the necessary set of surgical skills must be determined, and these skills must be measured objectively. Little is known about the durability of surgical skills, including how skills decay and how to best train and retrain skills to reduce such decay. A skill model and objective measures that reliably assess surgical skill acquisition during training, skill decay when skills are unused, and skill reacquisition during refresher courses can reveal this information. To achieve these objectives, we propose to develop and thoroughly evaluate a Laparoscopic Surgery Training System (LASTS) for learning, refreshing, and assessing LS skills. LASTS uses models of surgical skill acquisition and decay, objective methods of surgical skill assessment, and individual skill and training models to maximize training effectiveness and minimize skill attrition by creating training curricula customized to each surgeon&quot;s abilities. LASTS models are populated with empirical data and validated through a set of experiments with surgeons of many levels of expertise.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop an innovative process which can transform conventional cemented tungsten carbide (WC-Co), the most widely used industrial tool material, into functionally graded cemented tungsten carbide (FG WC-Co). Compared to the homogeneous structure of conventional WC-Co, FG WC-Co has a harder surface and tougher core due to a gradual increase of cobalt content from the surface to the core, which offers considerably higher wear resistance without sacrificing fracture toughness. This combination of mechanical properties leads to the superior engineering performance of FG WC-Co which translates to significantly improved tool life, reliability, and productivity. The broader/commercial impacts of this project will be the potential to replace conventional WC-Co used in numerous manufacturing industries including auto and aerospace manufacturing, oil and gas drilling, geothermal energy exploration, mining, construction, and applications where extreme wear resistance is required. The replacement of conventional WC-Co tool materials with FG WC-Co is expected to lead to significant productivity improvements in these manufacturing industries.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The power converter units on military aircraft currently use relatively low performance aluminum cold plate technology and PAO or fuel coolant to cool the high heat producing components. The thermal resistance between the power electronic components and the coolant is relatively high in these package designs, which forces the coolant to be maintained at a low temperature in order to prevent component failure.  This places a large burden on the thermal controls systems, which use a vapor cycle system to reduce the temperature of the coolant.  In Phase I, Technology Assessment &amp; Transfer (TA &amp; T) analytically demonstrated the advantage of using ceramic cold plates for cooling the power switching modules and advanced cooling designs for the inductors to reduce allow a substantially higher (56  degrees C) coolant inlet temperature.  In Phase II, TA &amp; T will build upon the work performed in Phase I by further developing the component and system design and fabricating power switching modules and inductor components with the advanced thermal packaging designs and high temperature materials.  These components will be tested in an existing power converter unit to experimentally demonstrate the performance advantages.  BENEFIT:  The proposed concepts will enable use of substantially higher coolant inlet temperature compared to current designs.  The higher heat rejection temperature of the coolant increases the heat transfer efficiency and reduces the burden on refrigerated coolant systems on aircraft.  This will enable reduced heat exchanger size and/or additional heat load from higher power or additional electronic components.",

The Meta-modeling Approach to Prognosis using Existing Data offers a crucial link to the implementation of CBM/PHM strategies where currently not possible due to the absence of ground truth. In this approach, existing data serves as the basis for a prognostic model, circumventing more typical lengthy development paths. In doing so, this enables quicker, more cost effective deployment of CBM/PHM technologies and contribution to transformation to predictive maintenance practices.     This approach also serves as the basis for a comprehensive Life Management Framework that includes: data processing/mining, FMECA/RCM methods, data/feature fusion techniques, metamodel design/testing, decision support, performance metrics, and risk assessment/management.  Given the potential benefits, this approach to usage based prognostics will be attractive to military and commercial applications, including, but not limited to ground and air vehicle maintenance/repair organizations, aircraft logistics support centers such as Warner Robins, manufacturing, and other construction/repair facilities.",

        "abstract": "This is a proposal to design a compact visual odometry sensor that can be mounted on unmanned ground vehicles. Visual odometry (VO) is a technique that estimates the ego-motion from images perceived by moving cameras. A self-contained visual odometry sensor would provide several significant benefits to unmanned ground vehicles, including: 1) providing position information to platforms that do not have encoders or other odometry sensors; 2) providing position information in GPS-denied environments; and 3) providing additional position information to supplement existing odometry sensors and mitigate their errors. The use of our odometry sensor will greatly increase the ability of an unmanned ground vehicle to operate autonomously as well as providing additional situation awareness to the vehicle operator. Our system will be self-contained, require no field calibration and operate under a variety of field conditions.",

The PA that was developed in Phase I of this project will be built into a hardware prototype with today&quot;s cutting edge commercial components. The performance objective of 50% is a starting point for this design. With class E operation, our target efficiency is on the order of 70% or greater. To achieve this objective, we will employ envelope tracking (ET) in order to keep the PA near peak efficiency operation. We will also build adaptive predistortion into the RF and baseband design to improve performance even further. While this technology is targeted for handheld operation, it is has applicability in many other areas due to its potential high efficiency and linearity: including the commercial and military radio applications.

        "abstract": "Minimizing corrosion is a constant challenge to the ship design community. Fiber-reinforced polymers are generally corrosion resistant; in fact glass fiber reinforced composites may be fastened or joined with almost any fastener material to metals without fear of galvanic corrosion. However, carbon fiber reinforced composites, which may be necessary to achieve strength and stiffness performance goals, can induce galvanic corrosion in the attached metal structures, or metal fasteners. In this proposal, Materials Sciences Corporation presents a combined analytical and experimental plan for demonstrating the performance potential of hybrid composite structural components of interest to the undersea Navy. Here, the term hybrid is used to describe a composite manufactured using both carbon and glass fibers, either in general layered configurations or discrete transition areas of a structural component. Two important technical issues will be addressed for two out-of-autoclave material processing systems of interest to the U .S. Navy; viz., evaluation of processing induced stresses due to dissimilar material stiffnesses and selection of lamination architectures that provide the best balance of strength and durability. Coupon, element, component and full-scale elements will be manufactured and tested to validate translation of individual material properties to hybrid structures. Results of this program will add to what has been called&quot;Best Practice&quot;design guidance for composite non-pressure hull submarine components.",

        "abstract": "The US Navy is developing an electromagnetic rail gun (EMRG) that can fire inert pro-jectiles with a mass of over 16 kg to a range of 200 nautical miles. The lethality of the weapon is based upon the kinetic energy of the projectile, which will strike the target at a velocity of 1.5 km/sec. The small inert projectiles offer significant logistical advantages because they make it possible to carry many rounds without concerns of chemical propellants or explosive ordnance.       The projectile is exposed to extreme operational conditions. The electromagnetic launch leads to accelerations that approach 50,000 g&quot;s creating large inertial forces. During flight, the projectile reaches speeds of up to Mach 8, thereby generating significant aerothermal heat loads and aerodynamic pressures. The existing projectile design includes an aft skirt that helps to mi-nimize drag and provide aerodynamic stability. The skirt must transfer large acceleration forces from the rail gun armature to the forward projectile body and survive aerodynamic heating and pressures caused by hypersonic flight. Thus a lightweight skirt will need to exhibit very high compressive strengths at ambient temperatures, and adequate structural properties at flight tem-peratures. Attractive materials include metallic-clad ceramics and composites made with large compression-resistant boron or silicon carbide monofilaments.        The Phase I program employed geometry and trajectory data from Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) to develop a thermostructural model of the EMRG pro-jectile. The model includes the effects of the inertial loads caused by launch accelerations and transient temperatures and stresses caused by ascent and reentry. The Phase I effort focused upon two material solutions. The first is a hybrid graphite/boron/ polymer composite made by ITT called HyBor. The second material solution is titanium clad silicon carbide (Ti-clad SiC) made by Exothermics. The HyBor material offers about a 20% theoretical weight savings when compared to Ti-clad SiC. The thermostructural analysis showed that both materials will theoreti-cally survive the inertial loads. The transient thermal analysis showed that the outer surface will reach peak temperatures of 1000 degrees F, and the entire skirt will reach 500 degrees F by the end of flight; temperatures that may lead to decomposition of the HyBor polymer composite. Thus the Phase I effort identified two materials  a lighter weight polymer composite that may degrade during flight and a thermally stable SiC design that results in a weight penalty. The Phase I program included fabrication plates and tubes of each material. MR &amp; D is presently awaiting Phase I op-tion funding to measure preliminary thermal and structural properties.       The proposed Phase II project will build upon the Phase I results by continuing to devel-op the material design and fabrication details, and by fabricating and testing materials and de-signs in simulated thermal and inertial operational environments. In Phase II, the thermostruc-tural model will be updated with measured material properties. It will be modified to include attachment details between the skirt and forward projectile, and load transfer details between the skirt and aft pusher plate. The fabrication effort will address flight ready skirt geometries that match the outer mold line specified by NSWCDD. The effects of transient heating and thermal stresses will be simulated using the laser heating equipment at the Laser Heating Material Evalu-ation Laboratory (LHMEL) at Wright-Patterson AFB. The response to inertial loads will be cha-racterized by conventional gun launches at NSWCDD. The Phase II program will be undertaken by a team of MR &amp; D, ITT, Exothermics, and Southern Research Institute (SoRI). Technical di-rection will be supplied by NSWCDD and the Office of Naval Research (ONR).",

DSR has designed a highly accurate instrumentation sensor configuration that will allow for precise specimen deflection and load measurements as well as provide the necessary servo-loop feedback to the test controls to obtain high-fidelity behavior of the test specimen.    In Phase II, the mechanical, hydraulic, and instrumentation designs conceptually developed in the Phase I effort will be used to build the device and validate its capabilities (using an inert simulant material) under a variety of different conditions.",

The numerical modeling performed in the Phase I program suggests that a class of wideband acoustic waveforms could reduce the vulnerability to echo-repeater decoys while maintaining full sensitivity against actual targets of interest. The proposed waveforms provide unambiguous range response over time delays of at least 10 seconds, countering decoys which replay prior pulses to simulate range pull-in effects. The proposed waveforms also feature dynamically-scheduled frequency hopping, designed to minimize predictability and detectability.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This proposal is for the Phase II continuation of research and development for an Adaptive Interface Management System (AIMS) for Netcentric Supervisory Control of Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.  Our Phase II proposal is based on a full understanding of the problem to be solved and a solid record of achievement in Phase I. The AIMS program goal is to provide a new suite of intelligent agents, decision aids, and task-oriented job performance aids that will enhance the performance of the multi-UAV operator by leveraging his capabilities while reducing workload.  Specifically, AIMS will be a multi-agent system software system with a set of intelligent services that supports a multi-UAV operator in his interaction with multiple UAVs -- and makes is possible for him to do his job much more effectively.  By providing the AIMS capabilities, we will realize enhanced efficiency in mission planning, allocation of mission responsibilities to resources, and continuous UAV decision and control tasks during mission execution.  Our comprehensive Phase II Work Plan provides for: design and implementation of a complete AIMS suite of tools; evaluation in both laboratory and VCSC environments; GIG integration; and creation of a strategy for transition and commercialization of the AIMS products.  BENEFIT:  AIMS technology will find application in a host of military and civilian activities where multiple UAV operations are enablers of mission success and skilled operators are in short supply.  Unmanned aircraft provide means for their operating organizations to expand their situational awareness, to extend their communications reach, and to broaden their ability to project power beyond their organic human-limited capabilities.  These capabilities support a wide range of military activities both in the battlespace and as assistance to the civilian world.  AIMS technology amplifies the supervisory control capacity of the limited cadre of qualified military UAV operators so that they can exercise these capabilities worldwide and over extended periods of time as the mission may require.  Budgets for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) continue to rise.   But despite billions of dollars invested significant problems still exist in command and control, staffing and interoperability.  Consequently, the services have established as goals the development and integration of precisely the kind of capabilities we are proposing based on GAO reports and DoD internal analyses. What this means is that the environment for the present R &amp; D results is being clarified, standardized, and consolidated, allowing us to focus our resources on a single product targeting a small number of very lucrative opportunities.",

Test diagrams show the routing of signals from instruments to Unit Under Test (UUT) pins for each test in an automatic test program which tests a UUT on an Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) and are extremely useful in the troubleshooting of a Test Program Set (TPS). Automating the test diagram generation process will decrease the lengthy time to generate test diagrams by eliminating many hours of analysis of test stations, test programs and associated interface hardware. The Phase I study identified methods to use ATML data to generate test diagrams which provides a much desired open systems approach and will be employed in Phase II. Phase II work will also consist of producing ATML development tools for the ATML Test Station and Test Adapter to assist in the generation of ATML instance files, the resultant files will be used as an input to the test diagram tool. Phase I demonstrated that ATML support tools are essential for cost effective implementation of the ATML standards.",

Its low mass density (1 gm/cm3) is about a tenth of that of copper (8.98 gm/cm3), meaning that by replacing copper conductors and shielding in wiring and cabling can save up to 90% in weight. During Phase I, NanoSonic fabricated prototype cables using Metal Rubber sheet and fabric, measured and documented weight savings up to 90% over metal wire and mesh used in standard military cable designs, demonstrated MIL-STD-1553 data bus communication, confirmed order-of-magnitude weight savings and EMI/EMI shielding performance over standard 1553 triax, and documented exceptional environmental ruggedness. During Phase II, NanoSonic would optimize cable design, fabricate hundreds of meters of prototype cable using a small-scale cable production system, verify electrical and mechanical performance through laboratory testing, and provide test cables for demonstration onboard Army helicopters at Fort Eustis.

A need clearly exists for lightweight thermal insulation that is isotropic and structurally capable with high thermal performance, while also offering reduced fabrication and installation complexity and lower cost. In previous work for NASA and DoD involving lightweight structural insulation for high temperature engine and airframe applications, Ultramet developed and demonstrated lightweight open-cell foam insulators composed of a carbon or ceramic structural foam skeleton filled with a low-cost, nanoscale aerogel insulator. The potential exists to adapt and optimize aerogel-filled structural foam for the cryogenic insulation application, taking advantage of the thermal and mechanical benefits of each component while offering low cost and manufacturability in complex shapes. In Phase I, the feasibility of fabricating aerogel-filled open-cell foam for cryogenic application was demonstrated, initial thermal performance was established, and a path for continued material and structural optimization was developed through design and modeling. In Phase II, Ultramet will again team with Ocellus, a leader in low-cost aerogel fabrication, and Materials Research and Design for design and analysis support. Thermal performance will be characterized at the Cryogenics Test Laboratory at Kennedy Space Center.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Modern gas turbines must reduce emissions while demonstrating improved efficiency, durability, and performance. Designers are using higher compression ratios and peak temperatures to meet these goals. Flows in the area of the turbine inlet are highly unsteady, non-uniform, and 3-dimensional. The lack of information of inlet conditions in the turbine results in faulty distribution of cooling flows in the stage 1 nozzle leading to durability issues. These challenges make it difficult for turbine designers who need accurate estimates of inlet boundary conditions. Current measurement techniques can not provide the necessary time-resolved information. In Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of a new class of AC plasma sensor for high enthalpy flows. These sensors feature very high bandwidth (1MHz) and spatial resolution (1 mil) in a low-cost, simple, and rugged design. Using these designs, multiple sensors can be mounted on rakes to provide turbine inlet flow conditions over planar regions. During Phase I, measurements of pressure fluctuations in the exhaust of a gas-turbine were performed at 1600F and operation up to 3500F is possible with current materials. In Phase II, we will extend the operating capability of these sensors to 4500F using film-cooling techniques. The sensors developed under Phase II will be demonstrated in realistic engine environments and appropriate measurements such as temperature, pressure, and mass flow will be made. Significant efforts will also be made for tech transition and commercialization of the proposed sensors.  BENEFIT:  Research performed during the Phase II study will provide a suite of rugged sensors that are optimized to measure multiple parameters, such as temperature, pressure, and mass flow. These sensors will have all of the native advantages provided by the plasma approach including extremely high frequency response greater than a MHz, high sensitivity, excellent noise rejection, robust architecture to withstand high loads and temperatures, and a micro-miniature scale through MEMS packaging.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Alces Technology has developed a novel 1D scanned linear array MEMS microdisplay capable of 8 megapixel images and beyond. In combination with recent developments in semiconductor laser light sources, the Alces Microdisplay provides a low-cost, scalable approach to fulfilling existing and future requirements for UDMs in HMD systems. Combining the Alces Microdisplay with waveguide optics will enable small form-factor HMDs with (1) the lowest cost per pixel and (2) performance levels that cannot be matched by current microdisplay approaches based on OLED, LCOS, or HTPS technology. As part of its Phase I project deliverables, Alces verified performance metrics and completed the design of its microdisplay including the layout of the MEMS device and concepts for the optical core and illumination sub-systems. For Phase II, Alces will develop its microdisplay technology with a focus on form-factor, performance and commercialization potential of the MEMS laser light engine. Alces will demonstrate that the optical specifications set in the UDM project can be met using low-power, commercially-available semiconductor laser sources and will demonstrate a path towards a compelling commercial solution based on this unique approach.  BENEFIT:  The display industry is experiencing a period of change, with particularly rapid progress in the development of laser light sources as an alternative to LEDs and UHP lamps. Recent announcements on new semiconductor green sources by Sumitomo Electric, Nichia, Rohm and products such as Casio&quot;s Green Slim Projector demonstrate the potential for the laser to enter mainstream commercial products. In addition, the industry is constantly being driven towards ever higher resolutions by the voracious consumer appetite for higher resolutions.  Alces is developing a 1D MEMS microdisplay technology that is specifically designed to take advantage of the unique properties of laser light in realizing high resolution projection displays. As such, it is perfectly positioned to capitalize on the recent developments in laser light sources and thus far unmet market requirements for low-cost, bright, ultra-high resolution displays. Furthermore, the Alces Microdisplay&quot;s fundamentally low-cost, scalable approach to achieving high resolution will ensure sustainable advantages compared to systems based on incumbent DLP and LCOS light modulator components.  There are numerous applications for Alces&quot;projection technology and funded research programs contributing to the development of Alces&quot;display technology are likely to prove substantially beneficial to a wide range of market segments - including consumer electronics, indoor digital signage, automotive HUDs and aerospace and defense HUDs and HMDs  as well as benefiting the US display industry.  In the consumer electronics space, Alces&quot;technology will allow the creation of ultra-high resolution laser-based projectors with a size and price point an order of magnitude less than is currently possible. This will allow 4K resolution projectors, currently the mainstay of commercial cinema installations, to enter the home. Laser light sources also have high efficiency and a lifetime some two orders of magnitude longer than conventional UHP lamps, providing a clear future environmental benefit.  For automotive, defense and aerospace markets Alces&quot;technology will provide a fundamental change in providing high resolution, wide field-of-view helmet mounted displays (HMDs) and head-up displays (HUDs.) This will result in safety benefits for drivers, due to the quicker reaction time afforded by HUD technology and for warfighters who will be provided with acuity-limited HMDs providing increased situational awareness.   In addition, developments in Alces&quot;technology would fundamentally benefit its supply chain and ecosystem partners. A good example of this is the semiconductor laser diode industry. In the last year phenomenal progress has been made in the development of gallium nitride-based direct semiconductor green lasers, and in just 12 months since the initial reports of direct semiconductor lasing, engineering samples are now available for purchase. Alces&quot;productization activities could help stimulate the industry to further improvements in performance and price point and fully realize the potential of this multi-billion dollar industry. Similarly, the ability of Alces&quot;technology to display content at ultra-high resolutions would drive studios, distribution networks and content delivery partners to provide capacity to support this content.",

However, in many cases, small features in the CAD model are not needed for the numerical simulations carried out using those models, such as those involving structural mechanics, fluid dynamics, or electromagnetics. De-featuring, or simplifying CAD models and performing associated clean-up of the geometry entities remains a large bottleneck in the simulation process. In addition, deficiencies exist in exchanging data among CAD tools.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The unlimited field of regard of head mounted displays (HMDs) provides a significant advantage in situational awareness.  Unfortunately, this unlimited field of regard does not also mean that an HMD provides an unlimited field of view (FOV).  The field of view of an HMD is limited most often by the number of pixels in the microdisplay source.  Because of this, HMD designers are faced with the&quot;resolution/field of view invariant&quot;, where an HMD can either have a wide field of view or a high resolution, but not both.  There are a number of ways to address this invariant, but one of the most promising is via the use of dichoptic imaging.  In a dichoptic imaging system, one eye is presented with a wide field of view (WFOV), low resolution image while the other is presented with a high resolution, narrow field of view (NFOV) image.  The eye-brain system integrates these two images into a single image that appears expansive and detailed.  SA Photonics&quot;Phase I effort demonstrated the validity of a dichoptic imaging system in a laboratory environment.  Our Phase II effort will prove the efficacy of a dichoptic head mounted display for both pilotage and dismounted warfighter applications.

        "abstract": "Key obstacles to extending OFDM to wireless links and networks at high frequencies with dynamic channels are inherent low performance to Doppler and power amplifier operation with high backoff. Other significant obstacles are multipath and impulsive noise. PEARL provides a solid communications infrastructure with support for incremental relevant capabilities including TRANSEC and LPD/LPI. For this, PEARL integrates two layers of OFDM technologies with different Truly Shift Orthogonal Codes (TSOC): one with randomly chirped codes and intrinsic TRANSEC characteristics dedicated to&quot;variable rates&quot;and another with linearly chirped codes and intrinsic robustness to Doppler. A novel Split-Phase Shift-Keying modulation overlay layer&quot;makes&quot;resulting OFDM signals suitable for saturated power amplifiers. PEARL-OFDM multi-layer architecture enables full-range rates that maximizes connectivity, adds unparalleled robustness to high-rate Doppler, has inherent robustness to narrowband fading and impulsive noise and achieves near-optimum power conditioning of typical variable envelope signals enabling power amplifiers operation at near saturation. In Phase I Applied Radar designed, developed the algorithms and simulated the performance of the combined PEARL technologies. In Phase II we will build a software-define-radio testbed including channel emulators, port algorithms, demonstrate the PEARL practical feasibility and performance and initiate its transition to an actual JTRS radio platform.",

Static testing provides a practical means of obtaining plume signature data to support model validation.

Our starting point will be an advanced state of the art Navier-Stokes code that contains much of the requisite physics (chemistry, multiphase particulates, condensation, etc.) and operates in a dynamic grid framework. In Phase I, we investigated the use of all-speed preconditioning techniques for mixed regions of high and low speed flow. A technical approach was formulated to efficiently model rocket motors exhausting into quiescent environments including the effects of the test stand, surrounding terrain, prevailing wind, physical phenomena such as buoyancy, and secondary smoke formation. In Phase II we will incorporate models simulating these effects into our Navier Stokes code and analyze realistic static test firing problems. Work on the development of hybrid RANS/LES turbulence models for static test analyses will also be conducted to more accurately model transient turbulent structures and multiphase particulate phenomena present in these complex transient flowfields.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The USAF has identified a series of potential problems created by the capability limits of the present ignition technology. These limits are most pronounced at high altitude where low pressure and vitiated air produce an ignition limited condition. Knite&quot;s Kinetic Spark Ignition (KSI) is a transformational ignition technology which can be rapidly adopted and manufactured by existing DoD approved ignition manufacturers. Recent testing success on the USAF PDE project suggested KSI has significant potential to address the increased ignition need of turbine and augmentor applications. Knite proposes to expand on its Phase I work, focusing on experimentally characterizing the evolution KSI&quot;s spark kernel at varying conditions and flow rates.  This work will then be utilized in testing at augmentor relevant pressures and vitiation levels at HPCRF.  The HPCRF work will be followed by high-fidelity rig tests to address an existing, fielded, augmentor light-off problem to determine if KSI has potential as an alternate solution. Finally, KSI will be tested on a turbine engine as an improved ignition source for the main combustor.  Based on the scope of work TRL-5+ to TRL-6 in Phase II is probable and with the expressed industry support, Phase III of the project is likely.  BENEFIT:  Phase III of this SBIR will lead to Knite&quot;s first product line for turbine/augmentor applications.  The results of this SBIR will be directly applicable to other DoD turbine applications and if the need is present can be engine qualified for retrofit in existing product lines. Additionally, as improved ignition source, KSI has significant commercial market potential in turbine main combustors for organic fuel, lean combustion and enhanced relight capability. For industrial turbine applications, KSI may improve lean burn, and aid in natural gas and multi-fuel operations. The anticipated benefits from KSI based ignition system applications in reciprocating engine applications include improved fuel efficiency gains of 5% - 30%, reduction in greenhouse gases (including CO2) of 5% - 30%, and a reduction in harmful pollutants such as smog forming NOx of up to 80%. These benefits have been confirmed through 3rd party testing on various reciprocating engines. The highest barrier to entry for the reciprocating market is that KSI is an exciting but unproven technology.  By KSI becoming a proven product in the aviation market through the SBIR program this major hurdle to entry into other markets is dramatically lowered.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Research is proposed to investigate the feasibility of modifying the composition and microstructure of thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems to enable enhanced damping capacity while retaining or improving overall system performance.  The rotating components, used in gas turbine engines typically operate in severe operating conditions which include high temperatures, loads, vibrations and oxidizing conditions. TBC systems are often used to provide thermal, oxidation and hot corrosion protection to the surface of these components. However, state-of-the-art TBC systems are not currently optimized for damping vibrations stresses which can lead to inefficient engine operation and high cycle fatigue failures. Multiple damping mechanisms exist which could enhance the high temperature damping efficiency of these systems through modifications to their composition, microstructure and architecture.  In this work, novel TBC bond coat compositions along with structurally (on the nano-, micro- and macro-scale) modified TBC top coats will be employed to enable multi-functional, damping enhanced TBC systems that are envisioned for use on the low pressure turbine components of gas turbine engines.  Such coatings will be deposited using a physical vapor deposition based processing approach which enables enhanced control of the composition and microstructural of TBC layers and a means to apply them onto complex components.  BENEFIT:  This research is anticipated to result in multifunctional damping coating systems that can reduce vibrational stresses at high temperatures while still providing the required thermal and environmental protection to engine components. The resulting coatings will provide engine designers an additional means to eliminate harmful vibrational stresses, thus, expanding their ability to optimize engine designs for maximized performance. Currently, engine designers of turbine components must assure that there are no resonant frequencies that match the operating points of the airfoil, putting significant constraints on turbine designs operating across a spectrum of speeds and with several different excitations per revolution. The reduction of the vibrational stresses would therefore enable more aerodynamically advanced airfoil designs that may otherwise not be feasible. As a result, damping technologies that can be applied to high cycle fatigue critical components would have a significant impact of engine performance and affordability. These advances will not only benefit military engines which require improvements in engine efficiency and performance, but also commercial and industrial gas turbines. The innovative approach proposed here will also reduce the time and expense for refurbishing and repairing blades during engine overhauls, thus improving military readiness and reducing the cost of maintaining commercial aircraft.",

        "abstract": "The most significant hardware costs on a missile interceptor propulsion system are associated with the thrusters, for which there are typically four divert thrusters and four, six, or eight attitude control thrusters per interceptor. The largest contributor to the thruster cost is the integrated valve/injector. Integration of the valve and injector into a single body provides the benefits of low dribble volume, low weight, and fast response. However, the current designs are subject to serial manufacturing steps, adding to the component&quot;s cost and scchedule. A novel concept for the fabricating the injector was proposed by Montcorp for its Phase I program. A full-scale design was demonstrated in the Phase I effort, which represents the first integrated valve/injector concept that allows complete fabrication of the injector faceplate (including orifices and acoustic cavities) before integration with the valve body. This design provides significant cost and schedule savings in the fabrication of the valve/injector.

In the proposed concept, a set of visible and IR spectrum sensors track CSOs and provide a prioritized location map for an active laser-tracking unit, which is then used to interrogate the CSO and extract information for discrimination and threat cloud detection (threat/non-threat). Multi-mode/modality images and CSO data can be presented at various signal levels to simulate a typical engagement timeline. Active detection technology will enable the system to operate in both day and night and for&quot;dark pass&quot;tracking of satellites through the Earth&quot;s shadow, adding means for optical signal gating which can greatly enhance the signal-to-noise ratio for acquiring data. During Phase I we designed and integrated the proof of concept test bed to demonstrate TDI feasibility on targets that imitate CSO. Phase II activities will include extending the performance capabilities of the system, designing and building a brass board for verifying and optimizing predicted system performance, demonstrating and refining laboratory operation, and estimating the working envelope.  BENEFIT:   An important benefit of the proposed concept is the ability to leverage the capability of existing and advanced sensors by integrating their produced data to significantly improve the image information far beyond that produced by any single one. The most immediate application is for surveillance systems that employ multiple sensors. The technologies developed under this effort can be applied to various air and space surveillance systems against fast moving, closely-spaced airplanes, and missiles and space objects. In the commercial sector, this technology can be applied to air security and air-traffic control including proximity warning systems, collision avoidance, navigation systems and other areas where concurrent detection and discrimination of multiple objects is essential.

In Phase I, we have achieved major accomplishments and findings on 3-D motion replication, dynamic shape description and analysis, and activity recognition based on shape dynamics. We renovated the original concept of HMM4D by making full use of information coded in dynamic models. In Phase II, we will continue technology development and implementation, software development, and case studies.

BENEFIT:  Anticipated Benefits: Our technology will provide a creative yet robust solution to the Topic and will offer the following benefits:     HMM4D makes full use of the information coded in a dynamic 3-D model by extracting the information of shape, motion, and shape dynamics from it. This increases the robustness of the system and provides wide flexibility to adapt to various real world scenarios.        HMM4D fuses the information and clues from shape, motion, and shape dynamics in the stage of decision making, which substantially increases the discriminating capability and accuracy of the system.   HMM4D provides a function for 3-D motion replication, which can be used in virtual reality creation or as a test bed for system performance evaluation.    HMM4D maximizes the potential uses of the information provided by multi-modality sensor data so that it can function effectively and reliably in the presence of invalid inputs or stressful environment conditions.      The HMM4D is designed to have an open structure that is adaptable to the development of sensor technology and human modeling technology.

Overall, the Phase I program was extremely successful, with hardware designs of the arrays as well as a full systems design of the entire aperture as the result. Phase I resulted in a full systems design of the antenna, beamforming, RF electronics, thermal and mechanical design, digital receiver and exciter (DREX) design, and calibration approach. The radar relies on FIRST RF&quot;s affordable array technology. Phase II is expected to culminate with TRL 5 hardware used for demonstration aboard an asset of Navy&quot;s choice.",

        "abstract": "The accumulation of ice on rotor blades while in-flight has been responsible for millions of dollars in damage and loss of life. Current blade ice protection systems are thermal-based and have very demanding power requirements and, therefore, are typically never used and in some cases permanently disabled. Further, advanced composite materials are now being used in rotor blade designs. Overheating of these composite materials as a result of using the thermal ice protection systems while flying in icing conditions can cause blade damage. Damage to the composite materials during flight in general is a critical safety concern and there currently is no way of assessing the health of these materials during flight. Therefore, innovative approaches are needed for both ice protection and structural health monitoring of composite leading edges.   During Phase I of the project, FBS and Penn State uniquely demonstrated the feasibility of using a single ultrasonic actuator/sensor to accomplish three things: (1) ice protection, (2) SHM, and (3) ice accretion sensing. The Phase II work efforts will be used to optimize the ultrasonic actuator/sensor geometry and integrate an array of sensors into a representative composite blade section which will then be tested and evaluated under rotating icing conditions.",

These unconventional and nontraditional aircraft, ship, and boat targets pose unique challenges to radar system designers, analysts, and operators. To aid in the analysis and design of various radar systems, reliable M &amp; S capabilities are needed to predict radar signatures of the previously described targets and their operating conditions. The radar systems of interest for these M &amp; S capabilities operate at frequencies from L-Band up to the K-Bands, with an emphasis on X-Band frequencies since it is utilized for a number of targeting, tracking, and other radar systems of interest. High-frequency CEM methods are suitable for M &amp; S of radar signatures at these frequencies, given the electrically large nature of the targets. A limited number of high-frequency asymptotic software tools exist for predicting radar signatures of targets, but all have significant shortcomings. Delcross Technologies proposes to develop a new software tool called Signa that can be used to predict radar signatures of electrically large air, ground and sea targets while addressing the shortcomings of existing asymptotic signature prediction tools.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  During the normal course of research, development, and testing by the DOD small quantities of environmentally hazardous waste propellants, explosives, and pyrotechnics (PEP) are produced.  The compliance costs and burden associated with open burn/open detonation operations are considerable, including permit fees, ground water, soil and air sampling, analysis and monitoring of environmental impacts, regulatory tracking and reporting, and compliance inspections.  Research and development into alternative methods of small scale degradation is therefore needed.   Agave BioSystems proposes to utilize a novel enzymatic process for the biological degradation of hazardous waste propellants, explosives and pyrotechnics.  In the Phase I, proof of concept for an enzymatic degradation system was successfully demonstrated using the energetic material RDX.  In the Phase II, a system for broad degradation of propellant waste, including ammonium perchlorate, TNT and RDX will be developed and delivered for field use.  BENEFIT:  Successful implementation of the Phase II program will lead to the design and installation of disposal systems at military rocket propellant development lab facilities that lack permitted OBOD facilities. This technology will also provide for the portable disposal of unexploded ordinance.  A secondary commercial application is for manufacturers of low-order energetic pyrotechnics (fireworks, road and boating flares).  One of the largest potential markets will be the ammonium perchlorate (AP) which is the oxidizer and primary ingredient in solid propellant for most large rocket motors.  In addition there is a potential international market provided that the appropriate export controls can be maintained.",

While considerable effort has been expended reducing RADAR signatures of the next generation of Naval vessels, these ship designs often present significant signatures to pmmW sensors. To date, little has been done to understand or reduce these signatures. However, as a new class of pmmW sensors emerge that provide all-weather, day/night imagery, driven by applications in commercial security and developments in high-speed electronics, protecting against these threats will become significantly more important. Under this Phase II effort, we will develop countermeasures to these emerging threats using a combination of signature simulation and experimental validation.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Impact Technologies, in collaboration with our OEM partners, proposes to develop a hybrid approach for real-time prognostics of electromechanical actuators (EMAs) that will advance the state-of-the-art in prognostics technologies and help enable the use of EMAs in high power applications. The overall approach will feature a high fidelity dynamic model of various subsystems to virtually sense parameters that can be used to detect degradation, isolate probable root cause, and assess severity. In addition, data-driven techniques will also complement the model-based approach, including approaches related to command-response error analysis and dynamic features. A system level reasoner, featuring advanced diagnostics, prognostics, and knowledge fusion algorithms, will then be implemented within a probabilistic framework. Model order reduction and uncertainty management will also be addressed to facilitate use within an embedded, on-board implementation. The effort will strive to use the existing sensors that are already available on the aircraft for control, thus limiting the complexity, cost, and weight associated with fielding the system. Experimental validation efforts will be performed within currently available Impact and OEM facilitates. This automated, prognostic package will significantly enhance the ability to safely operate aircraft, schedule maintenance activities, optimize operational life cycles, and reduce support costs.  BENEFIT:  Improvements to the current state-of-the-art in actuator diagnostics is needed to reap the benefits of EMA technologies for high power (&gt;10 kilowatts) applications and avoid&quot;cannot duplicate&quot;failure notifications and improve maintainability. With the successful developments and implementation of this effort, it is strongly anticipated that the prototype algorithms and software module will fulfill this need and be of significant benefit to many DoD applications, including F-35, Remotely Piloted Vehicles (RPV), and NextGen engines/aircraft. Availability improvements will be realized through the reduction of recurring and nonrecurring PHM actions on actuator systems. The realization of such an automated, prognostic reasoning package will significantly enhance the maintainer&quot;s ability to schedule maintenance activities, optimize operational life cycles, and reduce the overall logistics footprint. Better diagnosis of actuation systems and more accurate time-to-failure predictions will reduce the risk of safety-related system failures and decrease costly inspection routines as well as premature component replacements by using a risk-based, maintenance optimization technique. This development is also applicable to civilian aviation applications (passenger aircraft, cargo transports, business jets, private aircraft, etc.). The developed approach and design products could be adapted for a variety of other commercial applications, including: land and marine propulsion systems, industrial actuation systems, fluid power transmission, robotic applications, weapon systems, and air vehicles operating in sustained supersonic cruise.",

With the broad coverage areas that WAAS provides, analysts will be able to monitor individuals, groups, and vehicles across space and time, allowing them to more accurately and effectively develop patterns of life, identify insurgent networks and cells, and provide critical, time-sensitive information to customers on the ground.  But with these new capabilities come challenges.  WAAS datasets will be enormous, and the potential for data overload is significant.  Decision aids and user interfaces are needed that will support analysts in optimally exploiting WAAS datasets, and these supports must be based on the actual cognitive demands of the analysts.  In this effort, we will directly address this requirement by performing an extensive cognitive analysis of the WAAS data analysis task.  Our team will develop multiple WAAS datasets, customized to the unique cognitive tasks that WAAS analysts will face.  These datasets will be integrated into realistic, mission-relevant simulations, which will be administered with operational analysts.  Aids and interfaces will be developed and the most promising and immediately usable will be formally evaluated, again utilizing the mission-relevant WAAS datasets.  BENEFIT:  The Air Force GEOINT analysis community will have a direct and immediate need for supports to WAAS analysis. As Gorgon Stare is deployed, analysts will be faced with massive amounts of data to exploit, and our cogntively-based supports will promote effective and efficient data exploitation.

While operation without biasing magnets was verified, all the prototypes constructed thus far exhibited relatively high loss and poor isolation, which made them unsuitable for practical applications. Furthermore, due to the strong internal magnetic field in the ferrite materials utilized to develop self-biased circulators in the past, the frequency of operation was restricted to above 20 GHz. Metamagnetics developed and patented novel materials fabrication and orientation techniques that lead to exceptionally low magnetic losses. Further, the aforementioned orientation techniques have been successfully applied to substituted hexagonal ferrite materials that possess low uniaxial anisotropy, thus allowing self-biased devices in the 8 to 20 GHz frequency band. Building upon these enabling advances, in this Navy SBIR Phase II effort, the development of low loss self-biased circulators for X-band applications is pursued. In addition, enhanced temperature stability and power handling capability over existing state-of-the-art are undertaken in this program to help prevent ferrite circulator devices from becoming the bottleneck in the development of next generation T/R modules and AESA systems relying upon wide bandgap semiconductor active devices.",

Optimized ferrite cores will be utilized to build planar transformers that can be used in future power electronics systems or retrofitted into existing ones.

        "abstract": "It is critically important to accurately predict radiation pattern, near fields and co-site coupling associated with antennas placed on electrically large airborne platforms, which can be addressed by high frequency techniques such as the uniform geometrical theory of diffraction (UTD). However, innovative improvements are needed for the development and application of these techniques due to challenges such as implementation of creeping wave mechanisms on faceted CAD models, identification of multiple order interactions and modeling of material treatments. Applied EM, Inc. has been developing a UTD based code, uCAST, to predict radiation pattern and coupling of antennas on electrically large aircraft platforms. During Phase I, some benchmark problems that can be specifically used to validate individual ray mechanisms implemented into the uCAST code have been determined. Radiation pattern data has been generated by the uCAST code for these benchmark problems. The data from the uCAST code has been validated against the MLFMM (multi-level fast multi-pole method) data from FEKO commercial software as well as the data from the UTD based NEWAIR code. Shortcomings of the existing capabilities and important missing interactions have been determined. During Phase II, the code will be enhanced based on the findings to yield better accuracy.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this project is to develop new language training methods that help guard against language skill decay, and help recover from skill decay when it has occurred. It leverages previous DoD and ONR investments in language learning technology, but it focuses squarely on the language attrition problem. In addition to providing language training that is resistant to decay, it pays particular attention to the problem of how to quickly recover language skills after attrition has occurred. This latter focus is a unique feature of this work, and is a key innovation. It is a fact of military life that there will be gaps between the time when languages are trained and the time when they are used. Thus some skill decay is inevitable, and so methods are needed that enable learners to recover their language skills as quickly and efficiently as possible. The developed technology will support both computer-based language training and mobile language training. The work has been informed both by the theory of learning and decay, as well as analyses of data from language learners using language training software.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to significantly expand the number of marketable compounds that can be converted from depleted uranium tetrafluoride (DUF4). DUF4 is produced by the reduction of depleted hexafluoride (DUF6), the largest and one of the most toxic waste components of the entire nuclear fuel cycle. Current technology can convert DUF4 into metallic fluorides. Pearlhill Technologies has developed new, environmentally and economically sound processes for the production of nonmetallic inorganic fluorides from uranium tetrafluoride (NIFUT). In Phase I, Pearlhill proved the feasibility of three NIFUT processes to produce commercially viable fluoride products; sulfur tetrafluoride (SF4) gas, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas, and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) gas. In Phase II, the company will design and develop prototype reactors and conduct field tests for three processes: (1) a scalable batch process to produce SF4; (2) a continuous process to produce SF6 gas by direct fluorination of SF4 in a stationary bed of cobalt trifluoride (CoF3); and (3) a continuous process for the direct fluorination of trimethylsilylamines at a low temperature liquid phase continuous process, in order to produce NF3 gas. The broader impacts of this research are that, for the first time, a company has created nonmetallic inorganic fluoride products from DUF6. The Department of Energy (DOE) currently has as much as 700,000 tons of DUF6 in its inventory. Meanwhile, four companies are planning to build new uranium enrichment plants. When these facilities are operational, an additional 27,000 tons of DUF6 waste will be added annually to the inventory. DOE&#039;s 1999 roadmap for decommissioning DUF6 discussed the need to create new processes for the commercial production of high-value fluorine products from DUF6/DUF4 including a variety of metallic and non-metallic inorganic fluoride compounds, which can be absorbed into current markets. A mix of high-value fluoride products is needed to minimize flooding any single fluoride market. Market research suggests that the market demand for metallic fluoride products can absorb only about ten percent of the potential metallic fluoride gas products that could be created from the annual ongoing enrichment process; hence there is a pressing need to increase the number of markets for fluoride products created from DUF6. The innovative NIFUT process will address this need. The Phase I research has proven that three fluoride products - SF4, SF6, and NF3 - can be produced at a significant cost advantage in the current marketplace.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to build a system called CyberCollage as a Social Cyberlearning tool to support computational thinking in STEM education. CyberCollage will enable collective programming of educational games and STEM simulations through a unique combination of networked real-time collaboration mechanisms and Web-based social end-user programming. For example, multiple students can work together on a Frogger game. While one student may be programming the frog, a different student might be working on the turtles. Similarly, students can collaborate on science simulations that explore STEM related questions such as &quot;can your frog live in my pond&quot;? Phase I established technical feasibility, and showed that complex science simulations with tens of thousands of agents can both run efficiently and be created collaboratively by students working together, locally, in the same classroom, or separated by hundreds of miles. Phase II will establish CyberCollage as a scalable cloud-based implementation of a Social Cyberlearning tool, and will integrate embedded assessment mechanisms that make learning outcomes in computational thinking both measurable and predictable. These assessment mechanisms enable the investigation and study of computational thinking transfer evidence between game and STEM applications. The 2010 PCAST report asserts that computational thinking is one of the fundamental concepts of networking and information technology. Fluency in computational thinking is needed to prepare today?s students to be the next generation of innovators and professionals. The proposed combination of high accessibility through Web interfaces, increased motivational prospective through social interfaces, and tested curriculum integrated into required computer education middle school courses is likely to reach a vast audience and attract both women and underrepresented communities to information technology courses and fields. This reach is enhanced by the participation of the National Center of Women in Technology (NCWIT) and Google in the Phase II advisory board. Both organizations are already disseminating AgentSheets Inc. computational thinking resources, which is an extremely positive indicator of a high probability of broad impact and commercial success. The CyberCollage project has established access to disadvantaged communities that include inner city, remote rural, and Native American schools in Alaska, Colorado, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming. These and other schools will serve as testbeds. A pledged investment by a third-party organization should establish a consumer-oriented extension of CyberCollage, making Social Cyberlearning of computational thinking relevant beyond its original scope of educational applications.",

This work will probe the effects of common agents on the lung, liver and kidney, three organs that play a central role in drug metabolism and are predisposed to toxic injury. 2D cell culture, commonly utilized for testing the cytotoxic effects of drugs, displays limited accuracy in predicting toxicity in vivo due to fundamental differences in the cellular microenvironment. While better representations of the 3D architecture of in vivo tissue are provided by animal models, they fail to accurately reflect whether or not drugs will cause cellular damage in humans as a result of biological differences between species. Our preliminary data shows that magnetic levitation maintains cells in culture in an arrangement that allows the cells to develop and communicate in a manner that is much closer to the in vivo environment than other in vitro systems. The broader impacts of this research are to improve assessment of drug toxicity and chemical hazards, reduce the use of animals, and advance the fields of in vitro toxicology testing and drug discovery. Commercial potential includes expansion of the device into high-throughput screening, generation of a prototype of a gas delivery system with capabilities to perform live cell microscopy, and development of a label-free viability assay for drug discovery and toxicity testing.",

        "abstract": "Solar and wind energy are the most likely candidates to meet our future energy needs based on the available capacity.  The problem is that these renewable sources are not consistently accessible, and thus storage must be an integral part of the energy solution.  Hydrogen generation via proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis is one attractive solution, but the life cycle cost of the electrolyzer must be reduced in order to meet the DOE targets.  The membrane electrode assembly represents over 1/3 of the cell stack cost, while the membrane ionic resistance and oxygen evolution overpotential represent the majority of the efficiency losses.  At high production volumes, the electricity cost can represent 2/3 of the total cost of hydrogen.  The oxygen evolution catalyst and membrane materials are therefore key areas of focus for both operating and capital cost. In Phase 1, significant advancements were made in the oxygen evolution reaction, with an estimated order of magnitude improvement in the exchange current density. In parallel, membrane studies focused on thin, reinforced membranes obtained from W.L. Gore.  During the period of performance, processing variables were modified to investigate their impact on stability and efficiency.  Conditions were found which enabled durability surpassing 5-mil Nafion membrane, while providing a significant performance gain vs. commercial electrolysis cells. The proposed Phase 2 project will combine the effects of both efforts in single MEAs, as well as performing further optimization of the catalyst composition and performing substantial reductions in loading.  Phase 2 will also focus on demonstration of scalability of the improved membranes to full size cell stacks, with fabrication of a 300 psi electrolyzer based on Protons 0.6 ft2 stack.  This system will operate for at least 1000 hours, with a goal of demonstrating &amp; gt;69% efficiency.  Analysis of operation projected to 50,000 kg/day will be performed, including analysis of greenhouse gas and petroleum reductions that will occur with the successful implementation of the proposed technology.  This research and development effort is designed to transform hydrogen-based energy storage into an enabling technology for the reduction of fossil fuel use by overcoming the present economic constraints preventing its widespread application.  Protons electrolyzers already serve a wide variety of applications, including metals processing, chemical manufacturing, electronics manufacturing, hydrogenation, electrical generator cooling, fiber optic cable manufacturing, and argon purification.  Next generation products currently under development include higher pressure systems for the fueling and energy storage markets as well as regenerative fuel cells for telecommunications backup power systems. All of these technologies are on pathways to commercialization and utilize various Government and internal sources of funding to advance their state of technical readiness.  Protons mission is clearly to move advanced technology PEM products into hydrogen energy applications as those markets emerge.",

These instruments currently use filtered high-intensity xenon lamps with poor spectral control, high voltage transients that can adversely affect electronic control circuits, lamp aging and a lack of easily-implemented size scaling.  What is needed is a more reliable, low-voltage solid-state, spectrum-adjustable and size-scalable simulator light source. The proposed new light emitting diode (LED)-based solar simulator will be comprised of commercially-available, reliable, low-voltage LEDs that can be spectrally configured to produce uniform, simulated terrestrial solar illumination, that can be arranged in a tile-like sub-module configuration that lends itself to solar panel size scaling, and that can be electronically operated under user-friendly software control. Phase I successfully demonstrated an operational LED-based solar simulator module and developed software for controlled adjustable spectral output from circuit-board mounted commercial LEDs. Phase II will incorporate low-cost commercially-available LED chips and utilize simple and proven methods of obtaining light delivery to enable fabrication of simulators with uniform illumination, adjustable spectrum, higher reliability and reduced manufacturing cost.  At the end of Phase II Spire will have produced an LED-based solar simulator module capable of rapidly testing commercial solar panels. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:   Solar simulators measure the performance of solar voltaic panels prior to field installation.  Consisting of light sources that closely match the solar spectrum, these simulators can test either crystalline or thin film modules, and can be integrated into fully automated solar panel production lines. With continually increasing solar panel sizes, the need for scalable larger area simulators will continue to expand.  These new LED-based simulators can also operate in manual mode, thus widening their market to include solar panel production lines and solar cell and solar panel evaluation under laboratory and field operating conditions. The availability of LED-based simulators opens an additional market in solar panel factory replacements.

        "abstract": "Thin film solar cells are one of the most promising and cost effective means of generating electricity from sunlight. However, their manufacture requires the use of precision film thickness process control sensors in order to produce high efficiency and economically viable cells. Current film thickness sensors are not reliable enough to meet these demands, failing after continuous use in a matter of hours as a result of high heat and excessive layer build-up. We will develop a state of the art sensor that addresses these shortcomings. We propose replacing the current water-cooled quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) based process control sensors with a new class of high temperature microbalances made from doubly rotated quartz, gallium orthophosphate or langasite. These sensors can be constructed to clean themselves after repeated use by heating to temperatures in the range of 500- 1300C. In addition they offer more stable performance under normal process conditions due to their improved resistance to film stress and radiation induced noise. In our Phase I investigation we demonstrated a 500C sensor that is stable and that can regenerate itself after a thin film deposition. For a CIGS thin film process, we successfully removed selenium films completely off the crystal. With higher temperature capability, indium, copper and gallium films can be as well. In Phase II we will improve this capability to 1000 C, leading to the removal of nearly all commercially deposited thin films in solar cell manufacture. Essentially, an unlimited lifetime sensor is the end result. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The successful construction of a self cleaning and heated microbalance sensor will have applications far beyond thin film solar cell production. This includes furnace processing, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD) and even low temperature thin film processing (PVD techniques such as thermal evaporation and sputtering) where the failure of the sensor during long processing runs can be a major problem. Many optical devices are made under conditions that fall into this latter category. A new class of organic thin film devices, including OLEDs (Organic Light Emitting Diodes) and organic thin film photovoltaic devices are well known to be difficult to monitor in vacuum processing lines. This new class of microbalance eliminates many of the failure modes. This sensor will be a revolutionary development in continuous vacuum coating technology. Roll coating systems have seen limited use of film thickness monitoring systems because of the short life of the sensors. Our innovation will remove that limitation completely.",

        "abstract": "In the manufacturing process for photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules, a significant percentage of crystalline silicon wafers and solar cells contain microcracks that are difficult or impossible to detect with the human eye or currently available machine vision systems.  These microcracks can propagate through the cells, resulting in power loss and cell breakage, due to mechanical and thermal stresses during cell fabrication, module assembly, and outdoor exposure. Photoluminescent imaging is being investigated as a means of crack detection in highly automated production lines, due to its potential for high-speed non-contact measurements. Image processing techniques will be applied to discriminate cracks from other material defects, enabling automated crack detection. Microcracks were detected by photoluminescence in both mono- and multi-crystalline silicon solar cells, using three different excitation wavelengths and two types of near-infrared cameras, a cooled silicon charge-coupled device and a cooled InGaAs focal plane array. In year 1, illumination sources and cameras will be tested to optimize image quality, while image processing software will be developed to identify microcracks in crystalline silicon cells. In year 2, a prototype automated high-speed photoluminescent solar cell inspection system capable of inspecting and handling 1200 cells per hour will be designed, built, and demonstrated. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Identifying and removing microcracked silicon wafers from the production line has clear benefits to solar cell and module manufacturers.  Automating the inspection and reject part segregation processes reduces the cost of inspection and rework labor in cell and module production lines while increasing product yield, thereby reducing the cost of finished modules. The elimination of microcracked wafers and cells from modules will increase the lifetime (mean time to failure) of installed modules. This will increase the total energy production over the effective lifetime of PV systems, thereby reducing still further the energy generation cost. In order to advance these goals, Spire plans to integrate automated photoluminescent crack detection systems into its commercial cell testing equipment and module assembly lines.",

        "abstract": "In 2005, commercial and residential Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems represented 518 billion kWh of energy consumption in the United States, which amounts to 8% of the total energy produced that year.  In addition, producing this power resulted in the release of 465 MMTCO2e of greenhouse gases. By reducing the energy demand of air conditioning systems, the US can realize a significant reduction in consumer energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions. ACT is developing a Vortical-flow, Direct-contact Heat Exchanger (VDHX) for integration with residential and commercial HVAC systems.  The primary objective of this device is to reduce the energy consumption of these systems by exceeding the energy efficiency of traditional finned-tube heat exchangers. This improvement in energy efficiency will stem from a reduction in coolant to air temperature difference, which will reduce compressor energy consumption, and a reduction in pressure drop through the heat exchanger, which will reduce fan power consumption. By the end of the Phase I program, ACT successfully fabricated and tested a VDHX demonstration unit that cooled air from 33 C to 15C using an inlet water temperature of 10C. The unit provided 8 kW (2.3 tons of refrigeration) at 735 CFM. To determine the impact of this performance on HVAC energy consumption, ACT developed a residential cooling model, based on thermodynamics and the Residential Loaf Factor method, to study HVAC performance at 70 locations across the US. According to this analysis, the VDHX can provide 33% to 60% energy savings over a traditional GSHP system and 30% to 50% over a traditional Air-Source Heat Pump (ASHP). ACT will build on the Phase I progress by first optimizing the VDHX design.  We will work with our university and commercial partners to define the design scope for residential and light commercial GSHP and ASHP systems.  This will include cooling, heating, and dual use applications of varying cooling capacity.  Two VDHX prototypes will be designed, fabricated, and tested for a residential and commercial load, respectively. These prototypes will be tested at our university partners psychrometric facility. Results will be used to design a final, VDHX-based air handler prototype for a residential load.  This unit will be used to validate VDHX performance as part of an air handler system for DOE and our partners. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:   The VDHX has direct application to the residential and commercial HVAC market as a highly-efficient indoor heat exchanger that will reduce HVAC power consumption.  This, in turn, reduces the carbon footprint of these systems, arrests the rising power demand associated with HVAC, and saves consumers money.  In addition, the VDHX provides integral particulate and biological filtration capable of increased indoor air quality compared to conventional heat exchangers.  This could allow for tighter ventilation control and a further reduction in power consumption.  Finally, the VDHX is highly corrosion resistant and not limited to high thermal conductivity materials.  As such, this heat exchanger can be made from easily recyclable, cost effective, and corrosion resistant materials.  All of these benefits make the VDHX an attractive heat exchanger for the HVAC market.",

        "abstract": "Extraction is a major cost driver in the production of algal oil. Reducing extraction cost is critical for the economic viability of algal biofuels. This project uses solid phase, hydrophobized silica resin to improve extraction of algal lipids. Process streams containing lipid and other hydrophobic compounds are treated to recover lipids and Corp) for extraction of the algal lipid produced after the Heteroboost process. Hydrophobized resins were evaluated with model triacylglycerides (TAGs) and fatty acids (FFA) to efficacy and selectivity of adsorption of TAGs and FFAs. Resins were then tested in complex mixtures of algal lipids, with or without algal cell debris or biomass. The inability to separate silica from cell debris cleanly ruled out use in these complex mixtures. However, the resins effectively removed algal TAGs and FFAs from clarified aqueous process liquids generated in Phycals aqueous extraction process. Additionally, this efficacy was maintained for 10 adsorption/desorption cycles. Phase II will focus on recovery of hydrophobic compounds from two process streams generated by Phycals aqueous extraction process. The ability to capture algal oil that is currently lost directly improves production cost. Recovering polar lipids that are not currently captured in aqueous extraction will provide additional cost savings. The project will focus on validation of the adsorption/desorption process at the subpilot, documentation of any higher value hydrophobic compounds recovered from this process, scale up of the process to the pilot plant, and develop a cost analysis/model to allow transition to the commercial plants to be constructed in Hawaii. The deliverables will be an optimized reactor design for adsorption/desorption on hydrophobized resins, optimized silica resin, optimized process at subpilot-scale, and field testing of the optimized reactor/methods at pilot-scale. Commercial Applications &amp; amp; Other Benefits:  Phycal is constructing a pilot-scale algal oil production facility on the Island of Oahu, Hawaii. This facility is designed to incorporate our existing production methods, but also to be available for testing improvements to these methods that will lower the cost of the algal biofuels that will be produced. This project could have a significant and positive impact on the cost of production of the algal oil by reducing the loss of lipid in process wastestreams and capturing of other hydrophobic compounds that have value either as an additional fuel feedstock or higher value product.",

        "abstract": "One of the principal technical and cost barriers to successful commercialization of algal biofuels as an alternative energy source is the inability to extract the useful oil components from the algae in an economical and environmentally sound fashion. Indeed, the DOE announcement for this proposal specifically notes topic areas (5d) regarding methods for extracting oils from microalgae as goal of research and development. The announcement further recognizes the critical barriers that impact cost and performance: oil extraction systems for wet algal biomass and further purification of neutral lipids. Current processing methods for algal oil require large investments in costly and energy intensive centrifuges and distillation equipment using environmentally unfriendly solvents such as hexane due to the difficulty in isolating oil components from residual biomass and water. Alternative strategies are urgently needed to purify the valuable oil components from algae that can be subsequently processed into useful biodiesel. The objective of this Phase I/Phase II project is to implement a novel chemical processing strategy that applies carbon dioxide as a solute to alter the physical properties of lipids including density, viscosity, and solubility such that algal oil is more readily separated from the remaining biomass and water. Our CO2 solute enhanced lipid isolation is fundamentally different from supercritical extraction, which uses CO2 as a solvent and requires much greater volumes of CO2 and high capital costs. During Phase I, we measured the effects of CO2 on the physical properties of oil, water, and algal biomass in a series of laboratory experiments. Significant CO2 solute dissolves primarily in oil as a single phase at elevated pressures to alter the density and viscosity of oil and facilitates the separation of oil from separate phases of algal biomass and water. Therefore, the aim of the proposed Phase II project is to translate this knowledge of physical properties of CO2 solute in oil into a complete chemical process for purifying oil from biomass and water at laboratory scale. During year 1, optimal process operating parameters will be specified for the specific unit operations in order to reduce the water content following algal growth, solubilize CO2 solute in oil, purify oil from biomass and water, then recycle the CO2 and water. The second year of the Phase II project will integrate these individual unit operations into a continuous process and to design an economical process for scale up in Phase III. The Phase III project, if approved, will implement a pilot project at 200-to 2,000-fold higher scales that demonstrates the commercial feasibility of CO2 solute based processing for oil purification from algal biomass and water. Commercial Applications &amp; amp; Other Benefits:  The commercial benefits will be a substantial reduction in processing costs for purifying oil from algal biomass. As processing the algal species represents the single highest capital cost component of algal biofuels, methodologies that reduce these costs will have a significant impact towards making algal biofuels including biodiesel and other products economically viable. Given the expanding number of algal growth companies in the US, the implementation of complementary technologies to process the algae to oil and residual biomass represents an equally important goal towards the development of a commercially viable renewal algal biofuels source to replace current fossil fuels.",

        "abstract": "Next generation fusion facilities will require many megawatts of RF power from dozens of gyrotrons. Conventional DC power systems, built from WWII era components, have provided the typical approach to powering high-power RF vacuum devices for the last 50 years. Typically, they suffer from reliability and availability problems, and are often only 50  70% efficient. Scaling these conventional RF power electronics for next generation high power fusion facilities is not practical in terms of cost or reliability. Fortunately, the last decade has seen the development and rapid adoption of solid-state, high voltage power electronics. This SBIR effort proposes to develop a Buck Matrix modulator, a unique single set of switches that delivers voltage regulation, arc protection, and pulse modulation to future fusion facilities. This topology, with an estimated efficiency of 96%, cuts the size of the traditional power system in half, using a single layer of solid state switches for both voltage regulation and arc protection / modulation. The Phase I effort successfully analyzed and modeled the Buck Matrix configuration in both the full size and Phase I demonstration configurations.  A representative, scaled version of this novel configuration of multi-phase series and parallel arrayed solid-state buck regulators wasdeveloped and bench-tested. The simulations and experimental results show that the full sized Phase II system is feasible, in terms of cost, size, performance, and manufacturability.  A preliminary high voltage and mechanical design of the full sized Phase II prototype was made. In Phase II, a full scale demonstration unit will be built for delivery to a west coast tube manufacturer, or a suitable US fusion facility for evaluation. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The resulting design is transferable to CW or long pulse applications, including future RF accelerators, light sources, and synchrotrons, and other DOE programs, such as the International Linear Collider (ILC). Applications beyond the fusion community such as Active Denial, and previously unworkable industrial applications of high-power gyrotrons, will now be open to exploration.",

From a technological perspective, electrical breakdown is a significant challenge for ICRF utilization in present experiments and will become more challenging for future devices like ITER and other reactors. An ICRF system utilizes an antenna to couple power to the plasmas.  Current antennas use materials with high conductivity, like copper, where the copper has been deposited onto a structural material like Inconel 625 or stainless steel. However, coppers low melting temperature and deteriorating mechanical properties at elevated temperatures result in electrical breakdown of the antenna and strong material displacement. ICRF antenna performance could be significantly improved by replacing the copper coating with a refractory metal such as tungsten.  During this investigation, innovative coating techniques are being developed to enable the deposition of dense, high purity, well-adhered tungsten coatings on ICRF antennas. Testing of tungsten coatings produced during the Phase I effort has shown considerable promise.  For example, electrical breakdown testing of tungsten coated samples at MIT has shown up to a 35% improvement in power handling capability as compared to copper reference samples with a similar surface finish.  During Phase II, the tungsten coatings will be optimized and a tungsten coated ICRF antenna will be produced and tested in Alcator C-Mod to determine antenna performance in a tokamak environment. The antenna &amp; apos;s voltage and power limits under various conditions will be characterized and compared to a traditionally copper coated antenna. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The development of dense, well-bonded refractory metal coatings on Inconel and  stainless steel substrates will enable the fabrication of advanced ICRF antennas.

        "abstract": "ITER will depend on high power CW gyrotrons to deliver power to the plasma at ECR frequencies. However, gyrotrons can suffer from undesirable low frequency oscillations (LFOs) which are known to interfere with the gun-region diagnostics and data collection, and are also expected to produce undesirable energy and velocity spread in the beam. The origins and processes leading to these oscillations are poorly understood, and existing gyrotron R &amp; amp;D tools, such as static gun solvers and interaction region models, are not designed to look at time-dependent oscillatory behavior. We are proposing the application of a conformal finite-difference time-domain (CFDTD) particle-in-cell (PIC) method to address the LFO problem. Our company is at the forefront of smooth-curved-boundary treatment of the electromagnetic fields and particle emission surfaces, and such methods are necessary to simulate the adiabatically trapped and reflected electrons thought to be driving the oscillations. This approach provides the means for understanding, in microscopic detail, the underlying physical processes driving the low-frequency oscillations. The basic tools, diagnostics, and templates have been developed and demonstrated for simulate a MIG in Gyrotrons. It is demonstrated that our strategies are appropriate and LFOs in a MIG electron gun have been simulated and reproduced using the 3D CFDTD PIC simulations for the first time. The outcome is promising and close to experiments. The tools, algorithms, diagnostics, and templates will be developed and used to investigate the trapped and reflected electron population behind the LFO phenomenon. Several candidates for the origin of the electron population will be evaluated, in turn, including emission temperature spread, both physical, and geometrically (surface roughness) induced, cavity and capacitive probe effects, and other emitting surfaces. Particle trapping times, life-cycle time, and loss mechanisms will be evaluated, with the goal of being able to reproduce observed experimental variations with gun voltage, current, and LFO mitigation schemes, and predict LFO behavior in future gyrotrons. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The new gyrotron models will be implemented in Tech-Xs VORPAL software which is commercially available, and should have an immediate commercial market with gyrotron manufacturers seeking mitigation of the LFO problem. The successful application of this capability will also help fill an important gap in the gyrotron R &amp; amp;D process, where this important type of particle-based time-dependant R &amp; amp;D tool is not yet established.",

        "abstract": "Arguably the most important issue facing the further development of magnetic fusion via advanced tokamaks is to predict, avoid, or mitigate disruptions. This problem recently becameone of the most challenging and hot topics in fusion research due to several potentially damaging effects, all of which can impact the ITER device. Among four disruption related topics: MHD dynamics, plasma edge physics, plasma-wall interaction physics and generation and losses of runaway electrons, the DSC addresses the firstone. The numerical algorithm will allow extension in physics models and interface with otherrelevant codes. DSC will solve the resistive one fluid 3D MHD equations in the real geometry ofthe conducting tokamak vessel, utilizing the adaptive meshless technique and will finally beparallelized. The DSC will be validated against the JET disruption data and will be capable ofpredicting the disruption effects in ITER. DSC will contribute to the development of the disruption mitigation schemes and suppression of the runaway generation. The DSC code was implemented in 2D with all basic components of the full 3D version. It performs adaptive, meshless free-boundary plasma core simulations. Vacuum fields, the plasma surface and wall currents are calculated using both Green &amp; apos;s functions and Poisson equation methods. For the first time the non-linear dynamics of the wall touching kink mode was simulated, including both fast ideal MHD regime till the saturation due to excitation of the Hiro currents, and the slower regime of the current quench due to resistive decay of the Hiro currents. A full one-fluid 3-D resistive MHD DSC will be developed capable of implementing realistic 3Dmodels of in-vessel components of tokamaks (e.g., LTX, JET, ITER, DIII-D, NSTX, J-TEXT). The m=1 kink mode simulations will be validated against JET disruption data base. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The DSC extends an innovative adaptive meshless method to a new area of application. DSC willmake a unique and timely contribution to the US and International tokamak fusion programs. With the projects completion, the DSC will result in a powerful simulation tool, available anddeliverable to the fusion energy science community. Being experimentally verified, the DSC can be a part of the software suite of the currently proposed Fusion Simulation Project (FSP).",

To meet the cost goals for traction motors to expand the availability of electric vehicles, substantial reductions in cost to produce the Nd-Fe-B alloy powders must be achieved as well as providing a U.S. base of supply.  Neodymium oxide (Nd2O3), the DOE specified starting material, is transformed to anhydrous neodymium chloride (NdCl3) by demonstrated low cost processing which is the feed along with iron chloride (FeCl2) and boron trichloride (BCl3) to an electrolytic fused salt cell that directly produces the ideal alloy Nd2Fe14B fine powder at a fraction of the state-of-the-art process cost.  The Nd2Fe14B is vacuum separated from the salt that is recycled to the electrolytic cell and the Nd2Fe14B powder is sintered to form a magnet without exposure to air producing a high quality magnet at low cost. The phase I demonstrated Nd2O3 could be transformed to anhydrous NdCl3 using a carbothermic reduction/chlorination demonstrated process.  The anhydrous NdCl3 was co-fed with FeCl2 and BCl3 to an electrolytic fused salt cell that electrolytically directly deposited the ideal alloy Nd2Fe14B as a very fine powder in the desirably nano size range that translates to magnets with higher energy density. The simplified flow chart that directly produces the Nd2Fe14B alloy predicts a cost significantly less than the current price of Chinese produced material. Technical feasibility has been demonstrated in Phase I.  Phase II proposes to scale-up processing utilizing neodymium oxide or lower cost carbonate to produce anhydrous NdCl3 which will be co-fed with FeCl2 and BCl3 in a scaled-up electrolytic cell to define reproducibility of producing very fine/nano particle Nd2Fe14B powder that is vacuum separated from the salt which is recycled back to the electrolytic cell in a benign environmental cycle.  The separated Nd2Fe14B alloy powder will be sintered into low cost magnets without exposure to the atmosphere.  This project establishes a U.S. source to produce Nd2Fe14B alloy powder and high quality magnets. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Substantially reducing the cost and energy in an environmentally friendly process to produce low cost Nd2Fe14B alloy powder provides the material to produce high quality permanent magnets at low cost that translates to producing more electric vehicles. The greater use of electric vehicles reduces pollution, reduces the need for oil/petroleum and the attendant advantages of reduced importing of oil.  A greater use of electric vehicles emanating from low cost permanent magnets is a benefit to the entire Nation.  The low cost Nd2Fe14B is also applicable for magnets for wind generation of electricity as well as defense applications.

        "abstract": "The structural degradation of fusion reactor components within high temperature magnetically confined plasma environments is a well-known problem. The high heat flux associated with the plasma, in addition to sputtering and thermal cycling, leads to detrimental erosion and cracking of the plasma facing components (PFCs) which tile the reactor walls. At present, no evaluation method exists that will enable true in-situ structural health monitoring of PFCs. Current non-destructive systems suffer shortcomings in that they yield poor spatial resolution (~2mm) thus prohibiting erosion depth measurement and do not allow for true in-situ measurements since evaluation can only be performed during maintenance shutdowns, which happen only once a year. Therefore, there is clear need for a PFC non-destructive evaluation system that can operate at elevated temperatures in the presence of high magnetic fields and neutron fluence, is immune to RF noise and ultimately compatible with high performance plasma operation while offering legitimate in-situ monitoring. Luna Innovations is proposing to develop a revolutionary non-contact ultrasonic health monitoring system for plasma facing components used in fusion reactors. In phase I, Luna demonstrated non-contact defect detection of sample PFC components where simulated defect detection was demonstrated at relevant reactor first wall temperatures and included material thickness changes and crack defects. System development for phase II will address the particular aspects of laser NDE component/fusion interface and will ultimately demonstrate in-situ operation in actual plasma facing campaigns.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  In-situ health monitoring of magnetically confined fusion reactor plasma facing components, enabled by the proposed non-contact ultrasonic solution, will facilitate commercialization of future tokamak designs (ITER) as well as increase reactor safety and lifetime in existing fusion reactors.

Toimprove quality assurance inspection of wind turbine parts and, in particular, to improvetechnologies to perform quality assurance inspection on very large, thick wind turbine parts, new technology is critically needed to uncover hidden defects before and after field installation. To address this urgent need, a new millimeter wave inspection tool for nondestructive testing of wind turbine components is being proposed. The tool is based on an array of scanningmillimeter wave probes that use penetrating, yet harmless, low-energy electromagnetic waves to image defects throughout the full thickness of wind turbine composite parts. Within theproposed system architecture, the sensors are arranged in a modular array that conforms to the blade contours and expedites the inspection process. In Phase I, the proposed systems feasibility was successfully demonstrated through computer simulations, designing, developing, and demonstrating a working prototype based on a series ofproof-of-concept experiments and tests. It was demonstrated that the Phase I prototype can detect small-scale (delaminations and porosity 0.2 mm) and larger scale (cracks and voids 10 mm to 100 mm) defects on an engineered sample. Phase I also demonstrated the systemspenetration depths 380 mm. The results of the testing were in good agreement with the simulation and modeling results. The overall goal of Phase II is to develop a full-scale prototype of the proposed system for pilottesting with wind turbine manufacturers and for evaluation by a national lab. During Phase II, theprototype system will be developed to include several enhancements based on the Phase I results and first-hand end-user feedback. The depth resolution to provide defect classificationcapabilities will be improved, signal processing to provide enhanced image resolution will be optimized, mechanical mounting and automation to achieve higher inspection speeds will beimplemented.

This will benefit the nation by improving the reliability of windturbine components, thereby reducing maintenance costs and extending wind turbine lifetimes.Improving the reliability and operability of wind turbines will help to establish domestic wind energy manufacturing capabilities and create a large number of green and clean energy jobs for Americans in the coming decades.

        "abstract": "As wind turbine rotor diameters increase in size, especially for offshore wind farms, susceptibility to damaging wind conditions is increasing as well. The fatigue and extreme loads that a turbine must endure ends up increasing the Cost of Energy (CoE) significantly through higher maintenance and repair costs, reduced availability, shorter lifetimes, and increased initial purchase cost because of the need for greater design margin. These problems are exacerbated for larger turbines and when major repairs require cranes to replace damaged components. Inefficiency is also a problem as wind turbines cannot anticipate wind speed or direction changes before they actually arrive at the turbine.

UV Lidar is a promising tool for measuring wind speed and direction hundreds of meters ahead of the turbine, providing advanced knowledge of wind conditions that can lead to damaging fatigue and extreme loads. It is proposed to combine condition monitoring output with forward looking Lidar data using a fault-tolerant control strategy. The condition of the turbine and advanced measurement of the wind flow field will then be used to determine an optimal solution for emergency, reconfigurable, or accommodating control. It is anticipated that these improved control decisions will lead to improvement in load reduction versus Lidar-based or CM approaches alone, ultimately resulting in longer lifetimes of critical turbine components and greater turbine availability.  The Phase I project demonstrated the ability of the new CM software to detect faults in CM data from wind turbines. This showed the feasibility of the approach, attracting increased wind industry interest in the project.  The CM software will continue to be developed as a product in its own right, but in Phase II will also be applied to fault-tolerant control. In Phase II, we will start by demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of integrating the CM software with UV Lidar wind measurements by modeling and simulation. Success at the modeling level will be followed by field testing the system, including UV Lidar, on a fully instrumented test turbine. Plans will be made to continue field testing on utility-scale turbines with our partners. We will also look specifically at offshore turbine requirements and benefits of the system. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  This Phase II effort will help accelerate deployment of three types of commercial products: (1) a stand-alone CM software package that can improve fault prediction and lead to lower maintenance and improved turbine availability, (2) a combined CM, forward-looking UV Lidar, and fault-tolerant control system to help turbines avoid damaging wind conditions and increase lifetime, and (3) a unique forward-looking UV Lidar that can also be applied to turbine control for enhancing energy capture, as well as other wind energy applications, such as site assessment and forecasting.  These products would address well-known needs in the wind industry.  The benefits apply to a customer base that includes turbine OEMs, wind farm developers, and operators.",

        "abstract": "Commercially available lithium-ion cells use electrolytes containing a mixture of organic carbonate solvents combined with lithium hexafluorophosphate salt. These electrolytes have significant disadvantages limiting the performance and safety of large li-ion batteries for automotive applications: regular electrolytes are flammable and the instability of the salt causes battery performance degradation and limits the cycle life. We propose to develop a novel Li-ion battery electrolyte composed of thermally stable lithium imide salt and non-flammable solvents. Use of this advanced electrolyte is coupled by employment of graphite foil as a cathode current collector, which unlike aluminum, does not corrode in lithium imide salts solutions. During our Phase I effort we prepared and tested lithium imide-based electrolyte formulations incorporating 80% of non-flammable components, such as fluorinated ethers and ionic liquids, and demonstrated drastically improved safety in 2.4Ah pouch cells with cathodes coated on graphite foil current collector. During the Phase II effort we will expand our development into a number of promising non-flammable fluorinated solvents and imide anion ionic liquids. We will optimize electrolyte formulations and overall cell design to meet rate capability requirements. New electrolytes will be evaluated for performance and safety in large 10Ah pouch cells designed for automotive applications. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Success of this program will lead to new generation of safer, longer lasting Li-ion cells. These Li-ion batteries will find use in many applications, including HEV, PHEV and EV. That will in turn help accelerate the growth of this market and the acceptance of these new vehicles by the buying public.",

        "abstract": "It is well established that prolonged operation at high junction temperatures reduces the lifetime of LEDs, significantly undermining one of the main benefits of LED lighting systems.  Despite advances in LED device technology, a significant fraction of the electrical energy input is wasted as heat. Inadequate removal of this heat results in poor optical performance and sort lifespan of LED lighting systems. The proposed Passive Heat Spreader significantly enhances lateral heat spreading and also decreases the overall thermal resistance versus current printed circuit board thermal management solutions. An added benefit of the design is that it also promotes a lower cost and less complex chip package by eliminating the need for an electrically isolated thermal pad. In Phase I, a prototype Passive Heat Spreader has been modeled, fabricated and tested.  Overall, the results show that an 85% reduction in thermal resistance can be obtained with a high purity water based passive heat spreader when compared to state of the art metal core printed circuit boards. Reliability testing also showed positive results. In Phase II, efforts will be focus on developing the passive heat spreader thermal solution for a targeted application. A number of issues will be addressed to bring the Technology Readiness Level to level 7, including life and reliability issues, performance related issues, cost issues and optical performance issues.  Most importantly, the effort includes optical and thermal testing of the passive heat spreader in an LED system. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Artificial lighting represents a large percentage of energy consumption across various sectors: residential, commercial, and industrial.  In recent years the solid state lighting industry has become an economically viable alternative to incandescent and fluorescent lighting.  Of the three, it offers the potential for longest lifetimes and highest efficacy without the inclusion of hazardous materials like mercury.  These factors support the DOE decision to develop a multi-year road map, whose goal is to ensure and accelerate the development and deployment of LED lighting products. Thermal management has been identified as a critical obstacle along this road map, which the proposed dielectric planar thermosyphon seeks to address; and it will enable the development of the solid state lighting industry.",

        "abstract": "Novel high-efficiency solid-state light sources are needed to help reduce the ever increasing demand for energy. Organic Light Emitting Devices (OLED), which are energy efficient diffuse light sources that may compete most directly with and offer a green energy saving alternative to conventional incandescent light sources. However, lifetime of large-area OLED lighting panels is still one of the biggest technical challenges, where studies have shown operation temperature has strong impact on device lifetime. It is therefore very important to improve the thermal management for large-area OLED lighting to extend panel lifetimes.  This Phase II work proposes to continue the improvement of thermal management for large-area OLED light panels, based on the success of our Phase I program. We will develop various approaches to improve the thermal management including building physical model, establishing panel-level testing methods, optimizing panel design, and exploring novel substrates and encapsulation systems.  During Phase I, we successfully demonstrated high efficacy 15 cm x 15 cm white PHOLED lighting panels achieving high efficacy of 66 lm/W at 2,600 lm/m2 (1,000 cd/m2) with a lifetime of 30,000 hours. We characterized the temperature dependence of our PHOLEDs and our study shows the importance of reducing the operation temperature to improve device lifetime. IR images of lighting panels were analyzed and the results provide guidelines for designing panels with improved thermal management .  During our proposed Phase II program, we intend to further broaden our studies of thermal behavior of OLED devices, and to develop various technologies to improve the thermal management for large-area OLED panels. The key Phase II deliverable is a 15 cm  15 cm WOLED panel with low operating temperature &amp; lt; 30 C, power efficacy &amp; gt; 65 lm/W, CRI &amp; gt; 80, CCT &amp; amp; CIE (x, y) meeting Energy Star Criteria for Solid State Lighting at a high light output of 10,000 lm/m2 (4,000 cd/m2). This power efficacy target is equivalent to 85 lm/W at 2,500 lm/m2 (1,000 cd/m2). The low-temperature operation will enable 50% improvement on panel lifetime to LT70 &amp; gt; 10,000 hrs at 10,000 lm/m2. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Today, OLED technology is the leading emerging technology for flat panel displays (FPDs), with recent product introductions in cell phones. Many of these features that are desired for FPDs are also making OLED technology of great interest to the solid-state lighting community. For example, OLEDs are bright and colorful lambertian emitters with excellent power efficiency at low voltages. In addition, OLEDs are thin-film devices that provide thin form factors especially when built on flexible substrates.",

        "abstract": "Industrial hydrogen production relies primarily on natural gas and hydrocarbon feedstocks to drive the various reaction chemistries that lead to hydrogen generation.  Carbon dioxide, the ultimate co-product when such feedstocks and processes are employed, necessarily becomes a major contaminant of the generated hydrogen. Thus, carbon dioxide isolation and removal is an important process step in the efficient, low cost purification and recovery of hydrogen from the intermediate reformed and synthesis gases. A new proprietary, chemically resistant and highly durable membrane developed in this project promises to improve the separation efficiency and to dramatically reduce energy requirements for the separation of carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The proposed membrane and process also addresses the ease of isolating carbon dioxide for efficient capture and sequestration. Base data showed CO2/H2 selectivities as high as 15 in combination with a membrane system that can have CO2 permeance of over 1000 GPU. When compared to both amine scrubbers and pressure swing absorption processes, the CMS membrane process has dramatically lower capital and operating costs. Costs for a typical CMS membrane system is $58/MM SCF H2 while PSA and amine scrubber costs are between $162 and $1,072 MM SCF H2 for the same 99% H2 purity. Key objectives for Phase II include integration of all key components that were successfully demonstrated in Phase I into a system and this will be followed by both optimizing the system and then scaling the system up for pilot demonstration. Overall Phase II objective is to use the basic data from pilot demonstration to show capital cost and operating cost reductions of 50% and 35% respectively. Given  our excellent success in Phase I, a number of key players and individuals are actively participating in Phase II. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Besides the hydrogen generation processes mentioned already, the new membrane promises to have broad application in the hydrogen economy, hydrogen processing, synthesis gas production, hydrotreating, and sulfur removal processes. Improvements in hydrogen purification and separation efficiencies and the ready isolation of a concentrated carbon dioxide co-product will have direct benefits in emissions reductions, energy independence, and carbon management. In addition to addressing specific needs of CO2 separation from H2, this platform will also address a broad Department of Energy need for high temperature and chemically resistant membranes.",

        "abstract": "Ethylene and propylene are major chemical industry raw materials and consume a great deal of energy related to their production. It is estimated that 230 trillion BTU/yr are consumed in olefin/paraffin separations.  Significant energy consumption is employed when cryogenically separating ethane from ethylene and propane from propylene. These cryogenic separations are difficult and are both capital and energy intensive. Membrane processes have been previously evaluated for separating ethylene/ethane or propylene/propane. While somewhat encouraging results have been demonstrated, stability problems have led to systems that have been unable to maintain performance. In many cases the use of silver (Ag+) salts were used to preferentially transport the ethylene or propylene. It is proposed to combine the stability features and high gas transport of Compact Membrane Systems proprietary membrane with the high selectivity of Ag+ salts. The membranes have demonstrated superb chemical and thermal stability with the highest gas transport of any known stable polymer. CMS has identified routes to adding Ag+. The introduction of Ag+ sites is likely to result in dramatically higher ethylene and propylene transport and also significant increases in ethylene/ethane and propylene/propane separation. We have demonstrated the feasibility of all the key elements for developing novel gas separation membranes. Key building blocks for program success include membranes that gave excellent results for the separation process of interest. Engineering and economic analysis projections showed that a process combining distillation and membrane separation would result in annual energy savings ranges from 16.8 to 45.6 trillion Btu per year. The resulting membrane/distillation hybrid process offers an energy savings of 15% to 23%, a return on investment up to 67% with a payback time of 1.3 years. In Phase II membranes will be optimized and larger size membrane devices will be fabricated.  Testing will be carried out for ruggedness and stability of the membrane for an extended period of time. Membrane performance will be demonstrated at an industrial site and the process via engineering and economic evaluation will be verified. Commercial Applications or other Benefits:  CMS has membranes with outstanding olefin/paraffin separation and flux. Economic and engineering analysis of these CMS membranes in a retrofit mode to be added to existing ethylene or propylene plants has projected energy savings of over 40 trillion BTU/yr and reduced separation costs by over $4.00 per 1000 pounds (or more than 12% of the separation costs).",

        "abstract": "While design improvements have been achieved, considerable difficulty continues to be encountered in the development of accelerator structures for future linear colliders required to operate with long term reliability at loaded average accelerating gradients of 100 megavolts per meter and radio-frequency pulse lengths in the range of 150 to 250 nanoseconds.  A recently completed series of high power radio-frequency and electron beam tests comparing two similar geometry linac structures, each tested with a  17 gigahertz dual resonant ring power amplifier under the same radio-frequency conditions and breakdown rates, has demonstrated an electron beam verified, 25 percent increase in the accelerating gradient of a 22-cavity linac structure by replacing the copper surface around the periphery of each contoured disc iris with high temperature brazed stainless steel. This higher gradient performance presented a compelling argument for avoiding the use of copper surfaces in the beam apertures of high gradient linac structures, and encouraged investigation of alternate metals to further improve the gradient and to avoid the undesirable high losses associated with stainless steel. Ongoing studies and radio-frequency measurements have supported molybdenum as a strong candidate for replacing the copper irises because of the low surface resistivity and superior strength and thermal properties. The fabrication and evaluation of brazed copper/molybdenum short test structures during the Phase I effort confirmed the low loss radio-frequency characteristics of molybdenum, and verified that the structure resonant frequencies remained essentially unchanged after successive braze cycles.  Also, during Phase I, microwave and physical design parameters, compatable with an existing dual resonant ring high power test amplifier, were established for a 2/3 mode, 22-cavity, copper/molybdenum linac structure, including the dual feed racetrack shaped input and output couplers. During Phase II, detailed designs and fabrication of the copper/molybdenum accelerator structure shall be completed, and the final tuned test linac and resonant ring system shall be installed in an existing 17 gigahertz linac test facility.  A further Phase II objective is to complete an extended sequence of high power tests so that the high gradient performance of the new copper/molybdenum structure can be compared directly with that of the recently tested all-copper and copper/stainless steel structures. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Success of the Phase II effort would lead to a better understanding of radio-frequency breakdown in traveling wave linear accelerators and would provide design guidance for further miniaturization of commercial accelerators for medical, radiographic and homeland security applications.",

        "abstract": "In a two-beam accelerator, a high-current drive beam imparts energy to a low current test beam by generating microwave power that flows from one beam to the other. The largest project of this sort is CLIC, located at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, that is being designed for operation at an electron-positron center-ofmass energy as high as 3 TeV. Technical complexity and low efficiency characterize the design for this project, creating technical hurdles that present serious challenges for its designers. This project proposes a new approach to two-beam acceleration by employing detuned cavities in its accelerator structure. In this way, it is possible for both the drive beam and test beam to traverse the same cavities. This could allow operation at higher acceleration gradients than CLIC because of the possibility of exciting the cavities in more than one mode simultaneously, and could allow a higher efficiency for power transfer between one beam and the other. Theoretical and computational analysis was carried out to establish a conceptual design for experiments to be conducted during Phase II. Plans for the experiments, and for further supporting analysis, were formulated. Test cavities will be built, and configured into a short accelerator structure, for measurements of transformer ratio and acceleration gradient, when the structure is driven by the modest current beam from an available 6-MeV RF gun. Analysis will be continued to improve understanding of this novel accelerator configuration. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  For construction of a future multi-TeV electron-positron collider, costs will scale down as the working acceleration gradient rises and as the complexity of the device falls. Thus one benefit from use of the proposed accelerator structure could be a drop in the cost of the machine. This couldin turnincrease the likelihood that the international funding agencies needed to support such an endeavor will react positively to a proposal to underwrite the collider",

The next frontier is high energy, short pulse modulators, continuing the technical thrust begun under recent colliders and numerous X-Band accelerator designs. Modulators to drive the klystrons for these new accelerators must meet aggressive requirements for pulse risetime, flatness, and repeatability requirements, at hundreds of kV. For short-pulse modulators, the Marx topology provides a means to achieve astounding risetimes and flattop control that are simply not available with hybrid (switch / pulse transformer) topologies. The basic proof of principle of solid-state Marx architectures has been demonstrated by several organizations, but deployable solutions for high voltage, short-pulse accelerators have not been available as of yet. In our Phase I effort, we have demonstrated a prototype Marx modulator design with the performance, affordability, and reliability necessary for this new class of accelerators. This proposed effort is focused on advancing the Marx modulator design developed in Phase I from a prototype to a fully functional, installed system for the 500 kV operation of a magnicon tube. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  A key benefit of this SBIR effort, therefore, is to reduce the cost of solid-state modulator designs significantly, allowing them to finally undercut the cost of conventional designs, while providing higher levels of pulse control, reliability, and efficiency. RF systems, primarily the klystrons and modulators, typically account for over one-third of the construction cost of a new accelerator.

We propose a collider based on a short rf pulse (~22ns flat top), high gradient (~267MV/m loaded gradient), high frequency (26GHz) dielectric Two Beam Accelerator (TBA) scheme. This scheme is a modular design and its unique locally repetitive drive beam structure allows a flexible configuration to meet different needs.

        "abstract": "The BELLA project at LBNL seeks to develop ~10 GeV laser-plasma accelerator stages that will produce ultra-short, low-divergence electron bunches with energy spread of ~1%, slice energy spread of ~0.1%.  A beam of sufficient brightness for collider applications can be used to drive a free electron laser and so this is a near-term experimental goal. Simulation support is required to reduce technical risk and increase the chances of experimental success. However, traditional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations suffer from high-frequency particle noise, which artificially increases the emittance and energy spread of the simulated electron bunch.  Fundamentally new techniques are required to adequately suppress numerical noise. We are adding relevant, novel algorithms to the parallel VORPAL framework, including a quasistatic treatment of the beam self-fields, careful initialization of externally-injected electron bunches, 2D cylindrically symmetric versions of existing algorithms and full Vlasov-Maxwell on 3D and 4D meshes. We are carefully benchmarking these algorithms with both PIC and fluid representations of the plasma, both in the lab frame and in Lorentz-boosted frames, using physical parameters relevant to the BELLA Project. The reduction in particle-driven noise and associated artificial emittance growth is dramatic.  For high charge, ultra-bright relativistic electron beams, we showed that a quasistatic treatment of the self-fields (analogous to what is done in standard tracking codes) correctly captures relativistic cancellation of transverse forces and essentially eliminates artificial emittance growth from particle noise. We showed that this approach can be combined with standard PIC or fluid treatments of the plasma, in the lab frame or a Lorentz-boosted frame, for 2D production simulations of laser-plasma accelerators.  Algorithms implemented during Phase I will be generalized to work in 3D and with all relevant VORPAL features. We will add an electromagnetic update with all E and B components collocated at mesh nodes. The laser envelope model will be modified to work in 2D r-z geometry for fast simulations. When testing and benchmarking, we will use BELLA Project parameters and also explore its expected performance. We will generalize the Vlasov-Poisson algorithms under development to work for relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell, and will use them to simulate colliding pulse injection in one and two spatial dimensions, on three and four dimensional meshes, respectively.  We will make VORPAL easier to use. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Implementation and testing of the proposed algorithms and capabilities in VORPAL will create additional opportunities for sales to laser-plasma groups around the world. Each year, more such groups are using VORPAL. The addition of relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell capabilities will more generally extend the scope of applications that can be modeled. In addition to being a key component of the DOE advanced accelerator program, laser-plasma accelerators may also contribute to next-generation light sources.",

        "abstract": "The power that can be produced by klystrons and other RF devices is often limited by the current emission density that can be extracted from the cathode. Operation of existing cathodes at high current density leads to dramatically reduced lifetime. Long life cathodes operating at high current density will allow development of higher power RF sources with improved performance. Control of barium diffusion reduces lifetime limitations due to arcing. Calabazas Creek Research, Inc. proposes to extend the capability of controlled porosity, reservoir cathodes to high power klystrons. Currently, these cathode are only available in diameters less than 0.25 inches. This research will develop techniques to generate cathodes to 2.0 inch diameter. Research will also be performed to lower the work function using alternative materials in the cathode reservoir. Cathodes were built and tested, resulting in improvements in the fabrication and assembly techniques. Cathode material was fabricated allowing larger diameter cathodes with increased mechanical stability. Design formulations were refined to increase mechanical strength and control barium diffusion rates. Designs were generated for magnetron injection guns and Pierce cathodes to two inch diameter. Cathodes will be built and tested with diameters up to two inches, including installation in a high power klystron. Research will continue to refine design calculations, investigate new material, and increase understanding of emission mechanisms by building an emission microscope. A design procedure will be developed and distributed to potential users. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  High power RF sources are in demand for the next generation of high energy accelerators and colliders. High current density, long life cathodes would be applicable to almost all future linear beam devices, including single beam and multiple beam klystrons, traveling wave tubes, backward wave oscillators, and gyrotrons. They would also be applicable to accelerator injectors.",

        "abstract": "Thermionic cathodes are in use in an overwhelming majority of vacuum electronics devices, including high-power RF sources used to drive particle accelerators. These cathodes do not operate reliably or have long lifetime if their current density exceeds 5-10 Amperes/cm2. Artificial diamond and related materials, produced by chemical vapor deposition, appear to be an attractive alternative, which could improve performance for high-power RF sources and electron-beam triggered high-power RF switches. Artificial chemical vapor deposition diamond and related material cathodes are prepared with a range of morphologies for evaluation as high current-density cathodes, and as current amplifiers. Tests of these cathodes in high-power RF switches in a two-channel X-band active pulse compressor driven by the Omega-P/NRL magnicon at US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) are planned. Several recipes and geometries for production of diamond and diamond/graphite cathode films deposited on molybdenum forms were tested, producing up to 300 A, 100 kV pulses. A current amplifier experiment using a thin diamond film in transmission was carried out. Record power gain of 17:1 and peak power values up to 90 MW were obtained  using an uncoated cold cathode in RF pulse compression experiments at NRL. Comparison of recipes for creation of cathodes coated with diamond and diamond/graphite composites will continue, with selection based on performance that will best serve for high-power RF switches. Such cathodes will be installed in switches compatible with the dual-chamber X-band active pulse compressor set-up at NRL, and compression studies with cathode currents up to 400 A will be carried out, in the expectation of demonstrating high X-band power gains ~ 20:1, and high peak powers &amp; gt;150 MW. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Cathodes are ubiquitous in vacuum-electronics devices used as television transmitters, satellite communications, and radars. Versions of the diamond cathodes to be developed in this project could be built for those devices, allowing improved performance at lower cost and with longer lifetimes. The potential market for such cold diamond cathodes could reach $10s of million annually.",

        "abstract": "High-brightness electron beams are required for a number of applications, from advanced accelerators to 4th generation light sources. However, the current technology for producing such beams requires an expensive, complicated laser system to drive a photocathode in a radio frequency gun. This technology is difficult to extend to high duty cycles, as is necessary for many applications in research and industry. In this proposed project, a novel, gated field emission electron source using carbon nanotubes will be developed. While field emission cathodes have been under investigation for use in radio frequency guns for more than two decades, and can produce relatively low emittance for a given cathode size, they have typically either produced very low currents or are prone to damage and are unable to directly produce short pulses. This proposal addresses these issues with two innovations: the use of robust carbon nanotube films capable of producing good current density with low thermal emittance; and a novel radio frequency gun design capable of gating the emission from the cathode to pulses of less than 100 picoseconds. Combined, these innovations enable a high duty cycle, low emittance, short pulse electron source, that avoids the requirement for an expensive photocathode drive laser. In Phase I of the proposed project, the two-frequency gun was designed and simulated, and a carbon nanotube cathode was experimentally tested in a pulsed regime. The promising results have laid a strong foundation for the work follow in this Phase II project. In Phase II, the engineering will be completed and the two-frequency radio frequency gun will be fabricated. Carbon nanotube cathodes will also be optimized and tested under radio frequency power. Finally, an optimized, low-emittance gun will be fabricated and tested. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:   Besides applications in high-energy physics and next-generation light sources, the carbon nanotube cathode based gun described in this proposal could also be applied wherever thermionic cathodes are used in commercial applications, such as in medical radiotherapy linacs, cargo inspection linacs, and industrial irradiation systems. The gated carbon nanotube cathode gun would produce better beam quality, reduce the cost, and potentially increase the reliability of such systems.",

The positron supply for the ILC will be generated by shining a 285 kW beam of 10 MeV photons onto a metallic target. The photons themselves are to be generated from a series of 100 2-m-long short-period double-helical undulator units energized by a 150 GeV electron beam. We will develop a special Nb3Sn insulated strand for the winding of the undulator. A three-stage R &amp; amp;D program is planned in which: (1) superconducting strand is developed and manufactured, (2) Based on the FEM modeled design from Phase I, a 12 mm period undulator will be wound on armatures with optimized designs and tested, (3) FEM modeling will be used to optimize the geometry design of the armature, recommendations will be made for the design and construction of undulators with shorter periods. , (4) The designs and construction of undulators with shorter periods, 12 mm, 11.5mm, 11 m and 10 mm, will be wound and tested.  An innovative tube-type Nb3Sn conductor intended for stable operation at 4 K in the field range below 4 T has been developed and insulated, and 14 mm period undulator was made and tested successfully. The overall Phase-I successful experience will provide a basis for the full FEM modeling, designing, and testing of shorter period helical undulator to be wound from fine-filament, stable, Nb3Sn strand. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The strand manufacturing and coil design/winding experience developed under this program will have wide ranging benefits. Tube-type Nb3Sn strand, characterized by its flux-jump stability at low fields and low persistent-current magnetization will find many accelerator applications. It will benefit the winding of: (i) light-source wiggler and undulator magnets in general, (ii) hadron-collider dipoles.

FAR-TECH, Inc. proposes a dielectric-loaded BPM that uses a novel coupling scheme. These features allow the BPM to fit in a very small space of 2 inches. The dielectric loading also increases the cavity shunt impedance and allows greater sensitivity than a comparable bare cavity.

Sub-micron beam position measurements are crucial to beam emittance preservation and control in this machine.

        "abstract": "This proposal describes an innovative high strength silver alloy for making Bi2212/Ag round wire conductor. To generate magnetic fields greater than 20 T, a new high field superconductor such as Bi2212 is needed. However, Bi2212 is brittle ceramic that can be easily damaged, and its critical current is very strain sensitive. The Bi2212 compound is contained in a silver matrix that is chemically compatible with the Bi2212 ceramic. Silver provides very little mechanical support for the superconductor during either magnet fabrication or operation. High field magnets are subject to large stresses, which can exceed the yield strength of the silver matrix, causing degradation of the superconductor, and necessitating more expensive approaches for making high field amgnets. This proposal seeks to develop a high strength, high modulus silver alloy for manufacturing Bi2212 round wire multifilament conductor. The silver is strengthened by a fine dispersion of alumina particles that are chemically inert to Bi2212 and produce an alloy having high strength and stiffness even after high temperature processing. The increased strength and stiffness provided by the silver alloy results in greater resistance to mechanical stresses and electromagnetic forces. These attributes simplify magnet design, resulting in reduced costs with the added benefit of higher performance. Potential applications include particle accelerators and high field NMR magnets. Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of all the critical aspects of the technology: production of an silver/alumina composite, fabrication of tubes from the composite and a Bi2212 conductor using a silver/alumina composite tube. The Phase II plan includes research to further refine the basic alloy formulation, develop improved processing technology, advance the production technology for making tubes, and a full scale demonstration for making a Bi2212 production conductor. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  A high field superconductor such as Bi2212 will find its primary application in accelerator magnets for high energy physics. The other major application for the technology is high field nuclear magnetic resonance systems for imaging complex organic compounds and biological materials.",

This project proposes to address the commercialization gap that exists between the proofofprinciple large area photodetector (LAPD) program and the efficient manufacture of large area Microchannel plate (MCP) devices using atomic layer deposition (ALD). For programs such as the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL) project and other applications in high energy physics, medical discovery and diagnostics and homeland security applications this will be transformational. Arradiance, as the key commercial ALD contributor to the Argonne LAPD collaboration, has developed nanofilm based MCP devices that exceed commercial microchannel plate (MCP) performance, for the small test samples that mimic the LAPD MCP device. In Phase I, Arradiance was able to demonstrate the feasibility of producing the large area LAPD MCP device through an innovative set of surface area experiments that simulated the LAPD MCP device using existing ALD process equipment. The MCPs produced in this experiment performed identically to MCPs produced in small batch environments. Arradiance has also developed a conceptual large area ALD system design that has improved upon many of the gaps in the existing, small sample process equipment. Phase II will enable Arradiance to fully produce and provide to the Argonne collaboration the large area LAPD MCP for process development and device optimization. Phase II will also afford Arradiance the opportunity to optimize the process and equipment to support economical LAPD MCP production for applications in high energy physics. The techniques, developed in this proposal required for largescale commercial ALD production of the LAPD a family of largearea robust detectors with the capability to be tailored for a wide variety of applications for which largearea economical photon detection will be transformational. Success of this program has the potential to impact many other applications where ALD is used to coat extremely high surface area materials in technology areas such as: catalysis, fuel cell, energy storage and filtration.",

Timetodigital converters (TDCs) are effective for TOF measurement. With few exceptions, subnanosecond TDCs have been implemented as applicationspecific integrated circuits (ASICs), which are expensive and timeconsuming to develop. It is also not yet possible to implement analog signal measurement and processing close to a largeformat detector array. A TDC with improved timing resolution and channel count is being implemented in an inexpensive, reconfigurable FPGAbased form to minimize cost and address diverse applications. Signal TDC measurement and pulse processing functions include binary pulse processing (BPP), single and multiple timeoverthreshold (TOT/MTOT) measurement, coincidence detection, and auto/cross correlation. 1024 channels with 850 ps TOF resolution can be integrated into a ca. 4 &amp; quot; 5 &amp; quot; printed circuit board, and as many as 512 channels can be implemented with one or more of these functions: sub20ps resolution TDC, 100MHzscale perchannel count rates, and realtime histogramming and coincidence detection. All Phase I program objectives were met and many were exceeded. The 64channel prototype board achieved 25ps TOF resolution, and TOT, MTOT, and auto/cross correlation were demonstrated on a subset of the channels, using programmable amplification, pulse shaping, and threshold interface boards. The TDC/BPP board was calibrated and tested using InGaAs detector arrays, Geigermode InGaAs APDs, and silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) detectors, using a gigabit Ethernet connection, with favorable results relative to more expensive, commercially available 1channel instruments. The Phase I prototype will be ported to a nextgeneration FPGA with onethird the cost, onequarter the power, four times more channels per board, and TOF resolution two times finer. An instrument will be demonstrated with a 1024channel lowcountrate (subnanosecond) mode, and a highpulsecount mode with as many as 512 TDC channels, including TOT, MTOT, and auto/crosscorrelation. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  When completed, the technology will be made available to developers of instruments for HEP and nuclear physics. NonDOE applications include radiation detectors for nuclear instruments, biomedical imaging devices such as positron emission tomography (PET) imaging systems and Xray imaging devices, and military applications such as laser radar (LADAR).",

This need for reliable and efficient energy conversion and storage is fundamental to coping with inconsistent power sources such as wind and solar, as well as improving the management of other base-load resources.

A portion of this infrastructure is reaching the end of its design life or reliable service life.  Complete replacement of old or failing cable systems is a costly option and, at any rate, unnecessary because, depending on their environment, cable systems do not age uniformly.  It has been recognized in the electrical power transmission community that the use of new and improved instrumentation for on-line condition monitoring of underground cables would be highly beneficial. The key parameters of interest include partial discharge at splice joints and in cable insulation, and cable temperature. A low-cost multifunction fiber optic sensor system will be developed.  It will be capable of detecting events, such as partial discharge, that can reduce cable life.  The system also will be capable of monitoring cable structure stresses and temperature. This system, with multiplexed sensors along the same light weight fiber cable, will facilitate ease of installation and long term condition monitoring.  Data signals will be able to travel over many miles without corruption, enabling acquisition and analysis at a central station.  The system will have two other significant features:  (1) it will be smart, providing prognostics for condition based maintenance and repair; and (2) it will require zero power at the sensor deployment points. Proof-of-concept was successfully executed and deployment feasibility was demonstrated for detecting partial discharge events and temperature. In Year 1, a functional prototype system will be developed.  In Year 2, a pre-production model will be developed, addressing both new and retrofit markets.

Electrical cables, including those used for instrumentation and control, are vital for safety related systems and problems related to these cables are often difficult to diagnose. The health of these cables and the reliability of their signal transmissions are affected by the aging condition of cable insulation, jacket material, conductors, and connectors. Thus, the ability to detect the location of cable degradation is an important part of preventing cable related system failures. Fortunately, most if not all cable degradation can be detected prior to failure through baseline cable condition measurements and follow-on testing. As such, the objective of this Phase II project is to conduct a research and development effort to design, develop, validate, and implement an integrated cable condition monitoring system for nuclear power reactors. Analysis and Measurement Services Corporation (AMS) successfully completed the Phase I portion of this research project by establishing the feasibility of integrating advanced cable diagnostic capabilities into a single portable cable maintenance test package. This conceptual design developed in Phase I will be brought to life in Phase II by developing a fully functional prototype system and demonstrating it in the two U.S. nuclear power plants which have already agreed to be the test beds for this research project. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The final commercialization of this research effort will result in successfully addressing a concern that will improve plant operations, improve plant safety and reliability, and ultimately result in lower operating costs.

        "abstract": "Although nuclear power plants have provided a reliable source of power for the U.S. over the last four decades, unexpected equipment failures have resulted in losses of power production and millions of dollars of revenue, which may have been avoided if the warning signs of impending failures had been recognized. Likewise, utilities have spent millions of dollars and lost countless days of power production replacing equipment and components that showed no signs of degradation, yet had reached the end of the manufacturers specified design life.  These types of problems and resource inefficiencies have prompted the nuclear industry to explore alternatives to traditional time-based maintenance practices in favor of condition-based maintenance strategies that employ advanced surveillance, diagnostic, and prognostic techniques. The area of prognostics, which concerns methodologies for predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of equipment and components, has only recently been given consideration by research organizations and other experts as a promising technology for the nuclear industry. The work for this Phase II project proposes to expand the research in prognostic technologies and demonstrate its application in nuclear power plants. This goal will be accomplished in this project by developing and validating practical prognostics tools in terms of algorithms and software products for RUL estimation of selected nuclear power plant equipment. The Phase I successfully established the feasibility of using prognostics for nuclear plant equipment and components through hands-on laboratory work, prototype software development, and industry research. Nuclear plant applications were also identified that would be amenable to the use of prognostics. Additionally, partnerships were formed with a number of nuclear utilities to allow for implementation and demonstration of these technologies in a Phase II effort. This R &amp; amp;D project will employ a comprehensive, hands-on approach required to move prognostics in the nuclear industry from feasibility towards full commercialization. This project will have four primary goals to include: 1) identify critical components and systems in nuclear power plants that are most immediately amenable to the use of prognostics, 2) develop software modules that integrate a variety of prognostic methods for estimating system RUL, 3) validate the prognostic methods with plant and/or laboratory data, and 4) demonstrate the application of prognostics in the asset lifecycle management practices currently employed in the nuclear power industry.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The product of this work has immediate application in all operating nuclear plants both in the U.S. and worldwide. Products that can accurately determine the RUL of equipment and components would be of immediate benefit for predictive maintenance in all industrial processes.",

        "abstract": "The primary challenges associated with Very High Temperature Reactors (VHTR) stem from their extremely high operating temperatures, especially during accident conditions which way has necessitated new material systems to be developed for most of the core construction, including fuel. There currently exists no method to directly measure peak fuel temperature in emerging Gen-IV reactors. Lambda Instruments, Inc. is developing extremely high-temperature, radiation-hardened fiber optic temperature sensors based on our unique sapphire waveguide technology. Sapphire is an inherently high-temperature material and has been shown to retain excellent transmission properties in moderate radiation and extreme high-temperature environments. All of the primary objectives of the Phase I were achieved with great success. Sapphire fibers were shown to survive in both high temperature (1600C) and moderate radiation (3.3x1017n/cm2, &amp; gt;1MeV) environments. Temperature sensor fabrication methods for high-temperature operation were designed and implemented. These initial fabrication methods demonstrated success at high temperatures up to 1600C. Additional fabrication methods for improved sensor ruggedization and survivability were also conceived and will be implemented during the Phase II project. The primary objectives for Phase II include: 1) Improving temperature sensor ruggedization, 2) Design and build optimized readout system, 3) Demonstrate extended survivability in high-temperature and high-radiation environments, 4) Demonstrate operation in high-radiation environment, and 5) Develop commercialization and transition to manufacturing strategy. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The primary commercial applications include emerging Gen-IV VHTR plants. The primary public benefit will be improving the safety and performance of emerging high temperature gas-cooled reactors. With growing international competition in nuclear power, the U.S. is at risk of losing our preeminent position in new reactor development. The development and international acceptance of these advanced reactors could result in a significant export for the U.S.. Key to that development, however, is safety, reliability, performance and cost. The proposed sensor development in Phase II supports all of these thrusts.",

        "abstract": "Statement of Problem: Light water reactor fuel used in current reactors uses slightly enriched uranium oxide (UO2) fuel pellets with zirconium alloy (zircaloy) clad. Zircaloy clad loses all of its tensile strength at temperatures of 500 oC, and balloons outward during the early phases of a loss of coolant accident, thereby blocking the flow of emergency coolant. Also, it reacts exothermically when exposed to emergency coolant after an accident. This behavior was a principal cause of the severe fuel damage during the TMI reactor accident and was the most likely cause of fuel damage and radioactivity release at Fukushima, Japan. Silicon Carbide (SiC) cladding, on the other hand, retains its strength to 1600 oC, would not balloon and block flow during an accident, and would not react exothermically with emergency coolant. Even though SiC cladding has been under development for over seven years, it still has several major technology development challenges that must be addressed before licensing and deployment. Examples of remaining challenges are development of a robust end joint to seal the fuel within the cladding, improving the composite structure for greater impact resistance, and creating new processes with the capability to produce 14 foot long clad tubes. And because the cladding is inelastic, the fuel will run hotter, requiring a change in fuel form such as annular UO2 fuel at higher enrichment, or use of a high thermal conductivity high melting temperature fuel such as thoria-plutonia. This work is intended to (1) demonstrate the superior behavior of SiC triplex cladding during severe accidents, and including a spent fuel pool loss of coolant situation, (2) to identify and develop creative solutions to the remaining technical challenges, and (3) to examine solutions to the higher fuel temperature issue such as use of thoria-plutonia fuel and higher enriched UO2. It is intended that the resulting SiC triplex clad product would be compatible with a variety of fuel forms that evolve based on ongoing industry and DOE fuel development programs. In Phase I we demonstrated three key characteristics of SiC fuel cladding. (1) unlike the zircaloy cladding used in current reactors throughout the world, the SiC does not react exothermically with hot water, or air, at temperatures of 1400 oC and higher; (2) it is chemically compatible with alternate fuel forms such as thoria based fuels that have higher thermal conductivity and melting temperatures than UO2; and (3) when coupled with a thoria-plutonia fuel form, it has the capability of very long fuel cycles (e.g. over 7 years), very high burnup (over 120 mwd/kg) and very high plutonium destruction rates (over 60% of initial Pu loading). Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Because of its robustness and durability during severe accidents such as at Fukushima, SiC triplex cladding has the potential to avoid core damage during severe accidents, and thus enable the continuation of safe nuclear operations in existing reactors throughout the world. When coupled with new fuel forms such as thoria-plutonia fuel, it can operate to higher burnups, thus reducing the amount of spent fuel and the burden on the US waste repository, and can also enable the disposition of plutonium from excess weapons disposition, and recycled spent fuel without the penalty of producing new plutonium, as in uranium based mixed oxide fuel.",

        "abstract": "The detection of radioactive xenon is an important component of both national and international efforts to detect nuclear explosions. Existing radioxenon detection systems have high sensitivity, but a better discrimination of Xe isotopes is desirable to better distinguish the radioxenon background created by nuclear power plants and medical isotope facilities from a nuclear explosion. Existing systems are also very complex, requiring cryocoolers to reach the operating temperatures for germanium detectors or multiple detectors for beta/gamma coincidence rejection. In the proposed effort, silicon detectors will be explored as a possible alternative to existing radioxenon detector systems. Silicon detectors are sensitive to beta radiation; have very high resolution for X-ray energies that the existing systems can not clearly distinguish; and as compact, solid state devices can be made into simpler systems. On the other hand, their detection efficiency is lower, so that the Phase I goal was a careful study of the improvements and drawbacks compared to the existing detector system. Prototypes of silicon detectors will be developed and built in Phase II.  In Phase I, radiation interactions in Si were simulated and test measurements were performed with reference sources to obtain resolutions and efficiencies at key energies as well as detector backgrounds. These results were used to compute the minimum detectable concentration for Xe isotopes (e.g. 0.13 mBq/m3 for 133Xe) and compare them to specifications for existing systems (1.0 mBq/m3). Following discussions with detector manufacturers, design concepts for Phase II prototype detectors were established. In Phase II, several prototype Si detectors will be built, operated with existing electronics, and evaluated for their performance through test measurements and quantitative spectrum analysis. This includes design and manufacture of the prototypes, firmware/software upgrades for the electronics and development of analysis routines that process the raw energy spectra to compute concentrations of Xe isotopes. Commercial applications and Other Benefits: The technology to be developed in this project, if successful, will support the efforts by US agencies and the International Monitoring System established by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty to monitor radioxenon from nuclear explosions and background sources by giving them a more precise tool to detect and distinguish Xe isotopes. The proposed detector would be mainly used in the monitoring stations established by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, in related radioxenon research labs, in mobile equipment for on-site inspections, and potentially for exhaust stack monitoring of nuclear power plants and medical isotope facilities.",

Thus, these sensors should have the capability of rapidly measuring key isotopic contents and ratios of actinides as well as other elemental composition of various impurities in condensed samples up to 250 meters with a spatial resolution of 1 mm. To ensure the safety of the operations personnel, the sensors should provide real-time and on-site standoff detection capability.

        "abstract": "CMOS APS detectors have emerged as an attractive imaging solution to replace CCD technology. They can be very thin, yield good signaltonoise ratio (SNR) at room temperature, and offer the possibility of incorporating inpixel data processing. But despite its potential, APS has demonstrated relatively poor actual performance; a key reason is that in existing monolithic implementations, the photodiodes (PDs) are integrated into the same layer as the readout circuits, incurring tradeoffs in materials and pixel layout. An alternate approach using backside illumination (BSI) is becoming available, but present implementations have very little near infrared (NIR) response, making them illsuited for imaging night sky radiance. A commercial CMOS process is thus needed that can fabricate largearea, highpixeldensity, fully depleted BSI imagers, in a hybrid architecture. A highly NIRresponsive silicononinsulator (SOI) BSI imager technology is being developed, including: 1) lownoise CMOSbased readout circuits, 2) subfield photocomposition (stitched) fabrication, 3) thick, fully depleted PD arrays, and 4) vialess 3D wafer bonding and electrical interconnection. A highperformance SOI CMOS readout integrated circuit (ROIC) was characterized and optimized for 3D integration with deeply depleted silicon PD arrays. New pinned PD pixel layouts were designed, fabricated and demonstrated. The design met the solicited application specifications, including high quantum efficiency, response into the NIR, and overall lowlightlevel performance (dynamic range, uniformity, linearity, etc). An approach was developed for implementing the ROIC in a stitched form. The stitched ROIC pixel design was demonstrated in simulation and the PD devices were demonstrated through lab measurements on 10 mpitch arrays. The ROICs and PDs were made ready for largeformat array fabrication, 3D hybridization, and demonstration in working lowlightlevel cameras. In Phase II, the highdensity, largearea PD arrays will be optimized and readied for integration with the photocomposed ROIC. Existing ROIC wafers and PD array wafers will be hybridized using vialess wafertowafer bonding and electrical interconnection. Stitched largeformat ROICs will be fabricated on 200mm wafers and characterized, and these ROIC wafers will be hybridized to the PD arrays using the same bonding process. The stitched ROIC will be compared to its nonstitched predecessor. Imagers will be made available throughout for independent test and evaluation at DOE labs including LLNL. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  In addition to lowlightlevel and persistent surveillance imaging, the technology has application in highenergy and nuclear physics, protein crystallography, DNA sequencing, electron microscopy, spectroscopy, spacequalified star trackers, astronomy, night vision, and other digital imaging applications.",

Mercury is a particular concern because it is a very toxic element that is widely spread in the atmosphere and water.

Los Gatos Research will develop a novel lab-on-a-chip technology capable of performing real time, in situ measurements of trace mercury and their chemical species with high selectivity and sensitivity. During the Phase I effort, we have established the technical feasibility of performing on-chip mercury speciation.  In particular, we have successfully performed on-chip separations of mercury ions (Hg2+) and methylmercury ions (CH3Hg+) in an aqueous solution with UV laser induced fluorescence detection.  In addition, we have also successfully demonstrated automated on-chip sample preparation and analysis capability.

By reducing the footprint and power consumption, the Phase II prototype will be compact, lightweight, and battery powered ideally suited for on-site real time monitoring and characterization of mercury species in the subsurface environments.

        "abstract": "The U.S. Department of Energy is currently seeking technologies that can decrease the weight and thermal insulation associated with personal protective clothing/equipment (PPC/PPE). The call for this technology has stemmed from the poor working conditions associated with workers in contaminated areas of nuclear facilities and the need to mitigate the effects of heat stress. Because the primary objective is to provide a comfortable working environment for these workers, Mainstream has developed an active cooling system that can be used with existing PPC/PPE instead of developing new protective suits. No matter how thin or lightweight an enclosed protective suit can be made, a worker in a hot environment can experience the effects of heat stress. Unless the suit is able to remove heat from the body and either store that energy or reject it to the atmosphere, the suit will act as insulation. Mainstreams active system is able to provide a cool/dry environment for these workers in even the hottest of environments. The system is lightweight and has similar volume requirements to a small backpack. In Phase I of this program, Mainstream completed the development and testing of an efficient and effective microclimate system that is designed to integrate with existing PPC. Through this effort, Mainstream has demonstrated that a low-cost, reliable system is a near-term reality and can be marketed without the need for a Phase III developmental effort. In Phase II, Mainstream will fabricate and test a second-generation prototype system and deliver the system to the DOE prior to completion of the Phase II contract. User feedback will allow Mainstream to proceed to a production design prior to completing the Phase II effort.  In addition to providing a safe and comfortable working environment to nuclear facilities workers, this technology has significant potential in other commercial and military markets. These markets include firefighters, HAZMAT workers, workers in clean rooms, workers in other contaminated areas, as well as military personnel that are required to wear Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) suits and bomb disposal suits. In addition to the development of an integrated system, this effort will bring forth individual components that have strong potential for both commercial and military markets.",

        "abstract": "The production of high-quality, high-charge-state ion beams is an area of intensive research and development worldwide for particle accelerators, atomic physics experiments, and industrial applications. Electron cyclotron resonance ion sources (ECRIS) generate multiply charged ions through electron impact ionization in a confined plasma. These sources reduce the cost to produce ion beams by reducing the accelerating voltage needed to achieve the desired beam energy. However, the three-dimensional (3D) geometry of the ECRIS magnetic field generates 3D structures in the extracted beam, which increases their emittance and reduces the efficiency with which they can be delivered to an accelerator. The complicated 3D geometry also makes numerical modeling a difficult task.  FAR-TECH, Inc. proposes to use a mapping technique to develop a sophisticated modeling tool that can simulate the 3D ECRIS plasma in a reasonable amount of computation time. The tool will aid ECRIS users in operating existing ion sources and designing and building new ones. During Phase I, FAR-TECH developed a mapping technique to provide a useful means of estimating the electron distribution function (EDF) in 3D without the computational expense of a 3D calculation. This quasi-3D modeling technique (Quasi3D) predicts successfully the 3D nature of ECRIS properties as observed in experiments such as the triangular cross sections of extracted beam ions. Our Quasi3D mapping technique eliminates the most time consuming part of the computation. The quasi-3D mapping is only valid for electrons. The complete 3D model requires proper treatment of gas and ions. In phase II, we will develop a Monte-Carlo Particle-In-Cell (MC-PIC) simulation module for support gas tracking. The electrons from our Quasi3D mapping will be integrated with the MCC-PIC gas and ion simulations. The completed code will treat electrons and ions self-consistently and provide 3D ECRIS modeling capability, within a practical computation time, up to steady states of an ECRIS (tens of milliseconds). Simulation results will be validated against measurements on ECRIS devices. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Numerical modeling of ECRISs will improve the efficiency of rare isotope ion beam facilities as well as industrial applications using highly charged ions, such a materials processing and hadron therapy.",

        "abstract": "The electron-cyclotron resonance (ECR) source is rapidly becoming the de facto standard source for accelerator applications where a reliable, robust, and low maintenance source of positive ions is needed for a particular application. As a result, a wide variety of ECR sources have been developed for specific accelerator applications ranging from isotope production to proton therapy to ion implantation and industrial processing. Note however that even the simplest of these sources is relatively large and requires hundreds of kilowatts of RF power. Electron-cyclotron resonance (ECR) sources used for industrial processing, such as ion implantation, are larger still. A small, lightweight, and reliable high-current source of singly ionized atoms could have a revolutionary impact on accelerator systems and industrial processing. The design of a miniature ECR (miniECR) ion source, developed under a Phase I grant, is considerably smaller and more compact than those available today. This source makes judicious use of dielectric materials to shrink the dimensions of the ion source to values significantly smaller than the free-space wavelength (~12 cm). An additional benefit of this small size is a reduction in RF power required to energize the source from hundreds of Watts to less than 100 Watts. The design of the miniECR source was completed in Phase I and two sources were fabricated for testing. The proposed Phase II program characterizes miniECR sources under a variety of conditions specific to different missions. In particular, beams of protons produced by a miniECR source will be characterized to optimize the source for proton-beam accelerators (isotope production, proton therapy, etc.). Operation of a miniECR source with deuterium ions will be characterized to optimize source parameters for neutron sources. Finally, characterization of a miniECR source operating with heavy ions optimizes the source for production of ions suitable for ion implantation and as a source of ions for tuning charge-breeder injection lines. The small size of the miniECR source, coupled with the inherent ruggedness and reliability of ECR sources, simplifies considerably the ion injector of proton accelerators and neutron sources. The small size also enables large ion implantation sources to be replaced with an array of miniECR sources. Additionally a linear array of miniECR sources enables wafer processing by sweeping a line source of ions across the wafer. This approach is not possible with existing ion implantation systems and enables a new paradigm in ion implantation processing that is more compatible with the large-aperture bending magnets used to isolate a particular ion species for implanting in the wafer.",

        "abstract": "A fundamental issue with high average current photoelectron guns is the generation of stray electrons and ions which can damage the photoemitter. Both the photogenerated electron bunch and any field emitted electrons can potentially directly impact the photocathode, desorb molecules from the gun structure and act as ionization agents for backgroundgas atoms. Ion backbombardment of the photoemitter can alter or damage both the photoemitter and the activation layer, resulting in diminished lifetime and poor photoyield, hampering efficient operation. The source of damaging gas ions is inadequately low residual gas pressure in the gun structure. Lower pressures need to be achieved by the application of extreme high vacuum techniques. Development and routine application of extreme high vacuum has been delayed by the inability to routinely and accurately measure the extreme high vacuum residual gas pressure. The goal of this program is to develop an inexpensive and accurate pressuremeasuring gauge for the extreme high vacuum range through the use of conductivity changes in titania nanotubes when exposed to hydrogen. Titania nanotube sensors were packaged and tested for hydrogen sensitivity in vacuum using a custom test fixture. They were characterized for sensitivity as a function of base resistance, noise figure, optical excitation response and were shown to maintain hydrogen sensitivity following a vacuum chamber bake. The hydrogen absorbing titania nanotube sensors will be optimized for vacuum sensitivity, demonstrated to operate well at extreme high vacuum pressures, quantified for optimal operating conditions and be integrated into a control system including the process for crosscalibration. The optimal method for sensitivity restoration in vacuum will be established. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Reduced gas ion damage to photocathodes, due to routine operation in extreme high vacuum, will allow less robust photocathodes to be used in properly designed accelerator injector guns. Other markets that require extreme high vacuum will also benefit, such as extreme ultraviolet photolithography for semiconductor mask production (benefitting IBM, Intel, and AMD, among others), MEMS manufacturing and space simulation efforts.",

        "abstract": "To elucidate the mysterious origins of nuclear spin, the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee (NSAC) has identied the science of electron-ion colliders, and specically the proposed polarized electron and ion collider, as absolutely central to U.S. science. These machines, estimated to cost as much as 500M 1B, will require highly polarized particle beams. To reduce the risk associated with building these machines, scientists need accurate simulations of spin dynamics in colliding beam accelerators. However current spin tracking technology takes many days to track an ensemble of particles across a single resonance in RHIC. We plan to develop a spin-orbit code capable of simulating a realistic distribution of particles through the typical acceleration cycle on a manageable compute time scale. This will be accomplished in a well-maintained and stable software development environment. This will put into the hands of DoE scientists an essential and maintainable tool necessary for performing fast and accurate simulations of spin-polarized particle beams. We are developing algorithms and code that take advantage of the highly-parallel and relatively inexpensive compute power of modern graphics processing units (GPUs). In Phase I we benchmarked, corrected and MPI parallelized the existing TEAPOT-SPINK code. We also developed a self-contained spin-orbit transport version of this code for the GPU capable of tracking 1000s of particles 50 -100 times faster at double precision than serial execution on a 2.4 GHz CPU. We studied the magnitude of element slicing necessary as function of energy and resonance proximity. As well we developed an approach to handle dynamic changes in optics. The approach developed in Phase I to simulate dynamic changes in the lattice under acceleration and beta squeeze needs to implemented. Realistic helical dipole spin rotator and snake models will be developed parameterized by energy and /or current. Additionally the UAL infrastructure stands in need of upgrading via the development of a better build system, tool chains, lattice parsers and establishment of regression tests to ensure the stability of this software tool for use by future accelerator physicists. Commercial Applications and Other Benets:  The proposed software development will directly benet scientists working to design high-luminosity polarized beam accelerators required for fundamental advances in experimental nuclear physics. Computational scientists working on this project will develop expertise in this area, creating opportunities for future contract work. In addition, the development of new computational algorithms for graphics processing units will provide additional technology and opportunities for applications and consulting.",

This SBIR proposal offers high-temperature-capable solid catcher materials for use in the pre-Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) to improve yields of rare isotopes as atomic or single-species molecular vapors. The applicant will develop carbon aerogels with a nanoporous microstructure to facilitate trapping radioactive isotopes for the efficient release of single-species molecular vapors. The project will focus on developing an efficient and fast-release hot solid catcher material combined with ion sources to harvest unused rare isotope beams. The feasibility of fabricating monoliths of undoped and doped carbon aerogels with tunable densities, high surface area, and high porosity after supercritical drying and pyrolysis at 800 C in an inert environment was demonstrated. We also established that the monoliths remained intact and retained porosity even after vacuum-assisted heating to 1500 C, the temperature required for hot catcher applications in a beam-line. In Phase II we will refine the carbon aerogel processing protocols to yield monoliths with desirable pore sizes and morphology and targeted material densities. Our industrial subcontractor and potential commercialization partner will perform vacuum-assisted heating cycles of selected carbon aerogel samples at temperatures from 1000 C to 2000 C. Our collaborator(s) will assist in evaluating the release efficiency of solid carbon catchers in the beam-line to improve yields of rare isotopes of C15O and C15O2. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Our approach uses aerogel nanotechnology. The carbon aerogel microstructure would serve as a fast-release catcher for rare isotopes with lifetimes ranging from a few milliseconds to a few minutes. Such isotopes are useful in understanding the origins of the universe. Rare isotopes also have contributions in nuclear medicine suited to both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.

        "abstract": "Existing silicon on insulator (SOI) pixel detectors which integrate single gate transistors with substrate diodes are limited by two key problems. First, the SOI transistor performance is degraded by the large potentials that must be applied to the substrate to fully deplete the diodes. Secondly, the performance of these SOI pixel detectors degrades with exposure to radiation due to charge trapping in the buried oxide. However, SOI pixel detectors offer the best resolution at high speed while using less power at lower cost than competing technologies like monolithic active pixel detectors or 3-D chip stacking. American Semiconductors next generation FlexPix SOI pixel detector technology provides all of the benefits of existing SOI pixel detectors, but eliminates the two key problems that limit performance.  FlexPix combines multi-independent gate Flexfet transistors with diode detectors integrated in the substrate. Flexfets unique multi-gate architecture effectively shields the transistor channel and eliminates the performance degradation due to both substrate bias and radiation charge trapping. Feasibility of the next generation x-ray imager has been established by successful completion of the design, layout, simulation, and analysis using the FlexPix SOI pixel detector technology. All Phase I technical objectives were met or exceeded through the collaborative research effort between American Semiconductor and the Fermilab Particle Physics Division. American Semiconductor exceeded the program objections by also completing the design, layout and simulation of two FlexPix advanced characterization test chips that in Phase II will provide key detector data to facilitate future designs by other government and commercial groups and spur business growth in Phase III and beyond. Successful manufacture of the substrate diodes in the FlexPix technology was demonstrated in an earlier Phase I program. Fabrication and testing of two FlexPix wafer lots will enable iterative design and process optimization to meet the requirements of the MAMBO x-ray imaging application and provide detailed process information for future business development. The first manufacturing run will employ the multi-chip configuration completed in Phase I containing both the basic x-ray imager design and the two pixel characterization test chips. The second manufacturing run will allow for design and process optimization based upon testing from the first wafer lot. For the second wafer lot, the team will create a full-scale MAMBO FlexPix x-ray imager prototype that will provide a key demonstration of the technology to spur additional business development in Phase III. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The FlexPix technology will lead to improvements in pixel detectors used in medical, military, government and related commercial imaging applications. Specific applications include high dynamic range biomedical x-ray, nondestructive and non-invasive testing, health physics, and environmental studies.",

        "abstract": "Domestic CMOS imager manufacturing technologies are attractive as a replacement for CCDs but do not yet meet all the requirements of scientific imagers. Their use in tailored scientific imaging applications is hampered by the large wafer sizes and high cost of deepsubmicron fabrication; the low voltage of standard processes also precludes the formation of deeply depleted photodiodes (PDs) in the same silicon as the readout circuits. Many new processes such as backside illumination (BSI) exist but are not optimized for sciencegrade imaging. Sciencegrade detectors would generally be best served by a 0.18m 6 &amp; quot; CMOS fab, operating at production volume for quality, yield, and affordability. However, new processes such as substrate thinning, 3D integrated circuit stacking, and 3D via formation, as well as new packaging technologies, are available only on equipment for 8 &amp; quot; and larger wafers.  Ideally, in a sciencegrade imager, two separate silicon layers will be used to form the PDs and the readout circuits, allowing each to be formed in optimized silicon layers of two different resistivities. The use of silicon on insulator (SOI) CMOS wafers can accomplish this separation. A detectorinhandle (DH) BSI imager can be fabricated using the bottom (handle) Si layer of the SOI wafer to form PDs and the top Si layer to manufacture radhard, highspeed amplification and readout circuits. In this program, several steps are being added to a commercial CMOS process to support this architecture, most notably steps for the electrical interconnection between the PDs and the readout circuitry. The Phase I program demonstrated the feasibility of establishing a domestic, commercially available DHBSI imaging capability, for both 6 &amp; quot; and 8 &amp; quot; SOI CMOS wafers. Highperformance silicon photodetector arrays were fabricated on SOI wafers and characterized. An imager readout integrated circuit (ROIC) was fabricated on an 8 &amp; quot; SOI process, and its optical and electrical performance was characterized. The process flow required to integrate the DHBSI on SOI CMOS processes was documented, and simulated using TCAD tools and prototypes. These processes were analyzed to prepare for porting to a 6 &amp; quot; process. The throughBOX processes necessary to implement the DHBSI SOI CMOS imager will be optimized for a 6 &amp; quot; domestic radiationhardened SOI CMOS process. After porting the ROIC from 8 &amp; quot; to 6 &amp; quot;, fabricating imagers, and confirming performance, fully functional DHBSI SOI CMOS imagers will be fabricated. The process flow will be prepared to port it to an 8 &amp; quot; fab in the Phase III program. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The highperformance detector technology will enable innovation in markets from highenergy and nuclear physics detectors to military night vision and persistent surveillance, and industrial markets such as protein crystallography, optical and electron microscopy, astronomy, and highspeed imaging.",

Specifically, these systems should provide collaborative data analysis and visualization with capabilities to communicate among users, creating a sense of participation and knowledge sharing via novel display technologies such as 3D autostereo. An advanced collaborative super high-resolution autostereo volumetric 3D visualization system that is scalable from laptop to wall size and that will allow multiple users to freely visualize and collaboratively analyze high-density volumetric scientific data in a distortion-free autostereo (without eyewear) 3D format is being proposed. The proposed system consists of a high-speed/parallel multiangular image beam scanner based on commercial-off-the-shelf micro-projectors, a holographic multiplexed projection screen, multichannel video image generation, and interface electronics. In Phase I the feasibility of the proposed volumetric 3D visualization system was successfully demonstrated through development of a scalable design and analysis, development of key subsystems and integration of a compact working prototype system using six microprojectors and a fabricated holographic screen. The fully functional prototype demonstrated a full-color high resolution bright 3D imagery with multi-perspective collaborative 3D visualization for many users from any distances within a 30 horizontal parallax view. In Phase II, the plan is to further develop this new 3D visualization system by optimization of the design with improvements in resolution, field-of-view, 3D parallax, scaled-up size by tiling, and interface to 2D and 3D imagery sources. The prototype will be tested and evaluated for real-time collaborative 3D interactive visualization. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  This super high-resolution large-format volumetric 3D display visualization technology will be extremely useful for scientific visualization because typical 3D displays now used by scientists are two-view (left/right) stereo systems. The system can significantly improve 3D perception and aid visualization of details otherwise obscured in current 3D, significantly enhancing scientific understanding of physical processes. This display technology has huge commercial potential, with immediate applications in air traffic control, simulation and training, and in entertainment, theme parks, museums, and educational institutions.

However, current 40/100 Gb/s testing systems feature bulky footprints and extremely high cost, and therefore pose a serious impediment for the rapid deployment and maintenance of next-generation networks. We propose to address these critical concerns by developing a compact, low-cost 40/100 Gb/s testing module that leverages commercial off-the-shelf hardware and provides full integration with existing network monitoring software. This solution will allow operators to greatly-increase their testing footprints and accelerate migration to faster link rates.

In the Phase I effort we conducted a thorough analysis to determine the feasibility of the planned approach. This work consisted of three primary objectives: 1) clearly defining the system requirements; 2) producing a comprehensive architecture design with full module specifications; and 3) developing a basic working prototype. This effort also conducted detailed investigations on integrating the proposed system with existing network monitoring frameworks used in the scientific community.  In Phase II we will transition the Phase I feasibility study and preliminary hardware prototype into a complete system ready for commercialization. Here the initial baseline specification produced in Phase I will be significantly expanded with new capabilities and interfaces. Next, this framework will be integrated with higher-level monitoring systems to demonstrate comprehensive end-to-end test monitoring capabilities.  Finally we will develop and analyze various testcase scenarios to demonstrate the final product and quantify its overall performance and cost-effectiveness.  Overall, the envisioned solution will greatly benefit operators and users in the scientific and commercial communities via the provision of a compact, cost-effective 40/100 Gb/s network testing module that seamlessly interfaces with existing monitoring software.

        "abstract": "Network Intrusion Detection Is a mission critical and computationally intensive application that needs to address future 100 Gbps networks. As the speed and complexity of networks increase, the challenge of intrusions, malicious attacks, and hostile activities is also increasing. Performance of existing solutions does not keep up with the increasing network speed. Today, even at 1 Gbps, commercial products falter under certain traffic conditions, thereby exposing users to attacks. NIDS cluster performance hinges on effective frontend load balancing at full line rate under any traffic conditions. New implementations should enable scalability of cost, complexity, and performance by silicon chip integration in Phase III. The focus of Phase II is robust front end balancing at full line rate with no compromise of performance under any traffic conditions. cPacket is utilizing its unique algorithmic fabric on a chip architecture, which has already been successfully deployed at Bro clusters for 10G networks, and extends it to 100G. The performance improvement is achieved by extending the algorithmic-fabric pipeline with first order partitioning logic, streamlining low level circuit design, adding 100 Gbps network interfaces, and implementing a  complete 100 Gbps system that can be tested at full line rate and lends itself to further silicon integration and cost/power reduction in the future. cPacket collaborated with NIDS developers to create a functional requirements document. A feasibility assessment was conducted and the complete hardwaresoftware architecture and execution plan for the complete functional prototype at 100 Gbps in Phase II were developed. cPacket will deliver a working prototype performing at 100 Gbps full line rate and Deploy it in conjunction with actual Bro NIDS cluster in real 100G networks like ESnet. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The benefits include better security at high speed 100 Gbps networks, shorter down time, reduction in disruptions, and prevention of associated productivity losses. Using off-theshelf computing clusters with frontend load balancing reduces the overall cost of ownership and frees up energy, space, and resources for functionality and productivity improvements. The 100G frontend will be proliferated initially to government organizations, and will also benefit commercial organizations with similar requirements. The new balancing technology is also applicable in the longer run more broadly. I t can seed new models for load balancing cloud applications delivery in the future. The deterministic algorithmic fabric technology lends itself to a high degree of cost/performance scalability by integrated silicon chip implementations in the future, with a potential to completely change the economics and cost/performance benefits of clusters with frontend balancing.",

        "abstract": "In an increasingly hostile computing environment, Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) serve an indispensable role in preserving the integrity of computer networks. This comes to manifest as the Department of Energy (DOE) is working at a national level to secure a number of strategic network entry points using Bro, a powerful NIDS developed by the networking group at the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) in Berkeley, California. Existing NIDS such as Bro, however, have been for the most part deployed as single-node appliances protecting a specific network asset. This architecture is being driven to a breaking point by two independent realities: first, as network data-rates increase, single-node NIDS boxes are being overwhelmed by the quantity of computation they must perform to continuously secure the network; second, as attacks become ever more sophisticated, NIDS have to incorporate more complex traffic analysis heuristics that further stress the systems processing capacity. To address these trends, ICSI has extended the functionality of the Bro NIDS with a cluster architecture that allows for the logical aggregation of multiple Bro nodes. The cluster architecture provides a way to arbitrarily scale the performance of the NIDS with the exception of one element: the front-end load balancer. In a cluster solution, the load balancer is the performance bottleneck because it is the only element that must process all the traffic as an indivisible trunk. To address this system bottleneck, we propose to design and implement a high-performance energy-saving load balancer that can distribute traffic at line rates of 100 Gbps. We argue that due to the strong heavy-tailed nature of network traffic  which shows that most of the relevant information from a traffic analysis perspective resides in a small portion of the total traffic  an optimal design will tend to shift intelligence and bring Bro-awareness toward the front-end load balancer to offload traffic from the back-end nodes. We show that by doing so, energy consumption in the cluster can be reduced by a factor of 2X to 10X.  In Phase I, we built a scaled-down version of our load balancing solution at speeds up to 10 Gbps, capable of load balancing traffic and of offloading irrelevant traffic using dynamic feedback from the back-end cluster.  In Phase II, we plan to scale our current solution to support speeds of 100 Gbps and use our intelligent load balancing algorithm to offload traffic from the cluster, with the objective to reduce energy consumption by a factor of 2X to 10X. The resulting technology will have commercial applications in the field of cloud computing, where large datacenters are in need to move massive amounts of data in a secure manner. Such datacenters can be found in both government facilities such as the DOE and commercial facilities such as Internet service providers and cloud computing providers.",

        "abstract": "New high-efficiency, low-emission, fuel-flexible gas turbine designs will operate at fuel lean conditions near the flame blow-out limit. To maintain high efficiency and flame stability under these conditions, a detailed knowledge of the flame dynamics will be required from both experimental and computational studies. From a computational perspective, accurate turbulent combustion models are required to evaluate advanced turbine designs. However, current combustion models applied for design analysis lack the necessary physical modeling to accurately predict flows near the lean blow-out limit. Under this proposed effort a new and innovative modeling strategy will be developed to accurately predict flows near the lean blow-out limit. This new model will also be computationally inexpensive so that it may be applied routinely within design analysis. The objective of this program is to develop a fast running, turbulent combustion model for large eddy simulation (LES) that will be accurate for all flame regimes of gas turbine operation, including near the lean blow-out limit. This new formulation will be based on a parameterization of the linear-eddy model (LEM). The LEM is a comprehensive mixing model that accurately captures the interaction of flow turbulence with flame structure in all flame regimes. Statistics from this model will be parameterized in terms of a reduced set of variables and stored within a database that is used to produce the required closure statistics for an LES prediction. This model will be fast because the closure statistics are retrieved from a database and not computed during the simulation. The model will also be general and applicable to all flame regimes because the closure statistics will be produced from the LEM formulation. Under Phase I a unique and innovative application of the LEM was developed that directly predicts flame extinction limits that contribute to lean blow-out. With this new formulation, an efficient LES sugrid model was developed and validated for an initial gas turbine combustor experiment. Under Phase II the modeling formulation will be fully validated for a range of test cases relevant to gas turbine combustion, including lean blow-out prediction. A commercial software package will also be developed to generate user defined functions of the model for use in any commercial flow solver. Commercial Application and Other Benefits:  A software tool kit developed under this effort will produce the model statistics and database required for an LES prediction. The database for a particular problem may be used within any LES flow solver, and for steady-state flow solvers as well. Combustion models generated by the tool kit will be applicable to a wide range of military and commercial combustion applications including gas turbines, power generation systems, furnaces, incinerators, internal combustion engines, aircraft engines, etc. CRAFT Tech will market this tool kit for license to commercial customers as well as to other flow solver development companies.",

        "abstract": "Positron Emission Tomography (PET) offers high sensitivity to a range of biological processes through the use of targeted radiolabeled probes. PET imaging can provide diagnosis for symptoms of diseases such as Alzheimers disease, head trauma, cancer, and stroke. In recent years, there has been considerable interest in non-invasive plant imaging using short-lived radio tracers, such as 18F and 11C. It aids in the investigation of the coordinated behaviors of metabolic and transport processes, and how it translates into the characteristic behavior of plants. The detector is demonstrably the limiting factor in the performance and cost of the PET systems.  The goal of the proposed project is to use of continuous crystals coupled to a new photodetector technology, silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) for investigating PET modules that are suitable for plant imaging studies, dedicated organ imaging systems as well as eventually clinical imaging. The main innovation of the proposed detector design over previously investigated continuous detectors is its ability to achieve high sensitivity and high spatial resolution in a thick continuous detector. High performance and low cost are expected from the proposed detector design.  The Phase I project was aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed detector design. Detectors with large imaging area 50mm x 50mm were successfully built by constructing an 8x8 element SSPM array (with 5mm x 5mm SSPM elements). The feasibility of a PET detector that involves light spreading amongst several SSPM elements for a scintillation event based on our 8x8 SSPM array was successfully evaluated and based on the results, the feasibility of Phase I was adequately demonstrated.  The Phase II project will be aimed at design and build high performance SSPMs with high gain, excellent optical detection efficiency and low noise. Advance the PET detector design investigated in the Phase I effort (based on SSPM arrays and a continuous block of LYSO crystal) as well as design and build high resolution detector modules to create bench top PET systems for clinical and plant imaging studies and detailed performance of the system will be evaluated out in Phase II. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Over and above the use in nuclear medicine, the proposed technology will be useful in nuclear and particle physics, space research, homeland security, environmental monitoring and synchrotron studies.",

Because DOE is planning a wide distribution of this type of spectrometer in support of its observational climate science mission for its Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program, a new approach is needed to reduce the cost. The company is developing a new Holographic A-band Multi-channel substrate guided wave-based spectrometer based on unique holographic technology. This Phase II spectrometer will consist of a monolithic optical dispersing/imaging element and a linear image sensor array. The optical element will provide moderate-to-high resolution, high environmental stability, and high light throughput in a compact and cost efficient device. In Phase II, a system will be designed and optimized for the capture of A-band spectra images with highly-efficient, low-noise, low-cost holographic dispersive/imaging elements at optimized geometry, a low-noise high sensitive linear image sensor array, and electronics that include embedded software.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The proposed technology will be of immense benefit in government and commercial applications enabling low-cost miniature spectrometers with dispersing/imaging elements that are easily manufactured via an optical contact copying technique. The key benefits of the proposed holographic technology is that it will reduce significantly the overall cost of manufacturing A-band spectrometry systems, compared to bulky state-of-the-art spectrometers. This development not only advances instrumentation for atmospheric measurements in the public domain and industry, but is proven for use in solar concentrators, helmet mounted displays and eye-trackers. With the introduction of this high precision, robust, and stable device, global warming experiments can be conducted more effectively. This technology will also advance optical tomography for remote sensing of the atmosphere and near-Earth space, robot vision, and intrusion alarms.",

        "abstract": "Secondary and oxygenated organic compounds play an important role in the atmosphere.  These constituents are involved in atmospheric transformation processes, and may play a significant role in the formation of cloud condensation nuclei.  Unanswered questions include the relative importance of anthropogenic and biogenic volatile organic emissions to secondary aerosol formation, as well as their global distribution and their contribution to particle growth and hygroscopicity.  With current methods it is difficult to obtain time-resolved measurements of organic compounds at the compound level, especially those that are oxygenated.  In situ measurements of individual species are often limited by sample size and detection limits.  Proposed here is a new method relying on the physical separation of particulate constituents from most of the vapor phase based on condensationally-enhanced particle focusing and concentration. This air-to-air concentrator will enable better measurements with a variety of in-situ aerosol measurements, including the Thermal -desorption Aerosol Gas chromatograph (TAG) and  particle beam mass spectrometer systems such as the Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) and the Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM). Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Answers to these questions rely on accurately measuring the concentration  of a suite of specific organic compounds found in atmospheric aerosols.  This will be facilitated by more accurate, and less cumbersome technology for air-to-air concentration of particulate constituents of ambient aerosols.

The sulfate aerosol produced from atmospheric oxidation of SO2 has a negative radiative forcing component that is highly uncertain due to its direct and indirect effects.  Due to its potency as a remote clean atmosphere aerosol precursor and its capability to modify cloud properties, SO2 is a short lived greenhouse compound. Direct measurements of SO2 that are accurate, interference free, sensitive and rapid are needed to support particulate sulfate and aerosol instrumentation.  The Phase I demonstration of the approach will lead to a Phase II instrument that will be further improved and field tested.  The instrument is a major advancement over current commercial instrument capabilities, made possible by recent advances in technology using infrared quantum cascade lasers.  In dedicated measurement campaigns and at remote clean air monitoring stations this technology will yield a sensitive, selective measurement of this important aerosol precursor.   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The proposed instrument will provide the capability to measure atmospheric abundances of SO2 in real time in order to better asses H2SO4 production and subsequent aerosol or cloud modification.

        "abstract": "Methane is the second most important atmospheric greenhouse gas after CO2 yet its global sources and sinks are still inadequately characterized.   Monitoring the isotopic composition of atmospheric methane is one of the most promising approaches to closing the methane budget.   Detailed process studies of isotopic fractionation associated with methane sinks and sources are also crucial. For both purposes, a real time instrument that can measure multiple isotopologues of methane is required.  There are no existing field deployable instruments for the sensitive, real time measurement of CH3D.  There are also no instruments available with sufficient precision to monitor ambient atmospheric 13CH4 (excluding the Aerodyne Research, Inc. predecessor to the proposed instrument). Hence, there is a need for sensitive, measurements of both isotopologues  ideally within one instrument. Recent advances in quantum cascade laser technology allow continuous wave operation near room temperature without cryogenic cooling.  We propose to couple these new lasers with advanced infrared detectors and new optical designs (for longer absorption path length in a compact instrument).  The resulting instrument will simultaneously measure the isotopic ratios of CH3D and 13CH4 with excellent precision  6 per mil and 0.3 per mil, respectively, for samples with methane mixing ratios near the ambient value of 1.8 ppm.  For process studies with elevated methane mixing ratios (such as chamber studies of peat bog emissions), the precision of the isotopic ratios will be even better (by perhaps a factor of five). The resulting instrument will be compact, portable and autonomous and will be sufficiently sensitive to deploy to remote field sites or even from light aircraft to assess sources and sinks of methane throughout the world.  Our Phase I results demonstrated the feasibility of the Phase II project with quantitative detection of CH3D and showed that the selected spectral region is free from interference.  We also developed a preliminary design for the Phase II instrument and studied other isotopic variants of methane. We will complete the detailed design and construction of the prototype instrument during year one.  In the second year, we will demonstrate the utility of the instrument in laboratory studies at MIT with pre-concentrated methane samples and with ambient samples in field studies of gas emissions from the Marcellus shale with the Wofsy group at Harvard. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  This instrument is eagerly anticipated by leading climate change researchers around the world since it will provide scientifically meaningful isotopic ratio measurements in real time, without pre-concentration and without cryogenic cooling of either laser or detector.  Other applications of this technology include air pollution monitoring, human breath analysis, geochemical prospecting, and industrial process monitoring.  This technology will provide a significant societal benefit though improved understanding and mitigation of global warming and global climate change.",

It will be developed to valuable prototype form and used to make observations of the atmosphere that are validated by proven high precision detection systems deployed on fixed wing aircraft. The photo-pneumatic analyzer was developed for Phase I, and the major technological hurdles were identified and addressed.

Parallel programs of laboratory experimentation and field observations are planned. Certain critical elements of the analyzer technology will be optimized in the laboratory aided by computer simulations of the electro-optical performance. Replicas of the CO2 Radiosonde will be deployed on the small latex balloon and in research pods of aircraft (manned, unmanned) as the means to validate performance against proven high precision analyzer systems. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The CO2 Radiosonde can be deployed in conjunction with the standard meteorological Radiosonde to launch the Radiosonde Utility of North America.

The sources and sinks of these gases and the interactions between the troposphere and stratosphere are needed to understand global warming and help devise strategies to minimize its effects.  In situ measurements of greenhouse gases have been restricted to airplane or large balloon-gondola platforms, due to the size, weight, and power requirements of current instrumentation. We propose to overcome this limitation with a fully self-calibrating, low mass greenhouse gas sensor suitable for more frequent, widespread measurement campaigns using smaller, inexpensive balloon sondes. A lightweight, inexpensive, stand-alone methane sensor suitable for balloon sonde measurements will be developed. This sensor uses a novel self-calibration method to achieve the high precision of the much larger and expensive instruments used on current airborne platforms, but will operate on a small meteorological balloon. The Phase II result of this program will be a sensor capable of measuring methane with high precision using small, inexpensive balloon sondes without the need for highly trained personnel. All of the research objectives for Phase I were successfully met. The most critical issues were determining the most effective laser delivery mode and to compare two detection methods for optimum precision, accuracy and ease of use in a balloon environment. Based on these key factors, a detailed preliminary design, including expected performance specifications, was developed. In Phase II a prototype sensor will be constructed, tested and flown using meteorological balloons. This instrument will operate autonomously and be self-calibrating. Analysis methods will be developed, tested, and refined. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  In addition to research instruments for atmospheric measurements, low cost, portable gas sensors have applications in such areas as environmental monitoring, gas leak sensing of pipelines, fire detectors for commercial and military aircraft, and process control sensors for energy and chemical production industries.",

Each of these permits will result in fracture operations needing 150,000 -1 million barrels of water. Frost and Sullivan, the market analysis firm estimates approximately 120 million bbl of water will have to be used in fracturing operations annually through 2025 to fully exploit the available and desired natural gas.  A reasonable estimate is that 30% of this water, 40 million bbl, will return to the surface as flow back water. Flow back water contains a significant amounts of dissolved solids, chemical additives, and in late stages, hydrocarbons from the formation.  ABSMaterials is developing water treatment system that removes organic contaminants from flow back water for recycling or reuse. The system can be used alone or to create treated feed water for membrane systems that can remove dissolved solids. The technology is based on Osorb, a patented swellable nano-engineered material with the ability to capture up to 8 times its weight in organics via reversible swelling. In Phase I of the project, a skid-mounted 4 gpm and trailer-mounted 60 gpm fluidized bed system were fabricated and tested with major oil service companies on the ABSMaterials campus. Results showed that &amp; gt;95% organics were removed including hydrocarbons and surfactants.  In addition, we began work to expand the use of Osorb to capture of metal ions from flow back water.

        "abstract": "Co-feeding biomass with coal in a gasification-based synthetic fuels plant has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions by 50% or more.  Unfortunately, the catalysts currently used to convert the syngas from the coal-biomass gasifier are poisoned by compounds that originate in the biomass and coal. Thus, the development of poison-resistant catalysts will advance coal-biomass-to-liquids (CBTL) technology or carbon free integrated gasification combined cycle. The water gas shift (WGS) reaction that converts the CO in syngas to hydrogen is an important step in all synthetic fuels processes.  Hydrogen sulfide (from coal or heavy hydrocarbons) poisons conventional WGS catalysts, thus sulfur tolerant WGS catalysts are widely used. Unfortunately, they must be run at higher temperatures than conventional WGS catalysts and consequently convert less CO to hydrogen (because of equilibrium limitations). TDA Research Inc. (TDA) has developed a new sour WGS catalyst that is as active as conventional low temperature water-gas-shift catalysts and which is not poisoned by sulfur and other contaminants present in syngas produced during the gasification of coal and biomass. Our catalyst converts more CO to hydrogen, improves the energy efficiency and economics of CBTL and integrated gasification combined cycles (IGCC plants).  It can be used as a drop-in replacement for existing catalysts. In Phase II, we will optimize the catalyst formulation, scale up catalyst synthesis and perform extensive lifetime activity testing with a wide variety of contaminants present in syngas derived from the co-gasification of coal and biomass. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Sulfur-tolerant water gas shift catalysts are not only useful for converting coal and biomass to liquid fuels, but are routinely used in gasification or partial oxidation processes that run on coal, coke, bitumen and other heavy hydrocarbon feedstocks.  Therefore in addition to synfuels production, they will also find applications in petroleum refineries, methanol and ammonia plants, and stationary power production.",

A major contributor to the poor performance has been fouling of the syngas cooler located downstream of the gasifier.

At present the understanding of the fouling mechanism for coal gasification is not adequately understood for equipment vendors to develop a solution. In this project we will develop a soot blowing technology tailored to the coal gasification conditions that exist in the convective syngas cooler used at coal gasification plants. The new soot blower design will be based on an improved understanding of the relevant governing mechanisms for fouling developed in this project.  The new soot blower technology will be designed to have the option to be combined with anti-fouling coatings that could be applied to heat exchanger surfaces in the syngas cooler. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The target application for the soot blower technology developed in this project is coal gasification plants producing syngas for use in power generation, refinery and chemical production applications.

        "abstract": "Coal fired power plants are a leading producer of carbon dioxide emissions.  To reduce the potential of global warming, carbon dioxide can be captured at the exhaust of coal fired power plants for capture and sequestration. The technology to capture carbon dioxide at the emissions source must be able to be implemented both economically and on a very large scale. Currently, the leading technology to capture carbon dioxide at coal fired power plants is through the temperature swing adsorption process by using aqueous amines.  Carbon dioxide adsorbs readily onto amines, and is desorbed for capture upon heating.  The heat capacity of the current aqueous based solutions is too high because the solutions are 70% water.  The energy to heat and cool the water as the solvent is circulating is energy intensive, and imparts a high cost on the production of electricity. Solid sorbents have been identified as a material solution to improve the economics of CO2 capture by lowering the energy regeneration of the capture material. In Phase I, Aspen Aerogels developed a novel solid sorbent technology that has a much lower equivalent heat capacity than aqueous amines.  The long-term cycle life of the new sorbent is also highly promising.  Having a lower recirculating heat capacity and thus a lower energy for regeneration, this sorbent improves the economics of the carbon dioxide temperature swing process.  In Phase II, Aspen Aerogels will improve the total working capacity of the sorbent and characterize its performance in exposure to sulfur and nitrogen gases over long cyclic testing to verify robustness and longevity to coal based combustion products. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Success of manufacturing high efficiency novel sorbent based superhydrophobic aerogel material for CO2 will be of great benefit to retrofit the existing fleet of coal-fired power plants for carbon capture and sequestration and meet challenges of CO2 legislation targets.

        "abstract": "The storage of industrially generated carbon dioxide in deep geologic formations is being seriously evaluated as a method for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere. Reliable and cost-effective monitoring is required to demonstrate that geologic storage is safe and effective for controlling carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon dioxide leaking from a deep storage reservoir is likely to intercept groundwater resources. Two characteristics differentiate water monitoring from other monitoring techniques: subsurface water forms an integrating horizon that covers a large area above the gas reservoir, and the direct monitoring of water protects our most important natural resource. However, current methods for groundwater monitoring, based on sampling followed by laboratory analysis, are far too costly and labor-intensive for the long-term monitoring of large areas. This effort will result in the development of the world &amp; apos;s first truly distributed dissolved carbon dioxide sensors, and will help to overcome current limitations. The sensors, which will be based on optical fibers manufactured so that their entire lengths are coated with doped polymers, will allow the spatially averaged or position-resolved detection of carbon dioxide during and after geological sequestration. This stand-alone system will monitor continuously for leaks, but more importantly, will quantify the amount of the carbon dioxide leaked into aquifers, key information required to begin remediation. Work in Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of preparing distributed fiber carbon dioxide optic sensors by coating segments of optical fibers with novel solid-phase sensitive materials, and interrogating the fluorescent coating through the evanescent wave field. The prototype sensors were evaluated for their analytical features, showing excellent features for the long-term monitoring of carbon dioxide in carbon sequestration. The overall objective is to build a fiber optic sensor system for fully-distributed carbon dioxide monitoring, and validate its performance in field tests at carbon sequestration pilot sites. Carbon-dioxidesensitive fibers will be fabricated using commercial manufacturing techniques. Sensor cables will be assembled, and a read-out unit will be developed. The system will be fully characterized in the laboratory under simulated underground conditions, and the results will be compared with field test data. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Carbon capture and sequestration may ultimately contribute to up to 20 percent of carbon dioxide-emission reductions over the coming century. Worldwide, annual carbon dioxide emissions from human activity are accounted to be more than 33 billion tons. Over 60 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions come from sources that are potentially amenable to carbon dioxide capture. Estimated costs for monitoring geologic storage over the full life-cycle of a project range up to $0.10 per ton of carbon dioxide, which provides a vision of the important market opportunity for monitoring techniques.",

        "abstract": "5,790 million metric tons of CO2 were emitted from fossil fuels in the U.S. in 2008. A beneficial, practical application of captured CO2 would bring significant economic and environmental benefits to CO2 generating industries. Meanwhile, biodiesel production yields around 10 weight % of byproduct glycerol. 230,000 tons of crude glycerol were produced in 2008, and 986,000 tons of glycerol are expected in 2018. With the rapid increases in crude glycerol generation from biodiesel plants, glycerol has become a waste stream and a financial and environmental liability to the biodiesel producers. To advance the production of biodiesel and realize the biodiesel economy, advanced development and commercialization of innovative technologies for the conversion of crude glycerol into value-added products is imperative. This proposed project concerns a novel and beneficial CO2 and crude glycerol application technology. In the presence of a low cost and highly active catalyst, greenhouse gas CO2 reacts with crude glycerol, a biodiesel plant waste, to produce a bio-based high value renewable industrial product  glycerol carbonate. In Phase I, glycerol carbonate was successfully prepared from CO2 and glycerol under different reaction conditions and using different raw material sources, and the optimal operating conditions were determined. The technical feasibility of this technology has been successfully established. An economic analysis was conducted and demonstrated the economic viability of this technology. The overall objectives of Phase II are to bring this proven and viable CO2 based glycerol carbonate production technology from a laboratory scale to a pilot scale process, produce glycerol carbonate using crude glycerol from different biodiesel plants, and evaluate coal-fired power plant flue gas as a CO2 source for glycerol carbonate production. The success of this project will bring a one-step, environmentally friendly, cost-effective, energy-efficient, and easy to operate CO2 based renewable glycerol carbonate production technology into commercialization. This technology can be easily scaled up and will have substantial environmental, economic, and energy benefits. An efficient transformation of CO2 and crude glycerol into a high value chemical is of significant importance for resource utilization and pollution prevention. It will offset the biodiesel production cost and CO2 capture cost and play an important role in the advancement of the integrated biorefinery concept for biofuel and renewable chemical production concurrent with CO2 emissions reduction, leading to substantial cost savings and environmental benefits. The success of this technology will have significant implications for biodiesel plants, industrial sectors with CO2 emissions, and glycerol carbonate producers and users.",

        "abstract": "The overall goal of this Phase II project is to develop a prototype of a thermochemical reactor for the production of syngas (a blend of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) using water and carbon dioxide as the reactants.  New materials will also be screened for their ability to reduce the reactor temperature.  Syngas is a particularly attractive fuel since it can be used to synthesize liquid fuels and chemicals such as methanol and ammonia.  Today, most syngas is made by reforming methane and gasifying coal; however, these processes require nonrenewable energy and materials, and contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  The proposed technology derives the heat needed for the thermochemical process from solar energy. In Phase I, a detailed thermal model was developed and used to guide the design of a thermochemical reactor prototype. The feasibility of the technology was successfully demonstrated; CO and H2 were measured in bench-scale experiments. New materials were also assessed for use in the reactor and a promising material was identified, yet new materials will continue to be screened.  A multi-reactor prototype will be developed in Phase II that will enable continuous production of syngas.  Industry partners will help assess the economics for a scaled-up pilot scale plant and support commercialization of the technology. In Phase I, the feasibility of the concept was successfully demonstrated.  A thermal model of the entire cycle was developed and a laboratory-scale, high-temperature, thermochemical reactor was designed, fabricated, and tested.  The dissociation of CO2 into CO and O2 and the production of H2 production from water were demonstrated.  New materials were screened for use in the reactor and a promising candidate material with a slightly different composition from that used in Phase I was identified.  The technology was discussed with several commercial partners that will support commercialization of the technology in Phase II. In Phase II, the thermal model will be expanded to include chemical kinetics and more detailed radiation heat transfer.  The model will be used to optimize the design of a multi-reactor prototype to achieve nearly continuous production of syngas.  The fuel productivity will be measured in the multi-reactor system and results compared to target metrics.  New material compositions will be evaluated for potential use in the thermochemical reactor.  In parallel, ACT will work with our industry partners to commercialize the technology. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The proposed technology is a non-fossil fuel based approach to generate fuels from CO2 and H2O. The CO2 may be sequestered from coal and fossil fuel power plants. In this approach, the carbon that was initially stored in the fossil fuel is re-used.  By &amp; apos;re-using &amp; apos; the carbon in the fuel, the demand for petroleum can be reduced and our dependence on foreign oil limited. Syngas is also used to make liquid fuels, alcohols and other chemicals that can be reformed to make commercial products, e.g., plastics.  High-temperature fuel cells also operate on syngas.",

        "abstract": "Although means currently exist to capture CO2 from combustion and other sources, capture at atmospheric levels is difficult. Once captured, CO2 needs to be released in concentrated form and sequestered: e.g., it can be buried under ocean water or in underground vaults, or it can be reacted with basic metal oxides to form metal carbonates. It may also be reduced to methane (another greenhouse gas), which requires compression and cryogenic liquefaction. Thus, the opportunity and need exists for development of new approaches for capturing, sequestering, and utilizing atmospheric CO2.  The Phase I approach addressed development of an integrated system for the concomitant capture of CO2 from air and conversion to more valuable product. The system utilizes a new nanostructured adsorbent material which possesses base sites and is electrochemical regenerated, resulting in conversion of captured atmospheric CO2 and water to more valuable products. The adsorbent is integrated with the cathode of an electrochemical cell to concomitantly capture and reduce (electrochemically strip) CO2 while the anode incorporates a hydrogen oxidation electrocatalyst. Reaction of captured CO2 and H2 produced by a separate electrolyzer produces a precursor chemical. Identification of preferred adsorbent, demonstration of core unit operations, and preliminary design of the overall process and system were key Phase I objectives that were met. CO2 adsorbents and integrated cathodes will optimized and a prototype system fabricated and the overall process demonstrated during Phase II. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  There is broad interest in CO2 capture and re-use technologies in anticipation of more regulation. Eltron has received commercial interest in this particular technology by wind power developers seeking to make use of electricity produced off-peak or in excess of local demand..

There currently exists no method to characterize the mechanical properties of advanced refractory materials used in emerging Gen-IV reactors. Lambda Instruments, Inc. is developing extremely high-temperature, radiation-hardened fiber optic strain sensors based on our unique sapphire waveguide technology. Sapphire is an inherently high-temperature material and has been shown to retain excellent transmission properties in moderate radiation and extreme high-temperature environments. All of the primary objectives of the Phase I were achieved with great success. Sapphire fibers were shown to survive in both high temperature (1600C) and moderate radiation (3.3x1017n/cm2, &amp; gt;1MeV) environments. Strain sensor fabrication methods for high-temperature operation were designed and implemented. These initial fabrication methods demonstrated success at high temperatures up to 1600C. Additional fabrication methods for improved sensor ruggedization and survivability were also conceived and will be implemented during the Phase II project. The primary objectives for Phase II include: 1) Improving strain sensor ruggedization, 2) Design and build optimized readout system, 3) Demonstrate extended survivability in high-temperature and high-radiation environments, 4) Demonstrate operation in high-radiation environment, and 5) Develop commercialization and transition to manufacturing strategy. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The primary commercial applications include emerging Gen-IV VHTR plants. The primary public benefit will be improving the safety and performance of emerging high temperature gas-cooled reactors. With growing international competition in nuclear power, the U.S. is at risk of losing our preeminent position in new reactor development. The development and international acceptance of these advanced reactors could result in a significant export for the U.S..

The membrane should possess the following properties to ensure high energy efficiency and long cycle life of RFBs: high proton conductivity, low permeability of active redox species, and high chemical stability.  In addition, low cost and high durability are also necessary requirements of the membrane before broad market penetration of RFBs can be achieved.  At present, commercial membranes cannot satisfy all of the above requirements. This SBIR project aims to develop low-cost, high performance hybrid PEMs for RFBs by an intricate hybrid scheme in a polymer-polymer-inorganic system.  Such membranes shall have high chemical stability in RFB electrolytes, high proton conductivity, low permeability of vanadium ions, along with high dimensional stability, high mechanical strength and durability, and lower cost than Nafion membranes. The Phase I results has successfully demonstrated that the intended membrane can be developed, which has shown the potential of not only lower cost than the Nafion membrane, but also superior properties than the Nafion membranes in several aspects, including higher proton conductivity and lower permeability of active redox species, while having equally high chemical stability in the RFB environment The Phase II work is to build on the Phase I success and systematically optimize the composition, processing, and performance of the new membrane for RFB applications.  The processing will be scaled up to a level that is feasible and profitable for commercial production.  Commercially viable prototype membranes will be produced and tested in practical RFB settings. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Redox flow battery (RFB) is one of potential technologies for stationary electrical energy storage.  The feature of decoupling between the energy and power, and the extremely large capacities possible from RFBs make them well suited to use in large power storage and high output applications such as for transmission grid operations, in helping to average out the production of highly variable generation sources such as wind or solar power.

A critical component of the RFB is the membrane which separates anode and cathode compartments. Currently, this is primarily Nafion, but Nafion is not only too expensive, but also lacks in selectivity, permitting leakage between anode and cathode electrolyte compartments. EIC Laboratories proposes the development of a new composite membrane for RFB applications. The membranes will be based on inexpensive feedstocks providing an economical alternative to Nafion and other perfluorinated copolymers, with additional improved selectivity properties. Furthermore, the membrane is to be solvent castable, providing an economical pathway for large scale production.

The new separator is shown to be stronger than Nafion with similar conductivity and stability, yet with much reduced self-discharge and meeting the proposed cost objectives for large scale manufacture. The Phase II program will assess the tradeoff and optimization of membrane properties, including selectivity and conductivity as a function of polymer structure variation, mechanical strength, and long term chemical stability in the VRB cell environment.

Redox flow batteries also provide a means to store intermittent renewable energy from solar and wind sources.  However important technical developments are needed if redox flow batteries are to fulfill their commercial potential.  Most redox flow batteries require the use of ion exchange membranes, typically in the form of perfluorinated acid polymer membranes.

Achieving a fundamental understanding of materials nucleation and growth phenomena at the nanoscale is critical for nanotechnology and necessitates an experimental environment in which the important atomistic processes can be studied as they are occurring. The proposed innovation is based on a revolutionary, yet practical method for simultaneous nanoscale imaging of nanofabrication processes by integrating tip-based pulsed laser radiation sources within a transmission electron microscope. Nanoscale confinement of radiation fields of enhanced intensity underneath a tip-based probe enables a wide range of materials modification processes that open up an entirely new avenue for the definition and processing of nanostructures, while at the same time allowing for direct in-situ observation of the fundamental processes.  During our Phase I project, we demonstrated delivery of a laser beam in optical near-field to a sample inside a transmission electron microscope for an in-situ imaging of a material undergoing nano-scale melting and recrystallization. This new capability remarkably enabled observation of the conversion of amorphous nanodomain precursors to single nanocrystals. The prototype in-situ probe holder developed during the Phase I project combines (a) photonic (laser) excitation in nanoscale, (b) in-situ transmission electron microscope imaging, and (c) simultaneous optical spectroscopic characterization of material properties. In this Phase II project, we will develop this prototype into a viable commercial product, a modular attachment kit to standard electron microscope instruments, to provide researchers in all aspects of science and technology with a powerful research tool to push the frontiers of science. This will be accomplished with systematic experiments to determine the optimal optical probe and detector configurations and the design and assembly of a prototype. Furthermore, the prototype will be tested in the real scientific studies of in-situ characterization of nanowire growth and the synthesis of nanostructures.        The proposed product will enable a widespread adoption of unique facility for the in-situ nanoscale observation of laser material modification and nanomaterials growth processes. This entirely new capability will have a profound impact to the fields of materials science, nanofabrication, and the adoption of nanotechnology into marketplace.",

        "abstract": "The primary experimental method used to determine the local internal structure of materials is that of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). If one also subjects the sample to an excursion in temperature during imaging at high resolution, one can watch the material processes involved in structural transformations. This allows direct and dynamic determination of the effects of materials processing on structure, and thus can provide critical insights to designing new materials with improved properties and performance. This approach not only permits deeper understanding of the basic physical processes involved, but also allows rapid exploration of a matrix of conditions and effects. However, current TEM heating holder designs that can accommodate a wide variety of specimens relies on substantially out-dated technologies, yielding significant problems with respect to drift / stability issues, expensive and time consuming maintenance and lack of precise and simple temperature control. Our motivation with this SBIR funded project is to develop a dramatically improved heating holder that is capable of delivering high-temperatures (1000C) to a sample, which is robust and as its most important feature has virtually no sample drift when the temperature of the sample is changed. In Phase I we build a prototype as proof of concept of the low drift mechanism. In Phase II we will optimize this prototype into a commercial product and make a double tilt version of the holder suited for all types of TEMs. This ultra-low drift TEM heating holder is expected to greatly aid researchers in exploiting hot-stage TEM, particularly during experiments that require imaging while increasing the temperature of the specimen, and are expected to lead to scientific advancements across multiple areas of research relevant to the DOE BES mission.",

        "abstract": "The Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) is a third-generation, high-brightness, 7 GeV storage-ring-based x-ray light source. At present, Argonne is pursuing an APS upgrade project known as the APS Renewal, aiming at improvements through upgrades of beamline optics, detectors, and end-station equipment. Intensive computation is a pivotal aspect of this accelerator modeling and optimization eort, and signicant acceleration of already-existing computational tools used for this work will allow to explore a wider range of parameters and produce optimal designs in less time and at lower cost. Particle accelerator code ELEGANT has been used extensively for the APS upgrade work, as well as for numerous other light source design and optimization projects in the U.S. and abroad. We propose to develop an optimized, benchmarked set of CUDA kernels and drivers for GPU-accelerated simulation of beam dynamics with ELEGANT. We expect that this will translate into more than an order of magnitude speedup of the most time consuming simulations. We will closely collaborate with the ELEGANT code developers to ensure the optimal usage of the new capabilities. We prototyped a single-particle-dynamics kernel (quadrupole) and a collective-eects kernel (drift with longitudinal space charge), achieving a speedup of 80x and 36x respectively over a CPU implementation, and incorporated the GPU-accelerated algorithms into ELEGANT. We will develop and integrate into ELEGANT a comprehensive set of GPU-enabled algorithms; enable, automate, and optimize parallel computation on multiple GPUs; deliver enhancements to the ELEGANT software engineering and quality assurance process; and provide simulation support to the APS Renewal design optimization eort. Commercial Applications and Other Benets:  Successful completion of this project will add to the functionality and value of the companys GPULib commercial library. In addition, the proposed GPU-accelerated beam dynamics modeling tools have the potential to be a signicant time and cost saver for both DOE-funded research institutions and the researchers in the Navy megawatt-class FEL program.",

The present state of the art is a solenoid focused 5 kW CW with less than 50% efficiency rendering the overall efficiencies of the klystron + solenoid to less than 40% efficiency and, in addition, requiring the purchase of 16 separate DC power supplies. Calabazas Creek Research Inc. (CCR) is proposing to develop a 10 kW 2.815 GHz CW klystron that incorporates a unique time proven Periodic Permanent Magnet (PPM) focusing structure in lieu of the solenoid focusing. The final design has obtained an electronic and overall efficiency &amp; gt;60% and eliminated the need for an expensive focusing solenoid-DC power supply combinations and substantial water cooling. Incorporation of this CW PPM focused klystron will increase the efficiency of the upgrade to the APS. All of the Phase I goals were met.  A design was produced for an S-band PPM focused klystron with an output power of 13 kW at a beam voltage of 20 kV and a beam current of 1.0 A. ANL has provided a table of specifications for the required CW klystron. CCR has met all specifications and has exceeded the efficiency by 10%.  Designs were realized for all of the critical components, including the electron gun, RF circuit, PPM structure, and RF input and output windows. In Phase II, because in Phase I we designed, simulated and analyzed a 100 kW CW klystron (initial specifications) and then repeated this effort for the 10 kW klystron, we will revisit our simulations of the RF interaction circuit and PPM structure toward optimizing efficiency and bandwidth. We will perform a detailed mechanical design, then fabricate, bake out and high power test this CW PPM klystron. We have budgeted for a rebuild and high power testing. In addition, we will ship the final klystron to ANL for high power testing with CCR participation. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  This S-band CW PPM focused klystron simple geometry minimizes fabrication and power supply costs over other CW beam devices.  Klystrons are used in many accelerators for research and medical applications, and for radar and communications in industry and national defense applications. In all of these applications, the S-band klystron is expected to offer a significant cost advantage.",

        "abstract": "The multipactor effect is a major challenge that is encountered in a number of areas involving high-power radio frequency or microwave systems.  Particle accelerator systems associated with high energy physics research are limited by radio frequency window breakdown largely due to multipaction. The multipactor effect is highly dependent on the secondary electron coefficient of the window, which is highly surface sensitive.  In this effort, recent developments in coating technologies are leveraged to integrate coating materials with extremely low secondary electron emission rates, allowing systems to perform at higher power with increased dependability. The Phase I research focused on two areas. First, exploring challenges associated with integration of the coating material with suitable radio frequency window bulk ceramics (e.g., Al2O3), and second, demonstrating that the coating material does in fact suppress secondary electron yield even at nanoscale thicknesses.  For the former, coating recipes were developed during the Phase I that will be of value during follow-on efforts. For the latter, the Phase I successfully demonstrated an extreme degree of secondary electron yield suppression after application of nanometer-scale coatings. The goals of the planned Phase II are to make direct measurements comparing the coating performance against competing options, such as Titanium Nitride (TiN), to produce a prototype coated window and to test the prototype window at high power. A significant portion of global research in physics is based on data produced at the few major particle accelerator laboratories located around the world.  These key facilities would see major benefits in terms of producing higher accelerator energies, decreasing the number of klystrons required for energy input, or reducing bottom line project costs, each of which results in the availability of more and better data for analysis by the many interested research institutions.  Beyond that, the particle accelerator industry includes a wide range of medical, research, and security applications that would benefit from improved window performance and reliability.",

        "abstract": "Some DOE modulators have been under development for a decade, but do not yet meet the specifications for voltage, droop, or pulse width.  A fundamental design limitation is that the inverters switch the full current 30 times during each pulse, requiring large and expensive switching transistors.  A new architecture was invented, consisting of an SCR-controlled power supply, a solid-state modulator, and a small droop corrector. The droop corrector effectively gives the capacitor in the modulator an infinite capacitance.  The system will meet the droop specifications, is inherently reliable, and will cost only $1.1 M instead of the present $1.7 M. This is because (1) the modulator switches only once per pulse, (2) the droop corrector switches only 5% of the power at high frequency, (3) The SCR-controlled supply is inexpensive, and (4) there is no output pulse transformer.  The droop corrector is the new element for this SBIR.  In Phase I the maximum voltage and device temperature for the corrector was verified, and the switching control scheme was developed.  In Phase II the droop compensation supply and the modulator will be designed and built. The testing will be done with a low-power supply. This hardware will be delivered to a suitable laboratory for testing and evaluation. The cost data will be collected as the system is built, and accurately estimate the future production costs.

        "abstract": "The effectiveness of synchrotron radiation science is being hindered by the limited availability of advanced detectors. The capability to produce photon fluxes has outpaced the ability to detect and measure the resultant photons. This is due to the limited deployment of existing detectors as well as very limited development effort to provide new advanced capabilities. As synchrotron radiation experiments become more sophisticated, advanced detectors exhibiting high count rates, high energy resolutions, and high spatial resolutions over large areas will be necessary to leverage the capabilities of the beamlines and enable discovery. A novel one-dimensional microstrip detector prototyped by Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) has proven to be highly effective at acquiring data with the count rates, energy resolution and spatial resolution needed for complex x-ray diffraction studies. The objective of this SBIR is to take the current hand build, uncalibrated, and user unfriendly detector to a commercial sealed, robust and reliable instrument building upon the foundation of the current device. In addition, several advanced features will be implemented that will improve the utility of the detector and reduce the total cost of ownership. Phase I initiated the technology transfer from BNL and resulted in a design that will eliminate an external chiller and vacuum pump, will achieve the desired operating temperature and will not suffer from ice formation. The new commercial design also incorporates several feature improvements such as faster readout, mounting points to ease integration, and an internal deadtime calibration capability. Phase II will build a quantity of detectors incorporating the advancements studied during Phase I. This will qualify Sydors manufacturing capability and enable end-user evaluations to validate performance specifications. Several beamline scientists from two synchrotron facilities will participate in Phase II beta testing to evaluate the new prototypes in target market applications. In parallel, Sydor will qualify commercial suppliers that will be used in a pre-production prototype constructed at the conclusion of the Phase II program. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The commercial deployment of the of this x-ray microstrip detector will enable researchers to advance their discovery in the very near term by providing an instrument that significantly speeds up the data gathering process as compared to present techniques. By acquiring data simultaneously at many points, the quality and quantity of data will be improved 100-fold from the current state of the art equipment. These detectors as well as future large array detectors built upon this framework will benefit a wide range of applications ranging from structure-based drug design to environmental remediation of contamination sites to new discoveries in nanoscale material science.",

Detectors are not yet available for the fastest bunch modes, and at the fastest operating modes, collection of multiple bunches is required, laser energy is insufficient at the pulse rates used, and during the longer experiments used to accommodate detector deficits, samples change e.g. through heating. These factors limit the science potential of experiments. A radiationtolerant dualcounting ROIC has been designed especially for the needs of pulse/probe experiments at thirdgeneration synchrotrons. The userenabled and userprogrammable DUPREA ROIC prototype includes in each pixel highbandwidth, lownoise amplification, duallevel pulse discrimination, and dual 15bit counters, allowing twocolor Xray/laser measurements. The counters support integratewhileread operation, minimizing dead time and addressing 11.4 ns and 153 ns bunch rates at the APS. The technology is being optimized to support both silicon and germanium arrays. All the Phase I program objectives were met. A smallformat DUPREA prototype was developed and all its functions were successfully demonstrated, providing proof of concept. Characterization was carried out using test camera electronics and control/UI software developed in Phase I, and the three operating modes were demonstrated at 135 MHz frame rates. Count rate, dynamic range, and linearity were characterized; at the fastest rates, the noise was demonstrated to be 25 electrons RMS. Both silicon and germanium detector arrays were evaluated, and pixelated arrays were hybridized to the prototype. A novel Ge array was completed and characterized, with passivation optimized for low surface leakage. The DUPREA prototype will be enhanced to support a variety of photodetector arrays, and its format increased to 128  128. Pixel preamplifiers will be modified with programmable modes to accommodate various detector arrays. Ge and Si detector arrays will be optimized, prototype detector electronics and mechanics will be reconfigured to meet the user communitys needs, and a cryogenic option will be made available. When the enhanced DUPREA2 camera is available in Phase II, it will be tested at APS. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  While the Xray detector under development is tailored to the highly specific needs for APS, it has also been developed to be adaptable for other HEP uses as well as a broader range of commercial markets for laboratory instrumentation in industry and academia.

Directdetection (photoconductive) materials are theoretically favored over indirect (scintillator) materials, but have yet to achieve high Xray absorption, ionization and charge collection. Present photoconductive materials are also not highly suitable for manufacturing, including e.g. uniform largearea deposition. A directdetection nanocrystal (NC)based pixelated array detector technology is being developed, taking advantage of semiconductor NCs abilities for Xray absorption and charge transport. The NCs can convert Xray photons to charge carriers, and when NC films are implemented with pixelated TFT or CMOS readout circuits, the resulting detectors allow the formation of versatile digital signals. In this way, a variety of custom Xraysensitive materials can be synthesized from chemical precursors and cast from solution onto a common electronic readout circuit design, including largearea designs. Lead iodide NCs were synthesized and optimized using various ligand coatings. The NCs morphology and optoelectronic properties were characterized as a function of synthesis conditions. NC films were coated onto simple detector structures and characterized; photoconductive and photovoltaic detectors were both demonstrated. The films showed very good responsivity and detective efficiencies, as well as linear Xray response under biases up to 50 VDC. Temporal response and stability were also studied. To support manufacturability of PbI2 NC films, the NC synthesis will be developed and scaled using an automated continuousflow microreactor, making available larger volumes of NCs having known size, shape, phase, and purity. Ligandswapping processes will be further developed to support NC deposition, as well as the methods of depositing the films on existing TFT and CMOS pixelated readout circuits. Working largearea Xray detectors will be fabricated, demonstrated, and characterized. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The technology supports the fabrication of largearea detectors with high pixel counts, instant digitization, realtime feedback, elimination of toxic film processing, and reduced recurring costs. When realized, these benefits will broadly address needs in various fields such as materials research, archaeology, biology, medicine, and nondestructive testing.

        "abstract": "With the depletion of fossil fuel reserves, hydrogen-based energy is becoming increasingly significant. Production, purification and compression of hydrogen represent key technical challenges.  Hydrogen is most commonly produced from steam methane reformers, by gasification or as a refining or chemical system off-gas.  All of these production systems require purification and compression steps and current systems often use substantial energy to operate and are costly. Hydrogen is also produced by FuelCell Energys (FCEs) commercially available high temperature Direct FuelCell (DFC) power plants.   FuelCell Energy, Inc. (FCE) proposes to address process intensification by developing a Thermally Integrated Solid State Hydrogen Separator and Compressor (EHSC) based on High Temperature Membrane technology (150-250C), which will efficiently and cost effectively combine the shift, purification and compression steps of hydrogen production into one device. In Phase I of this SBIR program we successfully demonstrated a baseline, lower cost solid-state hydrogen compressor cell capable of separating hydrogen from reformate streams containing up to 5,000 ppm CO and compressing it from atmospheric pressure to &amp; gt;50 psig.  We also demonstrated successful thermal integration of the water gas shift reactor with heat recovery efficiency of 80-85%. In Phase II, we anticipate extending this effort to scaling up the EHSC by increasing both the cell area and number of cells in the stack, increase of the pressure capability to 300 psi, scale-up of the shift reactor by up to two orders of magnitude, and evaluating it using actual reformate slip streams to demonstrate a production unit energy efficiency &amp; gt;70%. The hydrogen market is huge, currently about 10 million tons/year in the US alone and a multi-billion dollar business.  Most of the hydrogen is used by industrial markets, such as refineries, ammonia production, chemical plants etc., either used on-site or shipped via pipeline. FCE is developing the Thermally Integrated EHSC for these markets, as well as for distributed hydrogen and electricity co-generation using FCEs current DFC and future Solid Oxide Fuel Cell products.",

        "abstract": "Natural gas is a vital domestic natural resource whose recoverable reserves have been growing rapidly in recent years. As a result, natural gas costs have diverged from oil, making American chemical manufactures using natural gas as feedstock highly competitive. However, the uses for methane, the main component of natural gas, are still limited. This SBIR project addresses the long-standing need for catalytic methods to selectively oxidize methane to methanol using air. The goal is to create a scalable, efficient, and low-cost technology that converts abundant, low-quality natural gas into methanol for deployment to the nations smaller gas fields. This transformational technology represents a fundamental shift in the process chemistry and overall approach to synthesis of methanol. It combines fast reaction rates with a modest operating temperature that is many hundreds of degrees less than conventional syngas-based routes. This project applies novel concepts in oxidation and heterogeneous catalysis to create a highly engineered, multifunctional catalyst that promotes the selective oxidation of methane to methanol using air as the oxidant. No expensive co-reactants are required. Phase I research was directed towards proving out the concept on a bench scale system. The novel catalyst concept was demonstrated to work with exceptional selectivity, and the necessary reaction conditions were identified. The technology was estimated to exceed the performance necessary to compete with fossil-derived methanol. Phase II will extend this work to improve the catalyst performance in two key areas. Several elements of reactor and process design will be conducted to make the technology ready for commercialization. By the end of this project, the process will be ready for piloting, followed by full commercial deployment. If successful, this technology would allow the utilization of the many small and low quality gas fields scattered around the US and the world for methanol production. By drastically lowering the capital cost of a methanol plant, this technology will greatly increase the availability of methanol and open doors to converting this versatile material into a wide range of products including transportation fuels and commodity chemicals.",

        "abstract": "The United States needs efficient and cost-effective methods to convert biomass into liquid transportation fuels. Thermochemical gasification of biomass into synthesis gas followed by catalytic conversion into liquid fuels is a promising approach. One particularly attractive liquid fuel is ethanol. However, the thermochemical conversion of biomass into ethanol has been sta lled by lack of a cata lyst that can eff iciently and selectively convert syngas into e thanol. Problems with conventional heterogeneous catalysts include very poor selectivity and the production of undesired sideproductsespecially methane.  To overcome shortcomings of solid heterogeneous catalysts for direct conversion of synthesis gas into ethanol, in Phase I we developed a homogeneous catalyst dissolved in an ionic liquid that plays a part in stabilizing the catalyst, controlling selectivity, and providing temperature control. The Phase II project will optimize the homogeneous catalytic process for economic scale-up, enabling the use of biomass-derived synthesis gas for the large-scale production of fuel ethanol.  Synthesis gas was converted into ethanol while minimizing production of undesired side productsespecially methane, by utilizing homogeneous catalysts of nonvolatile, inorganic metal anions dissolved and stabilized in a highly thermally conductive, nonvolatile, ionic liquid. The homogeneous system also catalyzed the water-gas shift reaction, chemically consuming water co-produced with the ethanol, allowing energy-efficient separation of the ethanol from the ionic liquid while simultaneously producing hydrogen and allowing use of syngas with a CO/hydrogen molecular ratio of 1/1 or less, compatible with compositions derived from biomass gasifiers. A preliminary techno-economic analysis was performed for a 110 million gallon/year ethanol plant, showing that the optimized process would be competitive with or superior to other means of ethanol production.  The homogeneous catalytic process will be refined with modeling, catalyst optimization and testing. Process and economic analysis for scale-up will be done in collaboration with our Phase II partners, including a major ethanol producer that would adopt the technology if the experimental results and process analysis meet industry benchmarks. Commercial Applications or other Benefits:  The existing market for fuel ethanol is enormous, with annual U.S. consumption of 13.1 billion gallons, and is expected to grow to 36 billion gallons by 2022.",

        "abstract": "There is worldwide interest in the commercialization of energy efficient, environmentally friendly, hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicles and devices. One of the key challenges in transitioning fuel cell technology to the marketplace is the development of suitable onboard hydrogen storage solutions. Metal Hydride Solid-State (MHSS) based hydrogen fuel solutions provide favorable storage alternatives for certain applications such as zero-emission forklifts. Currently, approximately 66,000 Battery-Powered (BP) forklifts are purchased each year in the U.S. BP forklifts have some inherent drawbacks that could be eliminated by incorporating an alternative energy source in the form of a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) coupled with an MHSS fuel system. Hydrogen powered PEMFC forklifts are becoming more widespread, due to a vastly improved overall value proposition, with market sales doubling every two years. The advantages of an MHSS PEMFC forklift over a BP forklift include: 1) Significantly reduced charging/fueling time, 2) Constant Power (not decreasing at low charge), 3) Longer life span, 4) Added ballast (i.e., heavy weight of MHSS fuel tank is a plus for this application), and 5) Supports use of renewable energy (i.e., electrolysis via wind or solar power). Advantages of an MHSS PEMFC forklift over the current High Pressure (HP) PEMFC forklift design include: 1) Reduced safety risks due to low pressure fuel storage, 2) Increased tank storage capacity offering longer durations between refills, 3) Lower cost due to the elimination of on-site HP refueling stations, 4) Value proposition supportive of very small fleets, and 5) Capability to fill directly from an electrolyzer or other low-pressure source. HHC/SES will address the known problem via utilizing our teams vast metal hydride hydrogen storage experience, combined with proven systems engineering tools and manufacturing techniques, to produce a cost effect product that greatly exceeds present industry offerings and customer expectations. Evaluated cost and technical feasibility of MHSS fuel system design integrating with a PEMFC manufactured system. Successfully demonstrated: 1) MHSS storage capacity is greater than for HP fuel systems, 2) Specific energy and energy density meets PEMFC forklift requirements, 3) Ambient temperature start-up, 4) Hydrogen delivery rate is supportive of PEMFC, 5) Refueling can be performed without an off-board cooling system, and 6) Manufacturing design now offers cost competitive solution Validate Phase I design/modeling/testing and produce a full scale MHSS system supportive of PEMFC forklift manufacture. A retrofit kit for existing PEMFC forklifts will also be designed. The developed MHSS system will be formally tested and certified to meet all appropriate codes and standards. The market ready prototype will be integrated into a fully operational forklift for proof of functionality within standard operating conditions. Our solution will cause the wide spread replacement of BP low-speed materials handling vehicles (an estimated $45B/year global market) with hydrogen powered PEMFC systems. Associated benefits are as listed in item 5 above.",

        "abstract": "Aerosol particles have important impacts on visibility, acid deposition, climate, and human health, although large uncertainties remain in quantifying their chemical composition and atmospheric transformations.  A large fraction of the anthropogenic aerosol is generated from energy-related activities, and organic compounds are known to constitute a significant fraction of ambient aerosol mass.  Organic aerosol can be directly emitted from combustion sources or formed through gas-phase reactions of volatile organic compounds.   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the need for improved monitoring technologies for continuous particulate mass and chemical speciation of ambient aerosols.  A prototype Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor will be developed that measures ambient aerosol mass and chemical composition of non-refractory PM2.5 aerosol particles in real-time, providing quantitative measurements of particulate ammonium, nitrate, sulfate, chloride, and organics. The instrument will be designed to run autonomously for extended periods of time and will need no expensive post-processing analysis.  The Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor will be a simple, robust, modestly-priced, aerosol chemical speciation instrument ideal for routine monitoring of local and regional air quality, for continuous emissions monitoring, and for process control monitoring. The Phase I project succesfully demonstrated the feasibility of the Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor.  A prototype was constructed and deployed in a field campaign for intercomparison with routine environmental monitoring instruments.  Progress was made addressing quantification issues. During Phase II, a commercial version of the instrument will be developed.  Specific tasks include designing and constructing new hardware, optimizing the design of the inlet and detector, and developing new data anlysis tools for fast and broad dissemination of particulate mass loadings and chemical composition. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor will provide cost-effective, quantitative particulate matter mass loading and chemical composition data for determining compliance with air quality standards, and for inclusion in atmospheric climate models.  The primary market for this instrument will be government agencies that conduct routine environmental monitoring programs.  In addition, atmospheric research groups at universities and national laboratories will provide a substantial market.  We expect that the system developed in this program will yield a significant level of direct commercial sales in the atmospheric science and environmental pollution research and development communities.",

        "abstract": "Nuclear physics research has a need for position sensitive charge particle and gamma ray tracking devices.  The micromegas detector could achieve the best performance and lowest cost for the large structures required.  These detectors will be exposed to intense radiation, operate in high magnetic fields, and must be affordable.   Agiltron is developing a unique micro- fabrication process to produce micromegas with tailored device architectures, precisely controlled dimensions in large areas at low manufacturing cost. We are also optimizing critical design parameters such as mesh and pillar materials selection. The combination, optimizing component materials and device architectures, will increase in gain, count rate and spatial resolution, and significantly improve micromegas durability and reliability. In Phase I, Agiltron successfully established a unique micro fabrication process to produce micromegas with precision controlled dimensions, high reproducibility and reliable performances. The micromegas was produced in various configurations and dimensions which exhibited extremely low leakage current, in the pico-ampere range  under bias conditions (without radiation), demonstrating well-constructed micromegas. We also clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of high Z material coatings on mesh for spark resistance. Furthermore, excellent gain was observed under 50KVp x-ray radiation. Agiltron will construct and test micromegas from 100 to 1,000 cm2 area by employing the established Phase I fabrication processes with pixelated ground planes to demonstrate energy and spatial resolution at increased gain. We will also investigate and optimize micromegas device structures tailored to various applications, including low energy x-ray detection and imaging. We will further demonstrate that Agiltrons micromegas can be commensurate with curved designs planned for large particle accelerators. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Improved experimental equipment reduces DOE costs directly through apparatus procurement and indirectly as improved performance achieves desired results faster.  The low cost and large area micromegas will also be a suitable replacement for 3He neutron detectors for the advanced spectroscopic portal radiation monitor program. Furthermore, the detector to be developed in this program will have significant medical applications, digital x-ray images with high energy resolution.",

        "abstract": "One main issue associated with nuclear explosion monitoring is the paucity of accurate Ground Truth (GT) data used for the calibration of regional seismic networks, particularly in aseismic regions. Location accuracy of U.S. monitoring and the International Monitoring System provided for by the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty could be significantly improved with accurate GT data from large mines distributed across the globe.  We are developing a Ground-Truth Monitoring System (GTMS) consisting of an inexpensive, lightweight smart sensor unit that can be mailed to and emplaced near large mining regions. The GTMS can operate autonomously and automatically transmit accurate information regarding explosion epicenter, origin time and magnitude. Because of inexpensive ORBCOMM satellite two-way communications, we are developing an accompanying Ground-Truth Processing Center (GTPC) that can be used to improve calibration and processing over the course of a deployment providing accurate ground-truth data within the operational constraints provided by the intended users. In Phase I, we have demonstrated the feasibility of developing a Ground-Truth Monitoring System in terms of hardware design and software (signal processing) algorithms. It appears feasible that the system will meet specified operational goals of ground-truth accuracy, low cost, low power consumption, and autonomous operation without any human intervention. A prototype hardware system using seismic geophones, MEMS sensors and acoustic microphones is already being developed along with a processing framework. We have also developed the concept of a Ground Truth Processing Center (GTPC) which can be used to improve calibration parameters over the course of a deployment. Probably the only constraint that will be difficult to meet is the cost and weight. Our estimates for minimum cost and the total weight of the system is going to be approximately $1500, and 3 lbs, respectively including enclosure, batteries and sensors.  In Phase II, a prototype system will be built and deployed at mines in different geophysical regions. We will focus on algorithm improvement and automation for the Ground-Truth Monitoring System that can be implemented within hardware and processing constraints.  Because the GTMS will have two-way communication, we propose to develop a Ground-Truth Processing Center (GTPC) that can be used to adaptively improve ground-truth accuracy over the duration of a deployment. The Ground-Truth Monitoring System will have many applications besides nuclear explosion monitoring. Because of our flexible processing system, algorithms can be adapted to locate and track micro-earthquakes caused by injection wells used for carbon sequestration, oil and gas recovery, geothermal plants and hydro-fracturing operations. The system will also be useful for border security and perimeter monitoring of facilities as well as underground mine safety systems. For many applications, our business model actually becomes similar to that of a home security service where our GTPC is used to improve monitoring capabilities as well as provide high-confidence alerts.",

        "abstract": "This project addresses very high power switches for accelerators used in high-energy physics research and particle research.  Existing devices have relatively slow switching times, compared to those required for the application.  The proposed program seeks to develop high-voltage, high-current devices with much faster switching times and reduced conduction losses, thereby also improving reliability. Two approaches are utilized here.  The first is to develop switches operating at very low (cryogenic) temperatures, and the second is to apply proprietary switching topologies to this application. In Phase I, a cryogenic drive system was developed, and two cryogenic power modules were demonstrated in a liquid nitrogen bath at 6000 volts and 240 amperes, switching single, megawatt-level pulses. The switching times of one module improved by almost 6 times over room-temperature operation, and the on-state voltage of the other improved by up to 20 times. In the Phase II program, prototype high-voltage, high-current switches (rated for operation at 6000 volts and 2000 amperes) will be developed and tested extensively under a variety of loads, pulse durations, operation times, and power levels.  Reliability and current slew rate will also be evaluated.  The modules will be designed for room-temperature operation as well. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Apart from accelerator applications, which could lead to major breakthroughs in the understanding of fundamental physical phenomena, the high-power switches developed in this program could find use in power distribution systems for existing or future power grids (for example, superconducting transmission lines and superconducting wind turbines), as well as medical and military applications.",

The broader impact and commercial potential of this project address the global need for the rapid development and deployment of low-carbon, renewable electricity sources, which unquestionably ranks as one of this century&#39;s global grand challenges. Such technologies will fuel our economic growth, contribute to global environmental sustainability, and reduce our dependence on polluting and exhaustible fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas. The world&#39;s oceans, with global capacity estimated to be around 2 TW, constitute a vast but untapped energy source that is particularly well-suited to address underserved and/or growing coastal populations. The World Energy Council estimates that wave energy can meet up to 6.5% of U.S. energy needs. Efforts to tap utility-scale energy from the ocean continue to be hampered by high capital costs, high maintenance costs, and low energy efficiencies. The technology developed through this project will accelerate the commercialization of a wave energy harvester with substantially lower capital and operating costs than existing alternatives, enabling a levelized cost of electricity that is competitive with conventional electric power technologies.\n",

        "abstract": "Degradation of reactor components, heat exchangers, and piping systems in nuclear power plants subjected to heat, high pressure and corrosion has been estimated to cost the electric power industry $17.3 billion dollars annually. Eddy current testing is a widely practiced, and critically important nondestructive evaluation method used in power plants, yet it relies on decades-old sensor technology based on coils of wire that do not have the sensitivity or uniformity needed to reproducibly detect small, deeply buried defects. New, vastly superior, solid-state, eddy current sensors and monolithic sensor arrays that could directly replace the coil sensors now used in existing eddy current test systems are proposed. New solid-sensors will be developed and tested in collaboration with major eddy current test equipment users and manufacturers to result in sensors and sensors arrays that can directly replace the coil sensors now in use. The ability to detect incipient defects and monitor growth will provide data needed for prognostics and health monitoring. During Phase I, technical feasibility was proven by developing and fabricating prototype flexible sensors, flexible sensor arrays, and eddy current test electronics and software. Working with several large companies in the field, prototype equipment was evaluated in direct comparison with existing, coil type eddy current sensors and shown to offer higher sensitivity, better signal-to-noise ratio, in be capable of inspecting higher speed.  The sensors were shown to be compatible with existing ECT equipment. In Phase II research and development will continue and include a number of large companies to prove that the new sensors, sensor probes and eddy current test technology offer superior performance and substantial cost savings for the inspection of key components in power plants.  The technology will be developed to meet the standards and needs of industry, and commercialization will begin using company funds in the second year of Phase II. Commercial Applications and other Benefits:  The sensors and sensor arrays will replace the coil sensors that have been used for decades to perform eddy current testing and provide far higher performance at approximately the same sensor cost.  The new technology offers much higher signal-to-noise ratio and reproducibility than coil sensors, and will result in more definitive detection of defects, and the ability to detect smaller, more deeply buried defects.  The sensors will be suitable for use in both existing eddy current test equipment and new eddy current test equipment making it available for all applications where eddy current test is used. Some of the major industries using eddy current testing include: electricity generation, aircraft inspection, transportation vehicle maintenance, oil drilling, and pipeline inspection.",

Prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons has reached a state of heightened urgency in recent years.  Scintillator based gamma-ray spectrometers are an important tool in checking the proliferation of the nuclear weapons.  The performance of the current radioisotope identifiers is limited by the characteristics as well as cost of scintillators available at present. The goal of the proposed project is to investigate new scintillation materials that can be produced with excellent optical and scintillation properties using a low cost fabrication approach. Increased flexibility, significantly lower cost as well as high performance can be expected from the proposed technology. The Phase I project was aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of producing high performance scintillators using a low-cost manufacturing method.  The fabrication processes were explored and the scintillators produced were evaluated.  The Phase II project will involve detailed exploration of the fabrication processes to produce polycrystalline scintillators with high optical quality in large sizes.  Evaluation of scintillation properties as well as gamma and neutron detection performance will also be conducted. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Over and above use in nuclear non-proliferation, the new detectors will be commercially applicable to medical imaging, NDE, and materials analysis.

        "abstract": "There is a critical need for low cost, high performance gamma-ray detectors for identification and localization of special nuclear materials (SNM) such as plutonium and weapons grade uranium. Gamma ray spectrometers are an important tool in checking the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Cadmium zinc telluride (Cd1-xZnxTe or &amp; quot;CZT &amp; quot;) has emerged as the leading room temperature semiconductor gamma ray detector. However, despite decades of research and recent improvements in crystal growth and processing techniques, the yield of device grade CZT is low. To meet the needs of homeland security a lower cost alternative to CZT is desirable. Cadmium manganese telluride (Cd1-xMnxTe or &amp; quot;CMT &amp; quot;) shares many of the desirable nuclear detector properties of CZT including wide band gap, high atomic number and density and modestly high electron mobility-lifetime product. In addition, CMT has the potential to be a lower cost alternative to CZT. RMD has produced detector-grade CdTe crystals by the travelling heater method for many years and will adapt its technology to CMT.  Twin-free CMT material with good uniformity and high resistivity ( &amp; gt; 1010 cm) was obtained by the end of Phase I. In addition, gamma-ray detectors fabricated from this material exhibited stable, low noise and linear behavior. Phase II Plans The research in the Phase II project will be focused on the following main areas: (i) rigorous purification and growing single crystal ingots by THM, (ii) employing post growth annealing to reduce Te precipitates, (iii) characterizing chemical and physical properties, (iv) fabricating and characterizing detectors and (iv) applying depth correction techniques to CMT small pixel arrays. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: In addition to nuclear non-proliferation, nuclear medicine, computed tomography and nondestructive testing are other applications where high performance, less expensive spectrometers will have beneficial applications.  One medical application that RMD already takes part in is the production of surgical probes used for localizing radiopharmaceutical uptake.  These tools have become part of a technique (sentinel node biopsy) that minimizes the debilitating nature of removing lymph nodes in monitoring the spread of breast cancer.  As this technique has become more accepted for breast cancer, other treatment areas have been considered such as monitoring PET isotopes (emitting at 511 keV) which have greater specificity to cancer sites.  A high energy emission presents a challenging probe design because of scattering and lack of efficiency.  New large CMT detectors capable of scatter rejection would be a very welcome solution if available",

Important applications of higher energy synchrotron X-rays include measurement of strain and material evolution during processing, studies of composite materials and studies of layered systems. Detector requirements for these applications include large area, high sensitivity, wide dynamic range, high spatial resolution and fast response. None of the existing detectors meet all of these requirements. We propose to develop a direct detection imager consisting of a compound semiconductor layer coupled to an amorphous silicon thin film transistor array. This detector promises to have higher sensitivity and higher spatial resolution than indirect detectors currently in use. In addition, a low-cost method that can easily be scaled to large areas will be employed to couple the semiconductor layer to the read out array. Prototype imaging detectors based on a compound semiconductor layer coupled to an amorphous silicon thin film transistor array were developed. Film deposition parameters were investigated. The detectors exhibited high sensitivity and high spatial resolution as predicted.  Purification of the semiconductor material will be a focus of the Phase II work. Scale up of semiconductor film area and increase in uniformity will also be addressed. Imaging detectors will be characterized at a synchrotron facility. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  In addition to the synchrotron applications mentioned above, a high resolution, large area detector would have important applications in X-ray diffraction and medical imaging including breast tomosynthesis and portal imaging.",

The development of HTEIC-based wires will enable the resultant magnetic devices to operate at high temperatures, high power densities and high frequencies, offering the advantages such as high efficiency, small size and light weight. In the Phase I recently accomplished, we have demonstrated a novel magnet wire insulation concept based on a ceramic coating which can be cost-effectively processed by a polymer-based precursor.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Military communications satellites are trending to higher pulse power and total energy capacity levels in order to meet exponentially increasing satellite communications capacity requirements. As the demand for on-board power and total energy-storage capacity has continued to increase, Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries have become the new industry standard for use as rechargeable secondary batteries in space vehicles.  Although numerous Li-ion batteries have been spaceflight qualified over the past ten years by both domestic and foreign suppliers, most of these batteries use electrode and electrolyte material technologies that are nearly 20 years old.  As such, the only way to achieve the desired high cycle life with current spaceflight-qualified electrode and electrolyte materials is to substantially limit the allowed depth-of-discharge (DOD) and to control the operating temperature.  Thus there exists considerable need within the spacecraft community develop advanced lithium-ion battery materials possessing considerable cycle-life while maintaining or exceeding the specific energy of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) technologies.  To address this need, ADA Technologies, Inc., proposes to continue advancements made in Phase I to develop a highly stable lithium-ion cell system comprised of advanced nanocomposite electrodes and ionic liquid electrolytes enabling significant improvements cycle life.  BENEFIT:  The increased performance enabled by the proposed technology will allow for advanced lithium-ion batteries to meet the life-cycle and cycle-life performance requirements needed for current and future military and communication satellites.  Furthermore, the developments undertaken will substantially improve the state-of-the-art of lithium-ion battery devices.  Thus if successful, the resulting technology could have substantial commercial impact as the overall market for energy storage devices is estimated to be in excess of $6B per year.  Spin-off applications include hybrid electric vehicles, utility grid applications, and personal electronics among others.",

The goal of the project is to apply 3D pose and shape of human targets for automated inference of different attributes that would enable detection of anomalous behavior. The 3D representation of human targets is obtained as visual hull extracted from silhouettes of multi-view images. Low level image features are used to initialize 3D pose of the targets. The pose is refined using top-down algorithms. We have created statistical shape models using CAESAR dataset that models shape variations among different demographics. We search over this detailed 3D shape model to estimate optimal matching 3D shape of the subject. The shape model is used to detect anomalous shapes, attributes like gender, age and ethnicity. We train graphical chain models to recognize different actions. We have proposed modular software architecture with user friendly GUI, and open data formats to enhance interoperability. Preliminary results in Phase I validate the feasibility of this approach. Phase II work will include an effort to refine and optimize the framework to achieve near real-time processing and to enhance the system&quot;s robustness to more complex poses and in varied environment.  BENEFIT:  The proposed work addresses the technical challenges of human pose and shape estimation in video imagery. It will enable us to detect human activities and to identify suspicious and hostile human behaviors for military and law enforcement applications.  The technology has wide-ranging application beyond intelligent surveillance system:   a) Improved human computer interaction  The framework will facilitate development of more accurate vision based systems to recognize different gesture and motion in 3D. This has vast potential use in role-playing games where the movements of the user in the physical domain are appropriately reflected as an action in the virtual environment.   b) Clinical diagnosis and movement analysis  For identifying the underlying causes for walking abnormalities in clinical patients. The results of gait analysis have been shown to be useful in determining the best course of treatment in these patients.      c) Intelligent training systems for sporting activities  The analysis of sports-related movements often entails analyzing a variety of highly dynamic movements. Motion analysis provides the tools for the sports medicine and performance professionals to perform accurate functional evaluations/analyses for clinical and research oriented purposes.  d) Realistic animation  Cost-effective solution to importing realistic body movements in animated characters in videos.

        "abstract": "As the BMDS evolves over the next decade, the community will be exposed to a substantially greater amount of data from successful intercepts in all phases of the tiered defense, including boost, mid-course and terminal. In order to perform the necessary battle management, command and control functions, a net of sensors using both active RF sensors supporting the fire control, guidance and navigation functions, and some combination of airborne, space-based, or interceptor based EO/IR systems will be required. In phase 1, SciTec developed a proof-of-principle, physics-based features approach for damage assessment utilizing data from EO/IR research and development sensors, and identified and demonstrated a concept of operations for allocating functionality between the JNIC and an R &amp; D system to provide near real-time messages via tactical broadcast systems.  Utilizing a spiral development process, SciTec proposes to further evolve the features, increase the robustness of the algorithm, enhance the integration of the transmitted information for the BMDS and demonstrate the capabilities of our kill assessment algorithm. Additional research and development proposed for our Phase 2 effort will further extend the kill assessment capability beyond the single R &amp; D sensor to future sensors planned for Block 08/10 and beyond.",

These video systems traditionally use advanced image compression algorithms and Gigabit Ethernet for low latency transmission of large volumes of data. However, these are processing intensive tasks, resulting in large, rack mount solutions. There currently is no compact, low power transmitter capable of delivering high quality, low latency imagery. To address this need, Toyon proposes to develop a highly integrated solution comprised of a third party, ASIC for H.264 motion video compression and transmission, and an FPGA to support multiple camera interfaces. The design will be modular allowing the Embedded Miniature Motion Imagery Transmitter (EMMIT) to support a variety of camera interface modules for the greatest flexibility in the smallest possible package. This combination of compact form-factor, low power consumption, high processing capability, plus flexible interfacing will provide maximum utility for the Army.",

Linear synchronous or induction motors can be readily modularized to accommodate the size, weight, power and energy density requirements of a wide range of shipboard systems, including launch of extended range munitions, as well as launch-assist of missiles, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aircraft and other ordnance.   A high-power, solid-state switching based modular topology is used to develop the variable-frequency, high-current and voltage multi phase AC output, which is necessary for the control of the extremely high-speed linear synchronous or induction motors. A Modular Active Power Building Block (MAPBB) is configured through series/parallel circuits to achieve the desired voltages, frequency and currents in a Phase Switch Inverter. To minimize and equalize switching and conducting losses especially around maximum output frequency, a novel technique is used. It provides very low-distortion sinusoidal output currents at any frequency while, at the same time, minimizes and equalizes the thermal losses among the MAPBB units. This architecture&quot;s flexibility provides the linear motor designer with the necessary tools required to optimize the system power supply",

The effort advances the readiness of critical technologies for autonomous threat/anomaly detection and isolation through modeling, simulation, experimentation, and test spirals of increasing fidelity.  To achieve scalable, accurate, and timely on-board diagnosis of satellite anomalies, our hybrid diagnostic approach brings together the capabilities of a reasoning engine with a powerful set of quantitative fault detection and isolation (FDI) tools.  These include adaptive filtering, on-line system identification, and advanced neural network classification algorithms.  In the context of this hybrid approach, the FDI techniques act as what we term smart monitors, providing targeted diagnostics for critical subsystems and threat events.  The smart monitors feed candidate diagnoses to a constraint-based general inference engine that maintains a consistent view of spacecraft status across a hierarchical collection of components.    Development and test activities revolve around two operationally-motivated use cases:  electrical power subsystem diagnostics and threat detection.  The plan includes flight software implementation and testing on an Air Force sciencecraft, with measurements from multiple on-orbit electrostatic analyzer instruments.  At the end of the program, flight-proven technology (algorithms and software) will be delivered to support enhanced spacecraft autonomy in future DoD missions, helping to meet a growing need for increased robustness in the face of natural and man-made threats.    BENEFIT:  The end product of this effort will be a library of flight-proven software for hybrid threat and anomaly diagnostics.  Operational implementation of this technology is anticipated as part of an integrated spacecraft protection system on a next-generation military platform.  On-orbit validation of hybrid diagnostics software will place Barron Associates in a unique position to pursue our marketing strategy of partnering with major aerospace prime contractors for integration of specialized diagnostics and anomaly detection capabilities. Barron Associates will pursue commercialization of the proposed technology through a three-pronged approach.  First, the effort will open consulting services and contract R &amp; D opportunities for providing satellite manufacturers with tailored diagnostics.    Second, by enabling smart monitors to be integrated into a general inference engine, the program will make our neural network software and FDI tools accessible to a broader customer base and a wider range of applications.  Finally, we will pursue direct opportunities to commercialize advanced diagnostics hardware in spin-off ventures that leverage the algorithms developed in the proposed program.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Air Force is currently replacing chrome plating with High Velocity Oxygenated Fuel (HVOF) applied tungsten carbide-cobalt (WC-Co and WC-Co-Cr) coatings. These coatings require diamond wheels for finish grinding the HVOF coatings as well as aluminum oxide grinding wheels for base metal prep and Chrome plate grinding. The use of two types of wheels creates an undesirable equipment change during the overhaul and finishing process. In addition, the current use of both diamond and aluminum oxide grinding wheels involves the risk of grind burns to the substrate of landing gear components.  In Phase I, ES3 demonstrated belt grinding technology can safely grind HVOF applied WC-Co coatings as well as High Strength Steel substrates (HSS) more economically than standard grinding wheels without burning the substrate material.  In Phase I, only the infeed rate was varied.  A full Design of Experiment will be performed in Phase II to determine optimal manufacturing parameters which will ensure maximum efficiency without creating grinding burns.  All grinding parameters will be varied including in-feed, cross feed, part surface speed, and wheel surface speed.  In addition, ES3 will prototype 3 additional grinders with belt grinding attachments located in building 507 Hill AFB.    BENEFIT:  The implementation of Belt Finishing will have a dramatic impact on the cost and efficiency within the DoD and commercial businesses.  This improved grinding method has demonstrated exceptionally fast cutting removal rates, dramatically reduced times associated with belt changes over wheels, in addition the threat of grinding burns to the substrate is virtually eliminated thus reducing a potentially catastrophic failure from occurring.  ES3 expects the following benefits from the prototyping and verification of the Versagrind Belt Finishing machines:     That validation of optimized belts and process variables do not create burns on 300M or 4340 substrates.   That the requirements and equipment for a scaled-up production systems will be identified.   All significant production issues will be identified   Safety considerations and equipment requirements will be identified   Success of this installation will enable commercial landing gear OEM&quot;s and other DoD installations to implement the technology using proven methods",

        "abstract": "Advanced missile defense interceptors require lightweight thermal protection systems (TPS) and aerostructures designed to minimize internal temperature rise and ensure missile airframe structural integrity during flight, including operation in adverse weather. These material systems must meet various requirements such as weight, erosion/ablation performance, component survivability, and cost. Integration of the airframe and TPS components into a single unit has the potential to minimize weight, complexity, and cost. Ultramet has developed a melt infiltration process for rapid fabrication of refractory ceramic matrix composites (CMC) including matrices of zirconium carbide (ZrC), hafnium carbide (HfC), silicon carbide (SiC), and ceramic alloys comprising two or more of these. Substantial ultrahigh temperature hot gas testing of these composites has been performed with extremely good results, including testing under the MDA/SMDC/AMRDEC Composites and Advanced Materials (CAM) program. Ultramet has also developed and tested high temperature, low-cost insulators composed of open-cell carbon foam that is filled with a low thermal conductivity carbon aerogel insulator. The potential exists to combine and optimize melt infiltrated CMCs with foam-based insulators that meet the demanding requirements of hypersonic airframes while demonstrating affordable processing. The Phase I project combined detailed thermal and structural analysis of advanced composite structures by Materials Research and Design, low-cost and scalable air-dried aerogel insulation materials produced by Ocellus, and ultrahigh temperature structural CMC and foam insulator materials produced by Ultramet to demonstrate the initial feasibility of a fully integrated, non-eroding, load-carrying aerostructure/TPS that can operate under high heat flux and shear conditions. In Phase II, Ultramet will team with Raytheon for optimization of materials and structures, supporting Raytheon development of an integrated nosetip/insulator for the hypersonic Kinetic Energy Interceptor (KEI) vehicle. Team members will include Materials Research and Design, which will perform comprehensive thermostructural analysis based on requirements defined by Raytheon, and Ocellus, which will continue aerogel insulation optimization in combination with Ultramet structural foam insulators and high temperature CMC aerostructure development. Performance testing will include hydrometeor erosion testing at NASA Marshall and high temperature oxidation testing at the Air Force LHMEL facility.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The epitaxial liftoff of multi-junction structures provides a means to build photovoltaic devices that are flexible, light weight, and highly efficient.  However, current approaches to increasing the AM0 efficiency of multi-junction structures are reaching practical limitations due to the complexity of the device design.  The objective of this Phase II SBIR program is to develop innovative designs based upon third generation photovoltaic device concepts.  By combining wide and narrow band gap material within each p-n junction, quantum-structured solar cells can increase the current and the voltage output of each of the subcells within a multi-junction solar cell.  Ultimately our approach provides a pathway for obtaining, thin, flexible, single-junction solar cells with AM0 efficiency approaching 40%.  BENEFIT:  Photovoltaic (PV) devices can provide a mobile source of electrical power for a variety of military applications in both space and terrestrial environments.  Many of these mobile power applications can directly benefit from enhancements in the efficiency of the photovoltaic devices.  In particular, flexible, lightweight, high-efficiency solar cells are needed to maximize the power generating capability of space platforms.  Ground-based and air-based defense applications can also benefit from the development of flexible, lightweight cells with improved efficiency.  The technology developed during this program is expected to have immediate market opportunities for defense applications.    The SBIR project described here is also part of a larger effort to realize the ultimate objective of third generation photovoltaics, namely ultra-high conversion efficiency at low costs for terrestrial photovoltaic power.  Ultra-high efficiency solar cells could substantially enhance the overall performance of terrestrial concentrator photovoltaic systems.  This technology could thus accelerate the adoption of photovoltaics into the renewable energy market to address the world&quot;s growing energy needs without degrading the environment.  In addition to its potential commercial value and social benefits, this SBIR program will enhance the technical understanding of quantum-structured devices.",

The novel receiver architecture, relying extensively on digital processing, is to be realized in a CMOS fabrication process, allowing it to be integrated with many types of CMOS system-on-chip products, including microprocessors for remote metering applications, clocks, MP3 players, and many more.

However, their utility for systems studies of missile fly-outs is limited by extremely long run times for each calculation. Spectral Sciences developed a data-driven algorithm suite for fast, accurate rendering of real-world plume imagery.  The FRAMES (Fast Rendering Algorithm for Missile Emission Scenes) model uses a small matrix of calculations along with field data plus innovative spatial morphing and field interpolation algorithms to enable fast frame rate plume imagery to be generated using a single PC over a broad range of missile and sensor operational conditions.  FRAMES is built around a database of precalculated high-altitude plumes that, for each missile type, span a range of angles of attack, missile speeds, and atmospheric conditions.  The completed Phase I program demonstrated the feasibility of FRAMES for scaling plumes above 110 km altitude to different angles of attack.  In Phase II we will extend FRAMES to the full missile trajectory, including automated calculation of the supporting plume database and generation of multiple images along the trajectory.",

In engine hot sections, electronic semiconductor material-based sensors must be cooled or remotely located and connected using a pneumatic tube. Dispersion of pressure waves in the tubes degrade frequency response needed for the measurement of transient pressure phenomena. Because of size, weight and geometrical constraints, in situ cooling of electronic pressure sensors is also impractical for many test applications and unacceptable for most flight applications. Today, important needs for dynamic pressure measurements in gas turbine hot sections are currently unmet.  In this Phase II program, Prime Photonics will build upon the successful Phase I demonstration of an optically excited, optically interrogated resonant beam sensor (RBS) to develop a low-cost, practical sensor for measurement of dynamic pressures at frequencies of at least 5 kHz and at temperatures up to 2200 degrees  F. RBS technology combines the high operating temperature and EMI immunity of optical sensors with the simple, low cost signal processing afforded by digital phase lock loops.

        "abstract": "This project addresses the development of refractory coated or lined low density structures applicable for advanced future propulsion system technologies.  The fundamental idea behind this concept was to design a hot-walled refractory material (ceramic and/or metallic) in the form of a thin coating or liner and have that supported by a low density structure such as graphite or various carbon-carbon composites, offering an attractive lightweight design option.  This coated or lined low density structure combines the compatibility and hermetic seal of the ceramic and/or metallic hot-walled material with a lightweight, high strength to weight ratio support material such as graphite or carbon-carbon composites.  The advantage of this particular concept can be observed by both the weight and cost savings compared to, for example, current solid monolithic refractory propulsion components.  Lightweight structures are desirable for space transportation vehicle systems in order to reduce launch costs, increase mission flexibility, increase mission efficiency and add robustness with respect to the ability to add weight or additional materials to the mission with minimum sacrifice in performance.  This general concept is applicable to thrust vector controls, combustion chambers, nozzles and thrusters.  One study has shown that replacing a solid monolithic rhenium pintle and seat with a rhenium lined graphite version can offer both weight and cost savings as high as 80 - 90%.",

While accelerating the drug screening process, this device also offers the promise of reducing animal trials.

Effect of drug permeation, concentration and time dependent toxicity under perfusion and diffusion based conditions was highlighted. Finally, co-culture of vascular and tissue cells mimicking the in vivo conditions were demonstrated. Phase II will expand the platform to include cells from other organs of interest namely brain and kidney. Systems biology approaches will be used to identify biomarkers of toxicity.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Within an Air Operations Center, planners working in the Master Air Attack Plan cell make crucial decisions to create the air plan for any given day. They are expected to complete the plan in part by pairing targeting or collection tasks with the available platforms and weapons. Any assistance these planners can get to help create the plan in a timely manner would make the entire process more efficient and effective. One major challenge is orchestrating the target list; designing packages to strike more than one target at a time makes efficient use of resources and improves survivability. Another challenge is making the best use of available resources. For instance, rather than assigning a un-tasked resource to a collection, it may be more expedient to instead assign an aircraft already slated to perform a strike near the target. This proposal outlines a system, the Intelligent Pairing Assistant (IPA), designed to help planners address both of these challenges. The Phase II proposal builds directly on the results of the Phase I investigation, focusing on providing a small number of easy-to-understand pairing recommendations at specific decision points to help planners perform their work more efficiently and effectively.      BENEFIT:  There are three commercialization paths for the Intelligent Pairing Assistant (IPA) that we will pursue in Phase II: as a MAAPTK plug-in, as an assistant for other AOC systems such as TBMCS, and as a general pairing assistant for other planning domains. The first two options are the primary commercialization paths, pursuing Phase III funding within the US Air Force to transform the system at the end of Phase II into a fully deployed framework for assisting pairing either with MAAPTK or another AOC system. A third commercialization path would be to take the underlying technology and repurpose it for use in Navy Maritime Operation Centers, Department of Homeland Security, or  civilian planning systems, for tasks such as wildfire fighting, by encoding knowledge from, and integrating IPA with, the new domain.",

Traditional systems have used either stored suppressants that are often heavy, costly, and create logistical resupply challenges or systems that produce an inert gas such as an on-board inert gas generating system that can generate an inert gas to fill the ullage during flights. The Navy desires an improved inerting system that can support multiple independent fuel tanks that does not use engine bleed air, uses a minimum of electrical power, and that can reduce the oxygen content in the tanks to less than 9% by volume. Toward this goal, Reactive Innovations, LLC has demonstrated an inerting system that does not use engine bleed air nor stored reactants, and that can process fuel/air mixtures reducing the oxygen content to less than 9%. Experimental and mathematical models of the inerting process have been conducted that show how the inerting system will scale and perform at higher ullage flow rates. This inerting system is being scaled to a larger operational system to function with larger aircraft multi-tank fuel systems. Optimization of the inerting process will focus on reducing the weight and manufacturing cost.",

We will continue to advance JENTEK&#039;s Meandering Winding Magnetometer Array (MWM-Array) technology - including sensors, multivariate inverse methods and portable instruments. This is a critical need to support the USAF&#039;s transition from electrolytic hard chromium coatings (EHC) to the more environmentally benign tungsten carbide-cobalt (WC-Co) and tungsten carbide-cobalt-chromium (WC-Co-Cr) coatings.  The goal is to avoid the costly removal of these coatings, producing substantial savings and improving fleet availability.    During Phase I, JENTEK worked with the USAF and Delta TechOps to define NDI requirements and we clearly demonstrated feasibility of detecting subsurface cracks and grinding burns in HSS through foils representative of chromium plated on landing gear.  Clear indications of the defects of interest were produced; specifically for real cracks under coatings and for EDM notches and grinding burns under representative foils. In the proposed Phase II, we will fabricate and access more representative samples to both develop enhanced capability and demonstrate NDI performance suitable for transition into depot/field use.     BENEFIT:  If the proposed Phase II is successful, the USAF will have a reliable means for detecting cracks, grinding burns, overloads and other defects in HSS landing gear without removing HVOF and/or other coatings. The capability to inspect through such coatings will result in substantial savings and may improve availability of aircraft for the USAF by avoiding the costly and time-consuming process of coating removal. The developed inspection capability will facilitate the transition from EHC to HVOF WC-Co and WC-Co-Cr coatings, a transition that is also occurring in the commercial aviation community. Thus, we anticipate a substantial commercial demand for this SBIR developed capability.",

The basis for the system is carbon nanotube (CNT) enhancements embedded within composite laminates in conjunction with direct write (DW) electrodes patterned on a flexible abrasion-proof substrate. CNT provide improved delamination &amp; fracture toughness to the material, but also introduce multifunctional capabilities by virtue of their excellent thermal and electrical conductivity. Impact detection can be achieved by observing changes in local resistivity. Ice-detection is based on effective heat capacity, where power is applied to the CNT through DW electrodes for a brief period, and the temperature rise is recorded with DW thermocouples. The slope of that rise can been well correlated to the thickness of ice present on the surface. For de-icing (melting) and anti-icing (prevention of ice formation) a resistive heating principal will be used. A sparse network of DW electrodes will be applied to an abrasion-resistant layer and bonded to the CNT-enhanced composite, and when voltage is applied the CNT will heat due to their small but finite resistance value. Due to their high thermal conductivity, heat will be distributed relatively evenly throughout the aerosurface.",

Such a  system must deal with many challenges including a data starved environment,  nonlinear and non-conservative forces with uncertain parameters, long  propagation times without observations, wide variability in scenario  complexity from breakups to widely spaced orbits, uncorrelated tracks,  fusion of radar and EO reports, features, and non-traditional data.    To address these challenges, Numerica proposes the development of a new and  adaptive multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) class of algorithms in a software  environment and framework that supports rapid algorithm prototyping, testing  and evaluation, and object-oriented design.  Such an environment will support  and incorporate different algorithms for association, nonlinear filtering and  multiple models, complexity reduction, uncertainty management, biases,  likelihood ratios, features and non-traditional data, maneuver detection, and  event classification.  The program will unify these topics under a single  framework capable of solving large problems autonomously.  BENEFIT:  The first anticipated benefit from the proposed program will be the development  of a modern and statistically robust approach to tracking space objects through  the use of modern nonlinear estimation and correlation techniques.  A second  anticipated benefit will be the significant advance in change and maneuver  detection. The combination ensures a robust system for tracking and  maneuver/change detection.    The key commercialization of the proposed program would be a transition of the  algorithms and software, either alone or embedded in a modern multiple target  tracking system, to the JSpOC Mission Systems, NRO/NSA, or to a prime for the  Space Fence such as Lockheed Martin.  This program also provides the  opportunity to work with other contractors and the nation&#039;s Air Force labs in  support of the nation&#039;s space protection and situational assessment programs  utilizing Numerica&#039;s strengths in all phases of multiple target tracking,  modern control systems, sensors, sensor resource management, and situation  assessment.",

In the Phase I program, we began developing a new class of nanocomposite particles that overcome issues commonly associated with dispersing particles in lubricants, thereby leading to exceptional stability. The Phase I program also demonstrated a substantial increase in the thermal properties of transmission oil. A preliminary cost analysis was performed, which showed that the nanocomposite additive technology is economically feasible. The proposed Phase II effort builds upon these findings so that nanocomposite particle-enabled grease and oil (NanoLube) are made ready for implementation in the field. In addition to demonstrating scalability of the process for synthesizing NanoLube, the program involves testing NanoLube under simulated use conditions, and qualifying the lubricant for Army applications by testing using ASTM protocol. One of the largest DoD prime contractors has shown significant interest in the outcome of the Phase II effort. Success in the proposed program can lead to an immediate Phase III effort where NanoLube is qualified for use in a specific Army application.",

        "abstract": "Next-generation ground-based BMD radar is anticipated to employ a scalable architecture with multiple low-cost transportable arrays employing hundreds of thousands of elements per array. Low-cost analog array panels are to be employed in the array, and will typically contain a digital receiver/exciter (DREX) behind a subarray group of typically 64 or 256 elements. The combination of element-level analog beam steering and subarray digital beamforming allows for multiple simultaneous receive beams which are digitally controlled. A wideband DREX increases target discrimination capability, along with a great degree of flexibility in the waveform control and anti-jam capability. Applied Radar is developing a DREX solution to meet the needs of next-generation BMD radar under a spiral development process. This DREX interfaces with the MIT/LL Radar Open Systems Architecture (ROSA) for beam-steering and waveform control as well as back-end radar processing. This proposed Phase 2 effort improves upon the current VME-based DREX hardware, and includes demonstrations with available array hardware. Additionally, further effort will be made towards integrating the DREX with the array hardware. Emerging chip-level transceiver technologies are to be investigated towards the goals of reducing DREX size, weight and cost. We also look at the possibility from the DREX perspective of separating the transmit and receive functions of the radar into physically separate arrays, as well as cohering multiple arrays.",

Currently, Automated Tape Laying (ATL) machines accomplish in-situ matrix heating, winding, and compaction of the composite prepreg tape onto mandrels. As a result of indirect and ineffective heating, both the prepreg winding tension and the tape feed rates are limited by the current ATL machines. Creares innovation is a novel Directed Heating System (DHS) that deposits directed and localized energy into the prepreg tape using lasers that can be easily and safely integrated with the fiber placement head on any ATL machine platform. During the Phase I project, we assembled a DHS, completed pre-production tests on composite parts, and began designing the system for integration on off-the-shelf ATL machines. During Phase II, we will complete the system design, fabricate a prototype DHS, integrate it onto an ATL machine, and complete performance testing.

        "abstract": "Improving the useful rail life is major technical barrier to developing a fleet-deployable electromagnetic (EM) launcher. Current copper alloy rails, while having excellent electrical conductivity, are highly susceptible to hypervelocity gouging, galling, and attack by liquid aluminum transferred from the armature. Without a solution for these rail wear problems, the utility of EM launchers may be greatly limited due to high costs (resulting from a limited number of firings between scheduled rail replacements). Metal matrix composite coatings with refractory metal reinforcement, such as tungsten, molybdenum or tantalum, have been identified by NSWCDD as candidate coating materials for improving rail life. A revolutionary wrought metal deposition method, based on friction stir technology, is being developed through ONR funding by Schultz-Creehan to deposit coatings, including MMC coatings, that are metallurgically bonded with the substrate. This wrought metal deposition technology is referred to as friction stir fabrication (FSF). The application of this technology to the EM rail problem would be a straightforward extrapolation of current research and development efforts. As such, herein, Schultz-Creehan presents a novel but realistic approach to improve EM rail life through the application of MMC coatings using FSF.",

The ultimate objective of this program is to adapt the AR Microstructure (ARMs) technology and fabrication processes for use with the innovative sensor designs offered by the Image Sensor Division of Teledyne Imaging Sensors (TIS), a major commercial supplier of state-of-the-art detector products. In a directly related MDA sponsored Phase II Enhancement program, ARMs technology has been successfully integrated and tested with functional sensors produced by BAE Systems, a second major supplier of infrared imaging detectors. To ensure the supply of high functioning infrared sensors and to promote innovation, multiple detector manufacturers with varying device designs have been supported by the military and have supplied fully qualified detectors. A Phase II project is needed to demonstrate the integration of ARMs technology with TIS microlens-based sensor arrays. It is expected that up to two functional sensor arrays fabricated with the new ARMs treatment will be delivered to the Air Force for further testing. BENEFIT: ARMs technology offers the potential for higher performance detector arrays combined with increased environmental survivability and reduced costs associated with improved fabrication yields. It is anticipated that the increased sensor quantum efficiency over a wider infrared bandwidth afforded by the ARMs treatment will allow for longer range detection of missile threats allowing the warfighter more time to evade. The large format, multiple mega-pixel sensors slated for the next generation Air Force SBIRS HIGH program that is currently referred to as the Overhead Persistent Infrared System, OPIRS, and is the direct output of the AFRL High Stare research program, would realize significant performance and cost advantages through application of the ARMs treatment. The mechanical durability of the ARMs treatment can also lead to reduced replacement costs in airborne sensor systems used in the Predator and GlobalHawk unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the Joint Strike Fighter, and in most helicopter platforms such as the ARMY ARH-70A reconnaissance helicopter.",

        "abstract": "Currently there is no commercial software modeling capability which correlates the details of a manufacturing process to the probabilistic lifing analysis of a component.  Since fatigue life of a nickel base superalloy disk component is greatly influenced by bulk residual stresses, which themselves are functions of prior thermo-mechanical processing (TMP), service conditions, and microstructure features (such as grain size) and material anomalies (such as inclusions and pores), modeling of the evolution of these features during forming and in service will greatly improve fatigue life prediction.  Using the integrated process modeling system DEFORM, it is possible to predict the evolution of critical life limiting factors during TMP (e.g. cogging, forging, heat treatment, and machining).  Thus, integration of process modeling to probabilistic lifing methods will greatly help the jet engine industry, by improving fatigue life predictions and risk assessments of jet engine components.    During Phase I of this project, Scientific Forming Technologies Corporation teamed with Southwest Research Institute to develop a framework to link the process modeling system DEFORM with the probabilistic lifing modeling system DARWIN.  At the end of Phase I, we demonstrated a proof of concept model for linking DEFORM and DARWIN, specifically studying the effects of residual stress predictions from DEFORM generated during thermo-mechanical processing and service conditions on probabilistic lifing predictions of DARWIN for a generic jet engine disk.  We investigated a modeling framework in DEFORM to effectively link process modeling results with probabilistic lifing method predictions.     During Phase II of this project, our team will develop and implement modeling tools that will integrate location-specific grain size predictions, material anomaly orientation and residual stress profiles from processing models with probabilistic lifing methods.  Proposed efforts are targeted towards developing techniques to link processing modeling results from DEFORM with the probabilistic component life prediction code, DARWIN.  At the end of this program, it is envisioned that an infrastructure in DEFORM will be available to conduct sensitivity analysis specifically to address variabilities in processing conditions, material data and boundary conditions. It is proposed that DARWIN will be enhanced to take into account location specific grain size and material anomaly orientation in its life predictions and risk assessments.   Our team is working closely with all the major jet engine OEMs to develop an implementation plan so as to maximize the benefits of linking processing models with probabilistic lifing methods.      BENEFIT:  It is anticipated that the link implemented in Phase II between process modeling results from DEFORM to DARWIN will enhance the accuracy of fatigue life and risk assessment of jet engine components, thus greatly benefiting the jet engine industry.  Integrating process modeling with probabilistic lifing in Phase I has demonstrated the sensitivity of lifing results to residual stresses evolved during thermo-mechanical processing and service.  Adding location-specific descriptions of grain size, material anomaly orientation and residual stress variability due to changes in processing conditions, material properties and boundary conditions is expected to provide more accurate predictions of component fatigue life and its variability.       Building this link between manufacturing processing models and probabilistic lifing analysis will facilitate a genuine Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) methodology in analyzing the design and manufacture of a jet engine component.   This will make it possible to optimize the design process and improve component performance by directly incorporating material and manufacturing variables into the assessment of component lifing and reliability.  This link will also provide a tool to enhance understanding of the interaction between microstructural features and residual stresses on mechanical property response under service conditions.  It is expected that this link will help in understanding and optimizing the processing window during the manufacture of jet engine components to push the existing limits of jet engine performance in service.    The work proposed in Phase II will also serve as a launching pad for future full scale manufacturing process optimization analysis based on fatigue life of jet engine components under service conditions.  It is anticipated that this would help in accelerating the insertion of new materials to service through a better understanding of processing, evolution of microstructural features and mechanical property response.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Current generation of military GPS User Equipment (UE) uses significantly more power than a commercial GPS unit.  There is a desire to develop operational techniques and lower power devices to increase operational use of hand-held military GPS devices.  A lower power alternative to continuously running a SAASM receiver is to use a hybrid solution where the SAASM is only periodically turned on and used to update an alternative navigation system which is running continuously.      Under the Phase I contract we developed a design for a Hybrid SAASM solution that extends the operational use of military hand-held GPS receivers by periodically shutting off the SAASM functions and using a low-power dead reckoning solution between SAASM fixes.  This Hybrid SAASM architecture is based on commercial components integrated with existing SAASM modules which can result in a low power, handheld solution which maintains the anti-jam and anti-spoof protection provided by military GPS UE.  Under this contract we will develop a Hybrid SAASM Test-Bed integrated with an advanced battery pack to demonstrate the expected performance under representative operating conditions.  The Phase II test-bed will be used to demonstrate the anti-spoof and anti-jam and intelligent power saving features of the Hybrid SAASM architecture.    BENEFIT:  The battery lifetime of military GPS handheld receivers is significantly less than that of commercial GPS receivers.  For this reason, many military users are carrying commercial GPS receivers in theater rather than the mandated SAASM UE. This places them at risk of jamming and spoofing which could have disastrous effect on military operations. The proposed solution not only drastically reduces power consumption of next generation military GPS UE, but can greatly extend the utility of currently fielded units at low cost.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Solid rocket motor propellant degrades over time. Currently, health determinations are either destructive or involve expensive and time-consuming off-site tomographic techniques. In Phase I, Luna proposed  a nondestructive, in-situ Ageing and Defect Monitor suitable for use in depot or field.      In Phase I, Luna has shown feasibility of an ultrasonic nondestructive depot/field test set for the health of solid rocket motor (SRM) propellant. The link between propellant ageing and ultrasonic properties of the propellant was investigated:  formulation differences in samples were distinguished ultrasonically. Using a multilayer aluminum/propellant test artifact, a debond between the aluminum case and propellant was detected. The equations of guided-wave propagation in cylindrical multilayer structures were obtained. In Phase II, these results will be extended to correlation of propellant mechanical properties with propellant acoustic properties in motor geometry. The measurements will be verified on actual propellant. A demonstration prototype will be designed and built.      The results of the Phase II effort will be a field prototype test set that will dramatically reduce the cost and time needed to determine the health and readiness of SRM assets. As a result, the probability of a mission failure due to motor malfunction, or catastrophic motor destruction, will be reduced.  BENEFIT:  For military, scientific and commercial solid rocket motors, the development of Luna&quot;s Ageing and Defect Monitor will decrease the costs associated with assurance of readiness and reliability. Destructive testing and off-site tomographic testing are expensive and time consuming, and cannot be applied to all assets. Nondestructive testing, however, can be used regularly and on all assets at a lower cost than destructive or invasive methods. Other devices exist that use embedded energetic materials: explosive forming presses, explosive bolts. This technology could be applied to problems in those areas.     Other systems of multilayer metal/composite/energy absorptive materials exist both on airframes and military ground vehicles. Luna&quot;s guided-wave interrogation techniques can be applied to these structures as well, in order to find defects during manufacture or after suspected damage in the field. Examples include helicopter rotor fabrication, composite multilayer airframe structures, hull and armored vehicle systems to mitigate secondary blast effects, and similar layered structures. Ageing effects may not be of primary importance in many of these systems, but defect detection may be crucial to correct operation. Nondestructive, nonintrusive evaluation from an exterior surface will find great acceptance in the manufacturing process, and for depot maintenance/evaluation.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The objective of this Phase-II research effort is to further develop, validate and apply the ReaxFF force field parameters for hydrocarbon cracking catalysis on Fe- and Co-doped aluminosilicate systems. During Phase I we demonstrated the feasibility of the ReaxFF method for this catalyst/substrate system; we demonstrated that ReaxFF can reproduce DFT results for a wide range of systems, including equations of state, reaction energies and reaction barriers. We also performed initial application studies, showing, for the first time, a fully dynamical description of this complex catalyst/fuel interface.  In Phase II we will focus on extension, validation and, eventually, application of this ReaxFF description.  We will first bring the Co-ReaxFF description to the same level as the Phase-I Fe-parameters and will develop new parameters for alkali metals, which are important doping elements in zeolite-based cracking catalysts. The validation effort in Phase II will involve comparison of newly identified routes form high-temperature ReaxFF MD-simulations to DFT data, as well as an extensive interaction with experimental data.  In order to enable experimental validation we will synthesize Fe- and Co-doped aluminosilicate materials and study their catalytic conversion, as a function of feedstock composition, temperature and pressure.  Furthermore, we will perform calorimetry studies to evaluate the heat duty associated with the hydrocarbon cracking and EXAFS and thermogravimetric analysis studies to evaluate the composition and structure of the metal clusters in the zeolite. We will design a series of computational studies that can extrapolate towards the experimental conditions, thus enabling validation of our computational approach by both DFT and experiment. These validated parameters will then be used for an extensive MD-based study to map out the mechanisms, rates and long-term ageing effects of the cracking reaction for (a) various pressures and temperatures, (b) different composition of the hydrocarbon feedstock, and (c) varying dopant concentration and location.  This research effort will extend the application of currently existing catalysts for the cracking of hydrocarbon fuels to the pressures found in high-heat fuel systems by providing detailed, atomistic-scale, insight in the key reactive events on the hydrocarbon/catalyst interface.  BENEFIT:  The development of a force field (FF) based reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulation program to understand hydrocarbon cracking catalysis for high-heat sink fuels will play a key role in the research and development of scramjet engines.  The proposed software will be capable of performing nanosecond-scale MD-simulations on large (&gt;&gt;1000 atoms), and the development of parallel ReaxFF will enable application to systems&gt;1,000,000 atoms.  Hence, the development of this software will enable researchers in educational, industry, and DoD research facilities to study the full complexity of a dynamic catalyst/fuel interface for a range of applications from propulsion/energy to materials.  Groups that have an interest in ReaxFF include Exxon (fuel chemistry and catalysis), Lockheed Martin (carbon nanotube enforced polymers), CFDRC (catalyzed canbon nanotube growth), Intel (catalyzed carbon nanotube growth), Seiko-Epson (SiO2/Si interfaces), and Nissan (diamond-like carbon materials).  Spectral Energies will work with our partners at Penn State and the Air Force Research Laboratory to ensure that the results of this work enable the development of advanced engine technology, as described in the work for Phase II, as well as follow-on Phase III activities.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  A significant need exists for space antennas which provide high gain, small stowed volume, and the ability to generate both wide and narrow beams.  Currently available UHF antennas for space applications do not offer a clear path for higher gain apertures, as this would require either the addition of large antenna elements, or scaling a reflector.  The former is not an option with volume-constrained spacecraft, and the latter requires serious mechanical redesign.  FIRST RF proposes a deployable UHF antenna array which stows compactly for launch and deploys via a simple yet robust deployment mechanism.  The key enabler to the antenna design is the wideband collapsible antenna and feed.  Measured data suggests array gain of at least 18 dB over military UHF SATCOM bands from a stowed volume of 0.75m x 3m x 0.15m. The array is built from modular panels, which means the array size can grow to accommodate higher gain / higher datarate applications.  Beamforming circuitry provides simultaneous or switched access to multiple beams.  Phase I demonstrated the basic antenna element, which is a cornerstone of the design.  Phase II is focused on building a 4 element array followed by a full size aperture which meets the gain requirements.  BENEFIT:  The primary application of this technology is for UHF Follow On or MUOS satellites.  The antenna provides higher gain on both Tx and Rx.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Systima is proposing a Phase II SBIR program for a Scramjet Cold-Start Gas Generator (SCS-GG).  Systima&quot;s concepts combine the advanced injection methods and advanced ignition propellants into a reliable, low weight and volume cold-start solution. During Phase II, Systima will mature its gas generator and injection system designs and demonstration testing to verify the performance characteristics at the component and system levels. Systima will establish a transition path through the Phase II to testing with the 2-D scramjet test platform.  Systima proposes an integrated cold-start system. This system is involved in the entire start process from pre-ignition, ignition, liquid fuel operation, and liquid to vapor fuel transition. This requires a system that ignites the cold JP fuel and actively engages the fuel during transition to steady state. Systima&quot;s Phase I efforts demonstrated a promising design candidate cold-start system.   Working with industry partners, Systima will identify the requirements of the scramjet cold-start system and provide a lightweight and reliable SCS-GG and integrated design for supersonic combustion systems.  Reliable ignition of scramjet engines at the supersonic takeover point is a persistent concern. Current systems are undesirable due to complexity, safe handling, and overall weight/volume.      BENEFIT:  This method of enabling the cold-start of a supersonic combustion engine will have direct applicability to missile and vehicle systems utilizing hypersonic airbreathing propulsion. These engine systems have applicability in global strike weapons, high speed transports, and access to space technologies. This is an area of interest for the U.S. Government, both the military and NASA, and the prime contractors that are working on the research and development to supply the U.S. Government with these systems including: Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne.   Systima has ongoing relationships with these customers and prime contractors and will endeavor to put forward this technology in conjunction with our other hypersonic vehicle technologies in our product line. The SCS-GG System will need to be matured through TRL7 and AFRL&quot;s ongoing robust scramjet and X-51 programs will provide potential platforms for integrated ground and flight testing. Once this level of maturity is obtained, the SCS-GG System technology will be well positioned for transition into the first likely market for hypersonic engines with prompt global strike tactical missiles. Once this product/technology is embedded in this marketplace it is well positioned to grow with the hypersonic engines into other military and commercial flight systems. We are well positioned with our Rocketdyne partner, a world leader in hypersonic combustion engines, and high speed vehicle integrators to market and promote the use of this technology in weapons and exploration vehicles.   Systima is currently an active supplier of energetic material systems for weapons systems, space system actuators, and other development concepts and has the necessary expertise and capability to carry this product from concept, through development to production. Our personnel have decades of experience in this industry with energetic materials from simple double base powder propellants, custom grain fabrication, and through linear shaped charge. We are an established supplier of hypersonic vehicle shroud components and submunition ejection systems.  1.1 TECHNOLOGY MARKET OPPORTUNITY  Increased requirements for military weapons that can be fired from safe stand-off distances from their targets and have very short travel time to their targets has renewed interest in hypersonic propulsion technologies. Specifically to meet the stated defense needs for prompt global strike capabilities for weapons systems to travel over great distances in minutes requires that vehicles utilize airbreathing systems (not requiring that both fuel and oxidizers be carried as vehicle weight such as in high speed rocket based missiles) that can operate with supersonic combustion scramjet engines. The high speed of fluids through a supersonic scramjet combustor allows only milliseconds to adequately mix the fuel and air, ignite the fuel/air mixture and sustain combustion. Current scramjet powered vehicles such as the X-51 Waverider (see Figure 3 1) utilize volatile gaseous fuels such as Ethylene to provide cold-start ignition. These systems are weight and, more critically, volume inefficient taking up valuable vehicle volume that is needed for guidance systems and warheads required to weaponize the flight system. An integrated SCS-GG System that combines proven gaseous fuel cold-start and modern injection techniques for reliable operation with reduced weight and radically smaller volume will be an enabling technology for transitioning the experimental X-51 vehicle to a prompt global strike tactical missile system.  Prompt global strike technologies are becoming more critical to neutralize targets deep inside contested airspace/territory that appear for short opportunity windows for attack. This was demonstrated with the SCUD missile launchers in the first conflict in the Persian Gulf and with terrorist cells in the current conflicts.  Defending key allies such as South Korea and Taiwan by opening access for support and resupply will require rapid strike deep inside contested and hostile territory against similar targets. In response to this the government has expended many resources in working towards a hypersonic strike platform starting with the ASALM and SLAT supersonic cruise missiles in the early&quot;80&quot;s. The DOD has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in recent programs such as FASTT, HyFly, HiSTED, Falcon, X-43 and X-51 to develop this capability demonstrating a viable interest in bringing these technologies into full maturity.  The market space for a hypersonic cruise missile is estimated to be on the order of a total of $5B and approximately $500M/year assuming a final inventory of 2,500 missiles and a 10 year manufacturing run to reach inventory at a unit cost of $2M/each. This is based on comparison to the BGM-109 Block IV Tomahawk missile which is the latest version and soon to be manufactured subsonic cruise missile for a similar mission space. The total Tomahawk inventory is maintained near 2,500 missiles and the Blk IV is estimated to cost between $1.1M/EA and $1.4M/EA. The SCS-GG is a small component in this system and is estimated to cost approximately $10K/EA though if manufactured at a rate of 250/year these unit costs will likely decrease some due to volume of scale. This would amount to approximately $2M/year for the manufacture of the SCS-GG with a total market as much as $20M over the 10 year production.  Expanded market share potential exists for this product beyond the prompt global strike entry system in hypersonic attack aircraft, hypersonic transport aircraft and access to space systems. These spirals of market growth also depend on the success of the parent scramjet engine system and its development spiral.  If the SCS-GG becomes a state-of-the-art technology with Systima as the incumbent provider we will be well positioned to compete in this continued growth potential.  1.2 MARKET ENTRY PLAN  Systima has a unique combination of experience and agile efficiency to realize the successful development and production of these systems for industry.  Our staff has vast experience in applying our core competencies with energetic systems and high speed propulsion to solve unique and difficult problems in a variety of aerospace and defense systems such as small precision munitions, unmanned aircraft systems, hypersonic vehicles, and large missile systems.  The wide range of experience available at Systima makes our staff very agile in approach and application of skills towards developing a system often producing innovative solutions to problems rapidly.  This agility combined with our commitment to our customers and the quality of our products and services allows us to be very efficient and effective when developing new technologies.  To successfully execute market entry the SCS-GG System needs to achieve technical maturity to TRL7 prior to the transition of the current hypersonic vehicles to a prompt global strike tactical missile. This level of maturity is necessary to reduce the perceived risk associated with including this technology into a high profile program of record.  It is planned that the proposed Phase II program will advance the TRL4-5 with the TRL6 being achieved in the follow on Phase III program testing the SCS-GG in a static scramjet test bed at relevant conditions. This test program will likely require $300K to $500K to complete depending upon the number of configurations prepared and scope of testing program.   Once matured to TRL6 the SCS-GG System will need to transition into the flight test system program, likely the X-51 program. The X-51 program is currently sponsored by the same customer organization at AFRL as this SBIR program. The scramjet engine manufacturer for this flight test system is an active teammate on this development program. This should position Systima well to socialize the technology with this customers (gov&quot;t and prime) and insert the SCS-GG in future flight tests. Successful insertion into the flight test program will bring the maturity to TRL7. This level of maturity should be adequate to prepare the technology for insertion into a prompt global strike entry market and assuming that a Phase III program follows in close sequence to the Phase II the technology could be TRL6 mature first quarter of 2014. If flight test platforms are available at that point the technology could be transition ready as early as 2015.  2 MILITARY APPLICATIONS  Prompt global strike technologies are becoming more critical to neutralize targets deep inside contested airspace/territory that appear for short opportunity windows for attack. This was demonstrated with the SCUD missile launchers in the first conflict in the Persian Gulf and with terrorist cells in the current conflicts.  Defending key allies such as South Korea and Taiwan by opening access for support and resupply will require rapid strike deep inside contested and hostile territory against similar targets. An integrated SCS-GG System that combines proven gaseous fuel cold-start and modern injection techniques for reliable operation with reduced weight and radically smaller volume will be an enabling technology for transitioning the experimental X-51 vehicle to a prompt global strike tactical missile system. The DOD agencies most likely to benefit from this new capability would be the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy. Each of these services has requirements for prompt strike capabilities and platforms that currently deploy similar cruise missile systems. Each of these agencies has been actively investing in hypersonic vehicle research and development programs in their annual budgets.  The sponsoring agency/group for this SBIR program would be the most likely sponsor for the Phase III program. Successful performance on the Phase II should be directly communicated to this customer sponsor and a Phase III plan will be part of the Phase II final review.",

        "abstract": "The increasing need for ground combat forces in diverse theaters of operation and their need to move quickly in difficult terrain has created the requirement for a light weight armor system. Such systems allow for dexterity, ability to bend into distorted positions and allow for combat personnel to take cover in very tight spaces. The currently used rigid armor systems are effective but heavy and also restrict the mobility thereby compromising safety and increasing the vulnerability. Furthermore, most systems today are made with technology that has not evolved or changed over the last 40 years. In this Phase II effort, MMI will build upon its vast experience in nanotechnology and the creation of an armor system that is both comfortable and light weight such that it can provide greater protection and mobility/dexterity to the soldier. A unique armor architecture with a combination of materials has been demonstrated during Phase I that has the possibility of substantially increasing the armor&quot;s ballistic mass efficiency and therefore allowing for a significant reduction of the armor weight.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Organic matrix composite (OMC) structures used in critical areas such as around engine inlets and exhaust wash structures are known to fail through both hygrothermal and oxidative degradation.  Without a reliable means of monitoring the health of these high-temperature composites, degradation can seriously impact an aircraft&quot;s state of readiness.  At the same time, time-based maintenance in which parts are replaced on a schedule whether they need it or not is prohibitively expensive, with some structures seeing an expected service life of 100 hours or less.  TRI/Austin proposes to develop a structural health monitoring (SHM) solution capable of monitoring the health of these high temperature composites in-situ.  In Phase I a prototype SHM system was built and tested at elevated temperatures.  Also, sample OMCs were collected and fatigue tested to failure to study their damage signatures throughout life.  In Phase II, thermal and physical ruggedness of the SHM system will be further improved and its weight reduced; more complex and diverse OMC parts will be tested; algorithms correlating SHM data to time in part life will be developed, automated and installed on the SHM system; and the complete system will be demonstrated.  BENEFIT:  The proposed system permits a shift from conventional time-based maintenance to the more cost-effective condition-based maintenance in which a part is retired only as required.  This in turn may extend the service life of composite parts used around engine inlets, exhaust wash structures, and other critical areas.  Since the failure progression of OMCs are not as well understood as conventional metals, ability to monitor health and assess fitness for service is also an enabling technology for transitioning OMC structures into the fleet.  Applications of this SHM system include composites with resins such as polyimides (AFR-PE-4, MVK-14 FreeForm, 900HT, PMR-II-50, DMBZY-15, PETI series, etc), bismaleimides (BMIs), cyanate esters, phenolics, benzoxazines and phthalonitriles that are reinforced with continuous fibers such as glass, quartz, or carbon/graphite.  Pratt plans to use these composites widely on the F119 and F135 engines used on the F-22 and F-35 aircraft.  General Electric Aircraft Engines is experimenting with using high temperature organic matrix composite structures on F414, GE90 (currently commercial use), F108, and F103 engines.  Specific engine related structures being transitioned to OMCs include ducts, outer flaps, second stage stators, vanes, front frames/inlet cases, center vent tubes, flow bulkheads, air valves, and fan cases.",

        "abstract": "Brownout is the number one operational problem facing military rotorcraft today. Visual obscuration, combined with nose-up attitude during landing, make identification of landing area hazards difficult or impossible. To address this problem, CG2 has proposed a system that combines data from sensors mounted on the lead rotorcraft with telemetry to produce a synthetic vision display that allows a formation of rotorcraft to land safely. The system will generate a virtual scene using geometry extracted from LIDAR data and correlated camera imagery. The rotorcraft telemetry will be used to render a real-time scene that accurately depicts the position and orientation of each ship relative to the terrain, with recommended flight paths to the landing zone. Multiple viewpoints will allow the pilot to assess the landing area from multiple perspectives while landing. The solution will be validated in a simulation environment as well as with real sensors, and be capable of running on ruggedized, embedded hardware. Based on the design concepts proven in Phase I and the validation environment created in the Phase I Option, a prototype will be created during Phase II. The prototype will be tested both in the simulation environment and with a commercial laser sensor.",

Existing detection methods use bulky and expensive laboratory equipment, negating their battlefield use. Colorimetric indicators such as the currently deployed M8 and M9 detection papers are the fastest, cheapest, and easiest type of detector to use; however, these cannot detect vapor form chemical agents, and are highly susceptible to false positives from bug spray, smoke, gasoline and strong bleach. During the Phase I, Lynntech has developed a passive colorimetric sensor array platform, capable of detecting and identifying a variety of organophosphate based nerve agents. The sensor array consists of a combination of different nanoparticles based chemistries and color changing dyes. Sensor elements are capable of detecting CWA surrogates in liquid and aerosol forms, under extreme temperature conditions, have long shelf life, and can detect chemical agent contamination on a variety of surfaces.

However, they show high noise, and thus need to be cooled down to&lt;80 K to reduce the noise.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  SA Photonics FALCON Space Situational Awareness (SSA) cueing system provides long range detection of space objects objects to enable rapid and high accuracy cueing of counter measures.  FALCON incorporates world class digital low light passive sensing coupled with high performance image processing to enable long range detection of very small space objects.  The passive sensors cue a very high performance fiber laser source LIDAR system to precisely determine range and range-rate of the objects.  The information from the LIDAR system then can be used to rapidly cue countermeasures. The passive and active sensors are co-aligned into a compact package.    FALCON enables detection of space objects as small as 4 inches at ranges up to 200 km for clustered space objects.  For isolated spaced objects against a slow moving star field, detection is achieved at ranges greater than 400 km.  FALCON utilizes several key technologies including our BeamDirector beam steering solution which provides high accuracy beam pointing with full hemispherical coverage.  Coupled with our innovative and compact Origami Optics,  high resolution low noise sensor and advanced image processing techniques, FALCON provides unsurpassed detection capabilities for long distance space objects.  BENEFIT:  The flexibility of the FALCON system allows it to be applicable to multiple military applications. Those noted in this proposal include multiple satellite, airborne, and naval platforms as well as ground based applications.  FALCON provides long range situational awareness in a compact, low power form factor allowing for use applications where traditional systems cannot be used.  FALCON will then enable the enhanced protection of American assets by enabling early detection of potential incidents allowing effective counter measures to be taken.",

        "abstract": "In this Phase II SBIR project, NexTech Materials will continue development of high power density solid oxide fuel cell power systems for ship-service applications. The system being developed is based on planar stacks of NexTech&quot;s proprietary FlexCells, which offer unprecedented sulfur tolerance (simplifying the use of JP-8 as a fuel) and scalability to very large areas (making it feasible to build stacks with 500+ kW power outputs). In Phase I of this project, NexTech completed preliminary designs of a JP-8 fueled 500-kW SOFC power plant and a high power density SOFC stack that is core to this power plant. In Phase II of the project, NexTech proposes further development of its NexTech&quot;s large-area stack technology to validate the design principles of the 500-kW scale stack design established in Phase I. Work in the project will focus on testing of large-area FlexCells under conditions specific to ship-service power applications, design and modeling of large-area SOFC stacks, fabrication and testing of stacks made with large-area FlexCells, and delivery of a stack to NAVSEA for demonstration testing.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The objective of this Phase II program is to develop a battery operated, combat identification beacon (CID Beacon) technology that is compact and can be worn on the warfighter as part of standard gear.  The CID beacon will project a high brightness beam across a hemisphere allowing standard pods on military aircraft (Blackhawk, Apache, etc.) to detect and identify friendly troops on the ground.  This laser based beacon technology will allow the warfighter to project his position for long ranges up to 15-20 km.  The Aerius Photonics CID beacon will be ruggedized for warfighter use and the hardware delivered to the customer at the end of the program.  BENEFIT:  The anticipated benefits of the technology are a reduction in SWaP and cost for a commercial grade system that is suitable for law enforcement, security, and search and rescue.  A comparable device does not currently exist.  The CID laser beacon to be developed has many applications in defense and other markets. In addition to Department of Defense customers, the product would also be of use to police forces, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Coast Guard. During Phase II, Aerius will approach Prime DoD suppliers, as well as suppliers to police forces, DHS and the Coast Guard to establish sales and distribution channels addressing these markets. Early discussions with two Prime DoD suppliers, BAE Systems and Northrop Grumman have already taken place.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Thermal barrier coatings are currently employed to thermally protect gas turbine engine components from high gas inlet temperatures to improve the performance (fuel efficiency and thrust) of these engines.  Enhanced benefits are envisioned in future TBC systems if TBC&quot;s reliability and durability can be improved. One approach to achieve more reliable TBCs is the development of non destructive methodologies to determine processing / structure / property relationships for electron beam-physical vapor deposited (EB-PVD) thermal barrier coatings (TBC) in both an ex-situ and in-situ manner. This would enable the creation of comprehensive process maps that could be used along with real time feedback during manufacturing to greatly enhance the capabilities of an EB-PVD system to reliably produce high quality TBC coatings. To achieve this, Directed Vapor Technologies International (DVTI) and Reliacoat Technologies (RCT) will investigate the use of a curvature measurement technique to non-destructively determine critical, design related mechanical properties of EB-PVD deposited coatings and link these properties to processing parameters and coating performance. In Phase I, the apparatus and relevant analysis had been successfully demonstrated. In Phase II, the applicability of this approach will be demonstrated for in-situ testing to establish advanced process maps for EB-PVD based TBC processing techniques.  BENEFIT:  This research is anticipated to establish advanced process maps for EB-PVD based TBC processing techniques utilizing novel non-destructive ex-situ and in-situ curvature measurement approaches. The research will enable tighter lifetime distributions and aid the development of advanced TBC coating systems which will result in more reliable and durable TBC coatings. These developments significantly increase the potential for TBC coatings to become prime reliant which would result in much greater gas turbine engine performance.  This would help enable the realization of advanced gas turbine engine designs while leading to several percent thrust improvement or specific fuel consumption reduction for current turbine engines. These advances will not only benefit military engines, but also commercial and industrial gas turbines. In addition, the innovative approach proposed here will reduce the time and expense for refurbishing and repairing blades during engine overhauls, thus improving military readiness and reducing the cost of maintaining commercial aircraft. The demonstration of such novel concepts may also be applied to other functional coatings, such as environmental barrier coatings and damping coatings where reliability is also critical.",

To a large degree, this results from the need for power and low noise amplifiers at each antenna element. A promising alternative architecture shares the amplifiers among many elements and thus requires a phase shifter at each element. This choice imposes challenging power handling and insertion loss requirements on the phase shifter. Ferrite phase shifters offer low loss and high power handling capability but are bulky, heavy and power consuming. In this proposal, the development of microstrip ferrite phase shifters that exhibit low loss (10 W), and tuning with low magnetic fields is pursued. In parallel, low power drivers (",

The window manufacturing concept pursued in this project presents a solution to the Navy&quot;s need for durable, monolithic, infrared-transmitting sensor windows with target areas up to 80x80x1.3 cm (31.5&quot;x31.5&quot;x0.512&quot;) for reconnaissance purposes. The size of monolithic windows is presently limited by crystal growing equipment used to make sapphire, and by the availability of large hot pressing and hot isostatic pressing equipment for spinel or AlON. The alternative approach pursued by MER in this project is to scale up MER&quot;s standard window processes to produce strong, monolithic windows as large as 45.72 cm x55.88 cm x1.3 cm (18&quot;x22&quot;x0.512&quot;) during Phase I, to be scaled up to and to 80 cm x80 cm x1.3 cm during Phase II and Phase III.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  5-D has developed an approach, leveraging modified commercial technology, to add a modern high speed network to legacy aircraft using only existing aircraft wiring. With this design implementation, existing aircraft wiring will become dual purpose (original use along with high bandwidth data), resulting in a cost-effective upgrade applicable to thousands of aircraft worldwide. In the Phase I program, 5-D proved the concept for adapting HomePlug AV (Audio/Video) technology, the leading standard for broadband-over-power line (BOPL) networking worldwide, to the aircraft environment to enable high bandwidth network communication via existing aircraft wiring.  In Phase II, 5-D will develop prototype units and demonstrate operation of these units in an actual aircraft, as well as develop a roadmap to commercialization for the new capability.  Our commercialization plan is to immediately (following Phase II) apply the new technology as a temporary installation to support military aircraft system testing (including flight data systems, weapon systems, and payloads) and then progress the application to permanent operational aircraft applications.  The most significant benefit of our technology is that it enables high bandwidth data to be passed through an aircraft without significant modification efforts normally associated with removing panels and installing and routing wiring.  BENEFIT:  This program will develop a product and service to easily add a high-speed network, suitable for video transport and other high bandwidth applications, using only existing wiring in the targeted platform.  Installing additional wiring in legacy aircraft is very costly and time consuming, so this technology could significantly reduce the effort required to implement desirable upgrades.  This technology allows JHMCS and other modern upgrades to be easily implemented in legacy aircraft, thus extending their useful life.    This technology has the potential to gain a real foothold in the aviation marketplace as a low-cost, low-impact, and reliable upgrade to existing aircraft. 5-D plans to make this offering an easy upgrade decision for a significant percentage of aircraft systems worldwide. In addition, the technology is applicable to many other types of platforms that we have not yet assessed as markets including: military and civil ground vehicles like large tanks and automobiles, naval applications, and industrial communications.",

The resulting prime power and cooling needs have a significant impact on radar weight, volume, and cost and in turn can drive platform design. Power amplifier (PA) inefficiencies are the driving factor for transmitter inefficiencies and improvements in PA efficiency will provide significant radar and platform benefits. In radar systems with a large receive duty cycle, power consumption of the low-noise amplifier (LNA) is also critical for system efficiency.      Auriga is proposing innovative C-band GaN PA and LNA MMICs that will significantly improve the efficiency of phased array radar systems. Auriga&quot;s gallium nitride (GaN) PA will achieve a power added efficiency (PAE) significantly greater than gallium arsenide (GaAs) MMIC PAs used in existing transmit systems. LNA power consumption will be reduced since the GaN LNA will achieve the same OIP3 as a GaAs LNA with smaller device periphery and less DC power. The GaN LNA will remove the need for a limiter in front of the LNA due to its high breakdown voltage. Removing the limiter reduces the noise figure of the receiver.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The reduction of aerodynamic/hydrodynamic noise caused by violent turbulence is of strategic importance to many military systems. These include modern fighter jets, unmanned weapons with sensitive electronics, and surface and underwater vessels. For all these systems, aerodynamic or hydrodynamic noise can produce unacceptable levels of operational loads or acoustic vibrations, or be detrimental to their stealth. The reduction of aerodynamic noise is also of major importance to civilian transport systems. In the commercial airplane industry, reducing airframe noise improves the habitability of the passenger cabin. In the automobile and tire industries, deadening structure-borne noise arising from the rolling of tires increases the driving comfort of vehicles. In all automotive industries, reducing aerodynamic noise offers a commercial advantage and contributes to addressing environmental concerns and meeting noise certification regulations. For these reasons, there is a pressing need today for a multidisciplinary computational tool capable of predicting accurately, reliably, and yet rapidly aeroacoustic loads and vibrations. To this effect, this Phase II SBIR focuses on integrating within the AERO Suite of Codes the novel, multiscale, multidisciplinary aeroacoustic computational technology with a reduced-order modeling capability conceived during Phase I of this effort, and maturing its application to aircraft configurations with open bay doors.  BENEFIT:  The anticipated benefits of this effort include a state-of-the-art, comprehensive, and most importantly practical computational technology for the highly accurate aeroacoustic-structural analysis of full aircraft configurations involving open bay doors and external stores in the subsonic, transonic, and supersonic regimes. This computational technology will be seamlessly integrated in the AERO Suite of Codes deployed at the Edwards Air Force Base. Consequently, it will boost the potential of the AERO simulation platform for commercialization in the aircraft and automobile industries, among others, where noise reduction offers a commercial advantage, particularly in the luxury segments of the markets, and where addressing environmental concerns and noise certification regulations is becoming critical.",

The proposed Portable Array Module (PAM) meets this need, promising a new age of sustainable clean energy production and portability in situations where highly reliable energy sources must be established and maintained within a very short timeframe. Within PAM, power is generated by thin film photovoltaic solar cells that are deployed rapidly using a unique deployable composite array structure. Every PAM power system stows within a single ruggedized canister for easy transport to the desired location. Once on site PAM power modules unroll in a matter of seconds. Batteries and the necessary electronics to condition the power as it comes off the array can be located inside the ruggedized transport canister, or at a centralized hub.",

        "abstract": "Vector-borne diseases plague hundreds of millions of people worldwide, including U.S. soldiers who operate abroad. To reduce the impact of vector-borne diseases on military operations, the Military employs the arthropod repellent system, which combines a permethrin-treated uniform with the use of DEET repellent on exposed skin. Since the number of permethrin-resistant arthropods is increasing, it is necessary to develop factory-treated uniforms that incorporate insect repellents other than permethrin. TDA Research, Inc. proposes to develop novel, long-lasting non-permethrin insect repellent formulations and the techniques needed to apply them to military clothing. We will test the new formulations on fabric for both the standard Army Combat Uniform (ACU) and the Fire Retardant ACU, which has proved difficult to treat with previous formulations. We will measure the efficacy and durability of the improved treated fabric.",

The proposed Phase II SBIR program is aimed at developing new cryogenic insulations for passive thermal control, resulting in zero boil-off storage of cryogens.  The passive thermal control will serve to limit the heat leak into the cryogenic storage system.  The proposed technology is expected to increase reliability, increase cryogenic system performance, and is capable of being made flight qualified for the flight systems and to meet Exploration Systems mission requirements.   We will continue to use the technical approaches that have shown tremendous potential during the successful Phase I effort.  Our key approach will be based on the development, fabrication, and characterization of organic-inorganic hybrid nanocomposite microfoams.  In the Phase I program, we successfully demonstrated the feasibility of fabrication of these new foams with significantly improved morphology and thermo-mechanical properties.  The proposed approach will utilize environmentally friendly blowing agents.   The closed cell structure of these novel foams will prevent the occurrence of cryopumping.

This proposed system is based on a new dry powder formulation and a novel design of an inhaler that uses mature components developed in-house. POC&quot;s innovations in the nanocarrier (NC) construct and in the design of the inhaler make it possible to deliver a single dose with the MATEN during one deep and slow inspiration. The MATEN enhances the bioavailability for antisense therapeutics that is necessary for the prophylaxes and early treatment of warfighters against emerging bio-warfare threats. Its formulation is stable at ambient temperature, minimizes the potential for introducing immunogenic materials, reduces the bulk and complexity of dispensing, and directly addresses the requirements of the Transformational Medical Technologies Initiative (TMTI) program. In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of the MATEN by demonstrating product stability and establishing enhanced bioavailability in an animal model. In Phase II, POC will optimize candidate formulation for maximum bioavailability and conduct initial pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in an animal model.",

After development is complete, a pilot study will be conducted to assess the feasibility, usability, and the promise of the technology for promoting students' social skills and reducing negative behaviors. Data will be collected from approximately 300 students in 12 classrooms over 2 months. Half of the classrooms will use the product to supplement standard classroom instruction while the other half will continue with normal practices. Teacher and student measures will be collected before and after implementation.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Purpose: With national attention on the shortage of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) professionals, enrollment in science is expected to be on the rise in the years to come. Laboratory work is seen as an essential part of many STEM courses, because labs enable students to interact with natural phenomena and analyze collected data. Funding adequate labs, however, has become a challenge and many schools indicate they are not well equipped for laboratory science. It is estimated that a single classroom physics lab can cost $40,000 to $55,000, with an additional annual replacement and repair budget of $2,000 to $3,000. The purpose of this project is to develop a set of cost-effective and maintenance free web-based virtual labs that can fully replace or supplement hands-on labs in a typical high school physics course.\n\nProject Activities: The research team is developing all content and components for 24 virtual labs on topics such as displacement, velocity, acceleration of gravity, kinematics, and Newton's second law. In order to test the feasibility of implementing the technology in schools, the usability of the technology by high school students, and the promise of the product to improve student learning, a randomized trial will be conducted with 120 physics students from six classrooms in three high schools. The groups will be assigned to one of three treatments. One group of students will use the virtual labs as a replacement to traditional labs; one group will use the virtual labs as a supplement to a traditional hands-on lab experience; and one will be used as a control and will complete traditional hands-on labs only. Analyses will examine students' performance on a standardized physics exam before and after a semester long course.\n\n",

        "abstract": "It is well known that the brain is the organ most sensitive to ischemia/hypoxia. Noninvasive continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow autoregulation, cerebrovascular reactivity and related phenomena such as cerebral vasospams in combat casualties could guide clinicians/medics in adjusting the strategy of resuscitation and acute care, and therefore contribute to a substantially improved survival and functional outcome. In Phase I we developed a small (3.5 x 2.5 x 0.7 in), light-weight (&lt;4oz), battery powered and hand-portable 3-channel monitor that combines electro- and rheoencephalography (EEG and REG). While REG detects changes in cerebral vascular bed, EEG can be used to detect post-traumatic non-convulsive seizures or reversible breakdown of the synaptic transmission. The monitor can transfer the data in real time via either a Bluetooth link or standard USB connection. The monitor also has sufficient memory to store the raw data from&gt;300 hours of recording.   In Phase II we propose to ruggedize the Phase I monitor so to make it truly field-deployable, and to in part directly organize, and in part support, a number of animal and human studies (including a study on TBI patients) that should provide evidence of the efficacy of the monitor.",

For successful implementation of these coatings on ship-deck surfaces, it is critical ensure that coating deposition is optimized to eliminate&quot;extrinsic&quot;defects such as porosity, cracks and delamination and to prevent their occurrence during service. Of further importance is maintaining the amorphous structure within the coating both as-deposited and in-service. For effective implementation of non-destructive coating examination tools, correlations are envisaged through this SBIR partnership between intrinsic coating characteristics (residual stresses, modulus, adhesion) and potential monitoring tools such as infrared thermal imaging tomography. ReliaCoat will benchmark NDE tools by first employing its in situ coating property sensor to characterize key features of optimized and non-optimized coatings (including its evolution) and subject  them to a battery of NDE tests so that the most appropriate system can be selected. The coatings will also be subjected to accelerate laboratory degradation and reanalyzed to determine the measurement sensitivity on degraded coatings. A frame work for implementation on ship deck will also be developed.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In Phase I, CFDRC examined concepts for thrust management of a SRM that moved the nozzle relative to a fixed pintle.  A binary high/low thrust motor operating mode was selected and a heavy-wall test bed that used the pressure from the chamber to move the nozzle back and forth was demonstrated.  A simple, inexpensive pneumatic valve provided the only actuation required.  In Phase II, CFDRC proposes to design, build and test a hot-fire version of this binary-mode motor that will demonstrate sustained operation of the motor using a quasi-realistic propellant.  The testing will also provide data for validation of a transient simulation tool to be developed during the program that will aid in integration of the technology for future missile systems.  CFDRC has secured interest in this activity from Raytheon, ATK and MEI, and from various DoD program offices.  In Phase III, this motor will be available to the Air Force, Navy and/or Army labs for additional firings using military production propellants.  CFDRC plans to transition this technology to a second stage version of the Navy SM-6 missile, where CFDRC&quot;s thrust management capability will increase the terminal phase footprint and promote increased agility.  Upgraded versions of the Army NLOS-PAM and the Air Force HARM missions are also immediate Phase III opportunities.  BENEFIT:  The benefit of on-demand thrust modulation of an SRM in a robust, low-cost form will be applicable to a number of missile systems within multiple DoD agencies.  Besides the Navy&quot;s SM-6 upper stage, the Army has pursued this technology for most of a decade, almost incorporating it into its NLOS-PAM missile program.  Once the approach outlined in this proposal has been validated, CFDRC will work with SRM primes such as ATK to transition this technology to the field.  CFDRC will benefit commercially through license revenue and subcontracts with the system and propulsion prime contractors as this technology is adapted to fielded and future systems.",

The implication of TBI related injuries on the fighting force is that unit readiness is slowed as a result of diminished soldier reaction time and behavioral issues that may reduce the soldier&quot;s responsiveness.  Current methods of TBI diagnosis vary from low-tech physical examinations that scale the extent of injury based on motor skills, verbal response, and eye opening, to high tech CT scans, brain MRI&quot;s and EEG&quot;s.  These tools can provide valuable information regarding the assessment of a patients TBI yet they lack the capability to precisely define and quantify the actual intensity of the injury sustained, especially in the case of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).  This proposal concerns the development of a new method for evaluating TBI based on self administered non-invasive imaging of the retina [2, 7-9].  The approach is aligned with the growing consensus within the TBI community that it may be possible to correlate TBI with eye injury sequelae.  If successfully developed, the proposed method is expected to provide the US military with a new TBI diagnostic capability for combat deployment.",

It is ideally suited to act as an ISTF for DRFM testing, but to do so must have a means of providing coaxially-injected RF signals with real time emulation of range delay to distances of 27,000 nautical miles (Nmi) without degradation of the signals.

        "abstract": "An inflatable habitat is a pressure vessel with flexible shell. Notable features such as low weight, large inflated operational volume, and small pre-deployment volume offer significant advantages over traditional rigid metallic and composite habitat structures. Conventional designs suffer from indeterminacy of load sharing between meridional and circumferential members as well as the internally rigid metal support structure. The designs must functionally index the meridional and circumferential members to one another to minimize sensitivity to manufacturing, handling and operational trauma, all the while maintaining their independent load carrying roles. This design process results in oversized members to account for load uncertainties and substantially increases the handling, manufacturing, and integration risks.  The unique Ultra High Performance Vessel (UHPV) technology provides the solution to the design and manufacture of robust inflatable structures with exceptional accuracy and dimensional stability. UHPV technology provides high shell load containment architecture with fully determinate load pathways that can be modeled mathematically. The lightweight, low cost inflatable fabric structure, consisting of barrier film layers, carrier cloth containment layers, and pressure restraint tendons can be designed and fabricated to provide an accurate geometry without the need for an internal skeletal frame. Eliminating the need for a rigid internal load-bearing frame allows the collapsed inflatable to be packaged in the smallest possible volume. To bring this innovative inflatable design to use for surface habitats, airlocks and myriad other space environment and containment applications, a verification and validation plan using both testing and predictive analytical models is proposed to conclusively demonstrate that the fully load-determinate UHPV can meet all structural design requirements thereby allowing for decreased mass and risk.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The use of sealants in aircraft assembly and outer mold line (OML) repair is widespread.  Sealants are used to wet-install fasteners, for sealing overlapping (faying) surfaces, for butt joints between panels, and for seam (fillet) sealing.  Aerospace sealants are typically two-component polysulfide or polythioether compositions that can cure by oxidation or by crosslinking with epoxides, and require several hours to cure to a tack-free state.    These long tack-free times are especially costly for OEM manufacture and repair of aircraft in terms of delayed cure.  The ideal sealant would exhibit a long open time and then cure on-demand within a short period of time.  In the Phase I, Luna has demonstrated the feasibility of a novel cure-on-demand chemistry with long open time and rapid cure.  The Phase I also established that a cure-on-demand conductive sealant can achieve excellent post-cure performance in terms of elongation, resistivity, fluid resistance, and adhesion.  During the proposed Phase II effort, Luna will continue to improve on this sealant material to fit the AF needs for rapid cure time in a high performance sealant.  Luna will also address issues related to sealant application, scale-up, and commercialization/technology transfer.  BENEFIT:  The primary commercial application resulting from this program would be a conductive cure-on-demand sealant, that will dramatically decrease the time needed to cure sealants during OEM and repair activities.  This sealant could potentially serve as a gap filler on a wide variety of aircraft joints and seams for both military and commercial aircraft.  In addition, the resin chemistry developed under this program could also be extended to a wide family of cure-on-demand sealants, adhesives, and coatings.",

Under our Phase I SBIR work, we have developed and validated a self-starting inward-turning scramjet inlet concept and created a coupled CFD/thermal design and analysis capability.  Our Phase II plan involves the design, fabrication, and testing of a large-scale flight-weight scramjet inlet 6ft in length.  Due to the expected development and fabrication costs of the scramjet inlet, we are proposing structural and wind tunnel testing Program Options outside of the scope of the Main Program budget.  To accomplish these Program Options, we have identified interest and potential external funding sources within the AFRL Air Vehicles Directorate and NASA Langley for respective structural and aerodynamic experimental validation programs. Details for these Options have also been included within the proposal to facilitate directorate and agency discussion and coordination once an award is made.  BENEFIT:  At the end of a successful Phase I and Phase II program, the GHI team will possess integrated aerodynamic, structural, and thermal design, optimization, and manufacturing capabilities for large scale hot-structure scramjet inlets. These capabilities will be directly extendible to include other major scramjet components such as combustors, nozzles, fuselages, and control surfaces. These tools will combine efficient CFD solvers, sensitivity solvers, grid and surface generators, thermal and structural solvers, and optimization algorithms into one very advanced high-fidelity design tool. In addition, the Phase I and Phase II program will generate a much broader understanding of the self-starting inlet technology and robust inlet operability, which we believe is crucial to the future of scramjet flight as a whole. Furthermore, the incorporation of high-temperature nickel-based and refractory material manufacturing techniques and processes into the design cycle will reduce both initial design costs and final production costs, and streamline the overall design-to-flight process from start to finish.",

The novel device introduces the key benefit of the thin-multilayer piezoelectric technology to meet the current needs of fuze electronics (i.e. high capacitance, low output voltage and high energy density) while providing a robust package to eliminate handling effects and facilitate the integration with the fuze electronics. During Phase I we have assessed and demonstrated the feasibility and benefits of the novel SPG technology. Proof-of-concept models and experimental data have proven the feasibility of meeting the energy density goals of the program, i.e. 40mJ/cm3, using optimization of existing technologies and futuristic designs. Phase II objective is to deliver a robust, design optimized, TM-SPG to meet Armys smart fuzing requirements for 25mm to 40mm caliber ammunition. Safety will be demonstrated by testing the unit under the MIL-STD-331 requirements.",

        "abstract": "Efficient and effective operation of a communications satellite constellation involves health and safety assurance as well as high-performance operations execution. Interruption to service or loss of satellite functionality can result in compromised mission objectives. It is essential for Network Management Facilities (NMF) and Space Operations Centers (SOC) to have the ability to quickly respond and recover from any satellite abnormality. As satellite systems advance in complexity with increased bandwidth capabilities, more effort is required to detect, trend, communicate, coordinate, and respond to changes in a satellite&quot;s state of health. Our proposed MUOS Status And Reporting Tools (MOSART) program builds on TDKC&quot;s previous Satellite Threat Evaluation Environment (STEED) Phase II SBIR effort where we researched and prototyped critical satellite status and monitoring tools for constellations managed at the Air Force (AF) Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC). Under this Phase II.5 effort, TDKC will extend our previous research and adapt our core User Definable Operation Picture (UDOP) software to support status monitoring of the Navy&quot;s Mobile User Object System (MUOS). We will also adapt our decision support and satellite visualization tools to provide a much needed, ground-based situation awareness of the MUOS Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) network.",

MRLIN&quot;s original impedance spectroscopy probe design and innovative algorithm for performing impedance spectroscopy enables MRLIN to directly probe the contamination of the active carbon material, with increased accuracy, without the undue complications of readout electronics. This development, as a result, offers a novel system for assessing the residual life of sorbent-based air purification systems that are integrable into collective protection (ColPro) systems. In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of MRLIN approach by developing and testing a proof-of-concept prototype capable of evaluating the exposure of carbon to reactive gases and heavy hydrocarbons.

Navy sonar systems used in undersea warfare would benefit from these materials in providing more compact and efficient sensors with increased bandwidth and sensitivity.

One of the hurdles yet to be fully overcome are fabrication issues involving the use of PiezoCrystal materials in high frequency transducers.  The objective of the proposed Phase II effort is to continue development and demonstration reliable cost-effective methods of assembling PiezoCrystal materials into high performance SONAR transducers suitable for Navy applications. The development of such processes decreases the upfront cost and the programmatic risk of implementing high performance PiezoCrystal transducer designs for Navy fleet applications. Techniques to be investigated include electrode application, dicing, and curved transducer fabrication.   The NAVY platform targeted for demonstration is an Expanded Real Aperture Sonar (ERAS).

Phase II is directed toward greatly extending measurement capabilities with parallel development of a prototype read out system and sensor assemblies that will allow the system to be widely fielded and commercialized. The speed of the initial prototype will allow detection of events with rise times of approximately 3 to 5 ns over length of 135 mm. Extensions of sensor capabilities will allow sensing over longer lengths and the fundamentals of the system allow high speeds to be obtained. The initial target operational speed is chosen to result in the highest possible signal to noise level while retaining cost effectiveness by accessing commerically available detectors and amplifiers. The Phase I read out system had a dynamic range up to approximately 1,500,000 psi with sensor assemblies surviving pressures that are estimated to exceed 4,000,000 psi. The Phase II read out system will be designed to extend the read out range to 4,000,000 psi and greatly enhance the ability to separate out pressure and temperature measurements that were demonstrated but limited during Phase I feasiblity demonstrations.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  With increased focus on development of highly capable Nanosat satellites and missions, innovations in spacecraft system design and architecture that yield high performance, modular and multi-function systems will enhance Air Force mission capability and flexibility.  SWAP constraints in NanoSats necessitate this system approach to result in significant increases in spacecraft performance and mission capability within a highly responsive and lower cost NanoSat plug-n-play environment. An area of considerable development opportunity and need to enable Air Force NanoSat missions is to increase available continuous power significantly, to lower costs and to further leverage this capability to effectively de-orbit the spacecraft at end-of-life.    MMA Design LLC proposes to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in NanoSat S/C power systems by developing and delivering a High Watts per Kilogram (HaWK) Advanced Power and De-orbit Module (APDM) with a modular and scalable PnP architecture that is initially optimized for a CubeSat 3U configuration.  It consists of an innovative deployable solar array and de-orbit system combined with a single-axis dual-wing sun tracking gimbal assembly.  The significance to the AFRL of our innovative solution is that it allows the S/C to maintain high power while freeing the mission instruments to track an area of interest, thus improving mission utility and capability.  BENEFIT:  Potential benefits and impacts to the Air Force NanoSat missions include:  1. Space Situational Awareness  sun tracking allows the S/C to maintain high continuous power while simultaneously freeing the mission instruments to track an AOI, thus improving mission capability and utility.  2. Mission ISR data and quality can increase with increases in power capabilities and performance.    3. Maximizing the utility of the available volume by combining the functions of solar power and de-orbiting into one robust deployable system.  4. Rapid development and maturation of innovative power technologies leading to low cost solutions that is adaptable and scalable to other AFRL applications.  5. Advancement of key deployable and steerable solar array technologies to overcome current NanoSat S/C and mission limitations.  6. A modular and scalable system design that is multi-functional, solving mission needs consistent with a plug-n-play framework.  7. A low mass and volume system to maximize the mass/volume available for payloads.  8. De-orbit capability ensures reduction in future space debris and available orbital slots.  9.

In this proposal we introduce an optical sensor for measurements of mean skin friction on large models that operates in water. This sensor is based on the diffusion of a fluorescent dye from a polymer film into the water, a mass transfer sensor. Mass transfer is determined by monitoring the rate of dye diffusion from the film and applying a numerical model to the transient mass transfer process. This technique has been demonstrated qualitatively by detecting flow separation and reattachment on an airfoil model in the 12-inch water tunnel at Penn State University. Quantitative measurements of skin friction were conducted on a turbulent boundary layer with a Reynolds number of over 7-million. These results indicated an absolute accuracy of the system was better that 8%. In the Phase II effort, a captive model data acquisition system will be designed and tested. The focus of the program is to deploy the system in the NSWC tow tanks for testing on large models.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Over-the-Horizon radar (OTHR) uses ionospheric reflection to propagate HF transmissions to long range (~500-5000 km).  The ionosphere is a dynamic&quot;mirror&quot;that varies diurnally, seasonally, and with the solar cycle.  Geolocation of targets observed by OTHR, (Coordinate Registration; CR), requires accurate real-time ionospheric modeling and HF propagation calculations to convert radar-measured target signal delays and beam steers to geographical position.  In Phase I NWRA merged the backscatter ionogram (BI) leading edge inversion algorithm CREDO with NWRA&quot;s more advanced ionospheric data assimilation capability, GPSII.  In Phase II we will incorporate additional CREDO capabilities into GPSII, including using multi-hop leading and trailing edge BI data.  CREDO&quot;s ability to utilize radar returns from Known Reference Points (KRPs) will be extended to allow utilization of forward oblique ionograms.  This extended version of GPSII will be validated against real data.  For this validation, we intend to use a comprehensive Australian set of ionospheric measurements (the DINIS data) provided to us through the US/Australian Radar Agreement. This set includes multiple vertical, oblique, and backscatter ionograms.  Finally, we will develop an implementation package for the new CR capability that is user friendly and on a par with those we have previously developed for CREDO and GPSII.  BENEFIT:  The incorporation of additional ionospheric data beyond conventional OTHR vertical and oblique backscatter soundings is expected to improve the fidelity of real-time ionosphere models, resulting in improved OTHR Coordinate Registration metric accuracy.  The Next Generation OTH Radar (NGOTHR) is expected to have the additional benefit of elevation information in its backscatter soundings, and this can be incorporated in our solution method for additional fidelity.  Furthermore, because GPSII uses a non-radar-centric coordinate system, a single self-consistent ionosphere model can be developed for multiple OTH radars in the same region.  This will result in consistent CR of targets in overlapping coverage areas and ensure smooth track continuity as targets move from one radar&quot;s coverage to another.  Improved CR metric accuracy will enhance the applicability of OTHR as a wide area surveillance asset for Air Force and Homeland Security applications with dramatic cost savings over alternative microwave radar solutions.",

A strain monitoring system that is simple, unobtrusive, and highly reliable would be invaluable to the Navy for assessing the health of their vessels. To provide this capability, in Phase I McQ proposed the development of the strain acquisition and monitoring system (SAMS). SAMS consists of a scalable network of distributed miniature data acquisition modules that acquire, condition, and digitize strain signals. Each acquisition module consists of a strain sensor, signal conditioning, and digital signal acquisition electronics integrated onto a miniature printed circuit board (PCB). The modules are capable of transmitting the digitized data over a communications bus back to a data monitor to be viewed, recorded, and/or analyzed by a user in real time. The data monitor not only serves as an interface to the strain data but as a command and control center for the network of acquisition modules. It makes it possible to enable and disable individual modules, as well as configure the rate at which each module samples and reports the acquired strain data. The SAMS will serve as a high performance structural health monitoring system that can capture and record a high fidelity strain history over the lifetime of a ship.",

        "abstract": "To address the U.S. Army need for a hand-held, field-usable assay capable of diagnosing rickettsial disease in sick soldiers to aid early treatment with the appropriate antibiotic, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to complete the development of a new Rickettsiae Detection Dipstick (RDD). The RDD is a hand-held device based on a combination of lateral-flow immunochromatography technology and lab-on-chip principles. The RDD assay will rapidly (10 min) distinguish rickettsia antigens/pathogens in the spotted fever group (SFG) from typhus group (TG) in a blood sample. The RDD will be inexpensive, portable, and easy to use in a one-step protocol with at least 85% of the sensitivity and 85% of the specificity of current gold-standard assays. The device will use heat-stable reagents, have no special storage requirements, and require no power to operate. In Phase I POC demonstrated the feasibility of the RDD device by fabricating a prototype and demonstrating its capability to identify and differentiate inactivated rickettsia from SFG and TG spiked into porcine blood at concentrations",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The technical objective of this program is to develop a fast running, subgrid scale turbulence-chemistry interaction model for large-eddy simulation (LES) of aircraft combustors and augmentors that can accurately capture critical phenomena such as extinction and re-ignition effects.  To accurately capture these phenomena, this model is based upon a parameterization of the linear-eddy model (LEM).  The LEM is a comprehensive mixing model that separately treats molecular diffusion, small scale turbulent stirring and finite-rate kinetics.  Because the model resolves the microscale flame structure, extinction and re-ignition may be accurately captured.  Under this program, statistics from this mixing model will be parameterized to form a computationally inexpensive run time model.  This parameterization will be accomplished through a unique application of the LEM to a flow configuration designed to capture mean or resolved scale strain effects on the subgrid statistics.  Consequently, this novel modeling approach may be used to predict turbulent extinction limits by directly accounting for both small and large scale turbulent strain effects.  Parameterized statistics generated from this formulation are then stored using artificial neural networks (ANNs).  The resulting computational model is a fast running subroutine to provide closure for the LES filtered transport equations that is portable to any CFD flow solver.  The model subroutines, or user defined functions, for this formulation may be generated using a software tool kit developed in this program given user specified conditions.  These user defined functions may be easily implemented within any CFD flow solver for LES applications.  The software tool kit will also be able to generate RANS flow solver user defined functions with only minor changes to the input parameters.  Combustion models generated by the tool kit will be applicable to a wide range of military and commercial combustion applications.  These applications include gas turbines, power generation systems, furnaces, incinerators, internal combustion engines, etc.  BENEFIT:  At the conclusion of this program, CRAFT Tech will have completed the development of an advanced turbulent combustion subgrid model for LES of reacting flows.  This effort involves the development of a generalized software tool kit for the generation of user defined functions (UDFs) for specified combustion problems.  These UDFs may be easily implemented within any CFD flow solver for LES applications.  The software tool kit will also be able to generate RANS flow solver UDFs with only minor changes in the input parameters.  Combustion models generated by the tool kit will be applicable to a wide range of military and commercial combustion applications.  These applications include gas turbines, power generation systems, furnaces, incinerators, internal combustion engines, etc.  The commercial opportunities for this software tool kit are enormous.  CRAFT Tech will market this tool kit for license to commercial customers as well as to other CFD flow solver development companies.  Since the UDFs generated by the tool kit will be flow solver independent and completely portable, customers of other CFD flow solver development companies may use the tool kit for their applications.  With this goal in mind, the software tool kit was developed to produce UDFs that are compatible with popular commercial flow solvers that are used for a broad range of applications. This fact greatly expands the commercial opportunities of the software tool kit.",

Consequently, there is extreme interest in developing accurate Battery Management Systems (BMS) to take advantage of the positive attributes of lithium-based chemistries without sacrificing flexibility and safety. However, the lack of proper BMS standardization and inaccurate state estimation algorithms have hampered the widespread adoption of lithium chemistries in spite of their advantages. During Phase I we established the feasibility of our approach to overcome this problem. We demonstrated that (1) we can provide State of Charge estimation accuracy to within 2 to 3%; (2) we can utilize existing life cycle data from battery manufacturers to estimate State of Health and State of Life; (3) we have a workable concept for BMS firmware which can support these algorithms; and (4) we have established an outstanding teaming arrangement and implementation plan for Phase II and Phase III. During Phase II we will complete development and conduct field testing using typical lithium ion battery packs and U.S. Army combat vehicles with our commercialization partners. We project a TRL 6 by the end of Phase II.",

To meet these needs, this SBIR Phase II project focuses on developing and field testing a passive, wireless microwave acoustic sensor system for turbine engines, capable of monitoring temperature and pressure on rotating parts in real-time.  During Phase I, Environetix Technologies Corporation demonstrated the performance of prototype wireless microwave acoustic temperature sensors in a high temperature lab environment, including demonstration of stable operation at to 1200F. The sensor system is based on University of Maine patented technology, consisting of microwave acoustic devices fabricated using stable high temperature films and substrates and also proprietary sensor attachment methodology, and is licensed to Environetix for further product development and commercialization.  This Phase II project will advance a temperature and pressure wireless sensor system into a technology readiness evaluation stage through extensive sensor evaluations in engine test beds on rotating components up to 1200F.  The technology will be advanced to the point where negotiations can be made to incorporate the sensor technology into engines for OEMs and industry partners.  BENEFIT:  The prototype wireless temperature and pressure sensor system developed in this project will consist of wireless, passive, small, multiple-access harsh environment microwave sensors and the associated sensor data acquisitions &amp; signal processing systems for rotating parts in turbine engines.  The successful technology demonstration and evaluation in a turbine engine environment during the later stages of Phase II will lead to agreements between Environetix Technologies Corporation and several key partners to deliver the sensors in production scale quantities to meet the immediate USAF needs.  This sensor system will provide far reaching benefits for the USAF including allowing increased thrust to weight ratios, decreased fuel consumption and engine validation costs, and material data that could be used by life prediction models for better component health management practices. In addition, OEMs will use this technology for turbine engine and material development, since it provides sensing data not yet available to the turbine engine industry. The importance of this enabling technology goes beyond DoD applications, and will quickly find its way into the commercial aerospace industry, turbine engine testing industry, power industry, and several industrial control processes that operate in harsh environment conditions.",

        "abstract": "The majority of personnel injured in OIF/OEF have suffered blast injuries from IEDs.  Blasts often cause cranio-facial trauma that is difficult to repair surgically.  The current standard of care involves the placement of fixation devices and off label use of growth factor carriers.  These strategies often require multiple surgical interventions creating a significant need for better technologies that can be used in minimally invasive procedures.  A family of biomaterials derived from keratin proteins may provide a platform on which new strategies can be built.  Keratins have broad biocompatibility and can be formulated as films, fibers, foams, solid tissue constructs and important to this project, hydrogels.  One of the problems with many synthetic and naturally derived biomaterials is that they do not promote cell adhesion and migration into scaffolds that have weak cell-matrix interactions.  Keratins have intrinsic cell-binding properties that can be exploited to offer new solutions to cranio-facial regeneration. This Phase II proposal seeks to expand on Phase I data by testing an injectable keratin growth factor carrier in both large and small animal models of mandible defects.  The results will be used in an application to the FDA to begin clinical trials for injuries of cranio-facial bone structures.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In this program, CFDRC will develop and deliver a tool-kit for prediction of ignition delays (IDs) of hypergolic energetic ionic liquids (EILs). In Phase I, CFDRC has demonstrated the proof-of-principle by predicting IDs of EILs by using two methods: 1) Quantitative Structure Property Relationship (QSPR), and 2) Artificial Neural Network (ANN).  These two methods were found to be appropriate for prediction of IDs. In Phase II, CFDRC plans to expand the scope of the work and develop a robust commercial quality tool-kit that can be used by scientist, engineers and technicians to predict IDs of EILs at the concept stage, prior to their synthesis.  The tool-kit will predict the IDs with the user inputting only the molecular structures of the EILs.  With this easy to use tool-kit, a non-expert will be able to create a new database of IDs, add new EILs to the existing database, train QSPR and ANN, analyze the data and predict ID. In addition, CFDRC will also develop a novel protocol that will combine several physics-based techniques to extract mechanisms of hypergolic reactions of EILs and compute IDs.  Such a mechanism will provide insight into the fundamental of hypergolic reactions, and can be used with a computational fluid dynamics code to design and optimize EIL based thrusters.  BENEFIT:  Recently EILs have attracted considerable attention as next generation hypergolic bipropellants to replace toxic monomethylhydrazine (MMH).  Due to their low vapor pressures, they are safer to handle and transport and more environmentally friendly than MMH. Therefore, development of a tool-kit for prediction of IDs of EILs prior their laboratory synthesis will reduce the time and cost, and risk of failure at the later stages of development.  Air Force, other DoD agencies and NASA along with their contractors are working towards meeting the goals of the IHPRPT program.  Since EILs are the leading candidates to satisfy IHPRPT goals of lower toxicitiy bipropellants with increased specific impulse, these agencies and industries will benefit from the product of this Phase II. In Phase III and beyond, CFDRC will develop an integrated Propellant Design Tool-kit (ProDeT) that will be a one-stop solution for molecular structure to propellant property prediction.  Such a tool-kit will expedite the development of novel propellants.  In addition, this technology can be customized with minimal effort for non-military applications such as catalyst and drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The design and development of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAV) has moved from scaled down conventional aircraft configurations to biologically-inspired concepts structurally mimicking birds and insects.  As this research has expanded, traditional aerodynamic analysis where rigid structures are assumed, appears not to have the fidelity required to understand forces on flexible structures. Many MAVs have appreciable deformation due to flexible lightweight airframe construction and some utilize this flexibility for enhanced control.  During Phase I of this SBIR, Calspan took these issues into account and made contact with researchers / developers to obtain current and projected future requirements. The responses identified a large variation in desired capabilities. These parameters included expected load ranges for their MAV, required angle ranges, as well as rotational and translational rates.  This information was then summarized to define a system that would be useful for the largest number of researchers and used to define the Phase II proposal.  Phase II will develop, prototype, demonstrate and evaluate the support and measurement system in a wind tunnel approved by the AFRL sponsor. The Phase II demonstration and evaluation will include&quot;Scripted&quot;motion testing as well as simulated&quot;Free-Flight&quot;6 DOF testing.  BENEFIT:  At the conclusion of Phase II, the micro air vehicle research community will have the ability to perform various test techniques to develop a greater understanding of issues such as flexible aircraft dynamics, how to control flight at high angles-of-attack (e.g., 90 degrees ) for&quot;perch&quot;approaches and obstacle avoidance, evaluate flight characteristics of a parent MAV carrying micro-munitions, as well as investigating lift and control sensitivity to twisting or warping airfoils.",

        "abstract": "Pyrowear 675 is noted as a high performance bearing material used in turbine engine and other higher temperature applications. The mechanical properties and stability necessary for these applications is achieved via carburizing by design. The carbides that form to provide the hot hardness and desired mechanical properties for bearing service are at the expense of corrosion resistance. As the carbides form during carburizing, the alloying elements responsible for much of the corrosion resistance are removed from solution. When the alloying elements are tied up in carbide phases, the corrosion protection is drastically reduced. With the current thermal processing methods, the corrosion protection cannot be maintained when the hardness requirements are met. IBC Materials and Technologies will develop an innovative thermal processing technology based on a combination solution nitriding and low temperature ion plasma nitriding. The solution nitriding, coupled with low temperature nitriding will be employed to achieve an expanded S-phase austenite (S-phase) in the Pyrowear 675, leading to superior hardness and corrosion resistance of the bearings and gears",

Not only is the human hand a highly evolved solution to many difficult problems, but humans have fashioned a world of objects and tools suited to the strengths and weaknesses of our hands.  Much of the emphasis on biomimetic design of robotic hands to date has concerned the mechanical linkages - the location and nature of rigid segments, articulations between them and linkages to actuators (corresponding to bones, joints and tendons, respectively).  But such anthropomorphism is no guarantee of success; achieving functionality such as dexterous manipulation will require the addition of sensors and sensorimotor control algorithms, which should also benefit from biomimetic design.  We have developed and validated a robust, biomimetic multimodal tactile sensing technology that contains all cutaneous sensory capabilities and has similar sensitivities and mechanical properties to the human fingertip.  We will incorporate these sensing modules into a mechatronic anthropomorphic robot hand and develop software to perform exploratory behaviors and discriminate objects based on sensory feedback.  This approach will guarantee a reduced-risk strategy by avoiding the unnecessary reproduction of decades worth of development currently available state-of-the-art anthropomorphic mechatronic hands.",

Selected batteries will also be subjected to NAVSEA S9310 safety tests to validate the likelihood of future compliance. Anode and cathode fabrication methods and acceptance specifications will be developed to ensure the proper post-activation deformation characteristics needed to achieve desired electrical performance. The near term goal is to demonstrate a 20+% increase in specific energy (at the battery level) over LiSi/CoS2 technology (enabled by a new cathode material).

Currently, the JTRS HMS program office is using a commercial C/A code based GPS receiver in the Rifleman Radio under an OSD waiver to provide the situation awareness capability to the Soldiers. The vulnerability of the commercial C/A code receiver to enemy spoofing or jamming of GPS signals is well known, however the SWAP-C constraints of these platforms have precluded inclusion of secure military SAASM GPS receiver for situation awareness. The high unit cost of the current military SAASM GPS receivers, in addition to high power consumption that limits the battery life for the mission, also makes it unaffordable on some of these platforms. Mayflower proposes under this JPEO JTRS SBIR Phase II program to modify, enhance and test its military SAASM GPS receiver products developed under a recently completed program to directly address the SWAP-C needs of JTRS HMS Manpack and Rifleman Radio.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Man-Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS) missiles are a serious threat to aircraft. Susceptibility is typically examined using computer modeling techniques where an infrared (IR) model of the aircraft is generated and a missile is digitally flown toward the aircraft to determine if it hits or misses. To increase the accuracy of these models, large amounts of data on actual free-flight missile miss-distance is required to model missile performance distributions that more closely match reality. This will allow susceptibility models to be validated, providing better data for the warfighter and developers of countermeasures. To facilitate data acquisition at live fire missile tests, a Portable Missile Miss-Distance Identification System (PMMDIS) is proposed. The PMMDIS will automatically determine missile miss-distances within +/-3 inches for missiles missing their targets by as much as 60 ft. In addition to the high level of accuracy, the system will be portable, easy to set up, light weight, permit remote operation and post processing of missile test data, and perform for daytime and nighttime missile tests.  The system will also require minimal user interaction, provide sufficient power to operate for 15 days of continuous uninterrupted recording, and perform auto-calibration if a camera is moved during the test.   BENEFIT:  At the conclusion of the proposed Phase II project, MSI will deliver a Portable Missile Miss-Distance Identification System (PMMDIS) to the 46th TG/OL-AC  Aerospace Survivability &amp; Safety Operating Location that can be used at several different ranges. The initial PMMDIS system is modular in design so that it forms a foundation for a product family so that MSI and its current and future partners can pursue alternative military and commercial applications. While the initial efforts for PMMDIS development will focus on creating a product that meets the Air Force&quot;s unique needs for assessing MANPADS missile miss-distances during free-flight launch tests, the system will have adaptation potential to a number of other military and commercial uses.  There are three paths for pursing additional applications by leveraging the Phase II project results. The first path requires relatively minor PMMDIS system modifications to meet requirements for measuring missile orientation as it leaves the launch tube and for measuring the lethality effectiveness of guided and unguided bombs. The second longer term path focuses on applications such as a UAV-based lethality battle damage analysis system and a system that provides warning and activation of Infrared Counter Measures (IRCM) for both military and commercial aircraft. The third path includes commercial applications such as stereo vision and imaging products for tracking golf balls, baseballs, and video graphics. The disruptive technology for all three paths is providing highly accurate measurements using a relatively low cost camera based sensor (and advanced processing software) when compared to more expensive radar or laser measurement systems.  A further adaptation of PMMDIS can be made to evaluate the lethality effectiveness of other weapon systems such as guided and unguided bombs. Large bombing ranges, such as 46th Test Wing&quot;s ranges at Eglin AFB, want a low-cost system to rapidly assess bombing accuracy. The adaption can be accomplished with reduced funding levels due to leveraging the technology developed in the PMMDIS program. The same system can be used for air-to-ground missile launches in lethality evaluations. It can also be used to assess missile accuracy for launches at target drones. Perhaps the most notable military or commercial derivation of PMMDIS involves the fielding of this system on aircraft to provide warning and activation of IRCM protection measures. A key advantage of MSI&quot;s highly accurate system is the relatively low cost of the camera-based system versus methods that rely on higher cost radars or lasers. Approximately 80% of U.S. fixed-wing aircraft losses in Desert Storm were from ground based Iraqi defensive systems using IR SAMS. Both IR SAMS and IR air-to-air missiles have seekers with improved Counter-Countermeasures (CCM) capabilities that seriously degrade the effectiveness of current expendable decoys. By one estimate more than 500,000 shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles exist and are available on the worldwide market. MSI has already designed such a system for RPG protection in ground vehicles using a variant of the PMMDIS as the sensor. The PMMDIS developments will be further examined for updating current missile warning systems on aircraft. The potential for a low-cost on-aircraft system that may be provided by PMMDIS will be extremely valuable with very competitive pay back time periods compared to other options. Other non-military or non-terrorist applications of the PMMDIS have also been conceived. The system has the potential to update previous work performed in the area of stereo vision and image processing for tracking golf balls or even baseballs for television graphics. It can also be used for indoor training aids for golf, baseball pitching/hitting, football passing/kicking, or other sports where trajectory, orientation, and velocity are important to track and project outward. For example, current systems for baseball strike zone monitoring provided by Questec use a 4 camera system. Major League Baseball Advanced Media and Sports Vision are releasing a more modern and more expensive system called Zone Evaluation that utilizes 12 cameras. Based on MSI&quot;s initial evaluation, a variation of PMMDIS can provide the accuracy of the Zone Evaluation at a sell price comparable to the traditional Questec system. The MSI variant that is technically an equivalent to the Questec system will cost about two-thirds less than the current Questec system. This will make the system more affordable for college and minor league parks leading to a potential tenfold increase in market size.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  High energy laser (HEL) source technology has advanced more rapidly than the tools to measure the irradiance at the incident surface.  This work will provide a conformal mesh of nano-scale irradiance sensors that can be appended to the curved surface of an airborne body.  The sensor array will have a thickness on the order of hundreds of microns, which will minimize the effects on an aerodynamic body in flight.  The high percentage of open area of the conformal mesh will minimize the interference of the laser with the target surface.  The sensors that will be developed utilize nano-crystal technology to measure irradiance.  The sensor arrays will be integrated into a system that includes readout electronics, transmission of sensor data via a telemetry system, data acquisition, and near real time visualization of measured irradiance.  BENEFIT:  This work will also provide innovative instrumentation capabilities for Department of Defense customers. AEgis has received requests from government and commercial interests for irradiance instrumentation, including: Air Force (AAC and AFRL/RH), Navy (NSWC-Dahlgren), and Boeing-SVS. We have received specific design requirements from NSWC-Dahlgren and AFRL/RDTA that support unmanned aerial system (UAS) testing. AEgis is in close communication with these organizations, giving us a distinct advantage from the perspective of understanding the needs of the HEL test community.     In addition to these inquiries, there are numerous laser programs that need the instrumentation that this program will provide. These laser programs include ATL, HELLADS, JHPSSL, HELTD, ELLA, ALT-B, Navy LaWS, AFRL/RDLE, Boeing SVS, JIAMDO, SMDC, Army WSD. AEgis is actively developing relationships with these customers to deploy the technology that will be developed under this program.     Additionally, this work has tremendous commercial potential. The ability to produce irradiance sensors in a small, conformal form factor can significantly alter the laser detection and characterization marketplace.  Commercial channels include commercial and DoD laser development (test and evaluation, optimization, detection, etc.), solar panel positioning (space and terrestrial), laser detection and characterization on commercial and DoD aircraft, vehicles, ships, spacecraft, personnel, etc., for safety and defense purposes.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  AFRL has performed basic research in Space Situational Awareness (SSA) for many years. With the successful execution of multiple programs during the past few years, AFRL has become the de facto center of mass in the SSA research and development community. Perhaps one of the most critical areas of SSA is that of satellite conjunction analysis (CA). While CA has been performed operationally for some time, new requirements demand that more efficient approaches be investigated. In particular, improved sensor capabilities within the USAF Space Surveillance Network (SSN) indicate that the size of the orbital satellite catalog will increase dramatically, overwhelming the ability of existing operational CA tools to run in real-time.   The objectives of Continuous Anomalous Orbital Situation Determination (CAOS-D) are to identify and develop advanced algorithms for orbital conjunction analysis and to provide a platform in which to efficiently and objectively evaluate such algorithms. The ISS Team proposes radically new approaches to conjunction analysis in an effort to provide an improved space picture to the operators. The second phase of CAOS-D builds on the performance improvements made in the first phase and focuses on new algorithms for CA. By using the architecture developed in Phase I, the ISS Team will be able to implement and evaluate new algorithms with greater ease and efficiency.     BENEFIT:  CAOS-D will provide a configurable platform for conjunction analysis in a net-centric environment that will be compatible with forthcoming JSpOC Mission System (JMS) architecture. In Phase I, CAOS-D achieved partial  integration with the JMS UDOP. This integration showed how a user can interact with CAOS-D and configure it to evaluate various conjunction algorithms.  After completing the distributed process control, visualization and astrodynamic assessment algorithms in Phase II, CAOS-D will provide a system that will be usable by operational organizations and transitionable to programs of record.  Commercial applications of CAOS-D include currently envisioned SSA and Defensive Counter Space (DCS) systems such as the JSpOC Mission System (JMS) as well as current technical customers such as Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) A9.",

This length of time is dangerous for personnel.  Rapid identification of toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) in food using a sensor that is biologically-based and easy to use eliminates that danger and would provide exactly what is needed for toxicity evaluation of food.  In this Phase II, Agave BioSystems proposes to develop a rapid and accurate biosensor prototype using mutant C. elegans to evaluate toxicity in food.  This biosensor will use the nematode C. elegans as the model system and measure Green fluorescent protein (GFP) that has been linked to inducible promoters of genes responsive to specific stressors.  Extended shelf life will be possible because the dauer stage within the lifecycle of C. elegans leaves the worm in stasis for extended periods of time until growth is resumed with improved conditions.  By measuring the GFP response in a mixed population of mutant C. elegans, the outcome should be an accurate and sensitive assessment of chemical toxicity in food.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Our Phase II approach will further develop a new empirical approach to sensor calibration with the goal of dramatically improving the rapid checkout and immediate usefulness of Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) assets.  In Phase I, we demonstrated the concept of non-linear, per-pixel, response compensation models with empirically derived coefficients that corrected the instantaneous sensor response over the span of likely operational conditions in which the sensor will be expected to perform.  FTI&quot;s vision is one where sensor design, ground test experiments, and on-orbit checkout tasks are designed to promote pre-launch sensor calibration over the entire range of operating conditions expected in early on-orbit operations; the sensor is designed from the ground up to support an ORS mission.  In support of this vision, during Phase II we will address the novel calibration needs of next generation of giga-pixel arrays by incorporating new computational Graphic Processor Unit technology into the workflow.  Furthermore, we will construct an innovative Design of Experiment for collecting test data intelligently and efficiently.  We envision creating a software suite capable of supporting future space-based and airborne electro-optical infrared sensors, where the demands of ORS and large/fast readout sensor arrays result in a challenging environment of data-rich, time-critical operations.  BENEFIT:  The innovation resulting from this research will have direct impact on any program that has a need to reduce the timeline between sensor deployment and the delivery of calibrated, validated data to the user.  The ultimate result of the implementation of the innovations produced by this Phase II effort will be in the increased probability of mission success in the immediate period after cover release.  In addition to the high visibility space-based surveillance, remote sensing and interceptor missions, FTI has identified civilian and military applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as being potential immediate application targets for this technology.   Civilian applications for UAVs include border security, search and rescue, traffic control, fire suppression, and crop and environmental surveillance.",

        "abstract": "Various methods for increasing seat belt usage have been investigated over the last several years including visual and audible warnings currently installed in today\u2019s vehicles.  In spite of these attempts, FMCSA research has shown that drivers of about 59% of commercial motor vehicles (those weighing 10,000 pounds or more that operate in interstate commerce) buckle their safety belts as compared to about 82% of passenger vehicle drivers. Proposed methods for inhibiting vehicle drivability are out of the question for obvious safety and liability reasons. A more reasonable and subtle approach would be to directly alter driver behavior.  A study currently underway by the Western Michigan University and the Tenik Group, Inc. through NHTSA at the DOT, used a yieldable accelerator pedal force resistance (back force) on the accelerator pedal when drivers who were not wearing their seatbelt exceeded a speed threshold (15 mph) to motivate them to fasten their seatbelt.  When the driver fastened their seatbelt the backpressure on the accelerator pedal disappeared.  The addition of \u201cLearning Curve\u201d software allows the criterion speed and force to be adapted to each individual\u2019s seatbelt use pattern.  This system offers the advantage of being completely transparent to drivers when they are backing or moving their vehicles since the system is not active at these slow speeds.  This is a major concern for trucking companies that do not wish to add a disincentive for getting out of the vehicle to judge distance while backing.",

        "abstract": "We propose to develop a novel, highly efficient, soldier-borne system for real-time detection and neutralization of IED hazards at a stand-off distance of 150 meters and more. The proposed approach is a significant advance in stand-off explosive detector technologies, combining image processing with chemical detection signature and ballistic delivery of the sensory material to inspected objects. This allows fast identification of major explosives contained in IEDs (less than 2-3 second) followed by IED neutralization. In Phase I, the feasibility of the explosive detection concept was demonstrated using fluorescence imaging (FLIM) approach. In Phase II, major efforts will be focused on the improvement of the fluorescence imaging method such as stand-off distance extension; enhancement of the fluorescence quenching contrast by the lock-in imaging and using narrow band-pass filtering; image processing/pattern recognition and integration ballistic delivery means with recording/ processing equipment in one portable package (less than 20 pound). The neutralization system will be identified and designed to work in conjunction with the IED detector. In Phase II, two developed prototypes (FLIM-I and FLIM-II) will be tested at stand-off distance of 150 m and more and test results will be compared with modeling efforts. The Phase II prototype will prove to be an essential link between the accomplishments of Phase I and the development of a commercially viable technology in Phase III which have a wide variety application in the military and commercial sectors.",

PM/IDE will enable novice modelers to review and understand models more expediently, so they can learn modeling techniques more efficiently.  PM/IDE also will enable experienced modelers to review the models of others more quickly, so they can share modeling techniques and best practices.  Interactive graphical displays will enable modelers to describe planning domain models under construction and the plans they can generate to domain experts in order to facilitate more efficient knowledge elicitation and model review.  Without PM/IDE, ANML modeling will remain a tedious and difficult task that can be carried out only by the small number of people who have the necessary specialized skills and patience. This, in turn, will severely limit the use of ANML-based automated planning systems.During Phase I, we characterized the planning domain modeling task to identify the types of analyses and decisions that modelers carry out and the kinds of information they review and assess.  Based on this understanding of the task, we designed and prototyped PM/IDE capabilities and user-system interactions that help people develop ANML models.  During Phase 2, we propose to develop a TRL 7 version of PM/IDE. Our design approach draws upon our experience using a top-down, decision-centered software requirements and design process to develop data visualization and decision support systems.",

Leveraging earlier work on semantic annotation, we will develop algorithms to infer complex relationships between scene entities. Plain text reports of the scene are automatically generated to describe these relationships, contextual information, and events of interest. To achieve a high compression rate for bandwidth-limited applications, the text description can be used to synthesize image and video to provide a representative rendering of the scene and events.

The proposed simulation tools will include MD simulations that utilize fully atomistic reactive (ReaxFF) and polarizable non-reactive (APPLE &amp; P) force fields. Utilization of both reactive and non-reactive force fields will allow efficient and accurate modeling of chemical reactions and thermophysical properties that can be subsequently used for establishing quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR) with hypergolicity as well as direct modeling of hypergolic behavior.  BENEFIT:  Tools developed in this proposal will enhance and shorten the design cycle for the development of novel, IL-based hypergolic fuels. These tools will be also applicable for a variety of technological applications where reactions of IL play an important role. Examples of such technologies include pharmaceutical processes, biomass production, and energy storage (batteries and super capacitors).",

This family will include a 1/4U, 3U, 6U and 12U.  A 1U is as much as 2.3Kg in mass and is 10x10x10 cm in dimension.  Simultaneously, make CSDs very useful to the end-users and launch services by substantially reducing weight, cost, procurement time and increasing ease of use.  Write a detailed user&quot;s manual that thoroughly details capabilities and how the CSDs will be used. All the CSDs will be lighter and smaller that competitive design.              As a first option, design, build, test and flight validate an Isolated, Rotary Wafer (IRW).  Based on the 38.81 inch bolt circle payload interface common to all US unmanned launch vehicles, this 10 inch tall wafer would encapsulate and dispense payloads contained in the CSDs.  It would reside between the final stage an the primary payload allowing each launch to attain a greater utility. It would incorporate an vibration isolation system allowing both the primary and secondary payloads a substantial and useful reduction in launch environment loading.     BENEFIT:  An inexpensive, broadly useful Canisterized Satellites dispensers (CSD) to be flown as secondary payloads on a wide range of manned and unmanned launch vehicles and from within other larger satellites.  A substantial increase in the performance of CSDs.  A variation in CSDs that are both smaller and larger than currently available.

The combination of these complementary technologies promises to revolutionize aircraft systems and operations safety in the decades ahead.  However, the task of safely integrating these technologies is becoming increasingly difficult as their level of complexity, degree of automation, and demands from their operational environment grow. The Next Generation Air Transport System (NextGen), while providing significant benefits in terms of increased capacity and safety, will exacerbate this situation due to the large numbers of new and existing systems that will be required to interoperate.The multidisciplinary nature of these systems is a significant factor that makes analyzing their safety characteristics extremely difficult. While many development tools exist to conduct deep analyses within individual disciplines, there is a lack of tools available for deep analysis of complex multidisciplinary designs. The proposed research seeks to create a new class of development tool that will allow designers of complex systems-of-systems to explore the dynamic interactions between system components to uncover systemic vulnerabilities, precursory conditions, and likely outcomes.The Phase I project generated an initial implementation of the software package Idea, an Integrated Design and Analysis Environment that could be used to model complex interdependencies between flight deck operations, flight deck controls and display, and the underlying physical components of the aircraft. The proposed Phase II effort will mature this software and expand its capabilities, resulting in a flexible, standards-compliant tool that is ready for beta testing and subsequent commercialization. It will focus on enhancements that support cross-disciplinary modeling and analysis of safety-critical human-automation systems.",

Once an anomaly is detected, the Model-based Avionic Prognostic Reasoner (MAPR) solves a user-outlined state-space model, symbolically, using a Gauss-Newton optimization method and the information from the MIL-STD-1553 bus. This algorithm outputs a list of best fitting parameters to match the command to the actual performance. Rules are programmed in, based on results from principal component analysis . The rules determine both fault mode and the severity of that fault. The rules can distinguish between two failure modes: Mechanical jam and MOSFET failure, and healthy.The real-time processing will allow for critical evolutions in flight safety and provides a game-changing approach to condition-based maintenance. Once  deployed, flight safety can be improved by allowing the on-board flight computers to read from the MAPR and update their control envelope based on its evaluations, reducing damage propagation and increasing operational safety.In Phase 2, we will develop a functioning ground-based prototype of the technology to show the efficacy of the method. A ground-based version of the tool is the best candidate for development to ease adoption by testing in a low-risk environment; this tool will be demonstrated at the end of Phase 2. The MAPR concept is also applicable to any system with a state-space representation but at this point it has been developed with EMAs in mind.The MAPR prototype is at TRL 5 and will reach a TRL 7 by the end of Phase 2.",

A key contributor to this fact is the inherent cost associated with installation and maintenance of these control systems, since many system designs require the replacement of a helicopter&#039;s rotor blades, rotor hub components, or both.  The proposed work addresses this deficiency through the development of an on-blade full-span camber control system that reaps many of the known benefits of advanced rotor control in a retrofit design approach that has the potential to achieve production status due to its lower risks and costs compared to previous system concepts.  The design leverages past work in the use of smart-material actuated bistable tabs for rotor blade tracking, with a newer integral actuation concept that will lead toward a more robust and flightworthy design.",

        "abstract": "Reaction wheels are used to stabilize satellites and to slew their orientation from object to object with precision and accuracy by varying the rotational speed of the wheels. Three or four wheels are usually used with three of them aligned along orthogonal axes. The degree to which pointing stability is achieved depends on the stability of the wheels&#039; angular momentum vectors while spinning, which can be affected by static and dynamic unbalance contributions and other wheel construction issues. With the smaller satellites, requiring smaller wheels, the stability of the wheels will be even more challenging as the uncertainty of construction is likely to remain the same. To stabilize the smaller reaction wheels we propose to integrate a Sensor Chip containing MEMS gyroscopes and accelerometers with each reaction wheel. This allows direct measurement of the wheel motions for fine-tuning its operation. The improved wheel then becomes a means for improving IMU sensor stability for precision pointing and slewing from object to object.",

        "abstract": "NASA sees an increasing role in the near future for small satellites in the 5-100 kg size range. A potentially disruptive technology, small satellites are being eyed as platforms for the rapid demonstration of new technologies and important science missions. Currently, small satellite platforms struggle to balance the three critical tasks of collecting enough power, acquiring data and downlinking that data to ground stations in a way that maximizes mission return. For these small platforms, which usually do not benefit from steer-able solar arrays or gimbaled antennas and instruments, optimally balancing these three tasks strongly depends on the satellite&#039;s attitude control agility. Spacecraft agility has to do with rapid retargeting, fast transient settling and low jitter pointing control. Dr. Bong Wie, renowned spacecraft attitude control expert and Professor of Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University, stated that ultimately the &quot;measure of an agile satellite attitude control system is its ability to collect the maximum data from an area on the Earth that is rich in data-collection opportunities&quot;. A logical corollary following from this statement would be that to maximize satellite data-collection, system designers should look to increase the satellite&#039;s agility. Furthermore, in addition to data-collection, the other two critical tasks of power collection and data downlink are also maximized as agility is increased.Honeybee Robotics proposes to develop a low cost, high torque and low jitter satellite attitude control actuator derived from its Tiny Operationally Responsive CMG (TORC) design. This derivative product would combine two TORC units into a single scissored-pair configuration with SPA compatible interface. The result, a flight-certified TORC-SP, would be an actuator with the simple control interface of a reaction wheel that offers 1-2 orders of magnitude more torque per unit mass at drastically less power than a reaction wheel.",

In scientific computing, the focus is on the partial differential equations (PDEs) that arise from computational fluid dynamics (CFD), climate modeling, astrophysics, and structural and heat analysis that cannot be solved analytically. Certain problem formulations lead to sparse matrices, in which the majority of matrix elements are zero. Special attention is required when computing on sparse matrices in order to avoid using unrealistic amounts of memory or produce ill-performing software. Such topics have been the subject of considerable research and the limits of CPU-based performance have been reached.Recently, the graphics processing unit (GPU) has emerged as an attractive platform for high performance computing. The modern GPU boasts over 1 TFLOPS performance and as much as 6 GB onboard memory, but harnessing the power can be challenging. A library-based approach is common for HPC, with most applications using several libraries to offload well-known tasks. EM Photonics maintains a library of GPU-accelerated dense linear algebra solvers that has over 5000 users.

Flight evaluations of various adaptive controllers conducted by NASA and others have shown great promise.

        "abstract": "In the proposed Phase II program, we will continue the development of Mg bipropellant rockets for Martian PAV applications.  In Phase I, we proved the feasibility of this game-changing technology.  Through chemical analysis, we determined that Mg can be combusted with CO2 condensed in-situ from the Martian atmosphere to yield Isp ~240 s.  We then successfully demonstrated a low fidelity Mg-CO2 rocket in the laboratory, achieving combustion for 43s before voluntary termination.  We also analyzed the use of H2O and H2O2 as oxidizers, and Al as a propellant.  H2O exists at the Martian poles and below the surface, while both Mg and Al can be acquired in-situ from the Martian regolith.  We determined that the ideal vacuum Isp of a 10 bar Mg-H20 rocket would be as high as ~340 s, while the Isp of a Al-steam rocket would be ~380 s, and hydrogen peroxide could yield higher density Isp and operational benefits.  In Phase II we plan to develop and test an integrated high performance laboratory model system.  We will first fully characterize multiple propellant oxidizer combinations in a linear combustor.  Then we will design, build, and test an integrated system including both a rocket and a propellant management system.  Comprehensive test results would feed back into the design, culminating in an advanced system sized for prospective near-term applications.",

The further study expands to include the development of an SiC-SiC honeycomb using the proven infiltration process of the Phase I project.  In the proposed project, an SiC prepreg will be engineered that can be formed into a honeycomb and then infiltrated with SiC to form a ceramic SiC-SiC honeycomb.  The honeycomb will then be tested mechanically at ambient temperature and high temperature.  This testing will include cycling the material to determine property falloff.  C-SiC and SiC SiC will be compared in this study.  The thermal characteristics, such as conductivity and emissivity, will also be tested.  The integration of such a material into hypersonic and other structures is a key area of the research; therefore a bonding study is included in the current proposal.

        "abstract": "Hot Corrosion of turbine engine components has been studied for many years.  The underlying mechan-isms of Type I Hot Corrosion and Type II Hot Corrosion are increasingly well-understood.  Modern turbine engine designs that seek to achieve better fuel efficiency in part by increasing turbine inlet temperatures are strong candidates for nickel-based superalloy turbine disk materials.  As disk temperatures approach 700C, designers must consider the likelihood and effects of Type II corrosion.  Type II corrosion is typically characterized by localized corrosion pitting caused by melting of sulfur-containing salts.  Type II hot corrosion pits have been shown to decrease the fatigue resistance of superalloys due to initiation of fatigue cracks at hot corrosion pits.  However, the rigorous analytical models and tools needed by turbine engine designers to predict Type II corrosion effects are not currently available.The overall objective of this research program will be to develop DARWIN-HC?a probabilistic Type II hot corrosion, fatigue cracking, and fatigue life prediction software tool for nickel-based superalloy turbine disks.    The Phase I research was based on data provided by both NASA and the research team. The key Phase I innovations included enhanced probabilistic models that are explicitly parameterized by the relevant environmental and material variables.  The models are a significant step towards modeling the spatial and temporal evolutions of corrosion pits?setting the stage for the development of fatigue life prediction capability.    Whereas the existing DARWIN software contains probabilistic models of hard alpha anomalies in titanium disk materials, DARWIN-HC will feature the probabilistic models of defect distributions due to Type II hot corrosion, which can lead to fatigue crack initiation.  In Phase II, the team will create a functional DARWIN-HC prototype software application for evaluation by NASA and industry.",

Unfortunately, inaccurate or false readings from these sensors can lead to improper decision-making resulting in serious and sometimes fatal consequences. The research performed in Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of using advanced data analysis techniques to identify anomalies in Pitot tubes resulting from blockage such as icing, moisture, or foreign objects.  The core technology used in this project is referred to as &quot;noise analysis&quot; since it relates a sensor&#039;s response time to the dynamic component (noise) found in the signal of these same sensors.   This analysis technique has used existing electrical signals of Pitot tube sensors that result from measured processes during in-flight conditions and/or induced signals in pre-flight conditions to detect anomalies in the sensor readings.AMS has routinely used this technology to determine the health of pressure transmitters in nuclear power plants. The application of this technology for the detection of aircraft anomalies is innovative in that instead of determining the health of process monitoring at a steady state condition, this technology will be used to quickly inform the pilot when an air speed indication becomes faulty under any flight condition as well as during pre-flight preparation.",

        "abstract": "Many of the most challenging categories of propulsion system development are related to the prediction of interacting effects between the fluid loads, thermal loads, and the structural deflection. In practice, the interactions between technical disciplines are often not fully explored analytically, and the analysis in one discipline often uses a simplified representation of other disciplines as an input or boundary condition. For example, the fluid forces in an engine generate static and dynamic rotor deflection, but the forces themselves are dependent on the rotor position and its orbit. This practice ignores the interaction between the physical phenomena where the outcome of each analysis can be heavily dependent on the inputs (i.e., changes in flow due to deflection, changes in deflection due to fluid forces). Such a rigid design process also lacks the flexibility to employ multiple levels of fidelity in the analysis of each of the components.The goals for this project are to develop and validate an innovative design environment that has the flexibility to simultaneously analyze multiple disciplines, multiple components, with multiple levels of model fidelity.  Development and demonstration of such a system will provide substantially superior capabilities to current design tools.",

Thus, it is difficult to directly monitor components that are most susceptible to damage.Ridgetop has developed an embedded data acquisition module that overcomes these limitations. This innovation is a self-contained data processing unit within a specialized fixture that installs directly inside the hubs of rotating gear parts.

This proposal describes a novel type of schlieren system that would increase efficiency, capability, and productivity for ground test facilities. The concept and the availability of state-of-the-art components make the system more portable, easier to align, and more versatile than existing systems. A major drawback of current schlieren systems, and one that has restricted their widespread commercial use, is that they require exact alignment between a pair of widely separated mirrors or grids, which takes time and limits portability, and costs are prohibitive for most such applications. This problem is partially relaxed by focusing schlieren methods. The proposed concept incorporates features of existing schlieren systems while removing the primary limitations. All of the elements that require precise alignment are contained within a camera body and can be relatively inexpensive. Very large fields of view are made possible.

In its current configuration the LMM accommodates a Contained Bubble Experiment, and it has no substage illuminator and limited epi-illumination.  There is a need for future use of the LMM in more versatile fluids and biological experiments.  A modular observation platform consisting of an electronics module and the first two of an eventual suite of experiment modules is proposed.A life science experiment module that allows investigators to load up to two different fluids and combine them in a hollow glass slide under the LMM objective lenses has been designed and built.  It is suitable for the imaging, enumeration and evaluation of biological cells in suspension or attached to the glass surface of the hollow slide for on-orbit, real-time image cytometry.  Fluids can be changed to initiate a process, fix biological samples or retrieve suspended cells.The colloid science experiment module will be designed for conduct of certain microparticle and nanoparticle experiments for investigation of the colloid self-assembly (CSA) phenomenon, among others.  The colloid science module is being developed in response to the high level of interest in such a facility.  It includes a hollow glass slide and heating elements for the creation of a thermal gradient from one end of the slide to the other.The life science and colloid science experiment modules mount atop the electronics module in the position on the LMM where the stage would be.  The electronics module that contains a diffuse illuminator, power supplies for two piezo pumps, controller boards for pumps, valves and illuminator The electronics module is designed to receive power and control signals from the FIR/LMM system.  The same electronics module will support the life science and colloid science experiment modules.",

The software developed in this project leverages current computing technology to implement advanced Visual Odometry (VO) methods that will accurately track much faster rover movements. Our fully Bayesian approach to VO will utilizes information from the images than previous methods are capable of using. Our Bayesian VO does not explicitly select features to track. Instead it implicitly determines what can be learned from each image pixel and weights the information accordingly. This means that our approach can work with images that have no distinct corners, which can be a significant advantage with low contrast images from permanently shadowed areas. We have shown that the error characteristics of the visual processing are complementary to the error characteristics of a low-cost IMU. Therefore, the combination of the two can provide highly accurate navigation.",

        "abstract": "The overall program objective is to develop a high-temperature passive thermal management system for the Radioisotope Power Conversion system that energizes the refrigeration system applicable to Venus missions.  The innovation consists of a high temperature alkali metal variable conductance heat pipe (VCHP) integrated with a two-phase heat collection / transport package  from the General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) stack to the Stirling convertor heater head.   The thermal management system collects the heat from the GPHS modules, and delivers heat as required to the Stirling system.  Any excess heat is removed by the VCHP.  Excess  heat must be removed when the Stirling system is shut down, or in the early stages of a mission powered by a short-life radioisotope.  In Phase I, it was demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that the VCHP allows the Stirling convertor to: stop during transit to Venus, pre-cool the system before re-entry, work on Venus and execute brief stoppages on Venus. The reservoir is exposed to the environment temperature during the mission and this is a key for the HTTMS to work passively. The other component of the system, the two-phase heat transport package (HTP), minimizes the temperature drop between the multi-GPHS stack and the heater head. In Phase II, a full scale HTTMS will be designed and a representative multi-segment of the full scale HTTMS will be build and tested in relevant environment.  This multi-segment contains two or three parallel/redundant heat paths from the simulated GPHS stack to the heater head simulator, in addition to the backup cooling system (VCHP). The full-scale multi-segment HTTMS will be integrated and tested with the corresponding full scale multi-segment of the Intermediate Temperature Thermal Management System (ITTMS) of the Venus Lander.",

        "abstract": "The innovation in this SBIR Phase II project is the development of a unique triple junction inverted metamorphic technology (IMM), which will enable the manufacturing of very lightweight, low-cost, InGaAsP-based multijunction solar cells.  The proposed IMM technology is based on ELO (epitaxial lift-off) and consists of Indium (In) and Phosphorous (P) solar cell active materials, which are designed to improve the radiation resistance properties of the triple junction solar cell while maintaining a high efficiency. Because of the intrinsic radiation hardness of InP materials, this material system is of great interest for building solar cells suitable for deployment in very demanding radiation environments, such as medium earth orbit and missions to the outer planets.  Due to high launch costs, weight reduction is a key driver for the development of new space solar cell technologies.  Our recently developed epitaxial lift-off (ELO) process will also be applied to this new structure, which will enable the fabrication of the IMM structure without the substrate.  Cells with excellent end-of-life (EOL) performance require less area to meet specific mission power requirements.   The target efficiency of the proposed IMM cell at the beginning of life (BOL) is greater than 30% at AMO 1-sun.  The EOL target of the IMM cell is a degradation of less than 10% in efficiency.",

The UCDS Process addresses this issue by using a rigorous physics-based analytical framework to decompose the complex flow field inside a chemical propulsion device, such as a liquid or solid rocket, in a way that allows rapid simulation of the dynamic behavior.  Using UCDS it is possible to generate high fidelity predictions of the time evolution, amplitude and waveform of a pressure oscillation, along with any changes to the mean properties due to non-linear effects.  Furthermore, it has been shown that the modal Alpha (linear growth rate) is a key physical parameter that defines the dynamic behavior of a rocket and provides a reliable measure of combustion stability margin.By monitoring how the array of modal Alphas change with design or operational features, the effects on engine combustion stability can be predicted.  This insight provides the means to eliminate instability without resorting to expensive cut-and-try iterative developmental testing.

Using actual space suits in training or experimentation is problematic due to the expense, bulk, weight, and difficulty in donning/doffing.  The goal of this project was to demonstrate a novel method for simulating space suit joint torques, which are non-linear and vary with angular position.  We designed a knee joint simulator using McKibben actuators with active control (also known as artificial muscles), which are cylindrical pneumatic actuators constructed of flexible rubber with an inextensible weave that causes the cylinder to contract longitudinally when pressurized.  A commercial knee brace was used as an exoskeleton to mount the actuators.  One actuator was mounted anterior to the knee to provide resistance to flexion, and a second actuator was mounted posterior to the knee to provide resistance to extension.  The active controller read angle input from a potentiometer mounted to the brace and output the appropriate pressures for each actuator to provide the needed torque.  The knee joint was installed on MIT&#039;s Robotic Space Suit Tester (RSST), a full-sized anthropometric robot equipped with torque and angle sensors on each of the joints.  Results from testing indicated that the torque vs. angle relationship achieved using the actively controlled spacesuit joint simulator was qualitatively similar to the non-linear trend observed in prior testing of the EMU on the RSST. We conclude that the use of these actuators potentially results in higher fidelity than passive actuation.",

The sensor will have the dynamic range required to detect and monitor CO from approximately 1 to 500 ppmv with a resolution to 1 ppmv. Maxion will grow, fabricate and test a Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) at a unique single-mode wavelength ideal for CO detection. Maxion will team with Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) to integrate the QCL into PSI&#039;s Wavelength Modulation Spectroscopy (WMS) platform.The WMS sensor board, previously developed for near-IR lasers, will be redesigned to accommodate QCL lasers. The QCL will be specially designed and fabricated for minimum power consumption. In Phase 1 the QCL was incorporated into the WMS platform and tested on a breadboard level. The breadboard sensor demonstrated the necessary dynamic range and easily surpassed the required minimum sensitivity. A Phase II prototype design was made based on the Phase I results for which dynamic range, sensitivity, SWaP, and operation with a high degree of reliability, minimal maintenance, and self-calibration under varying humidity and ambient pressures are primary design features. The sensor prototype will be tested in a relevant environment with controlled burns at a NASA test facility. Upon successful completion of all field tests, the TRL will be 6 at the end of Phase II.",

        "abstract": "The Lunar Organic Waste Reformer (LOWR) utilizes high temperature steam reformation to convert all plastic, paper, and human waste materials into useful gases. In the LOWR, solar thermal concentrators are used to heat steam directly to 600 C, after which the steam is mixed with a small amount of oxygen and injected into a reactor which is being fed with waste materials via a lock hopper. At the high temperatures, the oxygenated steam will react with all organic materials to produce a gas mixture largely composed of hydrogen, CO and carbon dioxide. After removing the remaining steam from the product stream via condensation, the gases are dusulfurized and then fed to a catalytic reactor where they can be combined with hydrogen to produce methane, methanol, or other fuels.  Both the necessary hydrogen and oxygen for the process can be produced by electrolysis of part of the water content of the waste material, which is extracted from the wastes directly by the reformer itself. With effective recycling of the steam, no consumables are lost in the process. All products are liquids or gases, making the system highly reliable and subject to automation. In the proposed Phase 2 program, Pioneer Astronautics will build a full-scale end-to-end LOWR system capable of turning 10 kg of waste per day into methane and oxygen.",

        "abstract": "As the size of composite parts exceed that of even the largest autoclaves, new out-of-autoclave processes and materials are necessary to achieve the same level of performance as autoclave cured composites.  Many of the new out-of-autoclave prepreg systems can be used to manufacture high quality composites initially but the lay-up time for producing quality parts is limited by the short shelf-life at ambient conditions.  The resin advancement, due to long lay-up times, commonly causes variations in fiber volume and higher void content in the cured structures.  Also, current out-of-autoclave prepreg systems do not provide the same level of performance, especially damage tolerance, as many current autoclave cured prepreg systems.  It is the objective of this work to develop a matrix and prepreg system for out-of-autoclave processing that possesses a year plus shelf-life while also providing an excellent balance of composite properties and damage tolerance.  As an additional functionality, the out-of-autoclave prepreg system will be developed to have inherent skin-core self adhesive characteristics so that film adhesives may not be required for designs with honeycomb structures.

The Phase I program successfully proved wMLI feasibility by designing, building and testing a wMLI prototype with a measured heat leak 3.6X lower than spiral-wrapped conventional MLI widely used for piping insulation. A wMLI prototype had a heat leak of 7.3 W/m2, or 27% of the heat leak of conventional MLI (26.7 W/m2).Modeling estimates the thermal performance of wMLI could be further improved by 3-fold, leading to a heat leak of 0.7 W/m2 (20 layers, 77K to 295K), and even larger advantages over conventional MLI piping insulation.In a Phase II program we would further develop wMLI technology with custom, molded polymer spacers, and advance the product toward commercialization via a rigorous testing program including developing advanced vacuum insulated pipe for GSE application. wMLI could provide advanced cryogen transfer line insulation and be the basis of a superior Vacuum Insulated Pipe technology.",

Upcoming NASA missions such as MMS involve complex high Earth orbits making the use of GPS difficult, though NASA has developed GPS receivers capable of performing in these environments.  Space GPS simulation needs are typically seen as a niche market, and the resulting solutions, which are often simply adaptations of terrestrial products, can be sub-optimal and at best handle simple, low dynamic LEO missions.  Further, space simulation solutions are frequently inflexible and cannot be modified by the end-user.  Given the broad but unique needs of HWIL testing involving RF systems, Emergent proposes to develop the Multi-purpose Radio Signal Generation (MRSiG) system to address these needs, which are essential to early risk mitigation.  The MRSiG system will provide for easy mission specific customization and generation of multiple waveforms used in ground testing applications and will return the expertise to simulate these complex environments to NASA. MRSiG will accomplish this difficult task by harnessing the latest in open Software Defined Radio (SDR) technologies. Simulation complexity for RF signal generation is moved into software, enabling the emulation of many RF waveforms/protocols including, but not limited to GPS, 802.11, S-Band, WiMAX, etc.",

First, we use parameter continuation methods to assist in computation of trajectories in complicated dynamical situations.  Numerical parameter continuation methods have been used extensively to compute a menagerie of structures in dynamical systems including fixed points, periodic orbits, simple bifurcations and invariant manifolds.  Perhaps more important for the current work, such methods have already proven their worth in flight dynamics problems, especially those having to do with the complicated dynamics near libration points.  Second, we propose to use Continuous Mechanics and Optimal Control (CMOC).   Algorithms based the CMOC formalism promises to support optimal trajectory design using both discrete and continuous control.  Third, we propose to use advanced filtering techniques and representations of probability density functions to appropriately compute and manage the uncertainty in the trajectories. While advanced methods for understanding and leveraging the underlying dynamics are clearly necessary for effective mission design, planning, and analysis, we contend that they do not suffice.  In particular, they do not, in and of themselves, address the issue of uncertainty.Herein we discuss methods that balance the accuracy of the uncertainty representation against computational tractability.",

The objective is achieved by a unique design that combines a dual-arc low-cost accelerometer array with three-axis rate gyros and GPS. Advanced filtering techniques such as the Unscented Kalman Filter are proposed to estimate sensor bias and drift effects. High vibration effects are estimated and eliminated by subtracting the imposed loading from the accelerometer measurements to provide a highly robust system in the presence of highly dynamical and vibrational conditions.

        "abstract": "Marine phytoplankton are critical in sustaining life on Earth.  They are key drivers of the global biogeochemical cycles of carbon and other nutrients, and account for 50% of global photosynthesis.   Phytoplankton growth is the fundamental component of the &#039;ocean biological pump&#039;?one of the two primary mechanisms that cause the ocean to be a significant sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide.  Since different taxa occupy different ecological niches, identifying the major influences on the spatial and temporal distribution of phytoplankton groups is necessary to understand ecosystem function and the role of the oceans in global climate.Scientists employ various satellite sensors to measure the amount and distribution of chlorophyll a, an indicator of phytoplankton biomass in the ocean, but satellites only detect near-surface properties and therefore cannot adequately resolve the water column biomass and composition of phytoplankton species.  Small and robust sea-based instrumentation (the innovation of this work) provides this information, as well as valuable independent verification of the spaced-based data (&quot;sea truth&quot; data).The objective of this program is to develop a small, inexpensive, submersible, robust microflow cytometer (uFC) for quantitative detection of phytoplankton, to be initially deployed on the NSF Center for Coastal Margin Observation &amp; Prediction coastal ocean observatories (Oregon).  The device will be designed for long-endurance autonomous operation.  The proposed design has low power requirements, reduces or eliminates consumables, prevents of fouling, and reduces sensitivity to the environment.Our Phase 2 technical objectives are to (1) fabricate a complete uFC with all the subsystems necessary for extended autonomous operational deployment; (2) test our uFC on a coastal station operated by CMOP/OHSU.

For advanced levels of integration and test, the proposed large-volume metrology technology would allow fast, non-contact measurement of mirror rigid body alignment and prescription (i.e., radius, conic, aperture), with no special targets or references on the optic.

Currently used high-fidelity modeling and simulation tools at NASA are computationally prohibitive and not fully compatible with integrated analysis of spacecrafts. We propose to develop and demonstrate an innovative Model Order Reduction (MOR) software to automatically generate nonlinear reduced thermal models for spacecraft analysis. The underlying principle of our approach is to project the original full models onto a characteristic, low-dimensional subspace, yielding reduced models with markedly low computational orders.During Phase 1, key technology elements were developed and proof-of-concept was successfully demonstrated. A MOR engine encapsulating carefully selected nonlinear MOR algorithms, a reduced model solver and a verification module along with facile data exchange interfaces, were developed in an integrated software environment. By way of whole-satellite (LISA) case studies, critical evidence was established that reduced thermal models enable unprecedented speedup (10?500X) and accuracy (&lt;0.3%) for spacecraft analysis and design. In Phase 2, MOR engines will be optimized for enhanced computational performance. Robust constituent linear algorithms and domain-wise projection spaces will be developed to improve simulation stability and accuracy. New MOR capabilities to address variable-dependent models and parameterized MOR to accommodate design perturbations will be investigated. Our MOR software will be extensively verified and demonstrated for complex spacecraft thermal analysis. An application programming interface (API) will be developed in close collaboration with leading NASA vendors (C &amp; R Technologies) to facilitate technology insertion and transition.",

This modulation and coding pair provides excellent bandwidth-efficiency and greatly reduced transmitter SWaP.  Unfortunately, there are no high-data-rate AR4JA LDPC devices currently available and existing GMSK receivers operate far from the performance predicted by theory, especially in the presence of severe channel and equipment impairments.Phase I provided a design of a soft-decision generating GMSK demodulator integrated with an AR4JA LDPC decoder and with estimation and compensation of a comprehensive set of severe impairments.  Fixed-point simulations show performance within a small fraction of a dB of the performance with far less bandwidth-efficient modulations such as BPSK.  The results of this effort show the technical and commercial viability of an integrated GMSK/AR4JA LDPC design.The proposed Phase 2 effort involves the development and delivery of a prototype transmitter and receiver to demonstrate the superior capabilities offered by this innovation and enable subsequent commercialization.

Polymer membrane technologies are well suited for large area deployable space antennas by significantly reducing the mass and volume of the launch vehicle.  Low CTE polymer piezoelectric membrane technology is now at a maturity level to enable the development of high performance large area electrically formal membrane reflectors.  Advanced COATING technology is crucial to enabling technological developmental of high performance RF antennas.  The production of a conductive and highly reflective thermal control COATING that matches the CTE of the polymer membrane is at the center of this development program.  In addition, in Phase I, the piezoelectric polymeric membrane had a significant deformation at the application of the electrical potential - this manifested the need for stress balancing the coating.  Specifically, the objective is to develop the thin-film stress-balanced COATING that will precisely match the CTE of the polymer to the coating material itself, resulting in a zero CTE membrane/coating composite structure.  In addition, the coated membrane will exhibit the required RF performance, thermal characteristics, and environmental endurance, such as:  atomic oxygen (AO) resistance; visible and ultra-violet (VUV) radiation rejection; and space temperature extremes.  Surface Optics Corporation (SOC) has considerable experience in producing RF/Thermal coatings and precisely controlled intrinsic stress thin-films; both are necessary to the success of this program.

This approach can achieve extremely consistent passive quenching, and appropriate implementations can lead to rather small avalanches (e.g., ~10^4?10^5 carriers), for which reduced carrier trapping provides lower afterpulsing that will no longer limit the photon counting rate. When correctly implemented, this &quot;negative feedback&quot; avalanche diode (NFAD) design is also extremely simple to operate: with just a fixed dc bias voltage, the NFAD will autonomously execute the entire arm, avalanche, quench, and re-arm cycle and generate an output pulse every time an avalanche event is induced. During Phase 1 of this program, we characterized 5 different discrete NFAD designs to identify specific pixel-level design opportunities for reducing afterpulsing and timing jitter. We also fabricated and characterized wafer-level test structures  that show excellent feedback element yield and uniformity sufficient for large-format NFAD arrays.

The source will be useful both as a narrow band frequency stable sources for driving heterodyne receivers at key frequencies between 1 and 5 THz (1.4, 1.9, 2.7, 4.7 etc..) or for laboratory sources to characterize THz components, including MMIC&#039;s, or possibly for active spectrometers in an in-situ environment The proposed source would enable the development of THz array receivers for use in space and suborbital missions, or for atmospheric sounders and planetary landers. In Phase 1 our VECSEL THz source, based on intra-cavity difference frequency generation, demonstrated 2mW at 1.9THz running on a finite number of cavity modes with a linewidth per mode of around 1MHz.  Desert Beam Technologies will team up TeraVision (Tucson) and with  researchers at the Steward Observatory Radio Astronomy Laboratory (SORAL), University of Arizona  in  Phase 2  to further characterize a breadboard VECSEL 1.9THz system, measure Y-factor and I-V curves, redesign the VECSEL cavity to reduce it to single mode operation and test it as a local oscillator for SORAL&#039;s 1.9THz receiver.",

The proposed metal-mesh filters can tolerate cryogenic temperatures (down to 4K and below) and a wide vibration/shock spectrum, making them launch-capable and durable for long periods in space.  In addition, the proposed band-pass filters are light weight, as they employ no heavy substrates.  The proposed 2?5 mm thickness (mostly the mounting frame) allows insertion into tight spaces and standard filter wheels.

The proposed process is a drastic departure from conventional epitaxial methods, such as chemical vapor deposition and liquid phase epitaxy, which have yet to produce far IR BIBs suitable for astronomical instruments.Germanium BIBs will offer extended wavelength response up to at least 200\u00b5m, high quantum efficiency, high immunity to ionizing radiation, and elimination of long-term transient and memory effects.  Coupled with their compatibility with Si cryo-CMOS readout multiplexers and the planar, bump-bond hybridization process, these detectors will make possible the constructionof large format, high sensitivity FPAs for far IR astronomy and will replace the current unstressed and stressed germanium detectors.",

At the same time, we will reduce the driver&#039;s size in two successive stages of integration. In the first stage, we will implement a hybrid packaging approach in which a 993-actuator DM, HV amplifier, multiplexer components, and power supplies will all be co-located on a common multi-layered circuit board. With this driver we will demonstrate both low power consumption (~300mW) and high precision (~10pm). In the second stage of integration, we will design, fabricate, and test a High Voltage Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (HV-ASIC) version of the multiplexing architecture using a commercial foundry.

        "abstract": "The Electromagnetic Plasmoid Thruster (EMPT) is a revolutionary electric propulsion thruster and power processing (PPU) system that will allow a dramatic decrease in system mass and increase in thrust efficiency over traditional 500-3000 W propulsion systems. The high specific power (&gt;700 W/kg) and high efficiency of EMPT will enable a wide range of deep space missions such as Neptune, Pluto and Oort Cloud orbital insertion. Additionally, a solar electric EMPT system would dramatically increase the capability and reduce the travel time of an asteroid or Martian moon sample and return mission due to the variable-power, low-mass propulsion system. The EMPT employs a Rotating Magnetic Field (RMF) to produce large plasma currents inside a conical thruster creating a plasmoid that is magnetically isolated from the thruster walls. The intensified gradient magnetic field from the plasmoid together with the large plasma currents result in an enormous body force that expels the plasmoid at high velocity. The EMPT is a pulsed device, nominally operating at 1 kWe with 0.5-1 Joule discharges at 1-2 kHz. Presented is a full description of the relevant plasma physics as well as the thruster and PPU design. The Phase I EMPT demonstrated the multi-pulse formation and ejection of plasmoids at 0.1-3 Joules and 500-6,000 s Isp on both Xenon and Argon. Additionally, it demonstrated zero erosion or life limiting phenomena. The focus of the proposal is the experimental validation of an integrated thruster and PPU operating in a steady-state mode. The EMPT will be characterized over a range of parameters: input power from 200-3000 Watts, and 1,500-4,000 seconds specific impulse. The integrated thruster and PPU to be built and tested will have a total system mass of less than 1.5 kg. Successful completion of Phase II will be a fully integrated, steady-state demonstration of thruster and integrated power processing. Phase II will mature the technology from a TRL level 4 to 6.",

A basic requirement is that samples be returned in pristine, uncontaminated condition, necessitating development of a canister system capable of maintaining cleanliness and seal integrity through a variety of environments. Further development of the Sealed Planetary Return Canister (SPRC), is proposed after a successful Phase 1 program. Besides providing a high integrity seal, the canister incorporates features for robotic manipulation and to allow the sample to be accessed in a controlled manner upon return to Earth. The SPRC seal system addresses the two most significant concerns for planetary samples?seal surfaces contaminated by the sample and high pressure due to the phase change of volatiles. The SPRC incorporates a novel sealing system evolved from the only marginally successful Apollo indium knife edge seal approach but with added features to address the difficulties and inconsistencies observed. The indium is contained within a protective barrier to prevent against contamination, and the knife edge is mechanically cleaned during the sealing process. The container body can be configured to accommodate a variety of samples including rock cores, rock fragments, regolith, dust, and frozen soil. Atmospheric samples can also be preserved. The design is readily scalable and adaptable to specific missions. The prototype developed in Phase 1 demonstrated a leakage rate of less than 1e-6 cc-atm/s, meeting the primary science requirement.",

In response to the need for a compact, low mass, low power, and low weight-on-bit coring device, Honeybee Robotics proposes to continue development of an arm-deployed and arm-stabilized rotary-percussive coring tool. By using a robotic arm to deploy the coring tool into rock or soil targets and stabilize the tool while operating, the coring tool&#039;s internal deployment (or &quot;z&quot;) axis and external stabilization devices can be removed, resulting in a more compact, lower mass device. Also, adding percussion to the coring tool will reduce average weight-on-bit and energy consumption over the duration of the coring operation. The flexibility afforded from a rover or lander arm to target outcroppings, and the relatively higher TRL of surface coring tools (vs. deeper subsurface drills), make surface coring, especially with an arm-deployed coring tool, a particularly attractive option for near term planetary exploration.During Phase I, a preliminary coring tool design was developed that weighs less than 5 kg and meets all of the current MSR requirements. Breadboard testing also demonstrated the feasibility of arm-deployed and stabilized coring.The objectives of Phase II are to further develop, demonstrate and characterize a TRL 5/6 MSR-compatible coring tool. The rotary-percussive coring tool will weigh less than 5 kg, be arm-deployed and stabilized, include a passive linear feed device, require less than 50 N weight-on-bit, produce and capture 1 cm diameter by 5 cm long cores, accommodate active bit change-out and passive bit release, and positively retain cores in core tubes when removed from the bit.

        "abstract": "Bear Engineering proposes to advance the development of an innovative high torque, low speed, direct drive motor in order to meet NASA&#039;s requirements for such devices.  Fundamentally, all electric motors basically work on the same electromagnetic principle: a tangential electromagnetic force attracts the rotor to the stator.  Just when the rotor field is closest to the stator field and the electromagnetic attraction is greatest, the power is interrupted and another set of magnetic poles repeats the cycle.  Furthermore, the two magnetically attracted elements never make contact, which would otherwise offer the highest force of attraction.The proposed novel motor design, successfully demonstrated at TRL 4 in Phase 1, operates and behaves entirely differently from all other known electric motor designs and is capable of producing incredibly high, direct drive torques at low rotational speeds.  Its operational performance is similar to that of a stepper motor with a 1000:1 gearhead attached, but the similarity ends there.  The motor is configured such that its length to diameter aspect ratio is opposite that of traditional motors as it has a relatively large diameter and short axial length; this offers all new packaging opportunities.  The design also allows for a single, large diameter bearing pair to be used for the motor&#039;s output shaft which renders it stiff enough to directly mount the driven elements.  The need for additional bearing supports and bearing mounting structure is thus eliminated.  By the end of Phase 2, the system will be designed,  developed and tested at TRL 6 with Mars environmental conditions.",

Rendezvous of a vehicle with a sample canister in order to return the canister to Earth requires a variety of complex mathematical processing on a changing data set, coupled with the need to safely and effectively handle a large range of off-nominal conditions and spacecraft faults. Light speed delay isolates the spacecraft from real-time operator intervention, while inertial and situational uncertainties demand reactivity not required of typical spacecraft sequencing systems. These mission features call for a new class of sequence capability: Reactive Rendezvous and Docking Sequencer (RRDS).RRDS  melds the rule-based reactivity needed for rendezvous and docking with sequence characteristics common to more traditional missions. Rules watch for conditions in order to react to the current situation, allowing a wide range of complex activities and safety-related responses to be concisely represented without complex procedural programming. Responsibility for commanding elements aboard the spacecraft is divided among sequenced state machines called managers, coordinated together by a flight director which the ground commands.Underlying flight software for navigation, thruster allocation, inertial checking, attitude estimation and control, contact detection, docking mechanisms, and the like receive direction from the managers. This mediated control causes the system to reactively operate in modes with proper ordering of activities. Reactive operations are represented explicitly by states and transitions defining the managers, and do not require use of explicitly timed activities.Phase II of this SBIR will produce a Class B version of the underlaying VML 2.2 flight software capable of executing the RRDS state machines.

Building upon our Phase I feasibility study, we propose to implement an advanced cathode material in practical Li-ion batteries. The cathode material offers superior electrochemical performance over its commercially used counterpart, particularly in terms of discharge capacity and energy density. In Phase I, working in collaboration with a leading university-based researcher, we demonstrated that intrinsic modifications in the crystal structure, and extrinsic modifications on the surface of cathode particles, can lead to energy densities greater than 1150 Wh/kg at room temperature and 800 Wh/kg at zero degrees C for the cathode powder. In the Phase II program, we intend to combine the intrinsic and extrinsic effects in the cathode material, which will deliver the needed energy density at low temperatures, along with other desirable attributes. This will represent a significant advancement of the state-of-the-art in cathode materials. The structural and morphological modifications introduced in the material will allow us to (i) maintain high energy and power density at low temperature (ii) lower the irreversible capacity loss and improve the efficiency, and (iii) further stabilize and enhance the safety of the cell. In Phase II, our university-based collaborator will fabricate and test small Li-ion pouch cells, which will help optimize the cathode material. In addition, prototype Li-ion cells with a capacity of ~ 5Ah will be fabricated and tested by a large Li-ion battery manufacturer and supplier to the aerospace industry.

State-of-the-art electrocatalysts do not meet MEA efficiency and lifetime requirements for NASA applications.  Advanced electrocatalysts are needed.  In the Phase I, Lynntech manufactured a binary nanoparticle surface decorated mixed oxide electrocatalyst with the optimal microstructure and demonstrated an MEA efficiency of&gt;90% (i.e., an electrolysis potential of 1.358 V/cell) at 200 mA/cm2.  In the Phase II program, Lynntech will investigate different catalyst morphologies to improve the lifetime.  In addition, ternary transition metal oxides will be incorporated into the mixed oxide to further increase the efficiency and lifetime.  The applicability of this advanced catalyst to different membranes will be investigated.  Nanocomposite membranes with low hydrogen gas cross-over will be manufactured and tested.  A short electrolyzer stack will be assembled with the optimized components, tested and delivered to NASA.",

In Phase I, we have proven the feasibility of implementing a compact, low power and high performance S band receiver front end based on CMOS- MEMS components. Specifically, we conducted link budget analysis to define the radio requirements for different applications, including low data rate voice, data/telemetry and high data rate, high definition video transceiving. We also identified and optimized the receiver front end architecture (i.e. a low-IF architecture), and analyzed its electrical performance based on known properties of individual CMOS- MEMS components. Finally, we fabricated two key components, a high quality factor MEMS band pass filter and a mixer-filter, and validated their performances. Phase II will be focusing on performance improvements of individual device and the whole receiver front end. We will also implement a fully integrated receiver based on the radio- on- a-chip solution, and characterize its performance.",

The theta-D filter and the cost based filter, CBF, were developed and used in various orbit determination scenarios.  The scenarios were application to low Earth orbit, range only, and range and range rate estimation.  The modified state observer was also developed to estimate uncertainty in the dynamic model besides estimation of orbital states.Phase I research showed that there is a problem with the linear-like form that is used by many nonlinear filters such as the State Dependant Riccati Equation filter (SDRE filter), and the theta-D and CBF.  A study of the observability led to important discoveries about the lack of observabilty in some formulations.  Detailed study of the working of the proposed nonlinear filters in terms of observability and their application to more precise orbit determination and model uncertainty estimation will be undertaken in Phase II.Also learned from Phase I, IST-Rolla will focus more on how and where these nonlinear filters can help NASA.  There will be three main applications studied during Phase II:  interplanetary orbit determination, space debris tracking, and interplanetary landing spacecraft tracking.  These applications were chosen because of their relevance to current NASA missions and the nonlinearity of the measurements involved should show the need for the nonlinear filters. Furthermore, working algorithms and software will be given to NASA to test on ongoing applications.",

The Phase 1 effort exceeded expectations, with the device demonstrating reliable ignition of both hydrogen and propane fuels, and achieving in excess of 1 million impact cycles (40,000 start cycles) during fatigue testing without measureable degradation.  Several spin-off concepts were also identified that provide additional options for improving spark ignition system design.  For Phase 2, IES proposes an accelerated, 18 month effort to refine design concepts and analysis tools, and then develop specific ignition system designs for two customer applications, with the intention of having these ignition systems demonstrated in engine ground testing during Phase 2 and ready to start flight qualification immediately following the Phase 2 effort.  Both customers (United Launch Alliance and Pratt Whitney Rocketdyne) have expressed interest and commitment in participating in the Phase 2 activity, making engines and facilities available for development testing, and integrating any resulting viable products into their flight engines.  The ULA application is a new gaseous bipropellant H2/O2 attitude control thruster, for which the piezoelectric igniter is ideal as a simple, direct ignition source.  The PWR application is for an evolved RL-10 study currently underway, for which the piezoelectric system might be scaled up or used as a pilot igniter for a torch, or make use of another spin-off concept that was identified during the Phase 1 effort.  The timing of this Phase 2 effort coincides perfectly with near term needs of both these customers, as well as for other small engine applications in work to replace catalytic hydrazine engines with bi-propellant engines that will require a simple and reliable ignition source.",

By eliminating the need for a concentrated solar energy system, the ACE reactor offers a significantly lowers system mass and removes the need to keep optical surfaces clean.

The costs associated with the acquisition of major aircraft require a long usage period in order to obtain a good return on investment. The commercial and military aircraft fleets are inspected and maintained to produce a long operational life. However, many of the NDE techniques are slow, tedious, and costly.   Interestingly, the technologies used to inspect aircraft to detect flaws are quite sophisticated, but tools for keeping track of these flaws, their location, and evolution over time are haphazard and inspection-specific, so they are not easily generalized to inspections in general.We propose to leverage our machine vision technology to help automate portions of the inspection process to greatly reduce the time and cost associated with the inspection task.   In this approach, machine vision is used to localize the sensor scan information gathered during inspection so that it can be viewed and manipulated in the context of a 3D CAD model of the inspected object.   This then helps support the prediction of flaw propagation and structure life.

The vortices produced when atmospheric waves &quot;break&quot; can have diameters of 900-1200ft and tangential velocities of 70-85 ft/sec. CAT is dangerous to aircraft, recently demonstrated by United flight 967 from Washington-Dulles to Los Angeles on July 21, 2010, which encountered severe turbulence and landed in Denver with over 30 injured passengers, 21 requiring a hospital visit. Many other turbulence incidents have caused injuries or deaths to passengers and crew. Another recently-highlighted hazard is the inadequacy of current airspeed sensors on commercial aircraft. Federal investigators have reported that on at least a dozen recent flights by U.S. jetliners, malfunctioning equipment made it impossible for pilots to know how fast they were flying. A similar issue is believed to have played a role in the June 2009 crash of Air France 447 that killed all 228 people aboard. Michigan Aerospace Corporation (MAC) proposes the Molecular Air Data and Clear Air Turbulence (MADCAT) system which will be capable of providing not only a look-ahead capability to predict clear air turbulence but also a full air data solution (airspeed, angle of attack, angle of sideslip, pressure and temperature). The technology has already been demonstrated in-flight, confirming its ability to measure these air-data parameters. In addition, ground units based upon the same core technology have demonstrated the ability to detect atmospheric turbulence. MAC&#039;s direct-detection UV LIDAR technology uses molecular backscatter and does not require airborne particles and/or vapor to be suspended in the air, as other proposed solutions based on radar and LIDAR do. This Phase 2 project will result in a laboratory test model of MADCAT and a plan for subsequent airborne testing.",

        "abstract": "Loss of control is a significant cause of aviation accidents attributed to a large percentage of fatalities in the commercial aviation sector. Recently, Barron Associates, Inc. (BAI) has developed a system for unmanned aerial vehicles that autonomously executes recovery strategies to rapidly restore nominal flight. During Phase I, BAI sought to extend this system to manned vehicles by developing a joint human-automated (H/A) system. The goal of this system is to assist the crew during the recovery process by conveying information about recovery procedures in an intuitive and unobtrusive manner. BAI developed crew-specific extensions to the automated system both at the architecture and interface level. The architecture defines what information is delivered to the crew. The interface defines how this information is presented to the crew. Metrics were defined to measure the quality of the recovery and crew experience. Phase I pilot-in-the-loop experiments have shown there is the potential for significant performance gains and workload reduction if the joint H/A recovery system is used to guide the pilot through the recovery process. Phase I experiments were limited in scope. During Phase II, BAI would like to build upon these results by demonstrating that gains become even more pronounced in a realistic cockpit environment. This will require migrating to a higher-quality simulator and more accurately simulating the duties of the crew. The team will target ATPs (Airline Transport Pilots) during Phase II and expand the subject population so that the benefit of the system can be explicitly quantified. While integration into the cockpit is the ultimate goal for this system, BAI believes that the joint H/A recovery system can be of immediate use as a training aid. As part of the experimental build-up, BAI would also like to show that the use of the joint H/A recovery system during training translates into improved pilot recoveries when the system is not active.",

To address this problem, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Joint Planning and Development Office are developing the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). NextGen will enable critical advances to the current management of the National Airspace (NAS). The technologies that comprise NextGen offer the possibility of compelling new systems of systems that, if properly designed, will not only enhance the capabilities of the NAS but also improve its safety. At the same time, these fundamental changes bring with them implications for safety and security. In order to address these concerns, new techniques for the certification of software systems will be required to ensure that certification cost will not limit the safety innovations offered by NextGen advances. In Phase I, Barron Associates investigated the integration of ADS-B and TCAS as a representative NextGen system of systems and investigated the application of the system safety case to the system.In the proposed Phase II research, Barron Associates will develop a new collision-avoidance system and conduct an empirical study of the system safety case compared to DO-178B compliance as a certification approach. Throughout the development of the new collision-avoidance system, evidence in support of DO-178B compliance as well as in support of the safety case will be gathered. Using the data from this evidence collection together with the data collected during development, the team will answer key research questions that center on the use of the system safety case as an alternative means for airworthiness certification.",

The system provides energy-dense, low volume hydrocarbon fuel conditioning based on the hydrolysis reaction of triethylaluminum (TEA) with water.  TEA is an organometallic liquid that reacts exothermically with water and burns readily in air.  In Phase 1, we demonstrated the hydrolysis of TEA in JP fuel within an integrated mixing/injection apparatus to heat and vaporize the liquid hydrocarbon fuel prior to injection in a regeneratively cooled scramjet, as well as auto-ignition of the mixture at elevated TEA concentrations.  In Phase 2 we propose to more completely characterize the performance capability of the Phase 1 system using several hydrocarbon fuels to gather data for the design and fabrication of a palletized system.  Testing of the palletized system in a direct connect scramjet rig will then be conducted to demonstrate engine ignition capability and to compare the system to other ignition systems under consideration for scramjet vehicles.   Packaging in candidate flight vehicles will be carried out using 3D solid modeling to provide gravimetric and volumetric information and to provide designs for practical integrated, safe storage and dispense arrangements.",

The various levels of fidelity available in the code for aeroelastic modeling will range from CFD-based (both grid-based and a novel particle-based method) simulation to reduced-order aeroelastic models based upon Volterra series representations and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). The application of the proposed innovations spans the range of flight, from high-speed transport vehicles, to small-scale, flapping Micro-Air vehicles. Anticipated results include 1) the further validation and implementation of the proposed novel time-reduced order models into the existing ASTE-P solver framework (which already includes the various level fidelity mentioned above), 2) application of the proposed work to large-scale simulation and comparison with experiment, and 3) advancement of the state of knowledge for nonlinear problems in aeroelasticity in both the subsonic, low Reynolds number regime and transonic high Reynolds number regime.",

This nonlinear aeroelastic solver is generated by interacting a nonlinear structural Reduced Order Model (ROM) with a Neural-Network-based (NN-based) aerodynamic ROM and a gust ROM to provide the incremental aeroelastic forces and moments of a classical flight dynamics model. In this way, the flight dynamics model is kept with minimum changes so that this integrated flight dynamics simulation remains in the frame work of a 6-degrees-of-freedom simulation environment.  The nonlinear structural ROM employs an ELSTEP/FAT procedure that operates on a commercial nonlinear finite element software to construct the nonlinear stiffness matrices.  The NN-based and gust aerodynamic ROM is generated using a system identification technique operating on a CFD code to evaluate the weights and biases in a two-layer feed-forward NN system.  The end product is called FuNL-DFS that can simulate the key aeroelastic coupling mechanism between nonlinear structural dynamics and nonlinear unsteady aerodynamics with classical rigid body dynamics and can be used for control law development, maneuvering flight simulation, flight loads prediction and handling quality assessment.

By working with Prof. Ding at Lehigh University, PI will explore fundamental limits to quantum efficiencies for up-conversion detection at 1.57 microns. She will implement, characterize, and optimize single up-conversion device capable of detecting 1.57 microns and 1.27 microns. She plans to achieve detections of CO2 and O2 using implemented up-conversion device. She will investigate fundamental limits to noises for up-conversion detections. She will compare among PPLN, PPKTP, and PPLT as up-conversion media. She will expand detection wavelengths to cover ranges of 1-1.8 microns and 3-4 microns. She plans to introduce novel techniques for improving performances of up-conversion devices. She will investigate versatility of up-conversion devices under harsh environments. To achieve all these objectives, she has laid out a detailed work plan describing all the specific tasks necessary. Through optimizations, she will achieve the quantum efficiency of 50%, dark count rate of 50 Hz, bandwidth of GHz, electrical consumption of&lt;1 W, weight of&lt;1 lb, and dimension of 7x4x4 (all in inches).",

        "abstract": "In Sub-topic X4.01, NASA has identified a need for advanced radiation-shielding materials and structures to protect humans from the hazards of galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) and Solar Energetic Particles (SEP) on long-duration missions, outside the earth&#039;s magnetosphere. The radiation species of greatest interest are light ions (particularly protons), heavy ions (such as iron-56) and neutrons. International Scientific Technologies, Inc., in conjunction with the College of William and Mary, in its Phase I program developed lightweight, multi-layered, polymeric shielding against GCR and SEP.  The Phase II objectives include analysis and design of single and multi-layered nanocomposite polymeric radiation shields using OLTARIS modeling protocols to supplement the empirical results of Phase I, fabrication of nanocomposite films and multi-layered structures, acquisition of families of test data to determine key parameters of single and multi-layered structures tailored to stopping GCR and SEP, optimization of prototype multi-layered polymeric shields using statistical design and OLTARIS modeling for a range of manned and unmanned NASA applications prior to commercialization in Phase III.  The anticipated result of the Phase I and Phase II programs is the development of multi-layered shields with an outer layer of hydrogenous polymeric material for significant dose reduction of incident GCR ions and inner layers of polymeric composites containing additives chosen to moderate and absorb neutrons resulting from fragmentation of incoming heavy ions and to absorb short wavelength electromagnetic radiation resulting from the slowing of the GCR particles and capture of neutrons.  The Technology Readiness Level (TRL) at the beginning of Phase II is 4. At the end of Phase II, the TRL will be 5.",

        "abstract": "Folded Structures Company (FSC) has developed an innovative design approach for multi-laminate, primary and secondary structures for planetary habitats that integrates the dynamic deployment means with the static structural design using an advanced mathematical folding theory.  The design approach holds the promise of a much simpler expandable structure that is both lightweight and compactable (low delivery volume) and yet capable of extending into an expansive volume.  FSC research supports the utilization of a new class of deployable, space-based structures that utilize an advanced folding methodology as the primary engineering and assembly method combined with the use of both single and multi-laminate sheet materials.  The proprietary patterning algorithms create tessellations for planar sheets that articulate dynamically on the edges of the tessellation allowing for uniform deployment across the entire sheet.  Previous to the development of these algorithms, there was no general system for generating doubly periodic folded structures.  Based on results from a previous NASA SBIR project, FSC will apply its proprietary folding techniques and software to the broad topic of expandable habitat structures.  The Phase I project has resulted in a design concept for the expandable bladder section of the proposed lunar habitat that also integrates the flooring into a single deployable structure.",

The proposed technology developed at Integrated Micro Sensors Inc is based on laser-assisted fabrication of Micro Column Arrays (MCA) on the surface of the two materials prior to bonding. There are several advantages of the MCA technology in the drastic improvement of any bond: (i) mechanical strength increases due to interlocking of the adhesive or brazing material between micro columns, (ii) the bond strength increases due to the increase of the specific surface area by more than an order of magnitude, (iii) stability increases due to the inherent elasticity of the micro cones during a deformation, (iv) increase in the bond durability because of the repeated bend contours of the surface preventing hydrothermal failure, (v) wettability of the material surface significantly improves due to the highly developed surface morphology at the micro and submicron level and changes in local chemistry as a result of surface oxidation. Based on the feasibility proven in the Phase I project, this Phase II project will focus on implementation of the proposed technology for newest materials developed up to date and scaling of the proposed technology to large area and complex shape FRP composite structural joints.

Current instruments for such in-situ analysis, however, require that geological samples be brought to the surface by a sample acquisition tool and subsequently processed and presented to the analyzer. This model has significant limitations with regard to science yield: evaporation of volatile molecules before reaching the instrument, loss of stratigraphic information, sample bias, and cross-contamination. Furthermore, sophisticated sample acquisition, processing and handling mechanisms required to operate in uncontrolled, dusty environments are expensive and failure-prone.We therefore propose an alternative: bring the instrument to the sample. Specifically, we propose development of a fiber-coupled laser-induced breakdown spectrometer (LIBS) system, integrated into a 3m-class drill. LIBS uses a high-energy laser pulse to create a plasma on the surface of the material under test; the atomic emissions are collected by a spectrometer and yield elemental composition and basic molecular information.

During the long lunar day, the thermal management system must remove the waste heat from the electronics and batteries keep them within the acceptable temperature limit. Since the heater power availability is restricted, a variable thermal link is therefore required to limit the amount of heat that is removed from the electronics and radiated to space during the long lunar night. Conventional Loop Heat Pipes (LHPs) can provide the required variable thermal conductance, but they consume electrical power to shut down the heat transfer.  Our innovation adds a Thermal Control Valve (TCV) to the LHP, allowing it to passively shut off without consuming any electrical power.  This is important since there is a severe penalty for electrical power consumption: supplying 1 W in a photovoltaic system requires roughly 5 kg of extra equipment.  The TCV used in the LHP has been previously selected for thermal control in the pumped loop on the Mars Science Laboratory. The Phase I project was successful in demonstrating the feasibility of integrating the TCV in a LHP. The Phase II project will fabricate and test a LHP with a TCV at representative conditions, bringing the technology to TRL 6.

The MESFET-based LDO component has very competitive figures of merit (dropout voltage, transient response, power supply rejection) compared to existing components. During Phase 1 we confirmed that the components were unconditionally stable without an external compensation capacitor over the temperature range -196C to +150C and for radiation doses up to 1 Mrad(Si). We shall build on the Phase 1 design effort to demonstrate two fully integrated LDO regulators rated up to 1A with dropout voltages of less than 50 mV.

The enhanced low dose rate sensitivity (ELDRS) of the components will be studied using a low dose rate Cs-137 source. The characteristics of all the components will be documented, and parts made available to NASA and potential customers as deliverables from the Phase 2 activity.

The system solution for conventional seals represents a compromise between the turbopump mechanical design, primarily flowpath, and secondary flowpath design that results in increased leakage, increased seal wear, and reduced balance piston load capacity that reduces performance, throttle-ability, thrust-to-weight, reliability, and operability.  The magnetically actuated seal eliminates this compromise and provides significant improvement in performance, throttle-ability, thrust-to-weight, reliability, and operability.  Phase 1 resulted in a significant advancement of the technology by demonstrating a magnetically actuated face seal in both ambient and cryogenic conditions, characterizing the seal and actuator performance, and quantifying the performance improvements for the turbopump and engine.

The path forward is the development of new concepts in both materials and design that enables the fabri-cation of high-efficiency, cost-effective solar cells. A new approach to improving PV efficiency is to concentrate the light in such a way that the density of photons hitting the cell is substantially increased. This can be achieved by fabricating a plasmonic resonance cavity as part of each cell. The plasmonic structures make use of local field enhancement to concentrate photons at the PV junction. These junctions can then be stacked, as has been demonstrated previously, to convert photons over the full solar spectrum.

        "abstract": "MSI&quot;s Phase I efforts demonstrated a concept for massively distributed social problem-solving that we propose to develop into a full-featured framework enabling communities to form solutions to complex, multi-factor problems. The ePluribus Solver is motivated by the&quot;wisdom of the crowds&quot;philosophy that proposes that a solution can emerge from a large, diverse group that is superior to a solution formed by a small group. We believe that if society is given a sufficient framework they will be able to collectively address many of the world&quot;s challenges. ePluribus is designed to leverage the&quot;viral&quot;nature of social networks that causes ideas to spread rapidly and provide incentives to engage individuals in the problem solving process. The framework provides minimalist building-blocks for problem-solving while encouraging the emergence of new problem-solving processes. ePluribus enables users to collaboratively decompose complex problems into manageable components and work on them asynchronously. It then recomposes the components to form a collective solution from the diverse contributions and feedback of many problem-solvers. The fully featured ePluribus framework will manage the complexities of motivating, coordinating and integrating distributed solvers, allowing people to concentrate on what they do best  reason about problems matched to their intuition, skills and experiences.",

        "abstract": "Power amplifiers that provide both high linearity and high efficiency are essential for the transmission of high data-rate, bandwidth efficient signals used in MILSATCOM and avionics communications.   Achieving this objective at millimeter-wave frequencies remains particularly challenging.  Linearizer Technology, Inc. (LTI) in conjunction with L-3 Communications Corporation, Electron Devices Division (L-3 EDD) is proposing to develop a TWTA based transmitter including a block up-converter/linearizer (MPM-T) covering the frequency from 43.5 to 45.5 GHz with a linear output power&gt;50 watts and an associated overall efficiency&gt;30%.  This transmitter will have a weight&lt;15 lbs and a volume&lt;0.5 cu. ft. when housed in an air-cooled, weather resistant package suitable for antenna mounting.  Transmitter&quot;s linear performance will be based on supporting Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM).  A transmitter goal will be an amplitude modulation/phase modulation ratio (AM/PM) of less than 1.5 degrees /dB from small signal up to saturation across the band.  This work will be based on L3-EDD&quot;s success in producing Q-band microwave power modules (MPMs) and LTI&quot;s experience in producing linearizers for use at Q-band and with QAM at lower bands.    In the first phase LTI designed a linearizer, optimized for operation with EDD&quot;s EHF MPM&quot;s TWT with QAM modulation.  Simulation and testing showed this linearized MPM could achieve an AM/PM of&lt;1  degrees /dB, and with 16QAM a spectral regrowth of&lt;TBD at 2 dB OPBO and an error vector magnitude (EVM) of TBD at 2 dB OPBO.  The L-3 EDD multi-collector miniature EHF TWTA produced for Phase I achieved a DC efficiency of&gt;40%.      BENEFIT:  Modern communications systems use complex modulation schemes, such as QAM, to increase bandwidth utility (efficiency in bit/Hz).  These bandwidth efficient signals have a non-constant envelope with high peak-to-average power ratios (PAR).  Power amplifiers made for these modulations must be highly linear in order to minimize distortion that degrades adjacent channel signals and signal transmission quality (bit error rate).  To achieve the required level of linearity, it is common practice to operate amplifiers at a reduced power level or high output power backoff (OPBO).  The consequences of this approach are a very low efficiency, over-sized and heavy transmitters/amplifiers and power supplies, extra unnecessary heat generation, and higher costs.  At millimeter-wave these factors can make a communication system impractical to implement, particularly for power-consumption-sensitive applications such as SATCOM and avionic/mobile communication platforms.     This project will ultimately provide a compact EHF linear high power transmitter, which currently does not exist.  It will result in greater millimeter-wave power with reduced size, weight, cost and prime power over that available with current technology.  The benefits multiply with the need for linearity.  The greater the linearity required, the greater the return.  The target linearity of the proposed transmitter will improve upon current SATCOM specifications.  Greater than a two to three times increase in effective efficiency over present millimeter-wave power amplifiers is anticipated.    This technology also has value for both space-borne as well as ground-based systems.  The resulting MPM-T will be of great value in all Q-band/EHF communication systems where bandwidth efficiency and power consumption is of concern.  Portable, mobile and airborne communications systems will be prime candidates for integration of this technology.",

        "abstract": "Army helicopter pilots are inundated with information in the cockpit, and more is coming. But simply providing more information is not always the answer. With new technology constantly pushing more information into the cockpit, there is an ever-increasing demand for smarter management of that information before it overwhelms the pilot. Most cockpit displays require a pilot to navigate a series of screens to gather situational awareness for a decision. The time a user spends navigating these displays is less time spent building situational awareness. This proposal aims to improve helicopter pilots situational awareness and reduce pilot workload by reducing the time to find relevant information and decreasing the amount of irrelevant information presented to a pilot. To accomplish this, we will develop an Aviators Intelligent Assistant (AIA) that manages the amount and type of information sent to the display. The core of AIA is a domain-independent, context-sensitive display management component. AIA will also have application-specific interface layers for different data sources (e.g., Blue Force Tracker) and different display systems (e.g., Electronic Data Manager). By the end of Phase II, we will have an evaluated TRL6 beta version of AIA that is integrated onboard PM Air Warriors Electronic Data Manager.",

The ISDC builds on the original SDC concept by adding coolant layers so that it can be integrated with the pumped fluid loop on the rest of the vehicle.

        "abstract": "Adverse aeroservoelastic interaction is a problem on aircraft of all types causing repeated loading, enhanced fatigue, undesirable oscillations and catastrophic flutter. Traditionally, to suppress adverse aeroservoelastic interaction, notch and/or roll off filters are used in the primary flight control system architecture. This solution has pitfalls; rigid body performance is degraded due to resulting phase penalty and it is not robust to off nominal behavior. In Phase I, an approach was developed that is entitled, Modal Isolation and Damping for Adaptive Aeroservoelastic Suppression (MIDAAS). This adaptive technique determines an optimal blend of multiple outputs that effectively isolates a problematic lightly damped mode and simultaneously determines an optimal blend of multiple inputs to suppress the problematic mode via feedback. Adverse effects on aircraft rigid body performance are minimized, resulting in virtually no phase penalty. MIDAAS was validated against aeroservoelastic F/A-18C aircraft models with varying stores configurations and demonstrated very successful performance. In the proposed Phase II program, a robust real-time adaptive aeroservoelastic suppression solution will be developed with a buildup approach that includes further MIDAAS enhancements, extensive validation studies utilizing a high-fidelity CFD-based aeroelastic model of the NASA X-53 aircraft, and extensive validation studies utilizing real-time pilot in the loop simulation capability.",

The MAMRs use an innovative flow channel configuration and novel micromachining technologies to achieve very high thermal and flow performance.  In Phase I we proved the feasibility of our approach by demonstrating critical fabrication methods for the micromachined regenerator and its thermal and flow performance through detailed analysis.  In Phase II we will build and demonstrate a full-scale micromachined regenerator for a prototype AMRR system that can provide 70 mW of cooling near 2 K.

OKSI teamed with Scripps Institution of Oceanography to define and design a sensor that explicitly meets the performance requirements needed for ocean remote sensing of coastal regions, but can also be used for terrestrial remote sensing.  Specifically, some key requirements called for: 1) high spatial resolution (< 1 meter), 2) high spectral resolution (< 10 nm), UV \u0096 NIR coverage (300 \u0096 1000 nm), 4) high sensitivity for low reflectivity of ocean surfaces, 5) provide simultaneous downwelling solar radiation measurements, and 6) allow for operating mode that avoids specular reflections off ocean surface.  \nThe AquaScan design was completed during the Phase I effort.  During Phase II the sensor will be manufactured, tested, calibrated, and prepared for flight testing.  The system will then be demonstrated during several airborne tests off the Southern California coast.  The tests will include measurements of spatially/spectrally unique ocean phenomena including red tide blooms and river plume run-offs after heavy rain storms.

        "abstract": "Optical Physics Company (OPC) has developed new silicon carbide (SiC) foam-based optics with hybrid skins that are composite, athermal and lightweight (FOCAL) that provide an enabling capability for performing NASA space missions that will require 2 to 3 meter class cryogenic mirrors for infrared telescopes.  The key development in the Phase I program was the replacement of OPC monolithic SiC skins with SiC fiber reinforced/SiC CVD hybrid skins on 1.5\" coupons, 4\" flat and then 12\" powered optics.  This innovation avoids scale-up problems that include the inherent stress in the monolithic skins which can result in skin cracking during the substrate manufacturing and finishing processes, the non-uniformity of the .040\"-.050\" thick monolithic skins that typically require .010\"-.015\" of material removal before a continuous surface can be achieved for optical finishing, the long schedule of manufacturing the mirror substrate, and the large $2M/m2 cost to produce the polished mirror.  The hybrid skin technology provides increased skin strength and toughness to enable the foam based technology to produce meter class mirrors without skin cracking.  The manufacturing time and CVD chamber cost are reduced because premanufactured SiC fibers are used to provide the bulk of the skin mass rather than laying down a monolithic skin atom by atom via CVD.  The net effect is to produce a SiC FOCAL mirror substrate that is stronger, tougher, scalable to meter class, and potentially better than 50% faster and cheaper to manufacture.  OPC proposes to demonstrate that the hybrid skin technology developed in Phase I can be successfully applied to manufacture a 22\" diameter F/2 spherical SiC FOCAL hybrid skin substrate and then polish it into a precision mirror on a Phase II program.",

Our basic premises are that:(1) It is feasible to minimize the adverse effects of stress during combat and other traumatic exposure by a program combining cognitive training, and advanced HRV-based biofeedback; (2) minimizing the adverse effects of stress at the time of exposure will improve immediate performance and also help prevent the occurrence of post traumatic stress disorder; (3)  state-of-the-art handheld systems can provide new mobile means for delivering training and practice that can greatly enhance the effectiveness of the techniques by permitting on-the-spot refreshment and practice; and (4) presentation of cognitive and biofeedback content in motivating forms such as games, flash, and video will enhance the acceptance and thus the effectiveness of the overall system.  The Phase II program plan builds on the successful demonstration in Phase I of an end-to-end SRTS and on the positive feedback and offers of support received from several military activities involved in stress control.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The objective of this Phase II program is to develop a battery operated, friend or foe identification beacon (IFF Beacon) technology that is compact and can be worn on the warfighter as part of standard gear.  The IFF beacon will project a high brightness beam across a hemisphere allowing standard pods on military aircraft (Blackhawk, Apache, etc.) to detect and identify friendly troops on the ground.  In addition, the IFF beacon will have data transmission capability based on an IR pulsed laser that is fully integrated into the device.  This laser based beacon technology will allow the warfighter to project his position for long ranges up to 15-20 km.  The Aerius Photonics IFF beacon will be ruggedized for warfighter use and the hardware delivered to the customer at the end of the program.  BENEFIT:  The anticipated benefits of the technology are a reduction in SWaP and cost for a commercial grade system that is suitable for law enforcement, security, and search and rescue.  A comparable device does not currently exist.  The IFF laser beacon to be developed has many applications in defense and other markets. In addition to Department of Defense customers, the product would also be of use to police forces, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Coast Guard. During Phase II, Aerius will approach Prime DoD suppliers, as well as suppliers to police forces, DHS and the Coast Guard to establish sales and distribution channels addressing these markets. Early discussions with two Prime DoD suppliers, BAE Systems and Northrop Grumman have already taken place. Demand for the personnel tag devices market could grow to several thousand per month in a few years.",

The approach is analytically tractable, extremely bandwidth efficient, and gives rise to solutions which are both intuitive in structure and optimal in a well-defined sense, all essential attributes in providing a path to scalable and analyzable distributed processing architectures.  In Phase I of our program, a core DHTN reasoning engine was instantiated in software and evaluated extensively via simulation to establish its favorable performance characteristics for decision making accuracy, computational complexity, and robustness to practical processing constraints resulting from unreliable network performance.  In Phase II, we propose to develop the capability into a full distributed system prototype in which distributed services cooperate to optimize global network-level decision metrics.

This represents a tenfold increase in available power over CubeSats with body mounted solar panels. Insufficient power is one of the key limitations preventing CubeSats from meeting broader requirements for both military and commercial missions. The CASA design is based upon a multifunctional boom that deploys the panels and provides the articulation axis. The boom and panels are stowed on the sides of the CubeSat in the volume available in the P-POD launch envelope allocated for solar array panels. Conformance to the P-POD standard ensures that a wide range of CubeSat missions can utilize the CASA 50W 3U solar arrays. Additionally, the 3U design is a stand-alone module that can be integrated with other standard components to build a functional CubeSat. The CASA module can also be scaled up to fit 6U and 12U CubeSats. The CASA array will utilize mature triple-junction solar cell modules to reduce risk.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Researchers at the University of Missouri have developed a fluid-filled high power dielectric switch for pulsed power applications under Air Force sponsorship. For optimum operation, a switch should have a nearly constant breakdown voltage or low jitter. Many factors affect the jitter, and much effort has gone into switch design to eliminate vortices and static regions in the fluid. The best fill fluid was found to be MIL-PRF-87252 polyalphaolefin (PAO) coolant. In a Phase I SBIR program METSS demonstrated the technical feasibility of developing dielectric fluids with reduced breakdown jitter.  This was accomplished in two ways.  One involved chemical modification of the basestocks and additives used in the base fluid.  The other involved the addition of nanoparticles to the PAO coolant.  In an SBIR Phase II program METSS intends to build upon these technologies to develop dielectric fluids that are fully qualified for switch applications. The proposed program will also address additional issues related to material compatibility, personnel safety, environmental impact and use costs.  BENEFIT:  The development of new, successful, switch fluids will have both military and commercial uses. Military applications include modulators for high peak power electrical systems for manned and unmanned air vehicles, military radar drive circuits, directed energy systems. Commercial applications include modulators for high peak power electrical systems for high-speed rail traction, utility power distribution substations, power modulators for particle accelerators, and uninterruptible power supplies.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Emerging Directed Energy weapon systems are particularly attractive to Combat Commanders due to their graduated effects, light-speed propagation, minimum collateral damage and deep magazines relative to kinetic weaponry.  There are multiple efforts within the military which aim to demonstrate the efficacy of this technology.  Yet, the infrastructure to support DEW strike packages is only a fraction of that relegated to conventional kinetic munitions.  In particular, there is a need to improve the state-of-the-art in HPM/RF waveform selection through increased knowledge of target phenomenology, such that the optimal waveform is utilized in mission scenarios against a specific class, or classes, of targets    The Phase I effort established the feasibility and utility of analyzing unintended emissions of electronic devices to optimize HPM/RF DEW waveforms.  The researched technique provides a fundamentally new approach to HPM/RF waveform testing rather than an incremental benefit and is particularly well suited to automation. The Phase II effort therefore seeks to formalize the Phase I test technique through the development of an automated laboratory tool.  The developed test tool will be inherently low-cost, requiring little more than typical laboratory RF test equipment, and rely primarily on a novel exploitation of measured RF effect phenomena from the targeted device.  BENEFIT:  The proposed system has direct application to Department of Defense for counter-electronics and counter-HPM testing as well as the commercial EMI/RFI community.  For the military community, the system provides a fundamentally new mechanism to determine device susceptibility, offering a wealth of data which may be exploited to provide a greater effectiveness for DEW waveforms at a given power level.  This increased effectiveness is easily translated into a reduced size, weight or power of the weapon system, expanding the options for weapon platforms and concepts of operation.  Commercial laboratories will be provided an additional mechanism to determine the EMI/RFI compliance of critical components in aerospace, aviation and industrial safety.  The inherent low-cost of an automated laboratory system, coupled with the fundamentally new approach offered, promises a lowered barrier for market penetration of the developed product.",

The Air Force is seeking a low-loss ZBLAN fiber (ZrF4-BaF2-LaF3-AlF3-NaF composition) with wide spectral band optical transmission for satellite tracking systems. Expanding the detection range from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared wavelengths can substantially improve the satellite spectral identification. ZBLAN glass compositions, however, have high loss due to crystallization when fabricated on Earth. To address this Air Force need for low-loss ZBLAN glasses and optical fibers, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to prepare and conduct a ZBLAN fiber drawing experiment in low gravity on a Black Brand V type sounding rocket payload. An additional experiment with a similar ZBLAN glass host that is highly doped with active ions for laser applications will help to answer the question of whether crystallization of the perspective glass compositions could be suppressed enough to meet the low loss requirements for countermeasure applications when processed in low gravity. This Phase II project execution will utilize the available standard payload designs and will closely follow the established NASA program schedule for sounding rocket missions.  BENEFIT:  Through the confirmation of crystallization suppression in low gravity during fiber fabrication, the mission will open a pathway toward a unique opportunity to substantially expand the range of applicable fiber material compositions. Such compositions, including highly doped ZBLAN glasses with theoretical insertion loss orders of magnitude lower than in existing fibers, would enable high-power mid-infrared (mid-IR) lasers for a variety of DoD and civilian applications, including countermeasures, wideband hyperspectral imaging, industrial plastics processing, and medical laser treatment.",

The NCD is self-powered from its own battery and equipped with one or two microphones and a digital signal processing (DSP) chip to process the signals from the handset mic and the mics in the NCD.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This research focuses on providing a capability to perform rapid, semi-autonomous unmanned assessment of potential combat airstrips.  Current Tactics Techniques and Procedures require the operator to walk the runway and manually assess viability.  Soil hardness measurements are sampled manually along with marking of hazards to flight, which may occur along the runway as well as along approach and takeoff vectors.  To gain data of high quality and maximize mission success, operations are conducted at night in the shortest possible timeframe required.  The objective is to automate and shorten time required to produce the airfield survey data product by providing an autonomous system capable of surveying a 3,500-foot expedient runway in less than 90 minutes, in day and night conditions, reducing risk to operators on assault zone survey missions and increasing survey product quality.  BENEFIT:  Unmanned Ground Vehicles have shown promise enhancing a number of military missions; however most successful autonomous systems perform in highly structured environments.  To enable operations in militarily relevant, unstructured environments at an operational tempo, a number of obstacle avoidance and planning challenges must be overcome.  A viable autonomous system should require minimal supervisory control and operate across a variety of environments from off-road cross-country terrain to dynamic urban environments.   The enhanced behaviors and perception capabilities integrated under this effort to support the expedient airfield survey mission will further the goal of enabling operations in military relevant dynamic environments.    Commercial applications of this technology include the dull, dirty or dangerous tasks in the agriculture, mining or security markets.  The high reliability and system ruggedness needed for the airfield survey system will be a major step towards the requirements for the commercial market.",

This SBIR has the goal of developing ultra high strength stainless steels with mechanical properties equal to those of AerMet 100 and the corrosion resistance of PH 13-8 (H1025). The Phase I SBIR designed and modeled alloys along with demonstrating the feasibility of producing and testing laboratory scale quantities of the alloys. Two martensitic stainless steel type alloys containing 12 % Cr, 4-6% Ni were designed and produced using strengthening mechanisms of (1) secondary hardening and NiAl precipitates or (2) secondary hardening enhanced by Si additions. Testing results showed that the alloys with secondary hardening and NiAl precipitates had low toughness. Si additions had positive effects on secondary hardening, but Si should be used with Co additions instead of Ni to get improved strength and toughness. The proposed Phase II program involves producing/evaluating secondary hardening steels containing 12 % Cr, 10 %Co with Si or Al and producing/evaluating generic and actual landing gear component parts made from the new alloys.",

Although this approach is not new, it has not yet been efficiently applied to LWIR, and performance of existing devices is completely inadequate in this range. The Agiltron approach advances both the resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of MEMS FTIR spectrometers by orders of magnitude. Using the developed lamellar mirror chip it will be possible to produce a handheld Chemical Agent Detector with 1 ppb sensitivity. Based on Infrared Absorption Spectroscopy, this instrument will provide the advantages of being more sensitive, universal, reconfigurable and less prone to errors and false-positive alarms.  The viability of the technical approach was proven in Phase I through the design, fabrication, and demonstration of a functional spectrometer.

Such guns have been built and operated successfully, however several obstacles prevent them from widespread usage in the field. One specific obstacle is the development of suitable interface between the armature and conductor rails. Abrasion, arcs, molten armature, and balloting loads easily degrade bare surfaces. As a result multiple firings are not possible without repair/replacement of conductor rails. In order to maximize electrical/thermal conductivity, Cu alloys are likely inescapable. In order to minimize damage, a material with a high melting temperature and high density is essential. Therefore, a rail structure that most practically meets these requirements would have a Cu-based core and a refractory metal surface. However, issues associated with thermal expansion mismatch pose significant challenges. The Phase I study demonstrated fabrication of an innovative functional gradient material between the armature and conductor rails. However, additional efforts are needed to perfect the gradient and demonstrate high performance, full-scale conductor rails. A Phase II effort will optimize adhesion of functionally graded rails; investigate non-planar geometries; small caliber evaluation; and fabrication of 5 meter long rails.",

M2E2 tool-kit will be able to operate in real-time and faster-than-real-time modes with large numbers of simulated MUOS terminals, while rendering detailed behavioral representations of the MUOS and connected JTRS networks. At the end of phase II, we will demonstrate the use of M2E2 tool-kit for an integrated software/human in-the-loop simulation with real video and audio streams transferred in a simulated MUOS network.",

        "abstract": "Organophosphorus chemical warfare nerve agents (OP-CWA) are attractive to terrorist groups and rogue states as an inexpensive and accessible technology for chemical warfare.  OP-CWA and organophosphate pesticides cause severe neurological symptoms and death by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE); the resulting excess acetylcholine accumulates and overstimulates the human or animal body.  Other esterases and organophosphatases in the blood either bind (butyrylcholinesterase, BChE) or catalytically degrade (paraoxonase, PON1) OP-CWA.  Therefore, it is critically important to be able to quickly monitor the human blood complement of OP-CWA enzymes to assess both susceptibility and current condition.  For military and civilian clinical use, a high-throughput, minimally invasive assay system is needed to quickly and accurately screen large numbers of soldiers/agricultural workers/first responders for OP-CWA or OP-pesticide exposure.  The currently available WRAIR assay is high-throughput, uses a minimal amount of whole blood, and is sensitive and accurate for AChE and BChE levels.  An assay that additionally measures PON1 and albumin esterase activities relevant to OP degradation and/or binding is greatly needed to more fully assess OP-CWA or -pesticide susceptibility for individuals at risk.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The maximum data rates through store interfaces based on MIL-STD-1760 or other interface standards have been constrained by older data bus technology used in these interfaces.  This has limited or precluded the ability to conduct efficient and timely transfers of certain data types such as large map or image files, target templates, digitized video, etc., between platforms and weapons, consequently limiting weapon effectiveness and/or operational flexibility in many instances.  Recent incorporation of a high speed Fibre Channel based alternative data path into key store interface standards provides the potential to overcome such limitations.  Further work is needed, however, to adapt existing Fibre Channel networking technology (including switches, terminals, etc.) to this application, considering the unique requirements of evolving weapons and manned/unmanned platforms.  A preceding Phase I study analyzed relevant network functional requirements and implementation considerations, developed an adaptable Fibre Channel network architecture for satisfying the identified requirements, and assessed the state of technology needed to implement compliant networks.  A recommendation was made to demonstrate and verify the developed network architecture in a manner that would also provide a test and verification environment for future prototype components and networks.  This proposal describes a suggested Phase II effort to accomplish that recommendation.  BENEFIT:  The technology to be developed by this effort will facilitate improved mission effectiveness and operational flexibility for certain projected weapon types.  It also has potential commercial application in sensor integration on air and ground platforms.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) are emerging as a critical technology for the U.S. Air Force with increased endurance identified as an essential need to enable MAVs to execute meaningful missions.  Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries, the preferred energy storage device for MAVs, are not capable of providing sufficient energy while remaining within the highly constrained mass and volume budgets for MAVs.  Thus, significant advancements in lithium ion battery technologies (e.g., increased specific energy and power) are required to enable MAVs to execute their intended missions.   To address this need, ADA Technologies, Inc., proposes to continue advancements made in Phase I to develop high performance lithium-polymer batteries for MAVs.  The proposed Phase II program places a particular emphasis on the development of a highly conductive and stable ionic liquid gel polymer electrolyte.  When combined with advanced nanostructured electrodes, the proposed technology will provide substantially greater specific energy, cycle life and safety as compared to state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries.  The proposed program will establish material synthesis protocols, material scale-up, proof-of-concept cell production and demonstration and ultimately design and produce a full-scale prototype lithium-polymer battery pack for integration into a target test-bed platform.  BENEFIT:  The increased performance enabled by the proposed technology will allow for advanced lithium-ion batteries to meet performance objectives for U.S. Air Force micro air vehicles.  Furthermore, the developments undertaken will substantially improve the state-of-the-art of lithium-ion battery devices.  Thus if successful, the resulting technology could have substantial commercial impact as the overall market for energy storage devices is estimated to be in excess of $6B per year.  Spin-off applications include hybrid electric vehicles, utility grid applications, and personal electronics among others.",

The concept is a high-velocity, high-temperature metal-vapor torch (MVT), designed to focus its energy into a concentrated region or distribute energy into a prescribed pattern depending upon the target characteristics. The MVT can be mounted to a small, remote-controlled platform for close approach to the target or function as the ordnance package for a small, self propelled pyrophoric missile (PM) to attack targets at 10&quot;s of meters standoff distance. The ordnance package will include a miniature power supply, contact fuze and safe and arm device. The objectives are to: optimize the original MVT and PM design; develop derivatives that offer improved performance and functionality; and benchmark the MVT performance against multiple targets using equal volume, conventional warheads. The work plan is organized into the following three stages: component development and validation stage (designed to quickly mature the MVT ordnance package and PM propulsion system); system development and validation stage, which involves testing a realistic prototype in a relevant operational environment; and a technology transition stage.  BENEFIT:  The microscale ordnance technology has direct applications to developing more efficient energetic tools and devices for perforation and cutting operations in the oil exploration and production industry.

Nuvotronics will design and fabricate extremely low-profile, miniature feed networks and antenna arrays using the revolutionary PolyStrataTM manufacturing technology.  The PolyStrata microfabrication platform allows design and fabrication of millimeter wave (mmW) antennas and feed networks that meet the dimensional tolerances required at mmW frequencies with batch fabrication yielding 100&quot;s of antennas at a time, making volume manufacturing cost effective.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The objective of this SBIR project is to develop and demonstrate a first-principles-based Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) tool for the study of flow separation control over flexible lifting surfaces of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs). The Phase I effort successfully adapted and validated a DoD open source, CoBi, for multiple DNS cases involving transition to turbulence, flow separation, and coupling with flexible surfaces.  The fully coupled computational tool uses a DNS-based Navier-Stokes solver and a non-linear large deformation Finite Element-based structural solver to capture the flow physics around a flexible surface down to the Kolmogorov scale.   The Phase II effort will involve several key modeling improvements including: higher order spatial and temporal schemes, turbulent Reynolds-stress-based solution adaptation, sliding grids, and a non-inertial reference frame.   The aeroelasticity of an AFRL Generic MAV and its mass properties, aerodynamic coefficients, and stability derivatives will be analyzed using the coupled DNS-structural tool with the enhanced Phase II capabilities to complement an ongoing AFRL/MN MAV research effort.  A mini propulsive wing with crossflow fan will be studied using the sliding grid and solution adaptation capabilities to predict flow separation and transition to turbulence at high angles of attack.  With these new functionalities, the CoBi code could be used for wide range military applications in DoD, as well as commercial applications in civil aviation industry.  BENEFIT:  A capability to accurately predict and control the flow separation over a flexible lift surface of an MAV can lead to many potential commercial applications of MAV.  The designed MAV can be used in an urban warfare environment to conduct reconnaissance in areas not accessible to larger aircraft, such as areas within buildings, to identify and segregate military targets versus areas having high civilian concentrations.  It can also be used in environmental and traffic monitoring, countering drug trafficking, accident assessment, and wildlife/land management.  Other applications include inspecting high elevation monuments, monitoring risk of first fires, and more generally interventions in constrained and hazardous environments, where it would be dangerous to send a human agent.",

The proposed SBIR project puts forth two key innovations for a cost effective lasercom terminal architecture that meets or exceeds all requirements for pointing and accuracy, data rate, acquisition time, reliability, radiation tolerance, and operating temperature range in a compact low weight, low power package.  The first innovation is the three level filter tree that separates eight distinct receive and eight distinct transmit lines.  The second innovation is the selection of materials for a wide operating temperature range in space.      The main advantages are full bandwidth capability of each access lasercom link at 40Gbps, operational flexibility without any constraints on geometry, and development heritage to well proven designs.        Phase I investigation developed an analytic performance model (APM), formulated design options for the optical front end, and evaluated options for combining the wavelength division multiplexing with other channel multiplexing options.  During Phase II, a Phase II prototype will be designed, fabricated and tested raising the technology maturity to TRL 5.      BENEFIT:  On this project, OPC is teamed with a prime contractor who is a key player in laser communications.  There are two potential technology transition paths:  One of these is to add laser communication channels to satellites developed and launched under the Wideband Global Satcom (WGS) and Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) communications satellite programs.  Another option is evolving multiple small scale application specific systems rather than a large, monolithic system.  This would serve the DOD and the intelligence community&quot;s need of less complex, less risky systems that can be developed and deployed faster.  The technology is a strong candidate for both options.  Furthermore, besides military applications, lasercom can also be a commercial option in some limited environments.",

        "abstract": "The Power Amplifier is a crucial element of any RF link as it generates the necessary power to the antenna to allow reliable communications, radar pulses or jamming capabilities. In order to efficiently generate this high power, power amplifiers are usually operated at, or close to the amplifier saturation point to be more efficient (less DC power to obtain the RF output). However, this is where the amplifier begins to exhibit non-linear performance, creating higher levels of harmonic and intermodulation distortion. This is a particular concern in multi-carrier and complex modulated systems. Distortions are caused both in amplitude and phase and can cause spectral regrowth which can cause jammers to interfere with friendly combined communications in bands outside the band being jammed. Trident proposes to use GaN technology to achieve wide bandwidths and good thermal performance in a small space with a linearizer to help achieve the linearity goals. The design will be optimized to operate the amplifier around the +2 dB compression point to achieve sufficient efficiency to ensure required performance. Based on the analysis completed under Phase I, Trident proposes to break the frequency range into three different bands (20&quot;500, 500&quot;2500, and 2500&quot;6000 MHz).",

        "abstract": "ENIG proposes an innovative and novel approach, using pulsed power to convert explosive chemical energy into lethal jets to attack MOUT targets when fired from light weapons. The device is in the form of a precursor warhead optimized to maximize cavity diameter in brick and concrete targets so that an effective follow-through munition can be delivered within combatant structures. The warhead is compatible with weight/size constraints of light weapons having diameters of 66-84 mm. The precursor device is completely autonomous carrying small on-board power for seeding the pulsed power system. Electrical energy generated powers liners of metal and reactive materials into jet penetrators that represent more effective precursors to facilitate main munition lethality. In prior ENIG efforts, devices were designed and laboratory tests have demonstrated jet formation and penetration technology. Phase I efforts have resulted in moving technology forward and identifying configurations that can utilize this technology into viable warhead systems. ENIG has teamed with technology partners for present development, including Lockheed Martin Missile Fire Control (LMMFC) for transition into various weapon platforms. Phase I benefited from support and technical exchange between AMRDEC, DARPA and AFRL/RDHP. Both DARPA and AFRL have provided continuing Letters of Support for Phase II.",

The goal of this SBIR is to research solutions for open issues in the areas of instrumentation, data collection and interface fidelity of the LVC representations, and provide a set of LVC capabilities, denoted as LVC-CF, that can be used to represent the current force communication networks under test. In Phase 1 of this SBIR effort, SNT conducted research to identify the requirements and concept of operations for such an LVC environment from the interface, data collection &amp; analysis perspectives. We also identified approaches to incorporate current force communications in a LVC environment and developed preliminary designs for the LVC-CF framework. In Phase 2, SNT will complete the design and implement a prototype of the LVC-CF solution based on the Phase 1 findings and demonstrate its applicability for potential use in both JTRS and IBCT test events.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The objective of the EVISTA project is to create an intelligent software solution designed to aid users and administrators in addressing their security concerns during the IPv4 to IPv6 transition phase. An expert system is combined with network-sensing tools and agents to i) identify unauthorized IPv6 transitional tunnel use ii) identify unauthorized IPv6 service access iii) conduct a vulnerability assessment of local end hosts and iv) mitigate active attacks which are enabled by the complex nature of a dual-stack environment. Phase I produced two prototypes, EVISTA Out-of-band and EVISTA Inline, both of which were successful in satisfying the desired objective. As a natural continuation of Phase I, EVISTA Phase II will build upon the Phase I architecture to expand and enhance its capabilities toward the ultimate end of productization as a commercial security tool. Projected changes include enhanced vulnerability assessment, automatic self configuration based on the hosting network, per-user authorization and authentication, enhanced threat mitigation, operation in multi-homed and native IPv6 networks, and incorporation of IPv6 firewall processing. These capabilities, among others, will combine to make EVISTA a compelling addition to an enterprise&quot;s suite of security tools as we enter the age of IPv6.   BENEFIT:  The anticipated benefits of EVISTA are considerable due to its widespread potential applicability. For example, significant commercial opportunities exist in areas relating to the DOD. This is due in part to fact that mZeal has several years of experience in working with the military on a variety of projects, and therefore has a high degree of familiarity with defense-related organizations.  More importantly, per DOD mandate, all DOD agencies were to have become technically IPv6 compliant as of June 2008. This implies all of them are at some level of transition, which is precisely the type of environment for which the EVISTA system is targeted.  In a similar vein, the OMB has also mandated that all Federal agencies have become IPv6 capable by now. Given the sheer size and scope of the Federal government, this represents an enormous market for the EVISTA product. There is also the potential for deployment of EVISTA in tactical networks. The promise of IPv6 is&quot;power at the edge&quot;, which implies its usefulness in tactical environments. The ability to detect and automatically disable an intrusive, potentially crippling attack on the network actively involved in a battle scenario represents a powerful capability in a tactical system.  EVISTA scaled to run on consumer premises equipment (CPEs) represents another compelling avenue for commercialization.  These wireless routers/NATs run in millions of households throughout the world. EVISTA could play a significant security role in the home by protecting consumers from attacks mounted through hidden IPv6 tunnels.    Ultimately, the largest potential market is the totality of the users of the worldwide internet. Government organizations in multiple countries are actively advocating for a transition to IPv6. Since the US has a relatively large portion of the IPv4 address space, rapidly developing countries such as China and India have additional incentive to move to IPv6.  Other countries have similar concerns and are likely to follow suit  including, eventually, the U.S.  Since the conversion to IPV6 is predicted to take place gradually, rather than overnight, the need for a transitional threat detection and elimination product such as EVISTA projects to be significant and prolonged.",

        "abstract": "The development of advanced interceptors addressing hit-to-kill against threats with the ability to maneuver poses significant challenges. Application of lethality enhancement devices in a hypersonic flowfield are strongly influenced by the blast chemistry, effective blast impulse applied to the fragments, freestream flowfield interaction with the blast wave, shock interactions among the fragments, and charge shape. To date simulation analysts and computational fluid dynamists have attempted to model and represent the mechanics of the particles in this very complex flowfield with simulation tools alone. At the start, assumptions are made which usually simplify or constrain the problem to allow a solution. Because the exact physics of all interactions are not precisely modeled, predictions often do not represent the real world outcome. This has lead to using probability functions to analytically determine the fragment pattern from a statistical data base. This proposed effort will provide the much needed test data to allow verification and validation and or correction to the existing simulation modeling tools currently used. Additionally, the test conditions will be representative of the actual flight conditions sought.",

Many of the flame retardant chemicals in use today are toxic and harmful to the environment. This proposal concerns a naturally occurring plant extract as a potential non-toxic flame retardant compound. In a Phase I feasibility study, it was demonstrated that the plant-derived compound could be grafted onto fabric materials, with the resulting fabrics having significant flame retardant characteristics. Test results also support the non-toxic nature of the modified fabric. In addition to the extract being produced in a sustainable and environmentally friendly fashion, methods were devised whereby the extract can be used in manufacturing processes without generating environmental hazards. The proposed Phase II study will expand the understanding of plant derived compound as a surface treatment for existing fabrics. The study will further evaluate the flame retardant characteristics of materials treated with the compound, will further investigate the potential for toxic byproducts, evaluate sustainable manufacturing processes, and confirm the compound is compatible with the physical properties of combat uniforms (breathability, strength, color, weight etc.).",

Although operating rooms are routinely cleaned, in the event of a sudden influx of casualties it may not be possible to clean thoroughly between operations. In addition, cleaning the walls of the soft wall shelters or liners may not be feasible. Therefore, antimicrobial coatings on the walls of both rigid and soft wall shelters are desirable to reduce nosocomial transmission of drug resistant bacterial infections.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  When using the current state-of-the-art in spatial discretization, numerical flux functions and temporal integration techniques, the amount of effort required for simulations in general geometries is prohibitively large for most unsteady simulations in multi-element rocket engines. In addition, current numerical techniques, while effective for stationary flows, have a potential for spurious reflections at interfaces, where grid sizes change abruptly. These limitations render present day approaches less than successful for unsteady flows. Following an exhaustive search for an efficient method to push rocket engine flow simulations to the next level, both in terms of fidelity and turnaround time, Metacomp Technologies proposes to employ an innovative application of high resolution methodologies in the CFD++ framework. In Phase II, the innovative methodology will be applied to gas-gas, gas-liquid and liquid-liquid problem classes.  BENEFIT:  The proposed technology will result in a dramatic reduction in computational effort to achieve a desirable level of fidelity in the simulation of unsteady flow in rocket engines. It will lead to a modern high-fidelity rocket engine flow simulation capability that can predict the onset of instability as well as transient response of the flow in the combustion chamber to disturbances.  The proposed research will complement other developments at Metacomp sponsored by the Air Force.  CFD++ will become a useful tool for AFRL to explore new designs for high performance rocket engines.  Concurrently, rocket engines are increasingly used in the commercial, non-military, market. Examples are the various Earth-to-Space rocket-powered payload carriers, some of which are government-sponsored, others privately owned.  Recent years have seen the birth of commercial space travel. While still in its infancy, increased activity in this area indicates a potentially big market in the near future. Since all these vehicles must be able to travel in vacuum, most of them will resort to chemically fueled rocket engines, which will encounter the same transient problems associated with military rocket motors. Consequently, the current proposal has potential for a diverse usage, benefitting both military and commercial sectors.",

We propose to design, develop, and deliver a ground breaking tool that will significantly aide analyst work in predicting and combating such threats.

SAS will apply powerful game-theoretic algorithms to deduce a wide range of possible threats, ranging from most likely to most dangerous.  It will include a sophisticated timing model to capture possibilities of adversaries launching attacks coordinated with natural events to disguise or confuse interpretation of their actions.  These threat trees will be passed to the analysts for use in developing appropriate countermeasures.      BENEFIT:  The Space Assessment Simulator contains a library of possible actions, goals, and domains that are potentially applicable to either the defender of the space assets, or an adversary.  Player models are then developed that contain a subset of these moves available to each player.  Potential interactive natural events are also stored.

If the FPA operation temperature can be raised to&gt;170 K without sacrificing performance, then lower power and longer lifetime MWIR cameras should be possible. Type-II InAs/GaSb superlattices represent the most promising material system capable of delivering a camera operating above 170 K. High temperature operation of current MCT based FPAs is limited by inherent defects in the II-VI material and strong Auger recombination. Type-II is based upon more mature III-V materials and should give better material quality, lower substrate costs, and compatibility with industrial III-V foundry processes. Type-II has significantly lower Auger recombination rates, and using the superlattice, the band structure can be engineered to further suppress Auger recombination. This allows for lower dark currents at higher operating temperatures thereby allowing for the development of a camera that can potentially achieve MCT performance at 170 K or greater. In this proposed work we will systematically study MWIR Type-II and apply recent innovations in order to demonstrate improved performance and then develop high performance MWIR FPAs and ultimately deliver a low-power FPA camera system at the end of Phase II.",

The antenna uses a connected array architecture to provide the very low frequency end of the band desired. The connected array links a multiplicity of nominally UWB elements together to instantiate a UWB response much wider than can be achieved by singular antenna elements. The specific connected element used is a Vivaldi Slot type element that has been computer optimized for ideal performance across the band. The array is made electrically thin both through the use of the partial directionality provided by the Vivaldi element, as well as by a novel Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) instituted with a new UWB Artificial Dielectric. The combination of these features permits the array to operate without introducing any resistive termination as is often the case for other array designs. As such, this design provides lower loss for a stronger received signal. Additionally, the Vivalidi element is selected because it has a wider element gain pattern that supports a wider Field of View than flat planar antennas can support. These features make it ideal for AoA with MUSIC.",

        "abstract": "Intellectual Merits:  This small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to develop innovative energy harvesting device capable to scavenge energy from environment radiations (light), covering wavelengths from 0.3 to 40.0 micrometer for numerous military and commercial applications. The device has the harvesting efficiency of more than&gt;20% for daylight and&gt;5 % for the radiations covering from 3 to 40 micrometer (during night time). All day and night energy harvesting devices are required as an alternate power supplies for various remotely located sensing system, unmanned aircraft, distributed wireless network system, ground-based warning and monitoring system to power the systems directly and/or to recharge the batteries, when necessary. To date several techniques for energy harvesting are being used and they are mainly based on vibration, electromagnetic, electrostatic etc. However, these techniques are location dependencies and none of these techniques could provide enough energy to operate system mentioned. Today&quot;s solar cell can be used as the energy harvester; however, they are only harvest when the daylight is present. In addition, today solar cell is not also high efficient, so that it requires more area to achieve make high power. A goal in Phase-II program is to carry on further research and development of proposed high power perpetual energy harvesting device, capable to continuously scavenge energy from environment all day and night to power and/or recharge the battery. Banpil will demonstrate: (a) modeling and simulation of the proposed integrated perpetual energy harvesting device (b) design and fabrication of proposed device integrated with the storage device, and (c) demonstrate energy harvesting module with low form-factor and low weight in Phase-II. Recognizing the vast application potential of Banpil&quot;s perpetual energy harvesting devices, several industrial partners have expressed strong interest in commercializing this technology. During  Phase II, Banpil will work with several leading military and commercial companies who expressed strong interest on proposed perpetual harvesting devices, as a part of commercialization of the propsoed technology.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The objective of the proposed Space Situation Awareness via Predictive Intelligent Reification of multi-INT Threat-models (SPIRIT) effort is to develop a real-time, multi-INT SSA fusion capability that provides predictive insight into both deliberate and environmental threats facing space assets.  A key enabler of this capability is the application of semantic web technology towards the enrichment and fusion of multi-source observations.  In Phase I of this SBIR the ISS team successfully demonstrated several powerful capabilities including: a capability to extract, semantically tag, and temporally align knowledge from unstructured data sources; how to extend semantic web technologies with temporal and probabilistic reasoning in support of multi-INT fusion; and how learned multi-INT indicator models can be applied towards predictive SSA.    The primary objective of Phase II of this effort are to mature the functional prototypes developed under Phase I into a comprehensive JDL level 2/3 fusion service capable of supporting real-time, multi-INT predictive SSA within the JSPOC Mission System (JMS).  In addition to a significant software engineering effort, SPIRIT Phase II also includes significant research into several challenging problems including semantic based fuzzy membership functions, multi-INT entity disambiguation, and assigning confidence to knowledge extracted from unstructured text.  BENEFIT:  SPIRIT will provide an extensible framework for supporting SSA in a net-centric environment that will be compatible with the new Joint Space Operations Center Mission System (JMS) SOA architecture.  Using a federation of normalcy, threat, and COA models, the real-time, multi-INT SPIRIT system will be able to rapidly identify and characterize threats, be they intentional or natural.  Consuming streaming multi-INT data as well as open source text, the semantic enrichment capabilities of SPIRIT along with its multi-logic reasoning system will support predictive awareness of emerging threats from partial evidence, enabling timely threat identification and development of effective countermeasures.  Although initially developed to support SSA, the declarative knowledge framework can be adapted to support new domains with minimal if any software programming.  The initial commercial applications of SPIRIT include SSA and DCS systems such as JMS.",

To improve this situation, the Heavy Armored Ground Ambulance (HAGA) has recently been deployed. However, no HAGAs have been available for stateside training. To remedy this, STI proposes the Combat Medic Simulator (CMS), employing STI&quot;s patented Fused RealityTM visual system. Three versions of the CMS are proposed.  The baseline version, the PC CMS operated with a gamepad, will allow a trainee to explore the HAGA&quot;s features.   The Fused Reality Open Space CMS will allow the trainee to be immersed in a virtual combat environment with a virtual HAGA, manually interacting with the virtual casualty (VIRCAS) and a scripted casualty transport team - while observing his own person in real time.  Finally, the Fused Reality HAGA Mockup CMS will include a physical mockup of the HAGA and all the features of the Open Space CMS.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  An integrated warm gas pressurization of the main and ACS propulsion system offers simpler, more efficient propellant management than existing designs.  The most operationally versatile system is based on a unique pump that forces liquid through a gasifier thus creating both the pressurant gas and warm gas for ACS thrusters.  All components of such a system are COTS with the exception of the pump which is the focus of this program.     The proposed pump uses no motors or mechanisms and has only one slowly moving part.  In addition to mass and volume reduction, the system offers benefits such as launching the entire propulsion system unpressurized and a constant tank pressure operation which improves thruster performance.  Furthermore, the warm gas can be used in place of cold gas for attitude control thrusters, providing increased specific impulse.    In Phase I we built and demonstrated a proof of concept pump and modeled the dynamics of the entire propellant storage and management system.    In Phase II we will produce and characterize the entire system and investigate its dynamics.  The goals will be more than a factor of two reduction in pressurization system mass and a greater than 10% increase in thruster performance.      BENEFIT:  Successful demonstration of the proposed technique will enable use of warm gas pressurization on any spacecraft using mono-propellants, significantly improving propulsion system performance while reducing the system mass and volume.  Warm gas pressurization could also possibly be used for bi-propellant systems.   A majority of spacecraft have one or the other, so significant impact is expected.",

In Phase II, we will further the development to optimize, ruggedize and productize the EFFECT system, which will be a robust integration of advanced optics, expert-system analysis/decision making, and automated cleaning/debris removal.  EFFECT includes a novel FO interconnect adaptor system that can be made to accommodate all types/form factors of FO interconnects including MIL-C-D38999 series connectors.  Phase II development will produce an intuitive, self-contained automated maintenance tool allowing for operation in tight, confined spaces where aircraft/vessel power is not readily available.  Further development and optimization of the EFFECT modular quick-connect adaptors (QCAs) will allow restoration of interconnect functionality per NAVAIR (or SAE) specifications in&lt;5 min.  In Phase II, POC will refine the EFFECT architecture to meet Air Force needs, and ruggedize the design per MIL-PRF-28800F.  The EFFECT prototype will be demonstrated to Air Force personnel, showcasing EFFECT&quot;s ability to maintain both legacy and emerging fiber optic interconnects used by the military, emphasizing reduced cycle time and first attempt performance metrics.  BENEFIT:  The use of fiber optics for data transmission has tremendous applications in both military and commercial environments.  With its many benefits over standard coaxial and copper lines, the use of optical transmission is growing exponentially, particularly in the telecommunication industry, which has invested a considerable amount of money in providing infrastructure directly to consumer households.  Additionally, the use of fiber optics in commercial aircraft and even in automobiles is growing every year.  Unfortunately the fragility and susceptibility to signal degradation due to fluid and particulate contamination requires ongoing maintenance that is time consuming without the use of automated equipment.  EFFECT will greatly help reduce this maintenance burden with an effective system that is efficient, portable, and intuitively operable with negligible infrastructure needs.",

The ability to harness and leverage information in this manner provides a powerful means for discovering links between information, and greatly enhances decision-making capabilities.  The availability of such services in DoD environments will provide tremendous advantages to the decision-makers engaged in analysis of critical situations, rapid-response, and long-term planning scenarios.  However in the absence of mechanisms for managing the usage of resources, any mashup service in a DoD environment also opens up significant security vulnerabilities to insider threat and accidental leakage of confidential information, just to name a few.  In this research project, we will develop a framework that will allow integration via mashups of content from various data sources in a secure manner.  The framework will be based on mathematical logic by means of which addressable resources have formal usage terms applied to them, and these terms are used to specify and enforce usage policies over the resources.  An advantage of this approach is it provides a formal means for controlling the usage of resources within highly complex secure mashups.  BENEFIT:  The anticipated benefits resulting from this project, which involves providing an end user computing environment that allows Warfighters to aggregate content from multiple DoD sources using Web 2.0 technologies in a provably assured manner, are:  (a) helps prevent security vulnerabilities such as insider threat and accidental leakage of confidential information; (b) overcomes obstacles to access of wider-ranging data sources and feeds; (c) extends the reach of legacy services (i.e., Net-Centric Data Strategy); and (d) helps users securely solve new problems&quot;on the fly.&quot;The potential to apply this work to commercial opportunities is easy to see.  The framework is applicable in any end user computing environment where mashups are needed.  Therefore much of our work in secure mashups should translate naturally to commercial settings.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  We propose to introduce artificial diversity to each installation of a standard platform by running the system using a combination of hardware virtualization and software dynamic translation. Automatic, transparent diversification offers powerful protection for systems that would otherwise remain homogenous. Code exploits are usually highly dependent on the details of the software and the vulnerability they target. Diversification ensures that those details change from one instance to the next, thereby requiring that a customized exploit be developed for each machine, frequently an insurmountable challenge for the attacker. Diversification is also attractive because it offers some protection against unknown attack vectors and methodologies. Our approach applies diversification to kernel code, application code, and interactions between processes.  BENEFIT:  Standardization of computer platforms is an important tool for improving security. Up to 80% of the vulnerabilities that are exploited during penetration testing of government networks result from misconfigured software. Standardized platforms allow security experts to ensure that these vulnerabilities are closed. Unfortunately, wide distribution of a standard platform also means wide distribution of any vulnerability in that platform. While adoption of a standard platform may be the only hope an enterprise has of managing and avoiding known vulnerabilities, it also dramatically increases the potential damage from exploits of newly discovered vulnerabilities: a novel attack may subvert or disable all standardized machines. Our approach to artificial diversity will enable the security benefits of a standardized computing platform without the coincident standardization of security vulnerabilities.",

Although increased awareness of the health hazards of respirable particulates and VOCs has prompted the development of new technologies to reduce emissions from restaurants, current technologies do not remove all hazardous air pollutants, have high capital costs, or have high operating costs.\n \nAn exhaust filtration system that removes greater than 99% of the PM and greater than 85% of the VOCs from underfired broiler exhaust will be developed in the proposed program.

        "abstract": "More than 10 million tons of polyurethane (PU) foams are manufactured globally each year, and as much as 20% of that production is unsellable scrap. Combining that manufacturing scrap with end-of-life recycling or disposal of PU foam, every year there is a tremendous waste of material that was made with a large investment of energy and still contains some very useful chemical functionality.\n \nMobius Technologies has developed a patent-pending method of using finely ground waste PU foam as a co-binder resin that can replace chemicals used in the manufacture of oriented strand board (OSB). This foam can be post-consumer or post-industrial recycle, and has been called micronized polyurethane, or MPU. Our key innovation is to un-manufacture polyurethane material from foam, and to do this during manufacture of OSB. In an OSB process, MPU can be caused to revert to isocyanates, bind wood strands, and eliminate the need for more energy-intensive and hazardous binder chemicals.\n \nOur objective is to remove technological barriers to allow massive amounts of PU scrap to be recycled this way into the large, established, and hungry market for durable building and construction materials. Specifically, we have sought out catalysts that promote the activity of MPU at a significantly lower temperature, which would allow wide commercial acceptance of the new material and process. Our efforts focus on increasing reactivity of MPU, understanding the effect of these catalysts on the process, and testing on a large enough scale to unlock commercial trials at leading OSB manufacturers.\n \nThe technology will permit manufacturers to reduce the use of chemicals, reduce toxic impacts, reduce the stream of scrap foam to already overwhelmed landfills, and still maintain the cost and quality of their product. The North American OSB market is large and growing. It more than tripled from 1990 to 2005, with 2005 production estimated at 25 billion sq. ft.\n \nIn Phase I, a list of nine candidate catalysts was identified, and these were tested as additives in remolded MPU plaques under elevated temperature and pressure. Measured internal bond strength identified the additives that produced a significant improvement relative to unmodified MPU. After additional testing to explore concentration and temperature effects for the remaining candidates, a single best candidate material was identified. This catalytic additive increased the strength of remolded MPU by more than 70% at process temperatures of 135\u00b0C and more than 200% at process temperatures of 110\u00b0C.\n",

Real-time detection provides a vital advantage over the existing sensors and will allow timed response in case biothreat agents are detected.

Although these approaches have been intensively investigated, they exhibit shortcomings in that they require additional hardware, impose costs for reagent use and storage, and waste resources (urea or fuel) as well. Furthermore: 1) NOx traps require low-sulfur fuels (and fuel supplementation) for effective use, and 2) existing lean NOx catalysts generally achieve less than 20% reduction in NOx emissions. A catalyst not requiring reagent or fuel supplementation is an extremely attractive and flexible option. Consequently, the key objective of the program is development of an inexpensive but effective sulfur oxides-tolerant, reagentless (passive) lean NOx catalyst.\n\nIn Phase I, Eltron identified specific, innovative, passive lean NOx catalyst compositions possessing exceptional activity (e.g., exhibiting 35-50% removal of NOx from real diesel exhaust) for NOx reduction by exhaust-borne hydrocarbons in diesel exhaust. Tests of preferred catalysts in diesel exhaust absent supplemental reductant gave activity with reduction of exhaust NOx level (to < 1.5g/bhp\u2022hr, engine load weighted) at low cost. Phase II will involve validation of Phase I results, final optimization of catalysts for non-highway diesel applications, and more extensive testing of catalysts in real exhausts. Catalyst development will continue to the point of engineering, fabricating, and testing monolithic structures incorporating the preferred catalyst. The end result of Phase II will be a catalyst technology that is commercially ready and outperforms or\u00b7augments existing technologies while minimizing capital and operating costs as well as the waste associated with current technologies.\n\nSuccessful completion of this program will result in catalysts applicable to a passive, lean exhaust after-treatment technology for removing nitrogen oxides and other species from exhaust streams rich in sulfur oxides. The technology will be applicable to after-treatment of exhausts from diesel engines, lean burn gasoline engines, natural gas-fired boilers and turbines, and coal-fired combustion sources. In addition to helping improve air quality, the reduction in costs and wastes will enable industry to more cost-effectively operate and address regulatory mandates.",

        "abstract": "Defiant Technologies builds and markets chemical detectors and it is developing a portable system to measure trace amounts of perchloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE) in ground water. This GC-based system will provide onsite results and reduce the need for time consuming and costly laboratory tests. In Phase I, Defiant demonstrated the fundamental technology. Defiant captured analytes of interest in a nanoporous material on a micro-preconcentrator and rapidly injected it into a micro-GC column. The GC adequately separated the constituents for identification on a low-cost micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMs)-based microbalance in less than 60 seconds.\n \nA market assessment by Foresight Science and Technology Services confirmed the need for this product and the potential revolutionary impact that a truly field-portable detection system could have on the water testing and soil remediation industry.\n \nIn Phase II, Defiant will move from proof-of-concept to product realization. The components will be integrated into a system and the performance will be optimized through a combination of laboratory and field testing. Improvements will be made in coating the MEMs components to provide consistent behavior. A longer GC-column will be integrated into the system for better analyte separation. Electronics and firmware for the micro-balance detector will be revised to conform to a field-portable system. There also will be a major focus on packaging and user interface to produce a system that is rugged, reliable, and easy to use and maintain. Testing will have a significant role in this Phase II effort to insure that the system provides accurate results under a wide range of conditions both in terms of the environment and the skill level of the operator.\n \nDefiant will subcontract with Foresight to further refine its previous market assessment. This work will include a refinement of the price-point for the product and a more in-depth study of the market potential. The intent of this work is to provide the basis for a compelling argument to investors who eventually will be needed to bring this product to production and market.\n \nFinally, a commercialization option is provided that investigates the development of a down-hole system for in situ well monitoring. Previous work with an environmental consulting firm indicated that there was a significant market opportunity for such a system and that Defiant\u2019s technology was more suitable than any other to meet the size constraints. Funds can be obtained to further this development if a sound design is developed and sufficient testing is performed to demonstrate feasibility.",

New formaldehyde-free wood adhesives that mainly consist of abundant, renewable, and readily available soybean flour and novel curing agents have been developed in a laboratory and successfully used for production of plywood in mill trials in the project funded by an EPA phase I grant. One of the most promising soy-based adhesives consists of soy flour and a natural product and is 100% based on natural materials, that is, does not contain any petrochemicals or petrochemical-\u00adbased products. The adhesive does not contain formaldehyde and will not emit formaldehyde or any other hazardous volatile organic compounds. As far as we know, this is the most environmentally friendly, green wood adhesive in the history of wood adhesives. This adhesive is superior to the UF resin in terms of the strengths and water-resistance of resulting wood composite panels. The overall goal of this project is to commercialize fully this new soy-based adhesive for the production of plywood in a commercial plywood mill. If this project is successful, the new adhesive is expected to be highly environmentally friendly, based on 100% natural materials, and cost-competitive to all competitive wood adhesives in the market. The results of this project will improve greatly indoor air quality and our working and living environments, significantly reduce the use of petrochemicals in building materials, and greatly enhance global competitiveness of the U.S. wood composite manufacturers.

        "abstract": "Production of cement (the binder in concrete) is a highly polluting and energy-intensive process, accounting for about 6% of global, anthropogenic C02 emissions and close to 2% of worldwide primary energy use. This project focuses on partial (~20%) replacement of cement in concrete with milled (mixed-color) waste glass to improve the moisture barrier qualities, durability, dimensional stability and other engineering properties of concrete. These beneficial effects would be realized as far as waste glass is milled to micro-scale particle size for accelerating its chemical reactions with cement hydrates. The landfill-bound quantities of glass are adequate to significantly impact the concrete construction practice. Waste glass is generated largely in urban areas, where the bulk of concrete production also takes place. Broad use of milled waste glass in concrete would yield significant environmental, energy, and cost benefits, and also would enable more extensive use of recycled aggregate concrete.\n \nThe Phase I effort identified desired particle size and dosage of milled (mixed-color) waste glass for beneficial use as partial replacement for cement in concrete. The favorable effects of milled waste glass on the chemical composition, microstructure, and key engineering properties (including stability under potential alkali-silica reactions) of normal and recycled aggregate concrete were identified through laboratory investigations. Theoretical and numerical studies were conducted to rationalize the experimental observations and to assess practical implications of using recycled glass concrete. A successful field study also was implemented in collaboration with concrete and recycling industries. The environmental, energy and (initial and life-cycle cost) benefits associated with partial replacement of cement with milled waste glass were quantified using the outcomes of Phase I effort.\n \nThe proposed Phase II project will:  (i) expand the experimental database on recycled glass concrete to cover broader ranges of concrete materials and engineering properties; (ii) corroborate the statistical significance of the benefits rendered by milled waste glass and verify the statistical control over production of recycled glass concrete; (iii) identify the mechanisms through which milled waste glass benefits the engineering properties of normal and recycled aggregate concrete; (iv) thoroughly assess the gains in service life and life-cycle economy of major concrete-based infrastructure associated with the use of milled waste glass; (v) implement and monitor large-scale field projects to demonstrate the scalability, compatibility with prevalent construction practices, and practical value of recycled glass concrete; and (vi) evaluate the environmental, energy, and cost benefits of recycled glass concrete in different applications and service environments.",

        "abstract": "Methane is the second largest contributor to global warming after carbon dioxide. Various technologies and process improvements have been developed to curb methane emissions in the United States. There is still a lack of economically viable technology, however, to utilize dilute methane streams containing 10-40% methane, in which the other component is primarily carbon dioxide. The streams are often vented, contributing to the climate change effects associated with greenhouse gases. Membrane Technology and Research estimates that the methane emissions from these streams could be up to 1.0 Tg (million metric tons) per year with a fuel value of $200-300 million, assuming $4-6/1,000 scf natural gas. A key objective of this project is to develop a simple and low cost membrane process to convert dilute methane waste gas streams into useful fuel, thus reducing methane emissions.\n \nIn Phase I, high-flux Polaris\u2122 membranes with high carbon dioxide permeance and adequate carbon dioxide/methane and carbon dioxide/nitrogen selectivity were reproducibly produced using MTR\u2019s commercial scale coating machines. A bench-scale countercurrent spiral-wound module containing 0.7 m2 membrane area was prepared successfully. Parametric tests were conducted on membrane stamps and the test module. An analysis of costs to upgrade dilute methane to fuel use using a membrane system was conducted. The payback time for the process is about 8-16 months. The economics improve for dilute methane streams containing more than 20% methane. The process is even more attractive if a credit for reduced greenhouse gas emissions is considered.\n \nThe key to bringing this technology closer to commercialization is to demonstrate the membrane process under real operating conditions in the field. In Phase II, a pilot-scale membrane unit will be built and operated at a landfill gas plant. The unit will be run for 3 months to prove the technical and economic viability of the process. If successfully developed, the proposed membrane systems provide an economically viable way to use dilute methane waste gas streams, thus curbing methane emissions.",

        "abstract": "Polyurethane (PU) coatings continue to be a detriment to the environment. As long as compliance leads to higher costs for coatings manufacturers and applicators, tighter regulation will lead to increased resistance by these companies or ultimately will shift production to less regulated areas. The ideal situation would be if environmentally friendly practices led to lower costs for coatings manufacturers and applicators. This is not impossible.\n \nThe key is to lower the labor costs for the paint applicator with an environmentally friendly coating system. A single component coating that requires no primer would be both a cost and environmental benefit. If coupled with 0% volatile organic components (0 VOC), and higher performance and nontoxic corrosion inhibitors, painting labor and material costs would be reduced along with VOCs and waste. Everyone wins. However, to achieve this, a large jump in resin technology is needed.\n \nDendrimeric polymers, one of the four macromolecular architectures of nanotechnology, have unique properties to help achieve these goals. Unfortunately, these polymers currently are too expensive for the general coatings market. Instrumental Polymer Technologies, LLC, (IP TECH) has developed a method called evolution polymerization to make hydroxyl\u00ad-terminated aliphatic polycarbonate dendrimers for a price competitive with common polyols. In Phase I of this project IP TECH used this method to produce silane-terminated dendrimers as 0 VOC solutions in a cost effective manner. IP TECH also demonstrated that their condensation leads to adhesion and physical properties that not only match, but exceed those of current polyurethane coatings. Furthermore, the core of the dendrimers were shown to be able to store a reservoir of nontoxic, hydrophobic corrosion inhibitors.\n \nThe product is near ready to launch and IP TECH already has sampled to customers wanting abrasion and chemically resistant thin coats. The technology is also near ready for customers who commonly heat cure polyurethane coatings. Work needs to be done to reduce the cure time as a thick coating. In Phase II the cost and dry time of the product will be reduced to allow a broader launch into the polyurethane coatings market. Two methods have been determined and will be exploited.\n \nThe resulting solutions will be produced and marketed as a raw material to coatings producers by IP TECH through a distribution network that already is established. Production will use reactors IP TECH currently uses for polycarbonate polyol production. Costs are currently in line with commercial polyurethane dispersions.\n",

        "abstract": "Reducing energy and water intensity of fuel-ethanol production is a critical national need, particularly if we are to realize the renewable fuel standards of 2010 mandating 36 million gallons of renewable fuels by 2022.  Because the ethanol tolerance of yeasts used in commercial cellulosic ethanol production is around 7-9% by volume, 10-14 gallons of stillage are created for every gallon of ethanol produced, resulting in billions of gallons of wastewater per year.  Yet existing stillage treatment solutions are costly and energy intensive.  Bio-electrochemical systems (BES) that can generate electricity during stillage treatment have the potential to greatly improve both the economics and carbon intensity of fuel-ethanol production.\n\nPhase I feasibility analysis demonstrated for the first time, to our knowledge, the ability of bio-electrochemical systems to reduce BOD in ethanol stillage while generating electricity directly.  A proprietary cell achieved a maximum power density of 3.5 W/m3 on un-pretreated ethanol stillage at columbic efficiencies of 31% while removing 0.42 KG COD/m3day.  A multi-discipline, physics-based Metlab model demonstrated lower 10-year discounted cost of ownership versus competing systems at performances similar to those achieved in the lab, based in part on benefits not fully considered in the academic literature.\n\nThis Phase II project builds on Phase I results to optimize performance and demonstrate a scaled BES-based stillage treatment solution in partnership with some of the largest ethanol producers in the world.  The project is divided into four major tasks:\n\nBroaden Scope:  Expand validated stillage streams to include cellulosic ethanol. \nDetailed Design:  Verify design concepts developed to minimize cost at larger scale; modulate key parameters to minimize internal electrical and hydraulic resistances to increase treatment rates. \nProcess Optimization:  Pilot design in proposed process configuration to validate performance and determine proper pre-treatment characteristics. \nPareto-Optimization:  Incorporate empirical results into our multi-objective technical and economic model to identify pareto-optimal solutions, validate pilot economics, and inform future scaling efforts. \nThe end result will be commercial validation of a scalable BES treatment process with the potential to radically reduce the cost and energy intensity of ethanol stillage treatment.  Such a process could be used as a retrofill to older ethanol plants, incorporated into the ramp-up for cellulosic ethanol production, and also applied to other fermentation-based industries such as brewing.",

Power is supplied by a separate JP-8 fired generator that serves multiple appliances simultaneously. This is inefficient, as generators are only 20-25% efficient, and unreliable since failure of the generator results in the failure of the entire kitchen operation. This is a significant risk because field generators have typical mean time between failures of only 500 hours. It is necessary to develop a means to individually provide electrical power to burners used in field kitchen appliances. This is a prime application for cogeneration, since there is a need for both thermal and electrical energy. Since the thermal energy demand is significantly greater than the electrical demand, an ideal technology is thermoelectric power generation (TEGs). Thermoelectric generators are solid state semiconductor devices that generate electrical power when subjected to a thermal gradient.

Utility ratepayers need granular information to more effectively identify and mitigate inefficient appliances and activities. The new generation of smart electric meters currently being deployed for automated reading and time of use pricing are not be able to provide this level of detail. The signal processing algorithms evaluated during the Phase I study accurately isolate and quantify the power used by individual appliances from the aggregate power signal of the many appliances present on a leg or circuit. In the proposed project, additional enhancements will be made to the load disaggregation algorithm that will significantly improve system accuracy and reliability. Ratepayers will access a secure webpage to view their cost to operate specific appliances in their building or groups of buildings. The granular perspective provided will enable end-users to (1) calculate their own investment return periods for equipment repairs and upgrades, (2) develop data driven best practices for energy conservation, and (3) ensure that cost reductions are maintained over the long term. The broader impact will occur when the technology is deployed throughout the residential and commercial segments as part of a new generation of smart meters. Commercially-available systems that directly monitor multiple specific loads are more expensive by an order of magnitude and inherently more difficult to install and maintain. Providing appliance specific load information has the potential to transform ratepayers&#039; ability to conserve energy.

While dengue fever can be a mild infection, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) cause death at a high rate and are associated with multiple serotypes worldwide. Dengue fever symptoms, especially at the early acute stage, can resemble infection with other disease agents, such as malaria and rickettsial diseases, with different treatment regimens. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a recently developed technique with similar or better detection sensitivity and specificity compared to PCR assays, but allows a single temperature incubation and simple readout more suitable to field devices. LAMP also offers the potential of detection in less pure samples, such as blood, facilitating quick field sample preparation. Therefore, Agave BioSystems proposes to develop a real-time reverse-transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (real-time RT-LAMP) diagnostic for detection of Dengue viruses in human serum.",

The solution will also make it possible to quickly add new repositories to the operational system (i.e., on the fly) using provided tools for aligning the repositories&quot;data models to the DiSIS ontology. This product will dramatically simplify the organization, maintenance and querying of large collections of data services and permit general users to access knowledge otherwise inaccessible behind technological barriers and incompatible access mechanisms. In Phase I a limited but functional feasibility prototype of DiSIS was demonstrated on a sample of maritime track data (both OTH-Gold and AIS) residing in a relational database and an RDF data store. In Phase II, DiSIS will be enhanced and expanded into a fully functional, field-tested prototype capable of handling a wider array of repository types covering a broader range of content and formats while permitting semantically richer and more complex user queries via a simple to use graphical interface.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Applications for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) are growing rapidly. The target training market is one area in which the&quot;pilot-less&quot;capabilities provided by UAS have been continuously exploited. To better serve this market, it would be beneficial if the UAS technology development included the modularity to support multiple airframes, sensors, payloads, and concept of operations. In this way, expansion of the UAS targets could progress alongside the ever-evolving target application needs. For example, Ultra-light aircraft have become more prevalent for drug trafficking across the US-Mexico border. This new target type and the requirement to engage the target non-lethally is an ideal candidate for modular UAS technology. The modular UAS developed and flight tested under this Phase II effort will be capable of supporting a variety of concepts of operations such as non-lethal engagement of Ultra-Light aircraft, which is the focus of the 2011 AFRL Commander&quot;s Challenge. By utilizing a systems engineering approach and drawing on years of rapid UAS design and flight test experience, the UAS test assets developed under this Phase II effort will enable the successful execution of this year&quot;s Commander&quot;s Challenge event.  BENEFIT:  The modular technologies utilized to create the Ultra-Light test assets for the Commander&quot;s Challenge event could be utilized to convert any manned vehicle into an unmanned target or test vehicle. More importantly, the successful conversion of an Ultra-Light aircraft to UAS will lead to the development of a solution technology capable of engaging these and similar target vehicles. The capability to non-lethally engage a variety of manned and unmanned vehicles is needed to better support incidences of drug or human trafficking, terrorist attacks, and even pirate activities. These solutions could be commercialized and successfully marketed to the Customs and Border Protection and local law enforcement groups to support our Nation&quot;s security initiatives. In summary, the modular technologies developed during the Phase I effort will be validated during Phase II flight testing of the converted Ultra-Light aircraft in order to effectively meet the immediate needs of the Commander&quot;s Challenge event and foster new development in border security research and development.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Today, a pressing need for high-fidelity transient, nonlinear, viscous, multidisciplinary simulations of complex fluid-structure systems with associated subsystems operating in near space arises in the design and analysis of many engineering operations. These include not only the cargo/weapon release, store separation, fueling/de-icing boom, and egress operations associated with military systems, but also those associated with commercial applications such as the optimization of draft during car racing and the design of biomedical micro devices for drug delivery, among many others. To address this pressing technical need, Phase I of this SBIR effort has focused on blending the arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian and overset/chimera methods to design a new framework for the fluid-structure analysis of complex systems with flexible structures and large relative motions. During Phase I of this effort, the feasibility of this new concept was also demonstrated. Hence, Phase II of this research project will focus on refining this innovative computational technology, implementing it in the AERO Suite of Codes deployed at the Edwards Air Force Base, and maturing its application to the nonlinear aeroelastic analysis of complex systems and subsystems with large relative motions.   BENEFIT:  The anticipated success of this research and development effort will extend the range of applications of arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian and overset/chimera methods to systems deployment and large motion analysis that accounts for both structural flexibility and turbulent viscous flow effects. It will also enhance the potential for commercialization of the AERO Suite of Codes deployed at the Edwards Air Force Base by expanding its range of applications to include problems such as cargo/weapon release, store separation, aerial refueling, optimization of draft in Indy and Formula 1 car racing, and the simulation of biomedical micro devices for drug delivery.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Significant challenges persist in Cyber security and Net-Centric Warfare, e.g., the vast problem scale, the management and deployment of a large pool of heterogeneous and physically wide-spread resources (both human expertise and machine power), the uncertainties, contingencies and dynamics of the domain environments and operations, and finally the time constraints associated with these challenges. Obviously the complex Cyber defense processes are far beyond any single actor&quot;s capability. Consequently there is an urgent need of a solution that can be used to collect, organize and deploy heterogeneous resources (commanders, operators and IT professionals) to effectively negate the Cyber attacks. Our solution to the aforementioned problems is an innovative software system, called We-Plan, which provides a collaborative environment for multiple actors to carry out mixed-initiative distributed simultaneous (MDS) planning in Cyber defense operations. In Phase II, we will improve the design of We-Plan from Phase I and develop it into a full-fledged, deployable and intuitive software system for AFRL to carry out in-house MDS planning in cyber operations. We-Plan is a general approach and is applicable to a wide range of DOD and commercial applications.  BENEFIT:  The anticipated Phase II results include a fully functional We-Plan software system that provides a collaborative environment for multiple users to carry out mixed-initiative distributed simultaneous (MDS) planning in cyber response operations. We-Plan is designed and developed to be applicable to a wide range of areas that share the same challenge described as follows: given a large pool of physically-separate heterogeneous resources, how to organize a subset of the capable and available resources to solve common problems (including problem specification, planning, scheduling, execution, potential result analysis and re-planning) in stressful time-critical dynamic environments. The immediate user of We-Plan is the funding agency and We-Plan seeks to serve as their in-house MDS planning tool. We-Plan can also transition towards concrete systems (e.g., Supplier Warranty Administration and Advanced Analytics for Logistics Command and Control) developed by our prime industrial partners. Additionally, We-Plan can potentially contribute to the Command and Control systems for various government agencies, as well as AFRL&quot;s Distributed Mission Operations, MDA&quot;s Ballistic Missile Defense System, Navy/Coast Guard&quot;s Maritime Interdiction Operations, etc. Potential commercial applications include air traffic control, civilian planning for police and fire response, homeland security inter-agency response operations, and FEMA emergency/disaster management.",

Test results using actual airborne composite images have shown that we are able to detect minefields with accuracy of 100%. In Phase II, we propose to add these technologies to Army vehicular system, which include intelligent IED minefield display, dynamic estimation of parameter values suitable for various operation conditions, interaction with operator feedback through speech recognition, and ontological knowledgebase management. System developed in Phase II will be deployed in a multiprocessor parallel computation platform for near real-time operation.

        "abstract": "The primary objective of this project is to develop of several novel classes of inertia devices such as accelerometers for use for flight control in high-G gun-fired munitions and mortars. The proposed accelerometer concepts are intended to provide high sensitivity of better than 0.05 G while being capable of withstanding setback acceleration levels of over 120,000 Gs and are intended to require minimal time (3 msec or less) to settle post firing and consume relatively low power. The inertia devices are to be produced using commonly used MEMS manufacturing processes, thereby are expected to be relatively low cost and highly reliable and have a wide range of potential commercial applications. The proposed novel inertia device designs are scalable across all munitions applications and should allow the development of low-cost inertia-based components for flight control of high-G gun-fired munitions with the goal of providing very affordable guidance and control systems for all future guided munitions applications, including large to medium caliber rounds.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  A critical capability associated with space C2 is the ability to develop and analyze alternative courses of action (COAs) based on SSA and other intelligence sources and to clearly define the cost and benefit associated with each option. However, the current COAs are primarily static or template driven responses and are adequate for day-to-day operations. For the new situations that are evolving rapidly, however, it is necessary to develop automated decision support tools that will aid space control operators in the COA selection process. The goal of this SBIR effort, therefore, is to develop a software capability to enable operators to develop and analyze COAs and select the best approach for creating/maintaining desired space effects supporting on-going or planned operations.     In Phase I of this contract, DECISIVE ANALYTICS Corporation demonstrated the ability to develop and implement an optimization-based decision support tool for Blue Force COA selection. This tool, the Space Threat Response Integer Programming Expert System (STRIPES), will be significantly extended in the Phase II contract to include more realistic geo-spatial and temporal restrictions, consideration of uncertainty related to the actions of Red Forces, as well as SOA compliant user-friendly graphical user interface.  BENEFIT:  The benefits of the proposed decision support system include 1) real time aid for space control decision makers through provision of a set of alternative COAs, 2) interactive optimization mechanism allowing consideration of operators&quot;threat response preferences, and comprehensive insights, 3) a fully functional SOA-compliant GUI software for space threat response decision support system, and 4) efficient storage and modification of a space threat response database.  The enhanced STRIPES decision support tool that will be developed in our Phase II effort can also be applied to enhance the capabilities of other real-time command and control systems.  State and local agencies have similar decision support requirements for first responders, logistics planning and other command systems, and commercial organizations have a similar need in the areas of operational control.",

The research and subsequent hardware prototype from this research will address many of these needs. The chaos waveform is an inherently low probability of intercept (LPI)/ low probability of detect (LPD) waveform. The research conducted in Phase I of this SBIR and continued in Phase II has transformed these chaos waveform into highly effective and efficient communication waveforms. The chaotic waveform system developed will be able to operate as a secure satellite and airborne waveform as well as a fall back rate for tactical links when jamming prevents update of network situational awareness to the nodes. Additionally, the chaos waveform can be used to provide added security to narrowband legacy and/or commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) waveforms.

SCC of aluminum is of particular concern in the chloride containing environments that are typical for naval operations and is increasingly investigated as part of the system design process for naval aircraft structures and subsystems. However, modern test methods that determine KIscc of aluminum require expensive long duration testing (10,000 hours). The feasibility of developing a reliable accelerated test method to measure KIscc for aluminum alloys has been demonstrated by obtaining accelerated test results of a 7075 T6 aluminum alloy that corresponds to the published values of KIscc. The Phase I project demonstrated 1) that the RSL test method developed for steels does, in fact, measure the Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) threshold for the onset of crack growth in aluminum alloys, 2) that the sensitivity to detect the onset of crack growth is enhanced by an analytical method that defines crack initiation, 3) that specimen design enhanced notch acuity and localized the crack initiation site increases sensitivity to SCC and 4) that the test method significantly reduced both the time of test (less than 100 hours) and the number of test coupons compared to ASTM E1681. Phase II will pursue advanced development of a testing system and method for measuring SCC resistance of aluminum alloys. The system will be based on the RSL test system presently used for measuring SCC resistance of steel alloys.

In Phase II, we will extend work by adding new design aspects and implementing a fully functional approach to support high-speed accurate cyber behavior analysis and anomaly detection. The significant advantage of the proposed system is: 1) reliable and highly accurate detection, 2) scalable to high-speed networks, 3) allows aggregate detection over multiple routers/gateways, and 4) reduced false alarms.  BENEFIT:  Essentially, the proposed system is an integrated cyber behavior anomaly detection and analysis approach. It integrates recent advances on network and host level anomaly detecting techniques, as well as high-speed streaming data processing techniques. If our approach is proven successful, the potential market size is very large. In addition, our industry partner, Lockheed Martin can transition these technologies. One direct product of this research will be an integrated cyber behavior anomaly detection and analysis software tool. We expect that this tool can support different attack scenarios and various network sizes. It can detect various types of cyber attacks, malware, user misbehaviors and other anomalous cyber events with high efficiency and reliability. More importantly, the tool is very efficient for detecting new emerged cyber threats even without predefined attack signatures. The developed tool can be applied to protect enterprise-level networks such as military information networks.",

Our plan is based around consideration of many elements within the design process including: device modeling, device layout, loadpull, harmonic loadpull, thermal management, interstage power margin, packaging, long term reliability, and linearization. We will investigate multiple amplifier topologies including a Doherty amplifier for improved efficiency at lower input drive levels. Our designs will rely heavily on electromagnetic techniques as a means of minimizing the die size and hence its manufactured cost. At the end of this contract, we will not only have developed state-of-the-art amplifiers, but also a complete design methodology for GaN amplifiers that can be applied across the frequency spectrum for other Win-T applications at K, Ka, and Q-bands.",

        "abstract": "The US Army has programs that require very compact explosive drive power supplies. One such power supply is the Flux Compression Generator (FCG). Flux compression generators convert the chemical energy of explosives into electrical energy by compressing an initial magnetic field. A major advantage of FCGs is that they can be relatively small and can fit into platforms of interest, unlike conventional power supplies such as battery powered Marx generators. Unfortunately, as the size of FCGs decrease, they have higher losses due, in part, to size and tolerance scaling. However, it may be possible to take advantage of this characteristic for higher losses to couple part of the energy that would have been lost out of the flux-trapped region into Radio Frequency (RF) energy. For Army platforms of interest, the geometries of interest are 1.5 inches (40 mm) in diameter and 1 inch (25 mm) in length. We propose to explore innovative ways to convert energy typically lost due to mechanisms such as stator clocking and flux pocketing.",

The project will develop new modeling, optimization tools and algorithm concepts that provide database search and correlations facilitating intelligent decision making processes for maintenance, repair and overhaul work practices and schedules.  Ultimately, such a support tool will act upon current databases, meta-data and repair practices to arrive at considerable personnel, parts and other resources savings and shorter repair time horizons within the maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) environment.  An aircraft maintenance and repair work scope optimizer, as a decision support tool, will utilize dynamic data and meta-data information and knowledge to provide the repair work force with a daily work package that accommodates contingencies via dynamic re-planning.  Such decision support tool will be orderly, repeatable and be tightly controlled. The key experimental and research results developed in the Phase I base effort have demonstrated the requested utility and effectiveness of developing algorithms and multiple concept reasoning modules which are robust enough to independently organize and analyze textural narratives and maintenance documents to a high level of accuracy.  Complex, non-linear conceptual associations and links discovered within hundreds of thousands of independent text maintenance documents demonstrate the benefits of using advanced AI techniques to identify similarity groupings and common maintenance associations within a single, dynamic information repository, called the&quot;INFORMATION CUBE&quot;.

        "abstract": "Ultrasound guidance procedures, such as central line placement and needle biopsy, require considerable skill to precisely position a needle while simultaneously holding a transducer. Finger-mounted ultrasound (FMUS) transducer array probes may potentially improve the workflow requirements of ultrasound-guided techniques by allowing an unassisted operator to use one hand to image, palpate, immobilize, and assist with the line placement. FMUS can provide a rapid real-time imaging capability to the physician for urgent or planned central line placement, improve efficiency of the procedure, and decrease the complication rate. Farus proposes to develop a flexible FMUS transducer array and imaging system that can provide high resolution imagery of vascular structures for needle guidance procedures. This design allows the probe to conform to both the finger and the patient&quot;s body surface, while providing high resolution imagery with improved coupling and high angular coverage. This design also allows the transducer to operate in curved linear, linear, and concave conformal modes, each with a varying field of view, depth, and resolution. This Phase II effort will focus on the development and demonstration of a functional FMUS system prototype, performance of regulatory and safety testing, and implementation of a field trial to validate system performance.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The cumbersome beam director and turret associated with conventional high energy laser (HEL) weapon systems pose a significant barrier to integration of HEL technology on aircraft. Development of a viable conformal HEL system architecture based on phased array lasers would provide a critical enabling capability for aircraft that would also be relevant to ground based platforms.    Nutronics, Inc. proposes a Phase II effort to develop and demonstrate, in a laboratory environment, our innovative Conformal Laser Weapon System (CLAWS) architecture with non-cooperative extended targets.  CLAWS leverages an innovative Nutronics HEL phasing approach that phases from the master oscillator to the target.  CLAWS is conformal, realizing the vision of phased array laser systems. CLAWS does not use a beacon illuminator, instead using the return from the HEL beam on the target for phasing the HEL.  CLAWS is not degraded by time of flight. CLAWS utilizes an innovative non-iterative phased array imaging method. The proposed effort will develop and deliver a 4-7 subaperture demonstrator testbed and verify the capability of CLAWS using laboratory testing with simulated non-cooperative targets.  The developed demonstrator testbed will be traceable to the requirements developed for an operational CLAWS under our Phase I effort.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The current static nature of systems and networks allows attackers to gather intelligence, perform planning, and then execute attacks at will.   If instead we remove this underlying static nature and make the network dynamic, many classes of attacks can be prevented by making them too difficult to carry out without detection as well as by reducing their probability and level of success.  To address this critical need, IAI, along with our collaborator Lockheed Martin MS2 Tactical Systems, proposes a novel network architecture to induce and manage dynamics in the network.  By creating a System-level Dynamic Network Architecture (SDNA) that allows the use of multiple techniques in a complementary manner, the system can more effectively prevent and respond to attacks.  Dynamically mutating various network components such as availability, routing, addressing, and naming in a coordinated way forces attackers to expend significant effort when conducting attacks.  SDNA also allows static parts of the network to be presented as dynamic to users and attackers, while limiting the modifications needed to end users and applications by acting transparently and automatically.  Through these combined techniques, SDNA disrupts an attackers ability to compromise and spread through the network.  BENEFIT:  The market addressed by the propose work includes all systems with security and survivability concerns.  A wide range of DoD and commercial systems suffer from the need for a stronger operation posture against attacks and can potentially be enhanced by the proposed work.  Complex systems such as the Global Information Grid (GIG) must be secure, survivable, and maintain an operational posture with maximum transparency through cyber attacks.  Enterprise systems require security to allow sensitive financial, industrial, and personal information to be transmitted across computer networks.  Countless time and money is spent as system administrators constantly work to stay ahead of potential attackers, effort which the proposed approach will help automate.  This work also directly complements the Air Force Software Protection Initiative (SPI) program, providing network and system security.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Production management concepts are needed to promote improved factory management and response to changing conditions.  Goals of this effort are to reduce human effort through knowledge sharing of stakeholders and generate a responsive recognition of suppliers&#039;contributions to end products.  Improvements include reduction in time required to fabricate subsystems, less cost to fabricate end-items, and a capability to become responsive to customer demand.  Raytheon needs manufacturing practices for producing high quality products in an efficient, economical, and time responsive manner.  Decision Sciences, Inc. will team with Raytheon for commercialization of the VPM methodology to perform near real-time prediction of production yields for ESSM and other missile systems.  New processes will integrate critical component information from key suppliers and mine information from legacy systems, both prime contractor and supplier&#039;s as available.  Information is critical for performing predictive analysis.  A Vertical Program Management (i.e., integration of key knowledge sharing throughout the supply chain) concept of total stakeholder involvement for a single product output will be melded with existing commercial concepts for manufacturing planning to provide a lean manufacturing approach that results in improved production efficiency and predictability.  Results are expected to include increased prime integrator/supply chain partnering and bring product awareness to the entire value stream.  BENEFIT:  The benefits of the Vertical Program Management (VPM) concept are far reaching.  They include generation of applications that seamlessly and non-intrusively integrate with existing Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP) systems (e.g., SAP and Oracle) and create self-contained and easy-to-use applications allowing managers and decision makers to&quot;look down&quot;into supplier networks, see vendor information, and visualize production of needed components.  The resulting impact of VPM upon fabrication processes of delivery schedules shortened, cost of manufacturing reduced, and production yields greatly improved.  Production status, communication of queries, information exchange, and gathering of data related to acquisition become readily available to stakeholders.  Necessary communications become automatic and interchange of information is a granted product.  Alerts are forthcoming in a timely manner to help defray delays and identify status allowing proactive correction of issues.  The communications capability can provide for manual and free interchange of information through queries, and can interface with stakeholders through existing communication systems (e.g., Microsoft Office Outlook ).

Each system is a scalable and modular design, which allows for improved performance capabilities on larger UAVs, such as Shadow or Predator.

Military uses of this system include locating enemy communication radios, cell phones, data links, jammers, remote detonation transmitters, and radars. Specific applications include Blue Force tracking or Combat Search and Rescue. While this system initially would be carried on a UAV, the technology is platform independent and could be used on manned airplanes, helicopters, tanks, APCs, and as a hand-held unit for troops. For civilian applications, DHS has already recognized and tasked the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to address the risk of US airports being disrupted by RF emitters. A hand-held variant of this system could readily assist DHS enforcement teams in locating such terrorist devices and even in apprehending the perpetrators. Also, smaller low cost units could be used at each airport for monitoring FAA communication channels to ensure flight safety.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Current state-of-the-art, high voltage, pulsed power systems designed to drive high power microwave (HPM) sources utilize Marx generator designs.  The high voltage insulation of these devices has been traditionally based on either high dielectric strength oil or sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).  The dielectric strength of the insulating medium determines the minimum size of the tank enclosure of the Marx generator since it determines the maximum voltage standoff between the fully erected Marx output voltage and the tank wall.  For example, AFRL has found that insulating an eight-stage linear configuration Marx generator employing 100 kilovolt capacitors requires nearly 50 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) of SF6 to insulate a six centimeter distance between the capacitors and the tank wall.  In phase I we demonstrated that the&quot;Nested High Voltage&quot;insulation geometry can successfully be used to insulate the voltages required while being compatible and convenient for the production of the pulses required.  We propose to implement our&quot;Nested Generator Insulation&quot;at full scale in order to reduce the size of 500 kV class HV generators to a diameter of 35 cm or less.  This solid insulation technique uses field grading foils that minimized the distance from the fully erected voltage and the tank wall.  That distance can be reduced by more than 50% to less than three centimeters in successful NHVG style designs.  This proposal describes the implementation of the Nested technology in order to produce a full sized test device based on the technology.  That device will be delivered to AFRL with a 500 kV, 10 kA nominal output under load and an outer diameter of roughly 35 cm.  BENEFIT:  The NHVG technology is the subject of active commercialization in its DC embodiment.  We see potentials for the integration of the pulse generator with the DC NHVG in areas such as RF accelerators for cancer therapy, security, and medical sterilization.  In such an embodiment, the Klystron and pulse system would be integrated together with switching provided by the grid of the electron gun.  The customers would be suppliers of Cancer therapy machines such as Phillips, Varian, Seimens, and Mitsubishi.  Security application are in cargo inspection.",

The project will explore the application of the technology, including an application to streamline the Market Research and Source Selection Phases of the Air Force&quot;s acquisition cycle, as well as an application that will help intelligence analysts monitor open source data.  BENEFIT:  To achieve significant improvement in situation awareness applications, we need easy-to-use systems that enable information to be integrated and monitored, without necessitating a long, arduous, expensive programming project for each application that is created. The research described here will develop such an approach for collecting, integrating and monitoring information about entities.  The work has multiple applications for the Air Force, such as streamlining the Market Research and Source Selection Phases of the Air Force&quot;s acquisition cycle.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  To reduce the incidence of fratricide, improve time to engagement,  and increase situational awareness, the Air Force is pursuing  technologies with the capability of positively identifying  non-cooperative targets. However, single-sensor NCTR systems may be  unable to resolve all target identification ambiguities. Thus, there is  a significant need for a system that can fuse information from  multiple dissimilar sensors and produce joint target identification  hypotheses.  The proposed program will address these needs through the  development of a distributed, multi-sensor, non-cooperative target  recognition (NCTR) system.  A key innovation to be provided by the  proposed solution is the ability to integrate the NCTR system  with a distributed tracking system to achieve a single integrated ID  picture across a network of platforms.  Further, the solution will  provide a NCTR information compression capability that will enable  operations in bandwidth-constrained environment. The effort will  also enhance algorithms for runtime efficiency and develop  uncertainty management techniques for improved robustness. An  advanced software prototype will be implemented to demonstrate the  NCTR capabilities on relevant problems. In the development of the  prototype, Numerica plans to align NCTR fusion system with needs in  the AWACS and NCCT programs to enhance the transition opportunities.  BENEFIT:  At the present time, most Air Force ISR platforms operate  independently from other ISR collectors (i.e., without integrated  networked sensing), and the non-cooperative target recognition  (NCTR) systems on these platforms operate using data from a single  sensor. As such, the target identification capabilities are  significantly limited over what could be achieved through  aggregation of the information available throughout the network.  A  fundamental benefit to be provided by this research program is a new  capability for distributed (network-centric) NCTR processing. In the  envisioned solution, the NCTR algorithms will interface with a  network-centric tracker to ensure that NCTR processors throughout  the network process feature and classification data in a coordinated  way.  This will enable a single integrated ID picture to be  achieved, a capability that is critical for fratricide reduction and  improved time to engagement. Another key benefit to be provided by  this research program is a capability to perform NCTR data  compression for distribution throughout the network. Feature data  from some sensors is liable to be large, thus transmission of all  NCTR data throughout a bandwidth-constrained network will be  prohibitive. Schemes that compress the NCTR data, yet minimize the  degradation in NCTR performance, are needed and this program will  pursue the capability. A third benefit of the proposed program is  the development of techniques that provide fusion algorithm  efficiency enhancements by trading runtime performance for  classification estimation precision. Also, algorithms that provide  uncertainty management will be developed; the capability is critical  for improving the reliability of the NCTR estimate, and thus  reducing the incidence of incorrect target identification. Finally,  a software prototype will be developed to demonstrate the  capabilities of the NCTR fusion system on relevant Air Force  scenario data. The overall benefit of this program to the Air Force  will be the development of a mature NCTR Fusion System, and the  preparation of relevant demonstration results, that is capable of  providing a transition solution to Air Force programs such as AWACS  and NCCT.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  MZA, teamed with UCLA and Notre Dame proposes the design, development, verification, and demonstration of a real-time adaptive optics (AO) wavefront control processor implementing the linear time-invariant (LTI) predictive control algorithm investigated in Phase I.  We will also conduct WaveTrain engineering simulations for an aircraft tactical laser system operating in transonic flight to address real-world physical phenomena such as realistic aero-optical effects, beacon illuminator propagation, and limited SNR which influence the operation of the LTI predictive controller.  A key aspect of the design of the AO processor is to provide an interface of the hardware to WaveTrain models, thereby allowing our real-time implementation to be tested directly in the simulated environment.  We will develop a FPGA-based AO controller solution presenting a standard camera interface and which couples well with high-speed deformable mirrors (DMs) currently under development for AFRL/RD and HEL-JTO.  We will conduct laboratory tests with these DMs to verify proper AO operation with update rates of at least 10 kHz.  We will use the AO processor and DM hardware from our laboratory verification testing to demonstrate AO compensation at the Notre Dame wind tunnel facility, including flow conditioning which is synergistic with predictive AO control.  BENEFIT:  Robust adaptive optics compensation of aero-optics and free-stream turbulence for tactical aircraft-based lasers requires predictive control methods which will address performance degradation resulting from finite sample rate of wavefront sensors and the associated latency.  Our Phase II program will result in a real-time, high-speed, AO wavefront control processor implementing LTI predictive control of compact high-speed DMs.  The resulting AO systems will provide high-quality atmospheric and aero-optical disturbance compensation without placing artificially high burdens on AO illuminator technology which may be difficult to achieve in a practical system.  Such a solution has immediate use in near-term electric laser system designs for aircraft platforms such as the Air Force ELLA program.  The Army&quot;s mobile THEL program would also benefit from this technology.  Offering a well-integrated processor and controller for high-speed AO applications resulting from this Phase II project will enable a commercial-grade AO product for aircraft applications, including beam control, imaging, laser illumination/designation, and laser communications.  These systems could also be used in solid-state resonator beam clean-up where aberrations from gain media coolant flow limit available beam quality at higher laser power levels.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The goal of this project is to develop key algorithmic components for predictive control of wavefront aberrations in aero-optics systems.  Prediction should allow for improved performance over existing approaches and/or the use of low-cost commercial off-the-shelf components in these systems.  One of the key components developed in the Phase I effort was a novel technique, which we dubbed GAFFE, to more efficiently estimate the velocity fields in turbulent flow scenarios.  In Phase II GAFFE will be used for system identification in the predictive control algorithms under development.  A detailed performance analyses will be conducted with high fidelity simulation tools to establish the effective performance envelope.  A real-time control architecture will be defined including identification of computer processors that may be used in real-time implementations of these algorithms.  Important applications of this work include space surveillance, laser communications and weapons, and remote sensing.  Real-time adaptive optics implementations are also critically important in ground-based astronomy.  BENEFIT:  The product of this research is a control architecture to optimally compensate for optical disturbances due to turbulence, both free space and boundary layer, in the presence of various noise sources.  Implementing this control scheme is obviously desirable in: 1) the development of laser weapons, especially to Air Force programs such as ATL, and 2) in providing defensive laser platforms on ships and military transport aircraft.  In addition, the technologies developed here will also be useful in other adaptive optics applications such as laser communications, remote sensing, and astronomy.  Current UAVs have no need for this technology, but existing UAVs such as Global Hawk, Predator, and Avenger are large enough to support adaptive optics in the future and may benefit from this technology.  Although the number of astronomical adaptive optics systems is quite small, these systems are quite sophisticated and may greatly benefit from the work to be carried out in this proposal.",

        "abstract": "HYPRES proposes an innovative solution to Navy&quot;s need for concurrent multi-netting (CMN) in a single receiver. Our approach involves direct digitization of the entire wideband Link-16 RF band followed by distribution of digital copies among multiple independent, parallel processing chains. This digital-RF approach ensures scalability to multiple nets with no loss of signal power and fidelity, while eliminating expensive analog components such as fast hopping synthesizers. In collaboration with ViaSat, a prime contractor for Link-16 terminals, HYPRES demonstrated the power of digital-RF technology with a two-net dehopping receiver prototype with ONR Discovery and Invention funding. During that program, we discovered a signal processing technique, which is ideally suited for direct demodulation of the Link-16 waveform, and presents a unique opportunity to significantly condense back-end processing hardware. In Phase I, this new technique was developed through extensive functional modeling and simulation. The design was then optimized for implementation on commercial FPGAs. Building on this strong foundation, in Phase II, we propose to develop, demonstrate, and deliver hardware that is capable of operating on digitized RF data to demodulate and dehop multiple Link-16 nets concurrently.

Therefore, the susceptibility of modern weapon, reconnaissance, and surveillance systems  in particular those with optical sensors  is acute. Recent interest in protection of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and their sensor suites has become extremely important as the use of UAVs on the modern battlefield increases. There is currently no means of rapidly detecting radiation from laser-based DEW, determining the precise location of the source, and directing countermeasures to the potentially hazardous energy. The ability to rapidly scan a full hemisphere for potential threats would allow the UAV system to quickly take evasive action or engage optical sensor protection systems, or even to cue defensive systems. Nanohmics designed and built a novel, low-power consumption, low-cost optical system for integration on existing UAV platforms that has a hemispherical field of view. In this program phase, Nanohmics will extend this development to cover visible, SWIR, MWIR and LWIR wavelengths and interface the hardware to UAVs for flight testing.

        "abstract": "Current multipoint initiation systems employ multiple LEEFI initiators which require precise timing and higher energy firing systems. Common problems with current technology include high cost, high volume and high energy needs. RSI working with the Navy at China Lake is proposing to build and test several variants of a new multipoint initiation system having several important features. First it can achieve a high degree of simultaneity required for multipoint devices. Secondly, inadvertent initiation at any single point on the perimeter will not propagate to other points. Finally the system will have very low cost LEEFI initiators and a low energy firing system. The system is compliant with MIL-DTL-23659. This multipoint system was successfully demonstrated in Phase I. The overall array is tailorable from 3 to many points with a large diameter range. RSI together with the Navy has taken steps to patent this technology. Specific work will be done during the phase II effort to optimize the explosive chain design, decrease system weight, demonstrate functionality at temperature extremes and complete design verification testing. Work will also be done to put in place facility resources needed to protect the technology and produce the initiators in a controlled and secure environment.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop a novel membrane for a broad spectrum of hydrocarbon separations. The initial focus of the project is the development of a selective membrane for efficient separation of hydrocarbons from methane in natural gas processing and separation of hydrocarbons from hydrogen in refinery applications. The chemically robust polymeric membrane will be of a composite configuration comprised of a hollow fiber porous support with a superimposed several hundred angstroms thick separation layer. The nano-structured morphology of the separation layer will enable selective fractionation of hydrocarbon molecules. The broader/commercial impact of this project is the reduction of energy consumption currently used in separation and purification of hydrocarbons found in oil and gas. In addition, if successful, petrochemical industries will reduce emissions of green house gases, including methane and carbon dioxide. The membrane will effect molecular level separation of hydrocarbons and will be capable of operation in harsh environments and at high temperatures. The initial market for this technology is the recovery of natural gas and hydrocarbon liquids from the associated natural gas in remote geographic locations (gas generated during oil production) that is currently flared. Development of the proposed technology will enable recovery of the methane and high value hydrocarbons at the well with extensive economic and environmental benefits. The membrane is expected to find further utility in high value gas and liquid separation applications including hydrogen recovery from refinery fuel gas, olefin/paraffin separation, and generic hydrocarbon fractionation.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to commercialize Lecturetools, an in-class integrated learning environment, to improve the quality of large, gateway higher education courses. Faced with the emerging online distance learning initiatives, traditional face-to-face oriented institutions are challenged to respond with innovative teaching approaches that validate their long established face-to-face teaching model. Many studies have shown poor student engagement and retention rates in traditional large-scale collegiate classrooms. At the same time, the model of using expensive, printed course textbooks is under great pressure - simply providing monolithic textbooks, printed or electronically, is not sufficient for successful student engagement or learning. An NSF panel considered the state of the college textbook and summarized that: The textbook of the future will be the organizing hub of an integrated learning environment where the student experience is key. The combination of advancements in web-based technology and the proliferation of laptops among students offer an opportunity to address both of these issues. LectureTools Inc. proposes to deliver an integrated learning environment that joins textbook materials with student response and inquiry, lecture delivery and student note-taking functionality. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project results from the integration of multiple in-class learning tools strategically aimed at improving the educational opportunities in large gateway courses. These courses, with hundreds of students, too often offer few opportunities for active, engaging learning. Clicker companies offer multiple-choice student response systems, but few other question types, no direct access to textbook content and little, if any, functionality for student questioning or note taking. Course management systems (e.g. Blackboard, Moodle, Sakai) have been successful in organizing course assignments, grading and resource sharing that happen outside the classroom, but have not penetrated the in-class experience where LectureTools is uniquely targeted toward improving student engagement and learning. Publishing companies offer online access to textbooks, but not integrated with in-class activities. With the student response market projected to be $290M and the overall textbook market projected to be $6B by 2014, LectureTools is well positioned to capture a sizable proportion of these markets. The University of Michigan serves as a testbed and is offering a LectureTools to all courses starting in the fall, 2010. Contracts are already in place with major textbook publishers to supply the initial textbook content.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build upon the success of Phase I which demonstrated the feasibility of a high resolution three-dimensional (3D) imaging system, based on a new technology that allows simultaneous 3D coordinate measurement and high resolution imagery using commercial off-the-shelf Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) or Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) sensors. Although stereoscopic 3D images and movies have existed for over 100 years, only recently have 3D laser scanners which can reach 1 mm accuracies for single points at ranges of tens of meters and triangulation systems which can achieve 0.1 mm accuracies at ranges up to 2 m been developed. These systems produce no images and must assemble a collection of single 3D points over time. Phase I demonstrated the ability to capture 3D images using a 6 megapixel focal plane array with sub-centimeter accuracy and identified areas where further improvement can be achieved. The Phase II effort will implement these improvements but will focus on the engineering, miniaturization and fabrication of a 3D camera prototype which has performance and a form-factor traceable to the alpha version of a commercial 3D survey-grade instrument. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will benefit multiple industries, from aerospace to industrial surveying to movie and game special effects, by providing the new capability to record and measure objects, motion and scenes in three dimensions with imagery and in real-time. Current technology, e.g. 3D laser scanners and motion capture systems, used to capture 3D coordinates of objects and surfaces is slow, difficult to use, and either can only be used on static objects or requires special suits and sound stages with limited resolution. Despite the difficulty and associated high cost, the value of 3D data is such that its use in 3D industrial survey has been growing at 40% per year, reaching $425M in 2008. The high resolution 3D camera technology subject of this SBIR has been demonstrated in Phase I to have the potential to increase the acquisition speed by 100X over current solutions while reducing total data collection and processing costs by 10X. While this speed and resolution improvement will have a large impact on current markets, the capability to have high resolution images of moving objects with 3D coordinate measurements at each pixel enables a large number of new markets such as 3D biometrics, security, cost-effective digital heritage preservation, real-time measurement of 3D trajectories and robotic vision.",

        "abstract": "Anodizing is the most common surface treatment of aluminum. The natural oxide layer formed provides excellent corrosion and wear resistance. Anodizing processes have relied heavily on the inefficient process of individual racking of the parts. Alternate techniques have been developed but surface problems such as burning cause high scrap rates. A new process for anodizing large quantities of small arms parts for Marine Corps military applications was demonstrated during Phase I. The process produced small arms parts having equivalent hardness, abrasion resistance, and corrosion resistance compared to conventionally anodized parts. This technique will meet an immediate demand for improved high volume processing without the need for individual racking, while maintaining the high surface quality to meet military standards. Phase II will build upon the Phase I work to produce prototype hardware for pilot-scale anodizing of small aluminum parts. The anodizing process will be optimized and process parameters developed that cover anodizing requirements for a wide range of parts. Anodized parts will be tested and their performance will be compared to the performance and reliability of parts obtained with state-of-the-art anodizing processes. The objectives of Phase II include process development, testing, specification compliance, and transition of the process to MCLB facilities.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The coordination and management of sensor data collection has a strong influence on the accuracy and completeness of the fused situational awareness picture.  To provide the best possible picture, Toyon Research proposes to develop algorithms which generate controls for a collection of UAVs in order to maximize the probability of identifying and maintaining track on suspected enemy vehicles or dismounts.  Algorithm inputs will include environmental data (terrain, roads, buildings), sensor, platform, and target motion models, and the current network centric fused estimate of the surveillance region. We will develop our control algorithms to address a number of real-world issues (e.g., limits on communication links, UAV fuel limits, communication and processing delays) as well as incorporate environmental information (traffic densities, obscuration, etc.) and operational priorities into the routing algorithm&quot;s objective function. Our sensor systems will include one standoff platform with radar, UGS distributed throughout the surveillance region, and multiple UAVs with video sensors. We will consider a decentralized architecture in which multiple operation centers are distributed throughout the region, each maintaining control of multiple UAVs but sharing track information to promote collaboration. The algorithms will be tested and evaluated within a simulated environment as well as in hardware-in-the-loop experiments.  BENEFIT:  Automatic route and task generation for sensor assets has immediate application to network centric warfare.  In addition, the algorithm technology can seamlessly transition into our Geospatial Analysis and Planning Support (GAPS) Toolbox application, which is sponsored by JFCOM Joint Urban Operation Office.  In addition to military systems, the technology developed during this project will serve as a foundation for planning tools for manned and unmanned systems, providing, for example, emergency response plans for natural disasters or biological, chemical, or nuclear attacks.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Without the capability to sense and avoid other air traffic, UAS flights are limited to flight operations within restricted and warning areas unless the proponent obtains a Certificate of Authorization (COA) from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  FAA Order 7610.4 states that remotely operated aircraft must have an equivalent level of safety, comparable to see-and-avoid requirements for manned aircraft, to fly in the national air space.  DRA&quot;s SAA system, addresses this requirement usong passive electro-optic (EO) sensors to detect, track and alert on aircraft that appear on a collision course. The EO system does not provide accurate range information.. Without accurate range, the UAS may maneuver earlier or more aggressively than necessary. Range information can correct this problem.. In addition, with multiple aircraft in the area, range and range rate allow the SAA system to prioritize intruding aircraft, and to select the best maneuver.  The LADAR can also provide other information to reduce the false alarm rate.     The DRA Team will develop and demonstrate a prototype LADAR-Enhanced EO SAA System (LEOS). to show the benefits of adding an active, interrogating component to the passive EO SAA system.

TREDA addresses the DARPA need for a small, directional, high gain antenna to operate in the 1 Hz-100 kHz frequency band. Phase I work conclusively demonstrated TREDA feasibility through analysis, numerical simulation, and experimental demonstration. Overall system architecture, system prototype design, and a test plan for Phase II have been developed. The Phase I feasibility study demonstrated the capability of TREDA to provide high gain (&gt;-15 dBi), directionality (&gt;-9 dBi), and efficiency, narrow beamwidth (3 degrees), highly positive forward-to-back ratio (&gt;45 dB), and high input power (&gt;1000 W) in a compact footprint. In addition, size, weight, and power analysis showed that the TREDA system can be integrated into existing military stationary airborne platforms for application to detection and characterization of underground tunnels. In Phase II, POC will finalize the development of the TREDA technology and ready it for transition to a DoD program in Phase III. The groundbreaking TREDA Phase II prototype will be fully characterized and performance will be demonstrated to DARPA personnel.",

In Phase II, we relax these constraints and generalize the capability for more communication waveforms and signal sources, and develop a prototype communication system demonstrating the capability in open air tests through real world propagation. Of particular emphasis is the underdetermined case, where there are more signals in a received mixture than available receiver channels.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  High power fiber lasers have made significant progress in last several years. Several kW of output power has been demonstrated, which enables a wide range of new applications from laser welding, laser cutting, and laser drilling to military defense. While high power fiber lasers have been successfully deployed in industry, one piece of critical components, fiber isolator, is still not available. For the moment, free-space isolator has to be used.  In this proposal, we propose to develop an all-fiber isolator for 1 micron high power fiber lasers and amplifiers. An all-fiber isolator with multi-hundreds throughput power level will be demonstrated and delivered. Successful development of this proposed high Verdet constant fiber and all-fiber isolator will enable many new applications of high power fiber lasers, and revolutionize high power fiber laser and amplifier developments.  BENEFIT:  This proposed all-fiber isolator can be used for current DoD high power 1 micron fiber lasers and amplifiers programs. It can also be used for industrial high power fiber lasers. The development of this proposed all-fiber isolator can extend the life of many fiber lasers and amplifiers, further improve the reliability of fiber lasers, and enable coherent beam combining.",

        "abstract": "To support tactical fuel requirements at forward bases, biomass wastes from operations, and those locally available, need to be converted into viable military fuels. Conventional approaches cannot produce military type fuels using compact and mobile reactors. Under a Phase I effort, Altex and Pennsylvania State University worked together to show the feasibility of integrating CAMBS non-catalytic and catalytic process steps to produce a JP-8 type fuel from military housing and wood waste at low cost. Furthermore, the process can be packaged to fit in containers for easy deployment to forward bases. The proposed Phase II effort will prove the performance of the CAMBS prototype system to operate on housing and wood waste and generate a JP-8 like fuel. The field unit will have all of the features of a full-scale unit and represent a CAMBS production unit for plant capacities from 5 to 50 tons per day of biomass. Once these prototype tests and a preliminary economic analysis are completed, a conclusion will be reached on the performance and economics of the concept. The Phase II effort provides results that fully demonstrate CAMBS in a well-controlled laboratory environment, where technical risks can be addressed and reduced.",

The methods evaluated were the phase Doppler interferometry technique that will be developed into a dedicated extended range cloud probe (PDI ExR CP) for helicopter icing research. This probe will also be commercialized for a much wider range of applications. The high-speed multi-beam imaging (HSI) probe was shown to be capable of measuring droplets and irregular-shaped particles such as ice crystals in mixed phase flows. This method also will be commercialized to cover a much broader range of applications. Under the Phase II program, the probes will be further designed, built, tested and delivered to the Army.

        "abstract": "Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) is an airspace surveillance system being implemented in the US and several nations globally. In this system, each aircraft determines its location using GPS, and broadcasts this to other local traffic and ground stations, along with other flight data (aircraft ID, speed, heading, flight number, altitude, etc). This endows local traffic with high situational awareness, enabling greater security, efficiency and airspace capacity. However, ADS-B can be effectively spoofed using a simple ADS-B transmitter driven by a computer and a GPS simulator program. For the DoD, the issue is one of denial of airspace access: an adversary can put up phantom traffic in a contested airspace, thus preventing allied aircraft from entering. Therefore, there is an immediate need for airborne military aircraft to be able to detect spoofed ADS-B reports in real time, in a stand-alone manner. In this SBIR project, KalScott Engineering is developing and demonstrating a method to detect spoofing of ADS-B reports using airborne signals intelligence (SIGINT) techniques.

        "abstract": "NanoSonic has designed and physically demonstrated Shape Memory-Metal RubberTM (SM-MR) thermoresponsive skins that rapidly trigger a mechanically adaptive response  in 5-10 seconds over airfoil sections for Remotely Piloted Vehicles (RPV) with wingspans up to 9&#039;.  The skin&#039;s modulus is reduced by several orders of magnitude at a rate of 13degC/second, yet the wing remains durable and recovers to its nominal structural state efficiently via a nanostructured thermally responsive reinforcing system.  SM-MR durable morphing wings are based on shape memory polymers (Tg&gt;95degC) self-assembled with electrically conductive nanoparticles that maintain EMI SE up to -88 dB upon repeated mechanical cycling, and high levels of EMI SE upon 50% elongation.  NanoSonic has recently harnessed the observed change in nanoparticle percolation dynamics upon mechanical strain as novel switches and air data sensors with co-located thin film transistors (TFTs).  NanoSonic has teamed with the University of Florida to demonstrate morphing wings on Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) that can sense and adapt to the environment on the fly.  The current morphing-sensing wing and hardware accommodates less than 5% of the gross RPV weight, and hence, can accommodate additional identification and tracking sensors to provide critical command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) feedback.  BENEFIT:  NanoSonic&#039;s SM-MR electrically conductive, durable, rapid morphing skins shall be initially developed as multifunctional adaptive wings and protective shielding materials for remotely piloted vehicles.  Such skins offer the added benefit of air data sensing as a proprietary technique results in unique sensors embedded within the structure.  SM-MR will be primarily transitioned onto morphing aircraft to ensure efficient wing morphing and electromagnetic stability during disparate vehicle configurations.  Air data and optical sensors will provide remote critical C4ISR feedback.  Additional military applications for various forms of the Metal RubberTM nanocomposites include biomimetric systems, thermal control system materials, actuators, lightning strike protection, RF shielding for large area structures and sensors.  Dual-use civil applications include low modulus conducting electrodes for high strain mechanical actuator and sensor devices, such as in medical prostheses or implanted bio-electronic devices, lightweight mechanical, electrical and thermal interconnection of electronic components on conventional circuit boards, and lightweight electronic flex circuits.",

        "abstract": "The ability to monitor the health of military assets/equipment, to know their history, and to estimate their condition and/or useful life is an important issue for military planners. A key aspect of such heath monitoring (HM) concepts is a system that can sense, record, and store the history data of environmental exposures of an asset over its lifetime. Environmental parameters of most interest include temperature, relative humidity, inertial shock, vibration, and strain. Such systems ideally require sensors that: are very small, utilize little power, operate in extreme environments, are maintenance free, and are low cost. Sensors with additional integrated functionalities such as data storage, smart data interpretation, and wireless/wired communications are highly advantageous. Due to inherent size, flexibility, and scalability advantages, Micro-Electro-Mechanical-System (MEMS) based sensor technologies are strong candidates for HM systems. An integrated MEMS multi-sensor module that incorporates the above functionalities would help address life cycle cost and operational effectiveness issues concerning many military assets/equipment. Phase I demonstrated the feasibly of a proposed technology through modeling and the demonstration of prototype HM modules. The Phase II efforts will focus on improving Phase I developed hardware designs, implementing additional features, reducing the overall size of the complete HM module using advanced electronics integration technologies, and demonstrating prototype devices.",

The proposed flare technology uses laser diodes to generate infrared light that matches the illumination intensity of the propellant-based M-278 flare. During Phase I PSI developed a preliminary prototype design for the solid-state flare that meets the required performance specifications. During Phase II the four primary subsystems of the flare: the illumination source, the optical system, the electrical power source and the thermal management subsystem will be optimized. The resulting subsystems will then be integrated into an experimental prototype. After completing functionality testing of the initial prototype, several alpha prototypes will be fabricated and subjected to environmental (vibration, shock, etc.) and field testing.

A key goal will be to advance the construction of the contact lenses to be ready for commercial market tests and OEM partner evaluations. Although the Phase I devices are fully functional and have validated the analytical predictions, they are not yet suitable for commercialization. The main deficiencies are the non-permeability of the polarization filter, the inadequacy of the joining adhesive, and the immaturity of the manufacturing processes. This project plans to develop a highly gas permeable polarizer using nano-imprinting onto gas permeable polymers. In addition, the contact lens construction techniques will be advanced in order to improve optical performance. A further goal is to develop prototype stereographic video eyewear to be used together with the contact lenses in support of clinical evaluations. Lastly, an IRB protocol will be developed and the contact lenses will be put through clinical trials. It is anticipated that all-day- wear contact lenses can be produced that will be able to meet FDA approval, and the performance advantages of this new display system can be evaluated during formal clinical tests. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be a significant improvement in how mobile and immersive imagery is viewed. Today, mobile computing devices must present their information through small LCD panels, while immersive computing must settle for the limited fields of view available through flat panel monitors and TVs. Wearable electronic eyewear are available today that attempt to address these limitations, but they themselves suffer from limited fields of view and excess bulk. This SBIR research will address the remaining unresolved technical challenges in order to prepare this new display concept for commercialization. If successful, a meaningful enhancement of human vision will have been achieved by making it possible to directly view very near objects without impacting normal distance vision. These advancements will enable many new applications for wearable displays including augmented reality, highly immersive 3-D video, stylish mobile display eyewear, wearable surgical imaging devices, and even comfortable high quality electronic low vision aids for sufferers of macular degeneration and other vision disorders.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop the next-generation chip-scale Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) gyroscopes for use in wireless devices that now require unprecedented device performance with minimum possible footprint. For instance, inertial navigation and motion sensing in most cellular devices require gyroscopes with small size, high sensitivity and stability, low drift and low power consumption. Most MEMS gyroscopes used in consumer electronics and wireless devices do not yet meet all the criteria for large-scale deployment in the fastest growing segment of the market: handheld devices. Existing MEMS gyroscopes are fundamentally limited by their underlying technology - electrostatic actuation and detection of vibration and rotational amplitudes. For this research project, a new approach has been proposed to the engineering of MEMS gyroscopes that can detect 3-axis rotation with unprecedented sensitivity and stability with minimal footprint. The goals of the Phase II project are to (i) develop both 2-axis (x-y) and hybrid 3-axis (x-y, z) micromechanical gyroscopes; (ii) develop associated driving and sensing integrated circuits (IC); (iii) test and characterize the devices for optimal performance parameters; (iv) bond the IC wafer to the MEMS wafer with wafer-level packaging. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project can lead to a revolution in the consumer wireless systems market with the standing promise of an integrated single-chip inertial sensor and timing device. Micromechanical gyroscopes have increasing relevance in inertial navigation systems and automotive applications. Beyond these applications which require devices with better sensitivity and stability, a host of new applications in consumer electronics have suddenly emerged. In particular, handheld devices such as cellular devices and GPS systems, and gaming consoles such as the Nintendo Wii now include miniature gyroscopes that must have extremely small footprint and consume very little power. The proposed approach lends itself to natural chip-scale integration with timing devices for future production of Timing and Inertial Motion-Sensing Units (TIMU), necessary for next generation inertial navigation. Another commercial impact will be on the chip manufacturing industry, as the integrated circuits (IC) wafers will be fabricated in the United States, in potentially high volumes.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to address a need in science education that is non-linearly becoming a serious problem. In general, educational technology has had a weak track record for positively impacting student understanding in the area of science. Research clearly suggests that students&#039; use of science simulation programs does have a positive impact on their achievement and understanding. There is a dearth of such software, and the simulations that are available are ?heavyweight? - typically computationally, financially, curricularly, and cognitively demanding. The GoKnow AniModeler Software Factory seeks to demonstrate how to build a software factory that can deliver 36, lightweight science simulations for $1 per student per year! During our Phase I SBIR effort, the company will develop the object-oriented architecture underlying the AniModeler simulation engine. Their challenge in Phase II is to build a factory system that exploits that architecture such that the creation of a simulation program ? an AniModeler ? is done by a science educator without any programmer assistance and it outputs, automatically with versions for 5 operating systems. Supporting consumer functionality such as, mobile and lightweight applications are the future of software development. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project addresses the full range of stakeholders: (1) In contrast to activities such as filling out worksheets, in using GoKnow&#039;s AniModelers in collaboration with their peers, students will see science as a social activity, sparked by a desire to understand how and why?not as a boring, solitary activity. Students will see science as a fun activity- successfully understanding how and why something works is a good ? fun ? feeling. (2) Teachers will see that lightweight, easy-to-learn-to-use, narrowly focused apps ? just like the apps on their smartphones - are much easier to integrate into their existing curriculum when compared with typical educational software that is expensive and so profusely functional that it takes excessive class time to learn. (3) Educators will see that educational software doesn&#039;t necessarily need to cost an arm and a leg, and that Open Source is not the only alternative. (4) Science publishers will see educational software as positively contributing to the value of their print offerings - especially when they make money from the software. (5) And, last but surely not least, AniModelers can demonstrate to software developers that educational software can be a lucrative business!",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop an antimicrobial polymer technology with silver compounded into the catheter matrix, which allows for antimicrobial action expected to last several months. This cost-effective antimicrobial polymer technology prevents the formation of surface biofilms on long-term implantable devices, without generating bacterial resistance. The root cause of these infections is the bacterial colonization of the catheter, with the likelihood of infection increasing as a function of catheter implantation time. Currently, there are no low-cost, long-term antimicrobial catheters, thus the proposed technology would fill a much needed clinical demand. The broader/commercial impact of this project addresses the 280,000 catheter-related bloodstream infections in the U.S. that cost over $3 billion per year in excess healthcare costs, claiming 80,000 deaths. The proposed technology will help clinicians attain and sustain zero indwelling catheter bloodstream infections. The $1.2 billion implantable device market urgently needs inherently antimicrobial catheters, thus obviating the need for systemic antibiotic treatment. Since no expensive coating procedures have to be performed, it will lead to cost effective manufacturing. This should lead to rapid commercialization of a family of antimicrobial catheters, especially since these advanced catheters will significantly help to reduce outcome costs.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will create electronic paper displays from a new e-paper technology that promises substantially improved black and white contrast, bright color images, multimedia/internet update speeds, and zero power image hold. The technology, an electrofluidic pixel that uses voltage to move a colored pigment in a fluid, is capable of achieving twice the reflectivity of existing e-paper solutions. This improvement in reflectivity enables the color saturation found in printed media. The multi-stable pixel designs demonstrated in the Phase I program make possible zero power images with grayscales. The Phase II research project will develop the technology for complete electronic paper displays incorporating this new pixel technology that are robust and manufacturable, and that achieve record reflectance (~ 70%). The first prototypes to be designed and created will be simple information content displays with simple electrical drive, such as electronic shelf labels. The later stage prototypes will be e-Reader displays with active matrix backplanes. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the widespread replacement of paper-media with electronic paper, providing superior low power products to the current burgeoning market. In particular, the improvements demonstrated in this project enable saturated colors and multimedia &quot;video&quot; rates with a zero-power image hold, thereby overcoming performance barriers that have blocked low power color electronic books from entering the market. For example, this technology could replace a stack of textbooks with a single lightweight color multimedia tablet. The market opportunity is easily in excess of $10B, and will support numerous new U.S. jobs under a business model providing a sustainable economic benefit to the U.S.A. Multi-stable electrofluidic technology is also well suited for both small and large electronic signage applications.",

The use of projection technology based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) micromirrors capable of scanning laser beams onto surfaces embedded within these devices offers a potential solution to the screen size problem. The end-goal of this project is the development of a tiny, energy efficient, low-cost, embeddable projection system capable of projecting large, high-resolution images at short distances from mobile devices. This effort will build off of work done in the Phase I project, in which a lab-scale functional prototype (a functional prototype has functionality but not scale or form-factor) of the system was built. This proposed effort will consist of two major research thrusts that are critical to the technology?s success 1) Development of an illumination module with integrated intensity modulator, and 2) Development of an advanced, miniaturized, pico-projector prototype. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes improving technology in the mobile device field. Business users and consumers are increasingly relying on the convenience of mobile devices as computing power and communication bandwidth improves. This market sector is increasing rapidly, and wireless mobile devices such as smart phones and netbooks are primary devices for computing and Internet access. However, the limitations of a sub-5&quot; diagonal display have prevented mobile devices from achieving their full potential. The demand for ever smaller wireless devices (as witnessed by subsequent generations of the iPod) and the need for more screen real estate are in direct conflict. The capability of pico projectors to overcome screen-size limitations in mobile electronics devices, projecting a large image despite their small size, makes embedded pico projectors a perfect fit for space-constrained mobile devices. Through their ability to enlarge displays, embedded pico projectors can unlock the potential of the mobile device and make them more capable as primary computing and Internet-access platforms. This capability ensures this proposed technology will have high commercial demand for the extended future.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop contextual video segmentation and automatic tagging technology and software. In long video streams that contain one or more topics, the software automatically discovers the beginnings and ends of Contextually-Coherent Video Segments in each video. Moreover, Video Semantics&#039; technology automatically assigns textual tags to each segment such that these tags describe the topic discussed in that segment. The tags assigned make all parts of the video easily searchable. Large video producers currently depend on manually segmenting their content into small segments and assigning textual tags to these segments in order to make them searchable. A short advertisement is then inserted before each segment. This manual segmentation and tagging process represents a significant pain point for content producers because it is labor intensive and not cost effective. Meanwhile, government agencies, which continuously monitor video content depend on speech recognition to spot specified keywords. This approach inflicts two pain points: (i) analysts have to deal with large number of false detections because the context in which the keyword occurs might be irrelevant, and (ii) if the keyword occurs in an important context, analysts still need to scroll back and forth into the video to find the beginning of the relevant segment. Video Semantics&#039; technology and products have the potential to efficiently address significant market needs. In addition to the commercial applications, the proposed technology will enable media monitoring agencies to perform their tasks more efficiently saving valuable analyst time and resources. Moreover, because Video Semantics? technology is language-independent, media monitoring agencies will be able to monitor more content in foreign languages without the need to develop language-specific technologies. The company will employ an indirect sales strategy via partnerships with software companies that develop media monitoring solutions and metadata generation tools. The company has identified its first customer and is working with them to integrate the contextual segmentation and tagging technology with their current media monitoring solutions.",

The Phase I effort demonstrated the commercial feasibility of the continuous, real-time near infrared monitor for tracking metabolite levels and cell density during protein expression with Pichia pastoris. Implementing this technology into an industrial production or process development setting requires the entire system to be hardened and made more user-friendly. All hardware components will be incorporated into a single unit with an embedded computer and the sampling interface will be enhanced to permit continuous monitoring or discrete sampling. Protocols for calibration generation and updating will be established, and performance diagnostics to maximize calibration robustness developed. The final design of the instrumentation will be beta-tested by current Pichia users. The broader impacts of this research will enable accurate control of bioreactors and enhance optimization efforts, resulting in maximum production yields of highly valued proteins from Pichia. Successful development of ASL&#039;s continuous, real-time monitor will enhance the attractiveness of Pichia as a protein expression platform.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will employ the boron-doped ultrananocyrstalline diamond (BD-UNCD) electrodes developed during the Phase I project to fabricate and characterize electrochemical cells and systems for the on-site generation (OSG) of advanced oxidants (chlorine-based mixed oxidants - hydrogen peroxide combined with hypochlorite - and sodium persulfate) and apply them to targeted water treatment applications. The primary research objectives are to determine the optimal conditions to generate oxidants and to establish the projected lifetime of the electrodes. BD-UNCD cells will demonstrate higher rates of oxidant production at lower costs and with greater energy efficiency than competing electrodes due to higher current densities and over-potentials for O2 and H2 evolution at the anode and cathode. The known difficulties with existing approaches of disinfection, such as the inadequate destruction of pathogens (Cryptosporidium), ineffective operation below 10\u00b0C, generation of large quantities of O2 and H2, and electrode fouling are expected to be mitigated substantially through use of BD-UNCD electrodes. Sodium persulfate (SPS) has been used as a highly effective oxidant capable of oxidative destruction of recalcitrant organics such as in oil-contaminated sea water. BD-UNCD technology will dramatically reduce the cost and increase flexibility of OSG water treatment using SPS. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a safer, cheaper, more environmentally friendly technology to generate &quot;green&quot; oxidants using diamond electrodes that can be used for a number of water treatment applications including purification, disinfection, and remediation. The market for chlorine-based disinfection systems alone is $20 billion with a correspondingly large impact on human health and national security issues associated with transporting vast quantities of hazardous materials. Overcoming technical barriers that have prevented diamond from being used for oxidant generation will require advances in the synthesis and large-scale manufacturing of diamond thin films that will impact other applications of this material. The electrochemistry of diamond is not well understood in the conditions needed for OSG. Better understanding of these reactions and the technological trade-offs between cell design and electrode geometry will impact related applications including the development of compact systems for third-world potable water generation, small scale desalination, the energy efficient electrochemical synthesis of new materials and other point-of-use applications of advanced oxidants. Large scale on-site generation of persulfates will enable highly effective treatment of refractory organics found in oil contaminated sea water and waste water associated with bitumen refining.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project has the core objective to develop a modular, laser power scaling concept based on recent innovations in high efficiency fiber lasers. The proposed concept uses large mode area, chirally-coupled core fiber to construct high power, pulsed fiber laser modules that can be spectrally combined into a single, collinear beam delivering multi-kilowatts of average power. Power scaling of a laser source with characteristics appropriate for the generation of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation is a key obstacle to the technical maturity of EUV lithography. EUV lithography is the leading candidate for high volume manufacturing of the next generation of semiconductor integrated circuits with critical dimensions of 22 nm or less. The Phase II effort builds on the successful Phase I feasibility and design results by developing the critical components and constructing a prototype laser module. Results expected from this work include construction and characterization of key laser components capable of withstanding high laser peak powers and demonstration of a breadboard, prototype fiber laser capable of producing pulse energy of 1 millijoule or more with pulse lengths of 5-30 nanoseconds at pulse repetition rates in the range of 50-200 kHz. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the continued advancement of semiconductor integrated circuit performance. A key metric in this advancement is the minimum critical dimension that can be realized in the manufacture of these devices. Advances in lithography have enabled a decrease of approximately 30% in this dimension every two years, which has led to a doubling every eighteen months in the number of transistors on an integrated circuit. This trend, known as Moore&#039;s Law, has fueled an explosion in the processing power, storage capacity, efficiency and affordability of microelectronic devices. EUV lithography, currently under development, is the critical manufacturing technology that is needed to sustain this trend on the five to ten year horizon. Development of a power scalable laser, operating in the nanosecond pulse regime, is a critical element in the practical realization of EUV lithography. Success in this endeavor will help to deliver continued advances in microelectronic devices that benefit fields of study and industry as diverse as genetic engineering, telecommunications, computer engineering and transportation.",

Large write current can cause tunnel barrier breakdown, thereby compromising memory reliability. Additionally, large write current requires large select transistors beneath each bit, preventing high density. In Phase I project, an MTJ bit design with a low enough write current has been successfully demonstrated.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in the ability of this novel, inexpensive printed gas sensor to combine the high performance found in the AGS technology and the modern fabrication technology from the microelectronics industry. The innovative products from this NSF SBIR can open a new landscape for sensor use. Legislative trends are pointing to a need for a low cost, high performance CO sensor. The result of this work will be the next leap forward in the existing widely used AGSs for monitoring. Initial impacts will include: 1] improvements in CO sensors allowing high performance home CO alarms to better protect human health as well as property, 2] widespread monitoring capability in transportation and infrastructure applications, important to both safety and homeland security; and 3] the ability to integrate gas monitoring into consumer products and create instant worldwide networks to monitor and assess for improved health and safety as well as environmental protection.

At the end of Phase II we will have developed a prototype process capable of commercializing these high performance supercapacitors. 2. Broader Impact Supercapacitors are indispensable energy storage devices because their performance bridges those of batteries and conventional capacitors. The most significant challenges for supercapacitors are to increase their energy density and power density. Our proposed core/shell nanostructured supercapacitors address these two challenges simultaneously. The proposed superior supercapacitors will meet the needs of quickly growing markets of hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), city buses, rails (heavy rail vehicles, tramways and metro), and renewable energy systems (wind power and solar power) to satisfy the peak power needs in a cost-effective manner that battery cannot provide. Other potential domestic applications include UPS systems, cell phones, PDAs, medical devices, AMRs, notebooks, communication equipment, sensors, actuators, car audio components, welding machines, solar lighting, inverters, cameras, copy machines, and power supplies. Core/shell nanostructured materials offer the potential to provide multifunctional application in supercapacitors, solar cells, and batteries. The success of this program will stimulate enthusiastic academic and industrial interests for using core/shell nanostructured materials to address significant energy problems, and thus open new horizons that have not been imagined before.",

Commercial LEP eyewear can only protect against a limited number of known laser wavelengths, with users having to change eyewear for different lasers. The new LEP eyewear will be a universal solution to protect human eyes against both known and unknown lasers in the visible and infrared (IR) spectral range, promising&gt;60% visual luminous transmittance,&gt;4 optical density, femtosecond response time, and full compliance with industrial and military standards. The LEP eyewear is expected to have adequate optical limiting threshold so that it does not require an extra focusing lens array for assistance. The material to be developed is semi-solid and can be integrated with ballistic-proof polycarbonate (PC) substrates, and requires no electrical power. This project will also be applicable to products for laser protection of optical sensors. The Phase II research activities involve material and manufacturing process optimizations as well as environment durability tests. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant. It will meet the critical unmet customer demand for a universal laser eye protection device, which is key in many military and industrial fields. The LEP products will create cost savings for customers (by providing a universal solution), reduce eye injury risk, and allow ballistic and shatter-proof capability. These devices have the potential to address the entire laser eye protection market, and cumulative LEP eyewear sales for the first five years are projected to exceed $10 million. This program will also advance the state-of-the-art in science and engineering, in developing novel nanostructures from phase-transitioning materials, as well as a new device structure with superior optical characteristics. Finally, this project will have societal benefit by helping to reduce the medical, insurance and associated costs of laser eye injuries.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will take advantage of the unique properties of carbon-nanotube (CNT) pores to develop membranes that are specifically tailored for forward osmosis (FO) applications. FO processes have a number of advantages over evaporation and pressure-driven membrane processes: low energy cost, low mechanical stresses, and high product concentration. The main problem impeding the widespread use of FO remains the lack of robust optimized FO membranes. CNT membranes are ideal for FO applications as they offer improvements in all relevant membrane characteristics: (1) improved structural integrity; (2) high permeability; (3) robust chemical stability; and (4) low fouling propensity. Most importantly, CNT membranes can be fabricated with sufficient structural support in the active layer to operate with only minimal external reinforcement, which minimizes concentration polarization losses. This project builds on the fabrication and functionalization approaches developed in Phase I, and applies them on a larger scale to achieve the objective of developing membranes with fast flow and high selectivity at reasonable production costs. Performance of the membranes will be benchmarked using laboratory tests that simulate real-world applications. This project will deliver an innovative FO membrane platform that exhibits superior performance and stability in FO applications. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to enable a variety of green technologies such as renewable power generation, wastewater reuse, and energy-efficient desalination. Although FO-based processes are extremely energy efficient, their commercial use has been hampered by the lack of high performance FO membranes. This project should produce two main outcomes. First, it would deliver a solid technical foundation for developing a novel FO membrane platform that would provide a superior commercial alternative to existing FO membrane architectures. Second, the performance advantages of the CNT membranes would open up several applications for commercial development.",

As experts in microfluidic design, OndaVia uses its innovations to manufacture devices that provide near real-time, precise water analysis in the field. Our Phase I SBIR project goal was to prove the feasibility of detecting 100 part-per-billion-level water contamination using an embedded surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) region within a microfluidic channel?a goal achieved with excellent results. The objective of this Phase II effort is to build a prototype water analysis system, the anticipated results of which will set the stage for rapid incorporation of this proprietary detection technology into OndaVia?s line of analytical instruments. The broader impacts of this research are emphasized by the belief that the world is running out of ?quality? water. Reservoirs are depleting, ground water is frequently contaminated through petroleum extraction, and new industrial contaminants are found in lakes and rivers every day. Typical analysis requires collecting a sample in the field and shipping the sample to a test laboratory; water monitoring agencies depend upon these outsourced laboratories where transport and processing time can take days to produce results, wasting precious time when the health of a community is at stake. Field-ready, real-time measurement tools that detect a wide array of compounds at a parts-per-billion or better level would be a powerful, valuable, and necessary addition to the water testing toolbox.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate the ability of an adaptive antenna system ? a radio with an antenna that changes its radiation pattern to provide coverage where it is needed ? to automatically optimize coverage. Harsh RF environments, for example those with shifting reflective surfaces such as shipping container yards, make it hard to set up reliable communication even when there is only one radio. When several radios must work together to provide coverage in an extended area, it is extremely difficult and time-consuming to manually tailor the radiation pattern of each antenna so that every portion of the area receives adequate signal and the radios do not interfere with each other. Through a combination of innovative pattern computation algorithms and active sensor feedback, the system resulting from this project will automatically tailor coverage to meet these goals. The system will not just be able to set up the initial coverage of an area, it will also continually monitor the quality of the coverage and automatically adjust to changes in the system or the environment that may affect the quality of that coverage. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is decreased deployment costs and substantially increased reliability. In the short run, the system will be built with a WiFi platform for use in the maritime ports market as a more reliable communication system to run their mission critical scheduling application. The deployment savings result from not only a quicker and more reliable initial setup but also from automated adjustments to coverage as environmental factors change ? including such radical changes as the failure of one radio. Because the system is agnostic to the frequency and the protocol used by the radio, it is not limited to WiFi deployments. The project will demonstrate this by creating and operating a prototype WiMAX version of the adaptive antenna system. In the long term, this adaptive antenna technology offers significant benefits to any large scale radio deployment. For example, as providers roll out the next generation of cellular, cell sizes will shrink significantly which will substantially increase the deployment cost. An adaptive antenna system offers not only the promise of reducing these costs but also adding increased connection reliability to these next generation systems.",

Rather than the existing approaches that synthesize a polymer inside the display, this research examines polymers synthesized and purified outside of the display. Side-group liquid crystal polymers (SGLCPs) will be developed that can be used at low concentration as dopants in the liquid crystal mixture that is the active medium in the LCD. Chemical variations on the successful SGLCPs discovered in Phase I will establish molecular-level understanding of the mechanism of the beneficial effects of the dopant. Effects of the dopants on processing behavior (e.g., the process of filling the flat panel) and ultimate performance will be characterized; the results will guide industrial implementation of the dopants. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project on new polymer dopants include improved performance of LCD-TVs, especially in the rapidly growing HDTV segment. Liquid crystal displays are widely used in televisions due to their low operating voltage, low power consumption and thin form factor. Polymer additives will be developed that increase the switching speed, enhance the brightness, improve the viewing angle and maintain the excellent dark state and high contrast that are the hallmarks of vertically-aligned nematic liquid crystal displays (VAN-LCDs). The potential revenues of these compounds could reach $100 million annually within a few years. Scientifically, polymer dopants in LCs represent an entirely new field of science and technology. Finally, this collaborative research will involve a combination of microsynthesis, polymer and LC physical properties and LC display fabrication that will confer upon its principals a comprehensive perspective on the transition of discoveries into competitive product offerings.",

This proposal focuses on evolving MWM-MR-Array (Meandering Winding Magnetometer-Magnetoresistive) technology for application to the thick structure typical of submarine hulls by completing advancements in both sensor and instrumentation initiated under the Phase I effort.  In addition, hull-like samples ranging from simplistic plates to panels with welded structure will be used to develop and evaluate detection and characterization capabilities of introduced flaws.

The concept of product lines is to design application software in a way that provides for maximum portability or re-use across multiple systems and multiple ship platforms. These two goals can be conflicting and difficult for the system developers to balance. New computer hardware can drive the need for new operating systems, new computer languages, and new middleware standards.

        "abstract": "This proposal lays out a development program for a new laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) instrument designed for non-destructive inspection (NDI) of composite airframe structures which are susceptible to core-crush damage, disbonds and delaminations, for example in composite rotor blades. The sensor employs non-contact laser vibrometry with acoustic excitation of the structure and uses the surface vibration signature as a means for locating and imaging hidden damage sites. Example data are presented from test panels which clearly illustrate the potential of the proposed approach which requires no advanced preparation of the inspection surface. Unlike existing laser vibrometers which employ a scanning single-beam approach, the proposed instrument employs a multiple-beam array to capture full-field (2D) vibration data instantaneously. The 2D imaging format is thus able to image short duration transient surface vibrations, a unique capability which could further enhance the NDI applications for the sensor. The rapid data capture, combined with the flexible fiber-optic design architecture provides for the first time, a viable platform for field based vibrometry for composite defect inspection.",

        "abstract": "To improve safety, modern submarine surface imaging systems have multiple camera modes, such as optical, infrared, and more. Current systems display modalities independently, compelling the submariner to switch between sensors manually to glean the relevant information. Following a successful Phase I effort demonstrating technical feasibility of our concept, 21st Century Systems, Inc. is poised to complete development of a multimodal video fusion capability, providing a single, relevant picture with increased contrast for salient maritime targets while reducing clutter. Smart Multimodal Image Registration and Fusion (SMIRF) will produce a higher contrast composite image through selective fusion of multiple sensor modalities regionally within each image. SMIRF combines state-of-the-art image enhancement, real-time cross-modality registration, advanced saliency detection, proven image fusion methods, and a decision-making engine to create a dynamic real-time multimodal, locally optimal region-based video fusion solution. SMIRF&quot;s adaptive approach allows it to intelligently choose&quot;the right tools for each job,&quot;rather than forcing the same solution in every situation. With our extensive experience in video analysis products and with a 100th percentile SBIR commercialization rating, we are just the company to deliver this capability so submariners can focus on seeing what&quot;s in the area and not on which setting to use.",

        "abstract": "In this proposal, Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) proposes an innovative Proactive and Adaptive Cross-layer Reconfiguration (PACR) scheme for Reliable Communication in Tactical Networks. The PACR scheme allows the user (e.g. network operator) to adaptively reconfigure operating parameters in the corresponding layers through proactive prediction, root-cause identification, and cross-layer negotiations. In current wireless networks, the failure occurred in one of the involved layers (e.g., link break at PHY) results in a connection termination; and consequently another connection establishment process has to go through all the layers for a new connection. This process is time-consuming and usually results in an extra latency and resource unavailability within the transition region, which in turn leads to inefficient bandwidth usage and a poor user experience. Moreover, the root cause of connection termination is typical hidden, and not utilized for the repair or reestablishment. The objective of the proposed PACR scheme is to develop an efficient cross-layer negotiation approach to enable proactive and adaptive system reconfiguration, with the final goal of providing users continuous, uninterrupted service without substantial performance degradation, despite various failures may occur frequently in volatile networks.",

        "abstract": "Wiring restraint devices used on all DOD aircraft are limited to polyester tying tape and plastic cable straps. They are applied at set intervals along the cabling to constrain the wire elements into a discrete, tight bundle, thereby minimizing its vulnerability to various types of damage. However, these methods are problematic in that they can be difficult to apply, constrain the cable too loosely or tightly, and lack suitability for areas with challenging environmental requirements. Innovative Dynamics proposes to develop an alternative wire restraint method based on the use of advanced tape-like self-fusing silicone material that is rapidly applied to aircraft wiring in the form of a durable rubber band.   During the Phase I program two silicone band designs were developed and tested in the laboratory for strength and survivability. A design optimization task will be performed in the Phase II effort to optimize material properties and down select a preferred mechanical embodiment. The Phase II program will culminate with the demonstration of an optimized fiber re-enforced rubber band material, and a specialized application tool to apply it to cabling for wide use in either factory harness assemblies or in-situ aircraft installations.",

Because a trawl fishing rig scrapes the ocean floor and scoops fish into a net, it can be devastating to bottom mounted sensors, especially when sensors are vertically tethered in the water column with sub-surface floats. The upward reaching appendages in a typical Navy testing range are easy prey against the trawl rig&quot;s heavy chains and rock hopper leading edges, which snag the sensors and damage or rip them from their tethers.   This program has developed passive, innovative methods of protecting the typical tethered sensor from becoming entangled in or damaged by a direct trawl rig strike. Specifically, this effort is targeted for the protection of arrays in planned shallow water Navy undersea training ranges. Because the unique SkySight Deployable Trawl Safe system is compact enough to be deployed through a modified linear cable engine, the time and cost to incorporate the needed hazard protection is reduced when installing large undersea arrays.  The successful Phase I used scale models and rigorous test analysis. The Phase II effort will build on this success and result in an ocean-demonstrated sensor protection system.",

        "abstract": "In the design of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composite materials, the preeminent concerns are typically: progressive failure and life prediction especially when subjected to fatigue loading. Fatigue experiments are usually very expensive and take a long time to complete. Furthermore, there could be thousands of test cases depending on the material system and layup sequences envisioned for a particular design. So this conventional procedure can hardly satisfy the need for a fast design cycle and cannot guarantee an optimal final design. Here we propose a method based on micro-mechanics. Starting from the constituents, i.e., fiber, matrix and interface, we proceed to predict the behavior of individual plies, bulk laminates and eventually total structures. Through the micromechanics approach, it is possible to predict progressive failure or life of composite structures. The Phase II program proposed anticipates developing a validated, long-term durability prediction methodology for FRP composite materials that can be used to strengthen, repair, and upgrade existing FRP structures on vehicles. This methodology will also be applicable to the design of new composite structures. This Phase II effort will also strive for integration into software tools for the implementation and integration with commercial finite element analysis software.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  ORBITEC proposes to demonstrate and validate a laboratory-scale experimental injector stability screening technique which will quantify injector element stability characteristics. The experimental approach promises to dramatically reduce development cost by utilizing a gaseous single element test facility which presents savings in hardware manufacturing, consumables, and test facility labor. The simple test facility will allow rapid stability characterization of multiple candidate injectors which will be unobtrusive to schedule requirements. The key cost and time savings will be fewer full-scale hardware configurations that must be manufactured which will in turn reduce the number of full-scale tests required for qualification. The Phase I effort evaluated a Russian pentad injector at full-scale and laboratory-scale conditions.  Correlation between laboratory scale and full scale experimental data showed that both combustion devices operated without experiencing high frequency combustion instability.  During Phase II, an available database for the injector will be utilized to ensure unstable operation which will be scaled up for engine testing.  Laboratory-scale methods of providing similarity such as heating and reactant dilution will also be evaluated.  The Phase II programs will set the necessary scaling requirements and produce plans for Phase III ORBITEC test facility implementation.  BENEFIT:  The end product of this overall research and validation effort will create an experimental test facility and scaling technique which will significantly decrease engine development time at a reduced cost.  The scaling technique will have application to virtually all high pressure liquid rocket engine development programs and existing engine upgrades for the Air Force, Navy, MDA, NASA and their contractors as well as commercial satellite launch companies.  Development may reveal application to the screech phenomenon in air-breathing engines which will significantly open the commercial aircraft sector.",

        "abstract": "One of the key limitations in optical band underwater imaging and communications systems is the excessive attenuation and scattering light experiences in traversing the intervening media. Strong attenuation fuels the demand for high transmitter energy and high sensitivity (photon counting) detectors. Strong backscatter can temporarily blind or damage highly sensitive detectors, undermining the systems ability to sense (or communicate) over both short and long distances. In principle, the&quot;backscatter problem&quot;can be mitigated by employing high dynamic range detectors (i.e. a detector that is responsive to both high and low levels of photons). This requirement is often at odds with the sensitivity requirement of detecting a few photons/nanosecond. One potential solution is use a fast optical switch (or attenuator) in front of the detector to gate out the undesired near-field backscatter. Current technology cannot address all of the needs, such as polarization insensitivity, large aperture, and wide acceptance angle. Arete Associates has devised an elegant solution to this problem that promises to meet the demanding requirements in a compact, low-power, open-architecture module. This program will result in the development of a stand-alone, polarization insensitive, optical attenuator module capable of achieving fast switching (&lt;100 ns) and high contrast with large spatial (&gt;1 cm2) and angular (&gt;+/- 10 degrees) apertures and with low insertion loss.",

As succinctly described in the solicitation for SBIR topic N093-215, manual operation of the launch and recovery system (LARS) is dependant on operator proficiency and alertness. The overall objective of topic N093-215 is to develop an automatic actively-controlled LARS that is independent of the recovery platform, can accommodate a wide range of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), and requires minimal operator intervention and in situ tuning.  Barron Associates and its research partners propose an adaptive platform-independent control system (APICS) Phase II effort that will leverage the lessons-learned from the prior automatic control system testing, a new high-fidelity LARS simulation model, and the promising linear and nonlinear control laws developed in Phase I. The specific technical objectives of the Phase II program are: (1) refine LARS simulation model; (2) enhance linear control system design; (3) enhance nonlinear control system design; (4) prepare for on-board APICS demonstration, and; (5) conduct on-board APICS demonstration. In the Phase II Option, the focus will be on software finalization, user-interface and data logging, and formal software release and configuration management.",

In Phase I nBn Technologies successfully demonstrated the abilities of the HOT nBn type FPA&quot;s. We further proved that a low power camera using nBn detector is feasible. Phase II nBn type HOT MWIR cameras will have the similar imaging performance to InSb and HgCdTe hand held cameras, but because of their high operating temperature(HOT) (180K) capabilities, the overall power consumption will be reduced from ~10W to less then 1W. HOT nBn camera systems will also demonstrate lower cost of ownership and lifetimes exceeding 400% of current InSb camera systems. The primary end user of the nBn camera is anticipated to be infantry and reconnaissance personnel. The decreased power requirements of the nBn camera will aid the warfighter by reducing the amount of batteries needed to successfully complete night missions. This will increase soldier mobility, mission duration, and of course the probability of mission success.",

To achieve the high power output and high efficiency, we will first develop 1W power amplifier MMICs based on GaN/SiC HEMT device technology with push-pull amplifier configuration operated in class E switching mode operation. A pair of these MMIC devices are mounted into a small HPA module with 2W output as a building block. The HPA modules will be integrated by means of a 24 way low loss TE01 radial combiner to generate 40W power output preserving the MMIC high efficiency.  To achieve the linearity, an envelope tracking digital pre-distortion linearization technique will be employed.  These various approaches have been demonstrated individually at lower microwave frequencies.  This program will result in a unique combination of these techniques at millimeter-wave frequencies, specifically at 71-76 GHz, to significantly raise the output power level, efficiency, and linearity of the SSPAs for future SATCOM, AISR system applications where a large volume of channels and high data rate transmission capabilities are required.  BENEFIT:  The high power, high efficiency, linear SSPA in the 71-76 GHz band will enable the development of future SATCOM/AISR communication systems that require very large volume of high data rate communications.

Many of the chemical processes of interest to the defense sector occur on ~100s of ps timescales and demand a high degree of control over the peak laser power. On the other hand there are a number of laser sources capable of producing high intensity, broad-bandwidth sub ps pulses. Therefore, it is desirable to produce a device which stretches the ~100fs laser pulses to pulse lengths as long as nanoseconds. Such a stretcher system is common in the IR for modest stretching factors of 5-10, but in the UV and with stretching factors of up to 1,000 or more, the system becomes challenging. The proposed device will accept laser pulses such as those generated from a frequency doubled or tripled Ti:Sapphire laser, and produce user-selectable pulse lengths and profiles.

These system achieves wide-area surveillance for dismounts by operating on stationary platforms (helicopter) which eliminates mainbeam clutter spread and allows slow-moving targets to be effectively separated from strong ground clutter based on Doppler shift. Also, the GMTI modes currently employ relatively narrowband waveforms to minimize the impact of target range walk during a coherent processing interval. The SAR mode, on the other hand, employs a much wider bandwidth and requires a moving platform in order to form the synthetic aperture required for image formation. Thus the GMTI and SAR modes represent seemingly conflicting requirements. Namely, traditional GMTI modes work best with stationary platforms and narrow bandwidths, whereas SAR requires a moving platform and wide bandwidth.

This novel use of GPUs, combined with the recent development of small HSI instruments, will enable cost-effective use of small, inexpensive platforms to support spectral target detection and identification missions previously reserved for large UAV or airborne platforms.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The development of the F-35 Lift Fan has revealed the possibility of fretting between the fan input shaft bearing OD surface and the titanium bearing supports in the Lift Fan gearbox housing.  A steel insert is currently used to provide protection against fretting of the gearbox housing.  In order to provide an effective solution and reduce the overall weight of the F-35, IBC Materials and Technologies has developed an advanced tribological coating that will dramatically reduce fretting, wear and corrosion of the Lift Fan gearbox housing, allowing elimination of the steel insert. The proposed solution is based on the Micro Plasma Oxidation (MPO) process that has been developed by IBC Materials and Technologies. The MPO-based Titanium Oxide ceramic coatings will provide superior performance, extended life and lower manufacturing costs compared with alternate methods, providing an opportunity for fuel savings and life cycle cost reduction for the F-35 weapon system.

        "abstract": "Advances in simulator technology have allowed researchers to move the test track/range into the virtual world. To insure proper transfer of experience, the many simulator components must work in harmony. This Phase II proposal addresses the motion cueing and steering system feel for hexapod-based driving simulations. Hexapods have limited motion capability for representing lateral accelerations that are represented in steady state by tilt cues. If done improperly, the resulting cues can negatively impact the simulation experience and may also result in simulator sickness, regardless of the fidelity of the other simulator components. The objective of the proposed program is to develop and validate appropriate algorithms for motion base simulators that provide more realistic feedback of motion cues and steering control feel to the driver. Two current motion cueing algorithms will be prototyped and evaluated via driver-in-the-loop simulation using a representative hexapod motion platform and an MRAP vehicle model. The simulator evaluations will feature advanced Army vehicle models and critical lateral maneuvering scenarios. The resulting algorithms will be validated using quantitative driver-vehicle system measures and qualitative driver opinions and ratings. The program will result in validated algorithms for enhanced lateral motion cueing and more realistic proprioceptive cueing from improved steering feel.",

The key challenge is the adaptation of MOTFT fabrication processes to flexible substrates from that used for glass substrates. The major differences between glass substrates and flexible substrates are survivable temperature treatment, chemical stability and dimension stability. Flexible plastic substrates can&quot;t go above the glass transition temperature and this will place a limit on the fabrication temperature. We have to design a metal oxide and a gate dielectric that can achieve good device performance at the lowest temperature possible. The plastic substrate may not be chemically stable in the fabrication process. We also have to develop a low temperature buffer layer that provides a good chemical stability for the plastic substrates during the MOTFT fabrication process. We also propose to develop a material, a fabrication process and a device design for a photo-detector with the requisite optical and electronic properties. Devices will be fabricated by solution processing utilizing blended hole transport and electron transport semi-conducting polymers and will have photo-response from 400nm to 700nm, high detectivity and high external quantum efficiency.",

The solution envisaged in this study is to use a very large floating mat (VLFM) as a breakwater. The VLFM is not intended to act directly as a causeway, but rather as an environmental shield enabling existing causeway designs to operate under its protection, thus supporting a layered defense approach. This layered defense approach enables the VLFM to be sacrificial during extreme events and repairable in calmer seas thereby protecting sea basing operations inside its protection zone.",

This project seeks to mature this concept of multi-input multi-output sonar with spread spectrum and continuous transmission capability.      We will validate spread spectrum ping technology as a sensor management strategy that outperforms conventional multistatics by exploiting the spatial, temporal, and bandwidth characteristics of the sonar system.

Despite efforts mandated under the BEACH and Clean Water Acts, beach closures have exceeded 20,000 days in each of the last four years primarily due to fecal pollution. The problem continues because traditional methods cannot identify the sources of fecal contamination (sewage, livestock, domestic animals, wildlife). MST assays employing quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were developed to quantify source-specific genetic markers encoded on the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the source animal (human, cattle, dog, etc.). The Phase I results demonstrated that mtDNA-based assays combined with bacterial source tracking methods will provide conclusive identification of fecal contamination sources allowing implementation of corrective measures to improve water quality and protect human health. Phase II studies will include a modification of the DNA extraction procedure to permit quantification of live fecal bacteria to aid in risk assessment and extended field validation studies at two beaches and two coastal watersheds impaired by unknown sources of fecal pollution. The broader impacts of this research are that the MST assays developed and validated during the Phase II project will empower stakeholders with the type of actionable data required to identify fecal contamination sources, implement appropriate corrective actions, and safeguard the nation?s waters.

The AP estimates the pavement load from each axle of a truck at freeway speeds and the truck?s class, and transmits these estimates to the traffic management center. The cubes take up minimal space and are installed within minutes, so WIM systems can be deployed anywhere at a fraction of the cost of traditional WIM stations. Phase I research demonstrated the technical feasibility and commercial potential of the WIM. The technical objectives of Phase II concern the WIM packaging and installation; calibration: sensitivity to weight, speed and temperature (especially for asphalt pavements); signal compression and source coding; channel coding; wide area data backhaul; overall system design; manufacturing prototype samples; and extensive testing. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to dramatically enhance the regulation of truck weights and provide data to greatly improve the maintenance of the US road and bridge infrastructure by drastically reducing the costs of WIM stations. Current WIM stations have limited deployment as they are costly to install requiring shutting the road for days and needing expensive maintenance and re-calibration. The new WIM stations could be widely deployed in additional locations on arterial streets and near ports to monitor truck traffic and be a component in a truck weight-based enforcement and toll system.

The company has used simulation-based learning technology platform to convey disease state concepts and clinical best practices to physicians for large pharmaceutical companies. This project extends this technology and approach to the study of immunology in higher education. Like many areas of science, immunobiology involves complex systems. The company is using an engineering paradigm to create a model immune system that is compartmentalized into elements that interact, forming a responsive whole. When this system is brought to life through interactivity and 3D visuals, students will experience how the immune system functions instead of reading about it. The company will work with educators and immunologists to build this simulator to fill recognized gaps in understanding this science. This Phase II project will result in a commercial version of the Immunobiology Simulator that will be marketed to colleges, universities, and medical schools with strategic science publishing partners. The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to create an Immunobiology Simulator that facilitates the comprehensive understanding of the immune system through direct experience of the interactions between its essential parts. This systems approach is a forward-thinking one that when combined with technology creates a new way to experience and learn immunology. Understanding the immune system is critical for advancing the battle against infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, cancer, asthma, and many other disorders. Immunology is an essential component in sustaining our nations competitiveness in the life sciences. It is a growing element of biology, bioengineering, nursing, and medical school curricula, with 29 schools already offering a dedicated immunology major. The Immunobiology Simulator will be accessible over the Internet, providing broad distribution.

Large motorized CMMs are either taught offline using computer-aided design (CAD) models or online using awkward joystick interfaces. Manual-only portable-arm CMMs are safe and convenient to use, but teach-and-playback is not supported. The proposed solution is a motorized articulated robot that combines the safety of a manual system with playback precision thereby supporting convenient statistical process control (SPC). The research objectives are to design and build a motorized CMM and develop the algorithms, tools, and procedures needed to create a successful product. The anticipated commercialized product will be a portable, user-friendly, cost-effective robotic arm that spreads the quality advantages of statistical process control across a broad range of products and manufacturers including non-traditional manufacturing such as medical surgery. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project has four parts. The first is the direct impact on the US economy. US workers will assemble, test, and ship the products developed under this SBIR. Components will be sourced from local US fabricators and OEM suppliers, boosting the US economy and generating taxes; and some of these products will become exports, reducing the US imbalance of trade. Secondly, the shortcomings of metrology devices available today discourage the use of statistical process control, thereby undermining manufacturing quality. The proposed solution will improve manufacturing competitiveness in the metrology market sector through easier adoption of statistical process control, leading to higher quality and reduced scrap costs. Thirdly, the proposed solution invites production-line workers back into close physical contact with the process that they must ultimately understand and control. The worker strengthens intuition by teaching the device for each new part geometry, while the playback capability avoids tedium and repetitive stress. Corporations often automate these workers out of their skilled jobs who then join the unemployed while the company loses touch with the ability to understand and innovate processes. Finally, this SBIR will support formal internship programs with several universities in order to maintain diversity.",

        "abstract": "Intellectual Merits: This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address further development of findings from the Phase I Project addressing development of advanced biopesticides by simple and scalable modification of sophorolipids. The yeast Candida bombicola produces sophorolipids (SLs) in volumetric yields of ~ 300 g/L. The Phase I program demonstrated that by simple chemical modification of unrefined natural SLs, a series of five highly active lead compounds were identified which possess broad spectrum activity against all three major fungal groups that cause serious diseases in commercially important plants. By amidation of the SL fatty acid carboxyl group (e.g. - NH2CH2CH2N(CH3)2), or by reduction of the SL-fatty acid double bond, derivative activity against pathogens greatly increased. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of amide SL-derivatives were generally on a par with tested commercial fungicides. Broader Impacts/Commercial Potential: The broader impacts of this research address the market pull for green agricultural products by developing a bio-pesticide produced via an efficient microbial fermentation followed by simple chemical modification to improve the performance of nature?s molecules. The goal is to create a superior bio-pesticide product that does not harm the environment, is safe for farmers that regularly handle these materials, and to provide safe food for consumers. SyntheZyme bio-pesticides will contribute to the on-going green food-production revolution. Their introduction into the market is expected to replace an increasing fraction of synthetic chemical pesticides during season-long disease control programs. Furthermore, new safe bio-pesticides are needed to replace chemical pesticides now banned due to tightened regulations and increased concerns about their pollution and health hazards.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a compact, metal-based, recirculating liquid cooling system for next-generation electronic devices. The dramatic increase in computing power over several decades has been accompanied by an equally dramatic increase in the heat generated at the electronic module level. It is generally accepted that forced air cooling, the dominant cooling technology of today, will not be sufficient for high performance devices of tomorrow. Alternative cooling technologies with higher performance and lower area/volume footprint have become critical for better-performing computing devices. A significant market is expected for such advanced chip cooling technologies. Metal-based microchannel heat exchangers (MHEs) combine high heat flux removal capacity, low area/volume footprint, as well as high mechanical integrity, and constitute a leading technological contender for replacing forced air cooling. This project will focus on design and fabrication of metal-based MHEs and MHE assemblies as heat absorption and rejection modules with improved heat transfer performance, assembly of recirculating-liquid MHE systems, and benchmarking against competing technologies. The study on the design, fabrication, and heat transfer testing of metal-based MHEs will enhance scientific and technological understanding related to micromanufacturing, as well as microchannel liquid flow and heat transfer. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is tied into the ultimate project goal of incorporating liquid-based chip cooling technology with the best performance into next-generation desktop personal computers and other microelectronic and powerelectronic devices. The planned recirculating-liquid MHE chip cooling system is envisioned to become a critical enabler of higher performance and higher power electronic devices. A quick review of the progress in computing devices over the last few decades and the associated societal changes serves to convince that increased computing power in the hands of imaginative people can unleash unforeseen innovations. Successful execution of this project will push to the market place a product that can serve a catalytic role in such an innovation unleashing process. The target product will be marketed to computer original equipment manufacturers and is shown to enjoy performance and cost advantages over competing devices currently being contemplated. The project goal is to develop cost-effective manufacturing technologies to the point of production readiness. Successful execution of this project will help to establish the commercial viability of a technology-based manufacturing company with potential for positive economic impact and job creation.",

VCD microscopy represents a new class of spectroscopic imaging diagnostic capable of measuring VCD images with millimeter to sub-millimeter spatial resolution. The recent discovery that long-range structural chirality in protein fibrils is characterized by unusually large and distinctive VCD spectra provides the backdrop for this project. None of the currently available techniques can characterize the fibrillation pathway or the final fibril state with the same ease and detail as VCD. VCD microscopy can be thought of as circular polarization contrast microscopy that is sensitive to long-range chiral order in localized regions of biological samples. The broader impacts of this research are studies of the supramolecular chirality of fibrils. This product is not a small improvement of an existing technology but a distinctly new method of studying long-range biochirality that is more sensitive, provides more detail, and is easy and fast to use. A secondary, higher-impact long-term impact will be clinical research laboratories where this innovation can be used for the detection and characterization of amyloids in vivo, i.e. for tissue biopsies, rapid detection of amyloids and drug screening.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enhance and optimize the Precision Distance Measurement system developed during the Phase I effort. The technology is based on innovative ultra-precise control of frequency-swept lasers to determine absolute object distances and thicknesses. The system is capable of distance and thickness measurements with&lt;10-nanometer precisions,&gt;1 kHz update rates, volume measurement coverage of 1 m3 (&lt;10-micron precision), and measurement ranges&gt;&gt;1 meter. This combination of features is needed for industrial metrology, target identification, and precision surveying applications. During the Phase II effort, a prototype system will be constructed and used to perform targeted experiments based on identified OEM customer needs and industry technology gaps. The prototype will include Doppler compensation, a software interface, and will be fully configured and tested for both in-house and on-site testing. The prototype will then be used to perform critical in-house and on-site demonstrations driven by OEM customer needs, which include spatial multiplexing and galvo steering for rendering rapid 3D images, precise measurement of large-angle and diffusely scattering surfaces for precise measurement of aspheric lenses, oddly shaped objects, and rough surfaces, and precise measurement of meter-level displacements for CMM and gauge block calibration. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will initially be to improve manufacturing efficiency, quality, and production throughput. The measurement system uniquely combines extremely high precision (&lt;10 nm) with the ability to measure over extremely large ranges (&gt;&gt;1 m). Due to this combination of performance and flexibility, coupled with demonstrated high update rates, the technology will enable increased production throughput in the manufacturing process and enable rapid absolute positioning and scanning measurements. The system will therefore enable considerable growth in an industry driven by advanced and more accurate inspection. The project will also lead to important societal benefits. For example, the technology holds promise for penetration into severely degraded visual environments caused by blowing sand and dust as well as into smoke or fog. It is anticipated that a variety of military and civilian applications would benefit from this capability including navigation, fire safety, and inspection systems. The benefits include saved lives and reduced property damage and more efficient search and rescue in burning buildings. Moreover, the system provides unique scientific opportunities such as enabling advanced space-based measurements by formation flying sparse apertures for the exploration of extra-solar planets and for atmospheric turbulence mitigation and high resolution imaging of the earth from space.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a new exercise device for neuromuscular training about the minor/secondary axes to reduce and prevent lower-limb injuries. Considering joints in the lower-limb including knee and ankle are free to flex-extend but with much more limited motions about the minor/secondary axes (leg twisting and side sway at the knee and ankle twisting and side sway), injuries often occur with excessive minor/secondary axis loadings. However, there is a lack of convenient and effective devices that can be used to train minor/secondary-axis neuromuscular control of human lower-limb during functional major-axis stepping/running movements. This project will address the strong exercise and clinical needs and develop a unique minor/secondary-axis exercising device to help subjects improve minor/secondary-axis neuromuscular control and rehabilitate/prevent knee/ankle injuries associated with excessive minor/secondary-axes loadings. Practically, this minor/secondary-axis exercising mechanism can be implemented with many existing exercise machines (elliptical machine, stepper, stair climber, bicycles, and leg press machines) for minor/secondary-axis training. As a powerful clinical evaluation tool, this system can also provide quantitative outcome evaluation. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes the novel training modality, widely used exercise platforms, and focused training protocol. The proposed unique minor/secondary-axis neuromuscular training device may directly help reduce various lower limb injuries. Furthermore, it may benefit multiple joints in the human lower (and potentially upper in a similar way) limbs and it may benefit individuals with minor/secondary-axis impairments in neurological disorders as well as musculoskeletal injuries. Similarly, the widely occurring knee osteoarthritis and leading cause of disability is closely associated with unbalanced/improper frontal plane loadings. The proposed minor/secondary-axis training device will provide a general platform and training strategy to help people better deal with potentially injurious off-axis loadings of the whole lower limbs with quantitative outcome evaluations. Practically, the minor/secondary-axis training can be implemented on various common exercise equipment including elliptical machines, steppers, stair climbers, and bicycles. The minor/secondary-axis training device can be used in hospitals/clinics for post-surgery/injury rehabilitation, and in gym and home settings for injury prevention training as well as rehabilitation. People of various ages and at various sports/activity levels can be trained to better prepare for potentially injurious off-axis loadings and avoid potential injuries.",

This unique performance is achieved due to innovative system design and optimized image rendering software integrated with a calibration-free eye tracker. In Phase I POC has proved the feasibility of this approach by demonstrating several laboratory and wearable prototypes. In Phase II POC will extend the capabilities achieved in Phase I to address the USMC need for increased situational awareness and to meet all major requirements including wide field of view, small form factor, high optical resolution, and low power consumption.

        "abstract": "Cyber warfare poses a critical threat to the security of our national and military interests via acts of piracy, theft, and reverse engineering. Today&quot;s nation-state-class attacks are increasingly difficult to differentiate from normal operations and often take advantage of users&quot;trust in a system&quot;s operating environment, hardware, memory, and other attack vectors. To counter such novel attacks, software protection systems must move beyond traditional and defeatable solutions that rely on signatures and integrity checks. Such protection systems must provide a near-human ability to derive meaning and draw quantitative conclusions from system event data and must adopt a machine learning approach to improve their ability to detect, prevent, and remediate novel attacks with experience. To meet these requirements, we propose to develop a Software Protection through Autonomic Knowledge Representation (SPARK) system. Key features of our system include a natural language processing-based approach to knowledge construction and representation that provides both more expressiveness and greater flexibility than traditional attack modeling approaches, and a tiered approach to software protection that allows automated defense techniques to function autonomously while providing a fall-back to human involvement when previously unseen anomalous events are encountered.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project will demonstrate a highly innovative, high-performance Adaptive Digital Receiver architecture with adaptive background control that optimizes the performance in rapidly changing signal environments and provides 2 GHz instantaneous bandwidth, SFDR&gt;90 dB, SNR = 66 dB, with dynamic digital channelization.  The efficacy of this technology was proven in the highly successful SBIR Phase I portion of this project.  This represents a breakthrough in wideband, high-resolution adaptive digitization and provides receiver performance well beyond current state-of-the-art.  The V Corp Adaptive Digital Receiver takes advantage of several levels of adaptivity that the competing approaches do not offer.  In addition to a dynamic channelizer that is adaptively tuned based on detected signals, the V Corp approach also includes a powerful Software Reconfigurable Digitizer that is adaptively optimized for the current signal environment to control important receiver parameters such as bandwidth, dynamic range, resolution, and sensitivity.  An Open Architecture approach to the prototype system will be used to readily allow the inclusion of existing and future AFRL algorithms.  The prototype hardware/software platform will be designed to be highly flexible to accommodate growth of the algorithms and integration with AFRL technologies. The approach uses an array of state-of-the-art converters and takes advantage of several V Corp proprietary, high-performance digital signal processing techniques to trade off bandwidth, dynamic range, resolution, and sensitivity.  The Signal Detection algorithm uses techniques such as statistical, spectral, and wavelet analysis to identify the location, bandwidth, level, and modulation type of signals of interest and jammer/interference signals.  The Adaptive Real-Time Control Algorithm uses heuristic and iterative approaches to tune the dynamic digital Channelizer and to select the appropriate DSP algorithms for the current conditions.  The V Corp dynamic Channelizer uses an efficient polyphase filter bank structure to provide multiple channelized outputs with arbitrary and independent center frequency, bandwidth, gain, and cut-off characteristics. The powerful signal processing technologies can be changed on-the-fly without disruption of the receiver&quot;s normal operation to effectively track signal conditions as they change.  One technique, called Adaptive Parallel Combining (APC), uses a parallel array of high-speed, high-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) with adaptive signal combining to dramatically improve resolution (both SNR and SFDR) of the digitization while maintaining very high sample rate. A complementary technique, called Advanced Filter Bank (AFB) also uses an array of ADCs, but it greatly improves the bandwidth of the digitization while maintaining high resolution (e.g., four converters can be used to quadruple the bandwidth).  Additional techniques include: LinComp linearity compensation to improve SFDR and increase analog input bandwidth; averaging of multiple ADCs to improve SNR; channel extraction to capture a desired narrowband; channel matching to digitize multiple channels (e.g., antenna elements) with finely-matched gain and phase; and accurate I/Q demodulation.  The V Corp proprietary techniques have been proven to provide the highest speed, highest resolution analog-to-digital conversion available currently or in the foreseeable future (similar techniques have already been customized for and implemented in several next-generation communications receivers, RADAR systems, and SIGINT receivers).  During Phase II, V Corp will demonstrate the capabilities and functionality of the Adaptive Digital Receiver architecture with dynamic channelization and adaptive control with a hardware prototype using V Corp&quot;s advanced DSP techniques to show beyond state-of-the-art performance.  BENEFIT:   This dynamically reconfigurable approach overcomes the critical digitization bottleneck which limits performance of state-of-the-art radio frequency transceiver systems. Many high-performance modern electronic systems will benefit from these techniques.  Significant applications include enhancement of RADAR systems, EW and SIGINT receivers, cognitive radios, wideband universal RF transceivers, specialized test equipment, and medical imaging systems.  This approach adds critical levels of adaptivity earlier in the receiver signal chain to optimize the digitizer&quot;s hardware capabilities (e.g., instantaneous bandwidth, spurious free dynamic range, signal to noise ratio, signal gain) based on the current signal environment, and to quickly adapt to changes in the environment.",

Currently, such components cannot be affordably made from advanced composite materials, due to highly inefficient and time-consuming consolidation processes. Creare&quot;s innovation is a novel Laser-Assisted Consolidation (LAC) system that deposits directed and localized energy into the prepreg tape using a laser array that can be easily and safely integrated with the fiber placement head on any FPS machine platform. During the Phase I project, we demonstrated the feasibility of our LAC by fabricating CYCOM-5250-4 samples on a proof-of-concept LAC system; demonstrating effective consolidation at high feed rates; confirming that our process did not advance the cure of the composite; developing the preliminary design of an integrated LAC; and confirming the significant cost savings for a prototypical JSF part. During the Phase II project, we will develop a LAC prototype, test it at Creare, integrate it with our partner&quot;s composite manufacturing equipment, demonstrate its effectiveness in a real-world manufacturing environment, and transition the technology to the JSF program.",

        "abstract": "The Air Force seeks sensors that provide angular long-term stability (LTS) for antenna pedestal units, avoiding the use of expensive devices to overcome attitude limitations. IFOS proposes to develop an innovative fiber-optic gyroscope (FOG) with requisite LTS features from a light-weight, compact and low-cost device that can sustain vibration and shock environments typical of inertial navigation platforms. Phase I feasibility experiments, conducted with an open-loop FOG prototype comprising new fiber components, demonstrated excellent LTS potential. Size, weight and power (SWaP) trade-off study provided guidance for a cost-effective FOG instrument with very small footprint. In Phase II, IFOS proposes to implement its innovative designs and packaging techniques through optimization of FOG elements (both the optical head and electronics). IFOS will construct a complete 3-axis FOG subsystem engineering prototype for Air Force use The proposed FOG will be demonstrated to requirements, including&lt;0.1 degrees  bias drift over extended time, temperature range and simulated vibration and shock environment. IFOS has assembled a multidisciplinary team of expert collaborators, including major prime contractors, to guide the FOG testing and integration within a complete Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The outcome of this project is expected to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in the open-loop FOG architecture.  BENEFIT:  IFOS&quot;s FOGs will directly benefit Air Force platforms that require low SWaP, high-resolution and/or long term platform stabilization, and will also be useful for terrestrial and airborne applications including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); shipborne; and highly mobile ground platforms programs. Other potential DoD applications include advanced tactical fighter (eg, F-22), NGAM (Next-Generation Ageis Missiles), PTSS (Precision Tracking Space System), ABL (Airborne Laser) and ALTB (Airborne Laser Test Bed) systems, ABIR (Airborne Infrared), THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense), and STSS (Space Tracking and Surveillance System). NASA&quot;s future space exploration missions can also benefit from the IFOS FOGs. While FOGs for platform stabilization will be the focus of IFOS&#039;s efforts in the near term, we expect that this technology will ultimately benefit FOGs for robotic systems, such as future versions of the DOD&quot;s Big Dog program, as well as FOGs for commercial aircraft inertial navigation systems (INS) and Stabilization of parts used for pointing on moving and/or stationary platforms.

The proposed effort will systematically develope, validate and implement DSMC-derived continuum enhancement to the MDA-sponsored RPFM2D next-generation, continuum plume flowfield solver for supporting plume IR/Visible signature predictions and extending their applicability from the low-altitude (0-100km) into the mid-altitude (100-200km) range. This novel technology enhancement represents a significant upgrade of capabilities to MDA&quot;s recent investments in plume flowfield modeling technology. Most significantly, it provides a robust, accurate, very-efficient, and lower-cost alternative to hybrid coupled CFD/DSMC plume flowfield modeling that is presently too CPU-intensive for routine systems applications, with a speed-up factor of ~10-100 anticipated over the hybrid CFD/DSMC methodology.",

        "abstract": "The Air Force has identified a need for an advanced traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA) that supports future generations of broad bandwidth, efficient and linear military satellite and terrestrial communications.  To address this need, InnoSys proposes to develop innovative solutions for advanced TWTAs that operate from 81 to 86 GHz, deliver high efficiency greater than 30% with a small signal gain greater than 30 dB, have high linear and saturated output powers greater than 45 and 90 Watts, respectively, have excellent linearity specifically to support quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) operation over a very high peak to average power ratio of&gt;3dB, with amplitude modulation/phase modulation (AM/PM) less than 4.5 degrees/dB, capable of operating temperature range of -40 to +80 degrees and capable of radiation total dose tolerance of&gt;1Mrad (Si) and single event effect (SEE) immunity of&gt;60 MeV. In particular, InnoSys proposes to further develop its solid state vacuum device (SSVD) coupled with a high voltage power supply for a compact, lightweight, high performance E-band TWTA. SSVD technology applies the very same techniques that enable the low cost, mass-production of semiconductors to be used for the design and fabrication of high performance millimeter-wave TWTAs.  BENEFIT:  The high power extremely high frequency regime has a number of potential applications. New technology in this part of the electromagnetic spectrum will directly benefit communications on the battlefield such as military&quot;comms on the move,&quot;personal and portable active denial systems, and other communications and data gathering and dispersal systems. Immediate application potential ranges broadly to include secure data links, video links, backhaul connections between cellular communications stations, space, radar, biological and chemical agent detection, atmospheric environment sensing, near object detection, and material imaging. The dual ability to have both very high data transmission rates and very high bandwidths, makes this E-band SBIR program, especially with the 5 GHz bandwidth, a key building block for both military and commercial uses.  Such a large contiguous bandwidth is only allocated and available for E-band.  Areas of commercial market interest include the RF-based commercial satellite communications programs (e.g. Iridium, Globalstar and Spaceway), and commercial SATCOM broadcast programs including XM radio, Sirius Radio and DirectTV. Current and future commercial applications for these source products also include gigabit data rate transmissions including full duplex Ethernet connectivity, monitoring and detection systems for all-weather, day-and-night operations (i.e., mm-wave imaging, airport surveillance, intrusion detection, and harbor traffic monitoring), fusion plasma research and thermal interactions and processing of materials, and a host of other fundamental scientific, academic, and research applications.

This project will research HMS architectures based on a loose aggregation of intelligent agents that collectively represent an agile weapon supply chain management system. We propose the concept of groups of agents based on the biological cell paradigm. Agents form virtual organizations able to adapt constantly to changing missions. Agents will be able to learn from their past experience as well as from observing changes and corrections made by human weapon handling experts.

Survivability can be defined as the capability of a system to fulfill its mission in the presence of attacks, failures, or accidents. Properties that increase survivability include resistance to attacks, the recognition of attacks and resulting damage, the recovery of essential services following an attack, and the ability to adapt in a way that minimizes damage from future attacks. This research is drawing on concepts from the biological immune system to design a set of cyber threat assessment and response algorithms and capabilities. These will enable a system to assess threats in real-time so that cyber attacks can be aborted before they cause damage or otherwise impact system operation.

This unique challenge of providing operational, noise-free, speech driven data management in a flight deck environment, with wireless network integration to the existing ADMACS shipboard LAN, is expected to lead to new paradigms for aviation maintainers. The ATI and Fortress Technologies team that proposes this Phase II project is uniquely suited to address the inherent challenges of this SBIR topic based on their current portfolio of military-qualified flight deck communications products and wireless mesh network hardware systems, respectively. Based on proprietary digital noise canceling microphone technology that is used in two different flight-deck certified communications headsets, ATI will initiate the design and integration of speech-driven applications on mobile devices in order to provide highly accurate speech recognition in jet noise fields across a wide population of users. This system will be interfaced into the ADMACS LAN via Fortress Technologies&quot;secure, FIPS-140 certified wireless hardware that satisfies DOD Directive 8100.2.

Our proposed approach to create the objective model is predicated on two factors. First, it involves innovative approaches to representation that extend the modeling of system performance and human behavior to capture, in a single tool, the interaction of dissimilar actors engaging in diverse decision-making processes across different environments. Second, it relies on disciplined approaches to model development that fairly consider and balance analytical motivations, competing requirements and technical alternatives such that software can be designed and implemented or perhaps re-used as appropriate to provide both near-term functionality and enduring utility. The end-product would be a functional model developed initially to support the analysis of air-prosecuted ASW but readily extensible by an anticipatory design to support the analysis of additional domains.",

Combustion Science &amp; Engineering, Inc. proposes to develop a robust, computationally efficient reduced kinetic modeling tool for aviation jet fuels that can be coupled with unsteady flow models such as LES to simulate static stability limits in augmentors.  A three-prong attack is proposed in this project.  CSE will develop computational tools to develop global reduced kinetic models using lumped-parameterization as well as time-scale based dimensional reduction methods such as Rate-Controlled Constrained- Equilibrium (RCCE) and Path Flux Analysis (PFA). Improvement to the computational efficiency of storage and retrieval of in-Situ Adaptive Tabulation (ISAT) using RCCE, and implementation of multi-timescale dynamic adaptive chemistry (MTS-DAC) scheme to save computational time for CFD simulations.  Computational efficiency and accuracy will be improved in all areas that are critical to modeling reacting flows: the finite rate kinetic mechanisms and the implementation of the kinetics into turbulent combustion CFD.  BENEFIT:  The ultimate result of this research will be the development of a modeling tool that will be useful for engineers to design combustors, augmenters and other flameholding devices in practical applications.  This will provide a design tool for predicting static stability limits and flame propagation in afterburner combustion systems.  The market for this product will include gas turbine designers and manufacturers for both military and civilian aircraft.  The use of this tool will significantly reduce development costs by eliminating some design iterations and hardware testing, which is quite expensive and time-consuming.",

Our vision for the end state of the effort is the availability of a productized DYSE (hardware and application software) configured from COTS components, useful for lab-based developmental testing of military C3 and commercial wireless devices in a user-defined, field emulation environment. The platform will also support research-oriented testing for emerging RF technologies such as cognitive radios and advanced MIMO antennas. A unique aspect of the product approach is connecting to Systems Under Test (SUT) at RF where they operate as if they were in the field including motion, antenna effects, other virtual spectrum users and field-realistic dynamic RF wireless channels. The realism is enabled by emulating the wireless environment in the digital domain, where complex RF channels can defined and programmed at will. A key feature of the test tool is the ability to efficiently and comprehensively test large tactical C3 systems typically made up of hundreds of nodes by immersing a small number of real systems in a virtual environment with a large number of virtual nodes. In addition to producing a prototype system, we propose to validate DYSE field testing emulation by collecting field data in a test range including specific instrumentation data, configuring a DYSE emulation of the environment including the same physical SUT, and then comparing results.",

However all high-strength aluminum alloys, such as 7050-T74, are susceptible to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and general corrosion in chloride environments, and the repair and maintenance of corroded components is a major cost driver. As a result, most aerospace aluminum alloys are anodized to enhance corrosion resistance. Unfortunately, anodization can reduce fatigue strength by as much as 40%, add cost, and produces a dangerous hazardous materials waste-stream. In the Phase I SBIR program QuesTek Innovations LLC successfully designed unique high-strength aluminum alloys with nearly 100% better SCC resistance, equivalent or better pitting resistance, and equivalent or better strength over baseline 7050-T74 alloy in the short-transverse direction. Under this Phase II SBIR program, QuesTek will focus on the optimization, scale-up, and coating process selection of the Phase I alloy design and identify target components for application. At the end of the Phase II program, QuesTek anticipates generating the alloy property data required to initiate a Phase III component level fabrication and qualification program.

At the present time, the leading candidate material for these demanding Recce applications is ALON Optical Ceramic, produced by Surmet Corp. The current available production equipment is limited to fabricating high quality ALON window blanks as large as ~17&quot;x30&quot;. Nearly doubling the 17&quot;width to produce a monolithic ALON window 32&quot;wide would require significant capital investment.      Alternatively, during the Phase I effort, Surmet demonstrated edge bonding techniques which allow two smaller windows to be fused together to produce a large window which can be optically fabricated as a single part. The bonding techniques have produced transparent bonds with strengths approaching that of the ALON material itself. In the Phase II effort, Surmet proposes to refine these techniques, select the most promising one and then scale it to produce 12&quot;, then 20&quot;and finally 32&quot;long seams.

The requirements in terms of input electrical power, cooling, weight and size satisfy the Army needs. VCSELs are clearly a superior choice for this application because of their high efficiency, extremely high reliability, higher temperature of operation and smaller emission area compared to competing technologies. In Phase I, we completed the Phase II prototype design, based on a single 7mm x 7mm (6mm-diam emission area) VCSEL array chip. This approach was made possible by the use of a novel high gain quantum well technology for the VCSELs. In Phase I, we also completed fabrication and demonstration of a preliminary prototype based on nine VCSEL arrays connected in series. The module delivers more than 350W CW power around 808nm. Night-time outdoor testing of the module showed that only 132W output was sufficient to clearly illuminate an area up to&gt;500m distance, even though the CCD camera was equipped with a ~50% transmission filter that severely limited the number of photons received by the camera. A video recording of the night-time demonstration was submitted along with the Phase I final report. In Phase II we propose to demonstrate the prototype of the solid state infrared flare with the form factor of illuminant candle. Measurement of the optical, electrical, and lifetime characteristics of the prototype will be conducted. Experiments to show that the prototype design will survive the shock environments of the M278 rocket will also be performed.",

In addition, due to the high volume expected for small diameter rounds, the ability to deliver a solution that is low cost is important.

The system employs miniature IR sources and a series of spectral filters to fuse and project spatially identical but spectrally separated MWIR images onto a unit under test for training and testing purposes. Under the Phase II effort, OPTRA successfully designed, built, and tested a prototype projector which is presently available for the Navy&quot;s test purposes. Following the conclusion of the Phase II effort, dialogue with PMA 272 resulted in new requirements for the projectors field of view (FOV) and dynamic range. Of particular interest is an increased dynamic range in the form of greater bit-depth of the DMD devices (on the order of 12-bits) and more importantly improved contrast to be commensurate with the increased bitdepth. To date no work has been published on increasing the contrast of MWIR DMD-based projectors; the proposed Phase II.5 effort will therefore not only satisfy the Navy&quot;s requirement for improved test equipment, it will also add to the overall body of knowledge of DMD-based scene projectors. In addition, OPTRA proposes an increased FOV of 9090 degrees .",

        "abstract": "Microwave and mm-wave modules often leverage a combination of MMIC die, discrete devices, circuits on ceramics, and bond wires assembled into a metal housing that typically contains a series of connectors. While modern microelectronics has largely done away with hermetic packaging, many microwave modules still use hermetic lids to seal the enclosures, providing the dual function of protecting the circuits from environmental damage and blocking EMI to and from the circuit. This packaging approach incurs a significant cost penalty to the device, but the sensitivity of microwave circuit components to their local environment has prevented the use of more common, less expensive potting and plastic encapsulation solutions because it changes the behavior of the underlying circuit and can cause significant variation over time and temperature. During Phase I, Nuvotronics investigated several promising material solutions for MMIC packaging that provide protection from the environment and EMI shielding. During the Phase II project, Nuvotronics and its development team will refine novel material coating approaches developed in the Phase I project, and transition the optimum solution to MMIC suppliers for DOD applications.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a new type of optical power monitor utilizing transparent microwires and nanowires patterned within a multi-layer anti-reflection coating. These &quot;wires&quot; are nanometer to micron wide traces defined within a transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) conductive layer. ITO typically absorbs 1 to 10% at visible and infrared wavelengths, depending on its thickness, and optical intensities greater than 1 mW/mm2 produce measureable localized heating. This temperature change induces a proportional resistance change that can be measured electronically. By inserting this detector in-line between fiber optic cables, the optical power of the internal signals can be measured without degrading the signal strength. Moreover, by reducing the dimensions of the trace to the nanometer scale, the detector also has the potential for high-speed operation with a bandwidth approaching GHz. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes new optical monitoring applications that were previously impossible or impractical. In one example, inexpensive and miniature optical monitors can now be integrated within the hundreds of millions of fiber optic interconnects produced annually for fiber optic communication systems. Advanced self-monitoring and self-diagnosing communication network architectures can be developed for Fiber-to-the-Home networks and data centers by transparently measuring the optical power through fiber optic junctions. This technology promises to reduce the cost to measure power within optical fibers by two orders of magnitude, and has the potential to be mass-produced and even inkjet printed on flexible plastic film, window glass, solar panels, mirrors, displays, or even on curved substrates such as light bulbs and lenses.",

The technology uses a specialized image sensor to render transparent biological samples visible at optical wavelengths without staining techniques or expensive optical microscope elements requiring extensive training. In addition, the technique naturally deconvolves amplitude and phase, enabling better interpretation of &quot;dark spots&quot;. This project represents a major application of silicon photonics, exploiting the vast semiconductor fabrication infrastructure for novel optics manufacturing techniques. In addition, this proposal addresses selected performance improvements, such as noise reduction via an added cooling unit and enlarging the field of view through denser pixel arrays. When fitted to a standard laboratory microscope, our novel sensor camera offers the capability to produce high-quality, real-time in vivo microscopic phase imaging at a significantly lower cost. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable high-quality, real-time microscopic images of in vivo biological samples. Our business strategy and product plan addresses two potential marketplaces: 1) Secondary schools, college teaching laboratories, and other educational settings; and 2) Academic and industrial research laboratories. Our market penetration strategy provides for educational microscope users to access our novel imaging capabilities at significantly reduced cost, revolutionizing bioscience teaching and training by rendering transparent samples visible in real time and enabling new curricula with a higher experimental component. Academic and industrial researchers also can exploit our innovative technology, using it for better imaging capabilities and removing ambiguities in dark spot interpretation. Our camera is entirely compatible with standard microscopes, enabling retrofits without technical challenges or the need for advanced training; it is also useful for observation of cultures in standard culture dishes, unlike competing techniques.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to further develop, and demonstrate at scale, a biological disinfection process that has exhibited superior microbial inactivation to steam pasteurization at a lower cost. This process leverages dilute concentrations (0.5-0.875% by volume) of plant-derived phenols and aldehydes to inactivate lower level fungi and bacteria found on agricultural byproducts (seed husks and hulls). The application focus for this demonstration is a novel material technology that converts lignocellulosic waste into a high performance, low cost replacement for synthetics (plastics and foams) using a filamentous fungus. This biological disinfection process can reduce process energy consumption by 83% and system capital expense by upwards of 50%. This project will fully quantify the efficacy of this disinfection process at scale (production volumes) as well as analyze the integration of this technique into a mycological material production facility that is presently addressing the protective packaging industry. Batch and continuous systems will be explored, and a comprehensive economic model will be developed based on the results. The mycological materials that are produced under this demonstration will be compared with materials fabricated with the existing pasteurization system, and samples will be evaluated by customers to ensure product adoption. High-embodied energy disinfection processes, autoclave sterilization or pasteurization, are ubiquitous within industries such as agriculture, food processing, and biotechnology. These methodologies are implemented to reduce or remove background bioburden (bacteria, yeast, mold) that can be detrimental to downstream processes due to contamination. Mycological materials production represents such a process since raw material contamination results in product loss and added labor. The plant essential oil (PEO) disinfection technique was proven under the Phase I research to offer a comparable process time to steam pasteurization and superior disinfection efficacy; thus this technology could serve as a drop-in replacement in some industrial applications. This process minimizes capital equipment and operations costs due a reduction in system complexity and energy consumption. In regards to the production of mycological products, this disinfection process bolsters the process robustness by extending contaminate inactivation periods which promotes rapid mycelium colonization or a reduction in incubation time. Therefore new market opportunities for mycological materials can be addressed while further supporting the business case for regional manufacturing using domestic agricultural waste as raw materials. Finally, the benefits obtained from this novel disinfection process permit an accelerated deployment and development of turnkey production systems to displace synthetic materials.",

The project proposes research and innovation on quality of diagnosis, richness of knowledge exchange, privacy and scalability of merging analysis and reporting of medical imaging for the detection of breast cancer. The company proposes a system which allows radiologists to focus on analyzing the image while the system automatically produces a report in the background. The reports are image-based, provide audience-specific levels of detail, and are backwards compatible to text-based reports. The SBIR Phase I project established the efficiency improvements that the proposed system can provide. In Phase II, this project will investigate cloud computing as a model for operating and delivering the company&#039;s mammography integrated analysis and reporting software. Cloud computing has proven to be a scalable and cost-effective means of delivering software services to customers and will thus be an important capability of health-care IT providers. However, the image storage and security requirements for medical images will necessitate improvements over existing cloud solution architecture. The Phase II project will develop new methods for delivering richer image-based reports and robust security via the cloud. Breast cancer affects nearly one in eight women, at a substantial economic and societal cost. Mammography screening is the most effective way to detect breast cancer in its earliest and most treatable phases. However, there are many inefficiencies and quality problems in screening mammograms. While a shortness of radiologists specializing in mammography is driving up costs, there are significant false-negative rate and false-positive rates in screening mammography. This situation creates a clear opportunity for innovations that can provide increased efficiency while maintaining or improving quality. Changes in health-care legislation are yielding incentives for health-care facilities to transition to all-electronic systems. As they do so, many health-care facilities are embracing cloud-based delivery and Software-as-a-Service models. If successful, the Phase II project will continue with research and innovation for the delivery of an integrated analysis and reporting software that will improve the quality of medical image diagnosis while decreasing costs.",

Over the last decade the cost of sequencing a genome has dropped by six orders of magnitude and the throughput of the process has increased by five orders of magnitude. The trend shows no sign of abating and industry experts expect the $1,000 genome mark to be reached in the next year. The combination of lower prices and higher throughput has lead to what is being called &quot;the data deluge&quot; or the &quot;the data tsunami&quot;. Taming this deluge has become a major issue in Bio-informatics and a principle bottleneck to further advances. The objective of this Phase II project is to contribute a solution to the processing problem based on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), non-conventional computing platforms that operate at significantly higher efficiency measured in cost and power per performance unit. The mechanism of genetic coding, identified by Watson and Crick in 1953, was one of the premier scientific advances of the twentieth century. It took twenty more years to identify a feasible approach to decipher the genetic code of a particular individual and twenty more to actually implement it. The first human genome was sequenced in 2003. By 2010 less than 1,000 humans have been sequenced but rapidly decreasing costs and increasing throughput promise that the number will increase exponentially and medical researchers foresee the day in the near future when the whole population will be sequenced as part of standard medical practice. The advances that will be enabled by partial or full sequencing of the population will bring a revolution to health care ushering in an era of personal genetic based medicine.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will design, build, test, and validate a fully operational prototype disk drive incorporating a commutational ramp load actuator (CRLA). The CRLA is a unique and transformative actuator for disk drives that provides significant improvements over existing actuator technology by increasing performance and reducing cost. The research objectives consist of a systematic distributed parameter design for the CRLA components, quantification of intrinsic parameters and performance characteristics, design and synthesis of a robust trajectory and control algorithm to fulfill the ramp load/unload requirements, and verification of repeatability and reliability of the ramp load/unload process. The CRLA design requires travel through a magnetic transition zone which presents an input singularity at a location on the ramp within the actuator sweep angle resulting from a zero torque factor. To promote travel on the ramp and through the region near the input singularity point on the ramp, a robust closed-loop control algorithm will be developed that will provide failsafe ramp load/unload operation through the transition zone. It is anticipated that the research will lead to a technically sound and robust CRLA prototype actuator which will provide significant performance improvements and cost savings. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is immediate and long-term. The immediate commercial potential is the specific application of the technology to the current 550 million units per year disk drive market for computers, servers, data backup systems, communication technologies, and many consumer products such as digital video recorders. The CRLA technology is expected to provide cost savings of $0.17 to $0.47 on magnet, coil, and latch materials for each disk drive. Additional cost savings are realized through a reduction in product liability, warranty, and return costs. This technology will provide a direct benefit to society via manufacture of a consumer product that is of a lower cost and higher performance. This innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding of devices that require ?control through singular regions,? with potential application in diesel engines and various military defense and security technologies. Additional broader impacts include: (a) realistic engineering training for students; (b) improving local economy by creating manufacturing jobs; (c) involvement of undergraduate students and preparation of project modules to enhance undergraduate curriculum; (d) collaboration with practicing engineers; and (e) immediate transfer of technology to disk drive industry.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project targets significantly increased throughputs and distances for broadband access over the existing copper landline infrastructure at low cost. In particular, the technology being developed offers advantages in interference-dominated and in suburban/rural environments. In the USA alone there are many millions of households that are currently out-of-reach of broadband access, where there are typically multiple copper landlines available, and the global demand for such solution is significantly higher. For these underserved subscribers, this innovative extended-reach solution represents the only low-cost broadband access alternative to costly, inefficient satellite coverage. While existing Digital-Subscriber-Line (DSL) solutions are not specified to provide broadband access at very long distances, the company?s novel solution greatly increases the achievable distances and allows broadband rates (1Mbps) to be delivered at extended ranges, as demonstrated in Phase 1 of this project. The technology combines innovative signal-processing algorithms with novel digital implementation architectures to allow for high-performance reduced-complexity and low current-consumption implementations. The broader impact and commercial potential of this project are in enabling affordable broadband service to the many households, which are currently out of the reach of broadband access, and in enhancing the performance of other copper-based applications. The technology will enable telco providers to better compete in areas where cable service exists, and can enhance existing solutions for copper-based backhaul, thereby helping service providers with the growing problem of backhaul bottlenecks associated with increased wireless traffic. The growing demand for solutions of this type has the potential to generate annual revenues on the order of $50M, representing a great business opportunity. Societal benefits include providing broadband service to previously-unreachable homes, thus allowing them to engage in remote education, e-commerce, and telecommuting, with all of the advantages that these entail.

Studies have shown that a poor end-user experience results in a tangible loss of revenue. Yet, online businesses are dependent not only on their own infrastructure, but on the state of the rest of the Internet as well. From the end user perspective, problems with the network infrastructure, third-party content provider issues, or traffic redirection attacks can result in sites being unavailable or slow. Hence, outside-to-inside monitoring of online services is critical for any Internet business if they wish to remain competitive. Unfortunately, existing products often treat the Internet as a black box. They are unable to capture where things have gone wrong or what could be improved inside the network. In this Phase-II proposal, the company takes a bottom-up approach to capturing end-user experience by focusing on understanding and measuring the components of the Internet infrastructure (such as DNS) that are responsible for data delivery. If this effort is successful, businesses will be able to ensure that their service is globally available, proactively identify performance bottlenecks at the network level, and be alerted immediately when under a traffic redirection attack. Businesses that operate on the Internet expect data from monitoring services to be actionable. While some products provide actionable information regarding problem components in web pages, The company offers actionable insight into the network infrastructure that drives content delivery to end users. The impact of this technology is two-fold. First, the technology enables customers to improve content delivery to their end users, which leads to increased revenues. Second, the technology can protect businesses from falling prey to traffic redirection attacks, protecting both themselves and their users from financial losses due to fraud.

Experiments led to the identification of a foam capable of containing monomethylhydrazine vapors below 0.2 ppm for 8 hours and nitrogen tetroxide vapors below 1 ppm for 7 hours.  This and other evaluated foams exhibit significant potential for improvements in containing vapors, extinguishing hypergol fires, and potentially neutralizing the propellants.  In Phase II, the team, strengthened by Northrop Grumman and the capabilities of the NASA White Sands Test Facility, will continue the development and evaluation of candidate foams in lab- and field-scale tests.

As part of SBIR Phase I work Systems Technology, Inc., with Moog, Inc. have developed the Actuator Load Computing System (ALCS), an elegant and logistically attractive solution to this problem that employs onboard flight control actuators as load sensors capable of measuring both high frequency and quasi-steady loads. Further development to streamline the ALCS toward a demonstration flight ready system is proposed for Phase II. Since actuators directly measure the forces exerted on control surfaces, these loads can be used as a robust reference gauge for what is occurring on the wing or tail surface as a whole. This leads to the proposed development of the Aircraft Structural Response Estimator (ASRE) to accurately estimate the lifting surface deflections and loading from the ALCS measurements. ASRE development will utilize test data from high-performance aircraft routinely used by the US military. Since actuators are employed with all control surfaces, the combined ALCS and ASRE solution extends itself for use with wings, vertical tails, and horizontal tails without the need for additional hardware",

In the Phase I program, TIAX developed and demonstrated a pad concept based on the notion that the directionality of the honeycomb structure improves the impact performance of the pads. Test results clearly showed that TIAXs TPE honeycomb pad concept can be effective for use in helmets for blunt impact resistance. The TIAX prototype pad outperformed all of the existing pads that it was compared against. TIAX proposes to continue the optimization of the prototype pad system in Phase II with an emphasis on improving crush performance while reducing the weight of the pads. Complete pad systems will be integrated into the ACH and put through standard test protocols for evaluation of impact performance as well as shock tests and human factors evaluations. Once the design has been optimized, TIAX will work with commercialization partners to develop cost-effective methods for manufacturing pad sets. The design development and testing work that occurs in Phase II is critical to bringing the proposed pad technology to a point at which it is ready for field testing and manufacturing scale-up as part of a Phase III effort. At the end of Phase II, TIAX expects to have both a design and manufacturing process in place for large-scale manufacturing of pad sets for the Army.

        "abstract": "High power fiber lasers have made significant progress in the last several years. Ten kW of diffraction-limited output power at 1 micron from one single mode fiber has been demonstrated. Department of Defense (DoD) needs 100s of kW for missile defense as well as for protection against rockets, artillery, and mortars (RAM). There is serious concern about current 1 micron fiber laser system potentially causing collateral eye damage due to scatter off of target surfaces. AdValue Photonics proposes to develop an innovative eye-safe single mode fiber laser with output power greater than 5kW using our proprietary glass fibers, and scale up the total power to 100s-kW with good beam quality using an innovative beam combining technique. In Phase II we shall further optimize erbium doped double cladding fiber, demonstrate cladding pumped fiber laser with slope efficiency greater than 85%, demonstrate output power of 500W, and design the proposed 100kW fiber laser system.",

        "abstract": "The need to fight and control the urban terrain is not a new concept for the military; however, there are new obstacles, illustrated in the battles fought and won in Fallujah and Haditha, that make the job of the warfighter much harder. Due to the pioneering work of researchers in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence, there exist promising and significant opportunities for the incorporation of semi-autonomous robotic entities within the small-unit tactical team that may positively impact the day-to-day effectiveness of those teams in urban environments. To achieve this vision, we propose to develop a system for Coordinating with Humans by Adjustable-autonomy for Multirobot Pursuit (CHAMP). The robots and humans will be controlled by distributed optimization strategies, derived from results in distributed pursuit, distributed constraint optimization, and dynamic game theory. The degree of operator control will be dynamic, and will be informed by recent results from the field of adjustable autonomy. Human-robotic interaction will be intuitive. The CHAMP system will allow the coordination of the robotic team to become more dynamic and adjust to the goals, demands, and constraints of the current situation as it unfolds.",

        "abstract": "Modern military systems operate in dynamic, multidimensional environments and employ a variety of sensors, models, and displays to provide situational assessments for decision making. Given the extreme complexity of managing such a battlespace, the core element of these platforms is often a computer-based command and decision system. Included in these systems is doctrine that guides the decisions of automated components and operators. For example, rules of engagement doctrine dictates when and how force should be used against a threat. Complicating the situation, the data in these environments are rife with uncertainty, and decisions must often be made in short timeframes. Consequently, the doctrine-driven decision making process is not deterministic in nature. To address these issues, Aptima is proposing the development of LUCID (Limiting Uncertainty in Command Information Displays). At the core of LUCID are model-driven visualizations that enable the quantification of uncertainty and provide an intuitive view of the uncertainties associated with doctrine-driven decisions. Working with Lockheed Martin, Aptima will identify scenarios involving uncertainty and gather data and doctrine related to AEGIS. This will drive the development of model-based visualizations with the ultimate goal of integration into the AEGIS workflow.",

        "abstract": "ADS-B reports can be maliciously spoofed to deny airspace to other aircraft including those on DoD missions. Under the Phase I  effort, we developed a novel approach that exploits the physical characteristics of the ADS-B transmission signal to determine its validity. We leveraged our proven transmitter localization algorithms along with multi-target tracking filters to develop an ADS-B message authentication system that can be deployed on an aircraft without the need for supporting ground stations or collaboration with other aircraft. Phase I effort demonstrated the feasibility of our approach using simulations as well through data collected from commercial air traffic. Phase I specifically accomplished: i) Development of a simulation testbed, ii) ASTAR algorithm development utilizing RF signal characteristics and multi-target multi-hypothesis testing, iii) ASTAR feasibility demonstration through simulations, iv) Real-time ADS-B data collection using COTS equipment, and v) ASTAR prototype system resource requirement determination.  Phase II effort proposes to develop and implement a retrofit prototype system in collaboration with Raytheon that will be used to demonstrate performance of the ASTAR system in real-time through Hardware in the Loop (HIL) as well as flight tests. Phase III commercialization will be done with support from Raytheon to develop a commercially viable product concept. ASTAR will be productized both as a retrofit add-on module as well as a built-in option for commercial transponders.  BENEFIT:  The proposed ADS-B authentication system has both military as well as commercial applications. DoD will benefit by having a robust countermeasure against potential malicious denial of airspace. Besides being able to flag the spoofed ADS-B messages, under certain conditions, the proposed system may be able to provide a localization solution that could be used to suppress the spoof attack source from generating further attacks. Commercial applications involve working with the standards groups and avionics manufacturers to incorporate the proposed authentication system either within the Minimum Operations Performance Standards (MOPS) for ADS-B or be offered as a standard capability of the transponder equipment.  System will also provide an independent check for bad data that may be generated due to system malfunctions on the transmitting or receiving systems (which may be an airborne or a ground receiver) or corrupted during transmission.",

Use of full-wave solvers to assess the on-platform performance of an antenna or the interaction between two antennas is impractical, both in terms of computing resources required and length of execution time. The next best choice is to use a high-frequency code. To address this issue, Applied EM is developing state of the art UTD (Uniform Theory of Diffraction) code for faceted CAD geometries. Although not as accurate as full-wave codes, high-frequency codes require modest computer resources and are faster than full-wave codes. In a serial mode, however, even these codes can take substantial time to execute depending on platform size and complexity. During this SBIR, Applied EM and its team members are proposing porting of already developed UTD code to both CPU and GPU-based parallel environments for the purpose of greatly accelerating the performance. During Phase I, we identified bottlenecks in current algorithms and also identified existing algorithms that may be problematic in transferring to a parallel environment.

Module development will proceed from a compact low inductance prototype developed in Phase I through iterations of fuse development at the 6 and 10-uF scale to demonstrate individual drop-out of failing capacitors under extreme testing conditions without energetic or propagating damage to the remainder of the module.

In the first years of development, the PHM was cumbersome and very difficult to transport. The new generation of PHM, which is comparable in size, weight and power to the commercially available cesium standards exhibit excellent frequency stability and timekeeping ability. The frequency stability of a passive hydrogen maser is essential and exceedingly suitable as a space-based atomic clock.  BENEFIT:  The keys to miniaturization of the passive hydrogen maser are mainly determined by the oscillatory system. The passive hydrogen maser does not have an oscillation threshold, instead operating essentially as a very narrow microwave filter.  The lack of a threshold reduces requirements on overall design, particularly regarding cavity Q, making possible a significant reduction in size, at the expense, however, of overall performance.

This combination enables the system to not only detect the presence of a variety of agents such as blister, nerve, and blood agents, as well as TICs, but also quantitate the exposure and alert the wearer. The miniature sensor design and user interface will allow the device to be seamlessly integrated with protective masks and garments. In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of CADET by detecting three chemical warfare agents using a sensitive, compact prototype in a laboratory. In Phase II, POC plans to develop a fully operational CADET system, fully compatible with protective masks and garments without impacting their form and function. CADET will be extensively tested under relevant conditions using military standards.  BENEFIT:  Development of CADET will provide the military with a reliable, hands-free method to rapidly determine the identity and exposure level of a variety of CWAs during asymmetric warfare involving NBC agents. CADET will also be useful for law enforcement personnel and first responders who enter contaminated areas to perform their duties. Commercial applications of CADET include chemical pollutant monitoring by environmental protection agencies and air quality regulation. In addition, CADET will be useful for monitoring the indoor and outdoor air at chemical plants and oil refineries. The proposed CADET, with minor modifications, will also have other commercial applications, including terrorism-related biological agent monitoring for Homeland Security, and wastewater monitoring near chemical/biological disposal plants.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this Navy Phase II SBIR program is to demonstrate the feasibility of using Piezoelectric Metal RubberTM (PMR) material for the harvesting of energy and the charging of batteries used by electrically-powered transponder systems underwater. PMR is an elastic piezoelectric material that produces electrical charge when mechanically strained. Cables containing PMR material can be held in tension underwater and periodically strained due to resonant vortex shedding induced by water flow. Charges generated by the PMR material can be collected and used to charge a local battery. The total energy stored can be scaled by increasing or decreasing the total number of segments, either in a single cable or in a cable array. This approach is potentially attractive for a number of Navy systems that require different power levels for long-term unattended operation. During Phase I, NanoSonic demonstrated the fabrication of initial PMR material, measured its piezoelectric properties, and analytically designed an underwater energy harvesting system approach building on PMR material and its response. During the Phase II program, NanoSonic would fabricate materials with optimized properties, and design, build and evaluate the performance of prototype energy harvesting systems through laboratory, water flow tank, and fresh water and ocean tests.",

        "abstract": "Today&#039;s riverine forces employ combatant patrol/assault craft that relies on speed, acceleration, and maneuverability for survivability and multi-mission success. These capabilities are at risk because of the increasing demand to carry more extensive payloads. Current diesel propulsion systems are typicallymodifications of truck or industrial engines with a weight to power ratio of 3-5 (lb/hp). By reducing the propulsion weight, the craft will be able carry more extensive payloads. The three engine choices are diesel, gasoline, and turbine. Current diesel engines don&#039;t meet the weight goal, gasoline engines are not an option due to fleet requirements and turbine engines have unacceptable thermal issues. However, a novel engine, the Linear Power Transmission (LPT) engine has the greatest potential to meet the 1lb/hp goal. The original engine design received FAA certification in the 1950&#039;s, weighed 237 lbs and produced 200 hp. In this effort, we propose to build and test an innovative multi-fuel marine engine, based on the LPT (currently in production for gensets). Project goals include an engine design that exceeds 500 HP with a weight of 480lbs with low fuel consumption.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this proposal is to develop user-friendly, highly accurate and efficient, robust and powerful computer codes for predication of radar signatures of MDA objects of interest (MOIs) and the effects of geometrical and material uncertainties. Three computer codes will be developed, one for body-of-revolution (BOR) targets, another for discrete body-of-revolution (DBOR) targets, and the third for scattering by a deep, arbitrarily-shaped air duct in an air-breathing missile. Each code will be self-complete as it will include a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI), a solid modeling capability that can accept commonly used geometry data formats, a robust meshing capability to generate high-quality meshes, a parallelized main computational engine, and necessary post-processing capabilities to handle output data. Equally important, each code will have unmatched capabilities to model complex geometries and materials that can be inhomogeneous and anisotropic. All the three codes are based on a novel physics-based computational electromagnetics (CEM) algorithm for solving Maxwell&quot;s equations and a robust stochastic collocation-based algorithm for uncertainty analysis, both of which have been studied and fully validated in the feasibility study conducted in Phase I. The CEM algorithm combines the finite element and boundary integral methods and implements a novel numerical technique to exploit either the continuous or the discrete rotational symmetry of a BOR or DBOR target to accelerate computations. For scattering by a deep cavity--a well-known grand challenge in CEM, the hybrid finite element and boundary integral method employs a special frontal algorithm to speed up calculation and reduce memory requirements. The stochastic collocation algorithm is capable to perform an uncertainty analysis by using a significantly smaller number of samples than required by the traditional Monte-Carlo method. The development of the proposed computer codes will provide a highly accurate and efficient and easy-to-use tool to compute the radar signatures of MOIs and to quantify potential errors due to geometrical/material modeling uncertainty. All the codes will be parallelized to harness the power of parallel computing. The use of graphical processing units (GPU) will be explored to further speed up the computations.",

Low-maintenance microfiltration is now used for pre-treatment, and it relies upon periodic electrolytic hypochlorite-enhanced seawater flushes. Increased littoral deployment of naval vessels has also seen an increase in biological fouling and clogging of vessel cooling systems, leading to the installation of electrolytic chlorination systems on ships and submarines to control biological fouling. Efficient electrolytic chlorination requires an active control feedback system in the form of a compact, near real-time in-stream detector capable of continuously detecting and reporting the total residual oxidant (TRO) content in the hypochlorite-enhanced seawater streams that the Navy uses for periodic biofouling control flushes. Efficient control/monitoring of electrolytic chlorine-generation systems requires a TRO sensor that will operate accurately, reliably and for long durations without maintenance in the marine environment.

To reduce noise and improve responsitivity, such detectors are cryogenically cooled to below -200 degrees C, which in combination with C-SWAP requirements greatly limit their applicability for integration into aircraft. Detector structures composed of SLS material have demonstrated the potential to achieve high temperature operation MWIR and LWIR, responsivity similar to HgCdTe detectors, and reduced dark currents.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  When a solid rocket motor propellant grain contains one or more flaws (cracks, debonds, casting voids) or develops them as it ages, the risks of testing that motor is significantly increased.  The responsible authority must decide between testing a motor that may destroy expensive testing infrastructure and relegating a motor for demilitarization that may not have failed from the flaw.  Both circumstances waste precious resources.  Such decisions demand a more accurate assessment of flaw propagation, so a tool that can provide that capability is critical.  No such tool currently exists.  ASI proposes to develop an innovative new tool, called ASSIST, that will provide that accurate assessment.  We propose to couple fully transient, fully three-dimensional fluid and structural dynamic codes that can be used to determine what happens to a motor that contains a flaw.  ASSIST will contain a detailed model for the combustion inside the flaw volume that determines, in large part, the stress/strain field induced in the crack tip.  It will also contain a detailed propellant fracture mechanics model to determine whether the flaw will propagate, based upon the stress/strain field at the crack tip.  We will validate ASSIST with an analysis of a large, flawed motor.  BENEFIT:  The Air Force will benefit directly from ASSIST through its application analyzing various strategic and tactical solid rocket motors in inventory that have been in service for long periods of time.  In fact, one of the critical flaws that limit the service life of the Minuteman III first stage motor is the cracking that occurs in certain portions of the grain as the propellant ages.  The ASI tool can be used to determine how much cracking can be tolerated before catastrophic failure will occur.  The tactical motor inventory arguably has a more difficult service life, since thermal cycles and rough handling/flight loads are not well defined for any particular motor.  That makes for a high likelihood of encountering a flawed propellant grain during routine service life testing.  The use of ASSIST in those situations is of significant benefit to decision makers.  Other DoD components can likewise benefit from ASSIST.  Army and Navy weapon systems also have challenging life cycle environments that increase the likelihood that flaws will develop as the motors age.  Again, the decision of whether to use or test such a system demands an accurate solution that ASSIST can provide.  The Missile Defense Agency (MDA), in particular, faces the aging problem every day.  That Agency uses aged Navy strategic assets (in excess of twenty five years in age) as the propulsive components of their strategic targets.  They have got to know which motors are safe to fly and which ones need to be demilitarized.  The cost of a single strategic missile defense test is in excess of $25M, so an unexpected failure from one of those aged motors is incredibly expensive.  ASSIST will benefit those decision makers.  In fact, any government agency that flies its own aircraft can likewise benefit from this analysis tool, because it is fundamentally an aeroelastic analysis tool.  Repeated dynamic aeroelastic dynamic loading of aircraft wings can result in catastrophic failure.  The ASI tool can benefit those agencies through a better understanding of those aeroelastic loads.  Commercial entities can likewise benefit from ASSIST.  Rocket-deployed parachute developers, such as BRS, Inc., use motors that age with time.  The environments in general aviation aircraft that use their systems are benign compared to military environments, but the motors age nonetheless.  They face exactly the same issues in determining the safe useful lives of their motors.  As with the government agencies, commercial aircraft makers and even Formula 1 race car manufacturers can benefit through static and transient aeroelastic analysis of their aerodynamic wings.  And, commerical jet engines need aeroelastic analyses of their turbine blades, as do those used in commercial gas turbine engines.  ASSIST provides ASI with ample commercial opportunity, so we plan to pursue those opportunities vigorously.",

For many of these systems, the surface area of the platform is in the tens of thousands of square wavelengths. In this case, the use of full-wave solvers to assess the on-platform performance of an antenna or the interaction between two antennas is impractical, both in terms of computing resources required and length of execution time. The best choice is to use a high-frequency code, which provides an approximate solution but requires modest computer resources and tends to be highly parallelizable. However, even high-frequency codes can take substantial time to execute depending on platform size and complexity. During this project, we propose to investigate multiple hardware-based parallelization strategies for our high-frequency computational electromagnetics code. The parallelization strategies will target different types of commercially available parallel processing hardware, including computer clusters and graphics processors.",

Previous work showed that combining fiberglass and thermoplastic face sheets and syntactic foam produced composite panels with greater impact resistance than plywood with aluminum facing. This work will expand the materials and processing envelope to produce a series of composite panels fabricated from recycled glass-reinforced/thermoplastic face sheets and a syntactic foam core consisting of glass or ceramic microspheres and regrind or virgin polymer. The use of hollow microspheres allows the achievement of both low weight and high impact strength while using low-cost extrusion-compression processing techniques. This configuration can be readily tailored to produce panel applications as varied as truck trailer bodies or for protection against flying debris caused by hurricane-force winds. The broader impacts of this research are the increased use of recycled materials to decrease the weight of commercial transport vehicles, resulting in increased fuel economy and decreased degradation of roadways and bridges. Also, improved systems for impact protection during hurricanes will result in less damage to commercial and residential structures and the loss of fewer lives. The technology of combining hollow ceramic microspheres from the ash of power plants with re-ground polymer waste will produce a material with unique properties that can be applied to a variety of commercial applications.",

This innovative product is driven by a need to create a test for human developmental toxicity that is more accurate than current tests that use animals. False negative results from these animal assays have lead to unexpected cases of birth defects, such as observed with Thalidomide. This assay, performed on human embryonic stem cells, is more predictive of developmental toxicity than animal models (80% vs 60%) and unlike animal models, provides data about specific human biochemical pathways that are affected. This will fund research to 1) identify biomarkers of developmental toxicity present in three different human cell lines, 2) optimize automation systems, 3) create a web-based interface to be used by customers, 4) standardize and create quality control procedures and 5) take the initial steps required for validation of the assay by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM). Upon validation, the test will be required in Europe for assessing developmental toxicity of newly developed pharmaceuticals and may be further used for testing of environmental chemicals as well. The broader impacts of this research include 1) a global reduction in drug and chemical induced human birth defects 2) significant cost savings (up to $70 million per drug) for pharmaceutical companies allowing greater confidence in drug candidate selection and 3) a major global reduction in animal testing.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate an inspection and monitoring sensor system that addresses the problem of structural evaluation of composite components with an innovative nondestructive evaluation (NDE) sensor system. Composites have always been a challenge for inspection due to their multilayer and anisotropic material construction. This challenge is increased when dealing with wind turbine blades due to their enormous size, construction, strength requirements, operational environment, and safety considerations. The Phase II effort will further upgrade and refine the sensor operational capabilities developed in Phase I. The signal to noise ratio and inspection coverage area (sensor footprint) will be further improved. The system capability will be expanded so that a single control unit can operate and receive data from a networked array of sensor. The sensor system will have application during manufacture to verify part quality, for pre- and post-installation inspection to check for shipping or assembly damage and during the component?s service life as a structural health monitor system. These sensors offer the possibility for substantial savings and reduction of downtime as manufacturing defects are discovered at the point of origin, before catastrophic blade failure can occur. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to facilitate the economical installation and operation of wind energy generators. The U.S. has set a goal of 20% (300GW) of electrical power to be generated from wind by 2030. Based on the typical utility scale turbine (1.5-2.0MW) this translates to having over 500,000 turbine blades in domestic service by 2030. Depending on the wind turbine size, blade costs are $55k to $300k each with a 1.5-2.0MW turbine costing $2-3M to install. The growth of wind energy represents a huge manufacturing challenge to produce, install and maintain the turbine blades. The sensor system developed during this program has the potential to detect defects or damage both early in the supply chain and during the life cycle so that expensive energy capacity downtime or catastrophic tower failures can be avoid. Blade failure is not only a cost issue but also a safety one as well. An accurate method for inspection of complex blade structures can have a major economic impact on the industry. The sensor system being developed also has use in Aerospace and Infrastructure/Bridge applications.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops devices and systems to conduct two-way data communication using the electrical power distribution grid as the communications medium. The Phase I research provided information needed to optimize the devices, systems, and methods used, but also raised additional questions that need to be researched during Phase II. This effort includes the development of specialized high-order modulation techniques, filters and shields to allow the equipment to operate in a high-voltage environment, and specialized low-overhead communication protocols to accommodate the constraints imposed by the communications medium. If successful, an application platform for grid applications and a management model for distributed communications and intelligence will be developed. Typically, these needs are being addressed by overlaying a digital network of some sort over the power distribution network. Smart Grid initiatives in development today are complicated by the fact that no one digital communication technology is adapted to all the places and environments in which the Smart Grid must operate. The grid itself is always present wherever Smart Grid intelligence is needed, making on-grid communications potentially the simplest and most cost-effective medium for enabling Smart Grid communications. Power Tagging Technology encourages a fundamentally different approach to Smart Grid implementation. Early efforts at using technology for demand management by engaging consumers have favored consumers at the high end of the economic scale, ones who live in newer subdivisions, and have the funds, skills, and interest to invest in personal energy management technology. Rural and inner city consumers benefit much less if at all from these programs. However, Power Tagging Technology has the potential to benefit all types of consumers equally through applications like high-resolution Conservation Voltage Regulation that reduces energy consumption and costs for wide-range of consumers. Power Tagging Technology is not only a communications mechanism, but it is inherently also a mechanism for monitoring the grid and inferring information about the electrical distribution infrastructure that is not readily available today. If successfully deployed, Power Tagging Technology has the potential for enabling whole new fields of research and development in Power Engineering and Grid Security.",

        "abstract": "Based on Cascade Designs expertise at developing individual water purification systems for the military and outdoor markets, we are proposing a novel in-line filter design that is based on incorporating multiple water purification technologies contained in a MOLLE compatible filter housing. Our proposed in-line filter will comprise of both size exclusion filtration and adsorptive media. The size exclusion step will remove all three classes of microbes (Protozoa, Bacteria, and Virus) to levels satisfying purification status including passing the NSF P248 test protocol. This filtration stage will also remove turbidity, algae and other contaminants contributing to the total suspended solids load to a level passing the military&quot;s drinking water standards while maintaining acceptable flow rates. During Phase I, Cascade Designs demonstrated the feasibility of the concept by showing that the proposed in-line filter design could satisfy the stringent flow rate, filter capacity and microbiological removal requirements established by the Army. We will continue in Phase II to optimize the performance of the complimentary water purification technologies and then design, assemble and test MOLLE compatible prototype filters. Our Phase II project will conclude with the delivery of 50 low-rate production filters to the Army for field testing in a relevant environment.    Benefits  The MOLLE compatible in-line filter developed in this Phase II SBIR program is intended for use by forward deployed soldiers operating in a hostile environment. These soldiers have a real need for a compact and lightweight water purification system that minimizes their exposure when collecting drinking water on the battlefield by enabling them to purify the water while on the move (i.e. enable a true&quot;scoop and run&quot;mode of water purification). Our approach is based on in-line filter that produces potable water devoid of any microbiological pathogens (i.e. functions as a hands-free microbiological purifier). Compared to the use of chemical disinfectants to treat surface water, this approach has the benefits of eliminating the need for a dwell time to ensure complete removal of any microbiological contaminants as well as improving the palatability of the treated water. Commercial applications of our approach will include gravity feed and hand-pump water purification systems that are designed specifically for the outdoor, travel and emergency preparedness markets. These markets have a real need for an effective outdoor water treatment product that is simple to operate and is a one-step purifier that can pass the microbiological removal requirements of the NSF P248 protocol.",

Our technical approach is to use lattice matched AlInN-GaN epilayers in conjunction with a field-plated insulating gate HEMT device design and a fluorine treatment to accomplish the goal. We believe that the combination of lattice matched AlInN field-plated HEMTs, a unique pulsed PECVD insulator deposition and the use of a controlled fluorine treatment should overcome the issues currently faced by the AlGaN-GaN based technology.  The suitability of our devices for military and commercial applications will be established via a joint processing and device testing program. In the Phase III program we will develop a large volume manufacturing technology for epitaxial wafers and devices for supply to DOD and commercial outfits in a strategic partnership with a large company.",

        "abstract": "The proposed research promises to replace and/or complement current front end limiter technologies, which do not provide the necessary growth potential for evolving threats, with a technology that does. This would enable design engineers to support MDA GMD radar, communication, and GPS systems advancing threat requirements by  applying an advanced limiter technology that counters evolving threats while not affecting the front end insertion loss.   This research will provide  the basis for the development of Planar Metamaterial Limiter Coating (PMLC) that will counter this problem and provide the necessary growth potential for evolving threats. During the proposed Phase II effort, PMLC technical feasibility demonstrations will be performed to demonstrate that this  PMLC technology will raise the front-end RF power handling capability to well over 10x which will allow countering the estimated incident HPM/EMP field threats without transient failure or permanent damage to any RF front-end.  The intended PMLC operation principle is to establish virtually instantaneous energy exchange between nonlinear PMLC coating material and incident high-power interference, thus clamping powerful HPM/EMP fields. At the same time this technology is intended to provide negligible coupling with the desired small signals thereby acting RF transparent and minimizing insertion loss. This effect will be achieved using nonlinear properties of the PMLC constituent material when influenced by the high RF fields. This research will provide a new category of inexpensive, easily integrated limiter technology that can grow with the evolving threat.  Results:  Several new PMLC devices will be fabricated and tested that will mitigate HPM, UWB and EMP destructive effects.",

Concerns with these defenses is that they fail to address the problems associated with attacks that originate from inside the network by a trusted user, and they don&quot;t account for relationship between attack methods and the vulnerabilities of the underlying software that is targeted by the attack.   This effort will develop a Real-time Application Software Analyzer (RASAr), with our team member at Auburn University&quot;s Information Assurance Laboratory that fills the gap in network defenses by utilizing the intimate knowledge of the software on a particular node to guide the defense strategy.  RASAr will provide analysis, verification, and monitoring capabilities for developed and deployed software. RASAr first analyzes the program to gain an understanding of the potential attack vectors used to exploit specific known vulnerabilities for source code and binaries. RASAr uses these analysis results to monitor for attacks that target specific vulnerabilities by identifying attacks targeted towards low-level procedure vulnerabilities in the software.",

        "abstract": "Future surveillance radars need to be more agile to identify and track increasingly complex targets. To meet this need, radars that can emit and receive many independently scanned beams will be required.  Furthermore, the scanning must be two dimensional and operate over wide bands. One row of 16 elements forming eight independent beams will be developed, constructed and tested to demonstrate the feasibility of building larger arrays. The wideband beamformer can be extended to a 16X16 array. The beamformer can form eight or more independently scanned transmit and receive beams, each capable of scanning over a +/-60 degrees  range in azimuth and elevation plane. The one row of Phase II hardware will also demonstrate azimuth scanning. The beamformer has an open architecture design that places no limit on the size of the array. The unit can be built with current MMIC technology using multi-chip modules. Greater degrees of MMIC integration will result in low cost. The beamformer has a novel design with active power dividers/combiners that have&gt;30dB isolation over active bandwidths.Dual polarization capability can be added in the future. The hardware may have application to ECM and high-rate data links as well as radar.",

        "abstract": "TSC will develop software that exploits the rich geometric diversity of high resolution UHF-band SAR when the SAR flies a circular flight path about the scene of interest. TSC will develop and implement software that processes both UHF-band and VHF-band TRACER data to: 1) generate VideoSAR frames for full CFP orbits, 2) perform VideoCD using NCD / CCD / PCD, 3) generate 3-D tomographic cubes by coherently processing circular flight path frames from several CFP orbits, and 4) generate (and/or update) DEMs using the TRACER data from two or more circular flight path frames via stereo/interferometric techniques. These techniques will be initially developed on a Windows Workstation and will eventually be ported to the Desch HPC for final testing and demonstration.     TSC will initially employ the TRACER UHF-band data that is currently available at TSC-CT for algorithm development. However, TSC will also process additional UHF-band and VHF-band data that is expected from the TRACER radar mounted on the Ikhana Predator-B for both CONUS and OCONUS collections. These collections are expected to support the generation of VideoSAR over a 20 km x 20 km footprint and therefore meet the long range Air Force goal for footprint size on the GREP program.    BENEFIT:  The UHF/VHF VideoSAR technology will address the military requirement for providing a real-time, wide-area persistent ISR capability, including image generation, change detection image generation, DEM generation, building, wall and road location maps, etc. (Note:  As reported at the 2010 National Symposium on Sensor and Data Fusion, determining the locations of walls along the streets in urban areas of Middle East cities has been identified as a critical military need.) UHF VideoSAR is a complementary technology to microwave VideoSAR; although it has a coarser resolution, it is very effective at locating objects such as thin wires and vehicles, has a low false alarm rate due to the lack of target shadows, and is able to penetrate foliage and (to a degree) some soil types. UHF VideoSAR, even when performed with a multiple polarizations (typically HH, VV and HV), typically requires a much lower data link capacity than does microwave VideoSAR. The military services and Government agencies that would receive the greatest benefit from the Phase II results would be the Air Force and Army from the robust, persistent ISR capability, and the NGA from the detailed terrain/urban data that will be provided.",

Existing commercial equipment available for contaminated water diving provides a high level of protection but does not allow&quot;free swimming&quot;use, and are not adaptable to this application. Currently for contaminated water use NSW divers employ conventional FFMs (full face masks) and dry suits that are not optimized for this use and have significant performance and safety shortcomings. Our Phase I effort identified the FFM as the critical weakness of these systems and we have developed a new mask system concept, which when combined with an optimized dry suit, will provide greatly improved performance. Our mask system will provide a helmet like seal to protect the divers face from contaminated water, and incorporates a unique face seal system that will allow conformance with a wide range of face shapes, while providing a high level of comfort.

This class of power converter, called switched-capacitor (SC or switched-cap) DC-DC converters, serves applications below 200 mA of current, with typical output voltages of 6 V or lower. The unique features of SC DC-DC converters are: (1) They consist only of switches and capacitors, and energy transfer is achieved by controlling the charging and discharging of the capacitors. (2) Because no magnetic components are needed, SC DC-DC converters are amenable to single-chip integration, or multichip module (MCM) packages. (3) The majority of the power loss is due to the small voltage drop in the switches and capacitors. Unique to Ridgetop&quot;s solution is the ability to digitally set the output voltage by using a comparator in the feedback loop. Using an on-chip digital-to-analog converter (DAC), we can take in a digital word and compare this voltage with the output voltage. Then we can modulate the output pass transistor that is used to set the output voltage. In this way, we can derive virtually any output voltage within the output range.

        "abstract": "Multimode seekers are receiving significant attention as a way to provide more capability in the same package. In some cases, laser, optical and millimeter wave sensors are being combined in a way that requires a common aperture. The requirements for such a system place a tremendous burden on the design and production of such a dome. In the phase I program, Surmet has developed and demonstrated a method to incorporate patterned, conductive metal grid within the dome material itself. The so called co-fired approach, of burying a metal ink pattern within a green ceramic prior to firing, results in an affordable path to manufacture very large numbers of domes with embedded grids. Surmet is in the process of delivering few fabricated domes as program deliverables. In the Phase II program, Surmet proposes to address several existing challenges in fabricating a fully functional JAGM dome. Surmet will refine the toolpaths and controls to direct-write grids from improved nano-metal ink on green machined JAGM dome blanks. Surmet will also demonstrate capabilities to fabricate the gridded domes to the required specifications and optical properties. At the conclusion of the program, a scalable pre-pilot fabrication process for gridded ALON/Spinel domes will be demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "OPTRA proposes the development of an explosive detector comprised of a Risley scanner and a standoff photoacoustic detector for robot-based mobile operation. The Risley scanner is a mature technology, which uses a pair of matched prisms to steer a laser beam anywhere inside a cone. OPTRA has extensive experience developing and customizing such Risley scanners to accommodate a variety of applications including laser ranging, optical avoidance and optical communication. The standoff photoacoustic explosive detection hardware concept was developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL) and utilizes a Quartz Crystal Tuning Fork (QCTF) to detect reflected returns from the target. Using this technology, ORNL has demonstrated the ability to detect explosive concentrations as low as 100 ng/cm2 at a range of 20 m and to distinguish between various explosives. By coupling these two demonstrated technologies, OPTRA developed a breadboard system during the Phase I, which was demonstrated to collect TNT and RDX explosive spectra. During the Phase II, OPTRA will build on this success by developing a compact prototype system complete with detection and discrimination algorithms suitable for mobile standoff explosive detection. This highly sensitive, wide field explosive detector prototype will be capable of monitoring large areas from a safe distance, which should help neutralize the IED threat in the near term.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  As the Air Force agency responsible for DE weapons and hardening of Air Force munitions against DE effects, the Air Armament Center and 46th Test Wing need a suite of low-cost instrumentation that can provide accurate, high-speed measurements of HEL and HPM energies. This instrumentation is needed to characterize weapons effects and identify kill mechanisms. The scope of the AEgis Technologies Group&quot;s directed energy capabilities and facilities is unrivaled among small businesses. In this Phase 2 project, AEgis will provide HEL instrumentation to characterize the laser beam at various distances, determine the efficiency of tracking and atmospheric compensation systems, and determine the energy deposited on various targets. Microsensors embedded in a rugged detector array will provide spatial and temporal irradiance and temperature profiles on the target. AEgis will also develop HPM instrumentation that will provide test engineers with the ability to characterize L and W band weapon parameters in controlled laboratory environments, determine their performance in open-air environments, and determine the energy deposited at and inside targets and target areas of interest. These HPM instruments will use a reconfigurable design with fractal geometry detectors that are fabricated on conformal substrates using a nanoparticle printing process.  BENEFIT:  This effort will result in detailed designs and tested devices for both HEL and HPM instrumentation.  AEgis has conducted market research over the past few years identifying application areas and customers for both the HEL and HPM sensors to be developed in this effort.  The current competitors for our HEL sensors typically only provide off board measurements of temperature on targets using infrared cameras.  Our HEL instruments provide higher quality data at higher acquisition rates than this approach and are not subject to degradation caused by thermal blooming or distance from the target.  Current technology for HPM sensing consists of B-dot and D-dot sensors that significantly perturb the fields they are attempting to measure and do not fit into confined spaces.  Our approach provides a novel detector that has minimal field perturbation. Our commercialization plans involve marketing these sensors to commercial ventures that provide HEL and HPM systems primarily to the military.  Numerous prime contractors have expressed interest in using this instrumentation in their internal research and development programs and in conjunction with their development programs for military related DE systems. AEgis has also received expressions of interest from government interests for HEL and HPM instrumentation. We have identified several ongoing programs that have stated requirements for the types of instruments we are proposing to develop with this effort.",

Technology Assessment &amp; Transfer, Inc. (TA &amp; T) has developed a process and material system for embedding grid conductor patterns in the spinel green state that are compatible with co-firing. The patterns are defined by soft lithography, which is an inexpensive and fast method of applying micropatterned structures to both flat and non planar surfaces. The conductors are then transferred, covered in the green ceramic compact, and maintain fidelity through all the processing required to achieve transparency in spinel.

The total weight of our battery-powered NCSI is approximately 3.4 lb and is similar to that of a common household flashlight. We have used low cost components such that the final parts cost of our NCSI will be approximately $230. In Phase I, we established the feasibility of our approach by completing critical soldering and heat shrinking operations with our proof-of-concept NCSI. During Phase II, we will develop a Functional Prototype for testing at Creare and Fieldable Prototypes for evaluation by the Navy and will execute our commercialization and transition plans.

        "abstract": "Echo Ridge and partner Argon ST, propose to validate the performance improvements of GPS UE, enabled by  the addition of cognitive functionality, with respect to user interfacing, PVT accuracy, TTFF latency, jamming/spoofing resistance and power consumption efficiency.  This will be accomplished through lab and field testing of a full functionality prototype cognitive UE hosted on a hand-held software defined radio (SDR) platform.  The prototype platform will include a traditional GPS UE and cognitive-enable UE, allowing side by side performance comparison.  The platform will utilize COTS/GOTS GPS signal processing software, accompanied by mature, open-source expert system software to allow platform portability while lowering cost and risk. The lab testing will include a high fidelity channel emulator capable of producing realistic and repeatable channel and environmental conditions including multipath and jammers/spoofers.  The testing will show quantitative improve in performance (&quot;through cognitive acting&quot;) in the context of the surrounding environment (&quot;through cognitive sensing&quot;) for three common environmental challenges:  narrowband interference (including jamming), spoofing and severe multipath.  Our team will use novel and unique signal processing algorithms with respect to both sensing and acting, developed on recent ESM, cognitive technology and robust navigation contracts.  BENEFIT:  In both the military and commercial market places, there is an ever expanding use of radio-based navigation devices.  Though they generally perform satisfactorily, in virtually every application there are instances where degraded accuracy or non-availability create dangerous situations.  For military applications, degraded positional accuracy due to jamming can affect the precision of a guided weapon or dismount orientation.  For commercial applications, the non-availability of GPS service inside a building can delay the arrival of emergency personnel to a 911 caller in distress.  Historically much research has been done to improve the performance of GPS user equipment, yielding great gains in positional accuracy and availability.  These activities have principally focused on improving the traditional functions in user equipment such as receiver sensitivity, reference oscillator stability, correlator speed, and signal processing algorithm performance.  To create opportunities for future large gains in performance, new approaches and algorithms will need to be applied to user equipment including aiding using other RF signals of opportunity, and cognitive radio technology.  Therefore, this research activity represents a means to provide large gains in user equipment performance vs. diminishing incremental benefits from traditional GPS user equipment research topics.  These gains can benefit the growing markets and applications in both the military and commercial sectors.",

The success of the process derives from the ability to heat a narrow band of material to a point at which its formability increases without metallurgical damage. Metallurgical examination and measurements with the Gleeble Thermo Mechanical Simulator helped validate the induction heating concept for Ti-6Al-4V alloys, nearly doubling the ductility and permitting significantly tighter bend radii than could be achieved previously. The work in Phase 2 will extend this methodology to examine induction-assisted bending of other armor materials (steel and aluminum). The performance of sections formed by bending will be compared with representative welds to ensure a balanced process comparison. Based on the results obtained for additional materials, the project team will assess the need and potential for using the process for post-bend heat treatment. Phase 2 will culminate with the bending of full thickness plate and design of a second generation system that captures Army and industrial requirements. Pending a successful outcome in Phase 2, the second generation system could be built with additional government and industrial support.",

Training data and modeling assumptions can be violated in the operational environments where the algorithms are applied. Alternatively, human manual target detection is accurate and adaptable due to the human ability to interpret data within its wider context. However, operational constraints and the overwhelming amount of data from modern sensors frequently preclude a fully manual approach to target detection. The SIG human-in-the-loop (HIL) active learning (AL) framework allows the operators to guide the training of the automated detection algorithm when the training and testing data statistics are mismatched. In this structured framework, the algorithm cues the operator using two specific criteria: detections that are high probability targets and detections that are highly informative for improving the classifier performance. The operator provides labels for the cued detections, and the new label information is used to retrain the classifier and improve the performance of the algorithm. At the conclusion of this Phase II effort, SIG will deliver a C/C++ implementation of the HIL/AL architecture that is ready for integration and test on the Shadow IED program.",

To do so, DPI suggests&quot;disaggregating&quot;the TAC function in certain applications of CAS. That is, by having engaged ground units perform some of the current Tactical Air Controller (TAC) functions (e.g., target identification and geo-location), thus freeing TACs to concentrate on functions that require a fully certified controller (e.g., assigning targets to aircraft and clearing pilots to release munitions). For the time critical portion and after the TAC has pre-approved the application of CAS, the TAC and Small Unit Commander (SUC) should be de-coupled. The system should remove reliance on any line of sight, audio, and visual cues, i.e., from TAC to target, target to pilot, from target to bomb . These cues are unreliable in poor weather and often not available in complex terrain. DPI proposes to flight demonstrate a transformational CAS system which includes a DP-12 Rhino Vertical Take-Off and Landing Unmanned Aircraft System (VTOL UAS), a small arms acoustic sensor, geo-location, laser designation, and cost-to-go mission planner.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Current mixing and casting procedures result in unwanted gradients in solid rocket motor (SRM) material properties with subsequent ballistic property variations.  Resodyn Corporations ResonantAcoustic mixing (RAM) technology is poised to revolutionize the design, development and production of SRMs.  RAM technology has the unique capability of rapidly mixing high solids propellant without using the high levels of shear that contribute to non-uniform material properties of the SRMs that are currently produced.  Additionally RAM enables a method to reduces the number steps needed to fabricate an SRM.      Uniform mixing of an inert propellant was successfully demonstrated in Phase I resulting in tensile modulus variations in the propellant less than, or equal to, 5%.  The mix-in-case concept was demonstrated for both an end-burner and a center perforation grain configuration.  A first principles model was introduced and its applicability was demonstrated.      This Phase II proposal extends the Phase I effort with more detailed evaluations of propellant formulation and grain configuration relative to ResonantAcoustic Mixing focusing upon scaling up the process and mixing in case.  Safety concerns and facility requirements are also addressed.  A method for dissemination and exchange of RAM best practices throughout the energetics community is also proposed.    BENEFIT:  RAM technologies will have significant impact at all levels of the SRM industry from laboratory development work, to engineering prototype motors, and into qualified production programs.  This technology dramatically reduces production cycle times and reduces the significance of the uncured propellant viscosity, which is currently a limiting factor that dominates current mixing procedures.  When the RAM technology is integrated into all levels of the SRM industry, the inherent benefits of using RAM technology will allow for improvements in mix quality, safety, production time and quality.",

The current project will permit this testing to be completed in approximately 3 hours, thereby dramatically improving the safety of U.S. recreational waters. It will also provide the US EPA with a means to satisfy a court-ordered requirement to reduce the time of current recreational water testing to ?same day? results.

Moreover, the CARD? technology can be used in other markets such as drinking water safety, food/beverage testing, therapeutics manufacturing, personal care product testing, and human/veterinary diagnostics. In addition, since the fully automated, portable system does not require operator input, individuals of varying skill levels will be able to easily perform sophisticated molecular assays that would otherwise have required extensive training and equipment.

This Phase II project seeks to develop a new, highly-efficient and low-cost approach to the manufacture of these materials that allows their assembly from the individual components at the nanoscale. The process produces highly homogeneous nanomaterials with increased functionality. These materials simultaneously have multiple property enhancements such as radiopacity (aiding diagnostic capabilities), high strength and durability, and improved optical properties. This technology can be further leveraged to expand market opportunities into adjacent segments where cost constraints have limited the adoption of advanced nanocomposites. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide nanomaterial composites that improve the function of dental restorations and of biomedical implants.

The compound was developed 10 years ago and shows exceptional promise as a deep UV non-linear optical (NLO) material. The sub-200 nm region is presently inaccessible for solid-state lasers, and optical components functioning at these wavelengths are limited. KBBF has excellent deep UV properties and shows great promise for laser applications like frequency doubling and wavelength mixing. A previous flux growth method for the crystals demonstrated excellent performance in deep UV lasing, but the material is very difficult to grow in the required single crystal form. Additionally, China has embargoed crystals grown by this method, as well as the process, so KBBF crystals are currently unavailable outside of China. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to continue to develop the hydrothermal method for growth of single crystals for optical applications.

Accomplishing these goals requires development of innovative new approaches to fabrication of mesoscale electronic circuitry and thin film energy storage batteries. Laser-based approaches to making very fine feature conductor patterns, vias, and mechanical structures in a variety of organic and inorganic materials commonly used in the electronics industry will be utilized. New battery chemistry will also be refined to allow fabrication of miniature, flexible, thin film batteries with energy storage densities substantially exceeding those of any battery currently on the market.

The challenge lies in the development of nozzles with beam diameters less than 100 micrometers. Several issues must be resolved due to the complexity of the supersonic, 3-phase, and microfluidic flow through micro abrasive-waterjet nozzles in which capillary dominates gravity. The required size of abrasives is so small that they tend to clump together with poor flowability under gravity feed, causing intermittent abrasive feed and frequent nozzle clogging. New concepts initiated by the company to resolve the above issues has proven to be very effective. In parallel, novel accessories are being developed to further reduce the size of features that cannot be accomplished alone by the nozzles. The micro abrasive waterject nozzles and accessories will be mounted on a multi-nozzle platform to upgrade existing waterjet equipment for micromachining and for enhancing productivity and/or integrated into a micro Jet Machining Center by combining them with a low-power pump and a small footprint platform tailored for low-cost micromachining. The broader/commercial impact of this project is the versatility of waterjet technology (&quot;5M&quot; - from macro to micro machining for most materials) is to develop a new product line of low-cost micrometer Jet Machining Centers. To meet the urgent need for the affordability of the healthcare system, commercialization of micro abrasive-waterjet technology for low-cost manufacturing of biomedical components for orthopedic implants will be explored. The micro abrasive-waterjet technology would also advantageously apply to manufacture components of green energy products and microelectronics. With global emphasis on R &amp; D in micro-nano technology, micro-nano products will be available commercially soon. The micro abrasive-waterjet technology would help accelerate maturing of that technology. By relaxing precision requirements, the micro abrasive-waterjet could readily be turned into an affordable prosumer/consumer product superior to conventional tools for fabricating art, crafts and jewelry.

Currently, removal of affected tissue must be confirmed in the pathology laboratory resulting in delays of up to 36 hours. If the residual cancer is left undetected the patient may be subjected to multiple surgeries or worse, may have a reoccurrence of the disease. This innovative technology will provide surgeons with a tool to ensure all cancer is removed, assist pathologists to help identify malignancies, and provide better results for breast surgery patients to avoid second or third surgeries. The broader impacts of this research will be the development and implementation of a novel, accurate, rapid, inexpensive, non-invasive, low power, hand-held probe that can assist the surgeon in the removal of all of the cancerous tissue and assist the pathologist in the diagnosis of specific tumor regions. Cancer is a major health problem in the US with over 1.4 million new cases and 560,000 deaths at a cost of $72 billion each year. In particular, the detection of breast cancer has serious drawbacks: cancer is hard to find in dense breast tissue, often depend on the use of invasive contrast agents, and advanced detection technologies are expensive and not available to the entire population. In addition, some types of tumors are not easily identifiable. Surgical procedures are safe only if all cancer is removed. Clearly, there is a pressing need for new technologies that would improve the detection of cancerous tissue.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a maskless photolithography system by ensuring that the patterns it writes are free of positional error (i.e., distortion) to the sub-1 nm level. In traditional photolithography, distortion minimization depends on the design and construction of an image-projection lens and on the fidelity of the mask. Measuring 1nm and sub-1nm geometric imperfections is intellectually challenging. In Phase I project, a confocal-metrology-system (CMS) was developed to determine focal spot positions from the phase of periodic signals produced when a master reference grating is scanned through the focal spots. In this Phase II project, corrections will be applied in the pattern-writing software. Errors in the X-Y position of the stage will be determined by comparing readings from a master reference grating with readings from the encoder built into the stage. Once known, systematic errors will be corrected in software through a process known as refracturing. The CMS will enable the systems located at disparate sites to reference a common fiducial, thus achieving identical patterning fidelity. The broader/commercial impacts of this project will be the potential to provide a maskless photolithography tool with high fidelity for low-volume manufacturing of custom electronics and photonics, and for future nanomanufacturing. In comparison to existing electron-beam systems, this maskless photolithography tool will provide higher throughput, non-vacuum processing, large-area continuous patterning, lower cost and freedom from distortion to the sub-1nm level.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will apply multithreading techniques to provide multi-terabyte (and larger) high-performance databases in MySQL. The company has developed a highperformance storage engine for MySQL, which maintains indexes on live data 100 times faster than current commonly-used structures. The technology solves the problem of maintaining indexes on large databases in the face of high trickle-load indexing rates. In Phase I, the company developed a multithreaded bulk loader to solve the problem of how to load data quickly. The next significant research problems for large MySQL databases are to allow online, or &quot;hot&quot;, schema changes in which, for example, an index can be added without taking the database down, and to use multithreading to speed up joins and reductions so that the large data sets can be queried quickly. In this project, the researchers will investigate the use of multithreading to support hot indexing and parallel joins reductions. If successful, multi-terabyte and larger databases will be manageable and fast on modest hardware, and the hardware will be scalable both with CPU cores and disks. The broader impact of this work is driven by faster, cheaper, lower-power on-disk storage. Organizations that have very large databases will be able to use much less hardware, both saving money and reducing power consumption significantly. Currently many application areas do not employ databases because their performance is too slow. Speeding up databases by two orders-of-magnitude can help grow the market. Currently, many organizations fail to make good use of the data they have collected because they cannot manage it, index it, or query it fast enough to be useful. Applications in finance, retail, homeland security, telecommunications, and scientific computing will benefit from improved manageability and performance. As users&#039; appetite for data continues to outstrip the availability of fast memory, organizing multithreaded queries on disk-based data for performance will continue to grow in importance.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project will develop to market a new class of assistive technologies to improve the quality of life and well being of the elderly and to reduce the overall burden of the of aging on social and private healthcare systems. The company envisions the digital transformation of the aging process through the application of emerging technologies to change the context of caregiving from a medical to a familial one. Today&#039;s telehealth solutions focus on medical aspects and ignore social and psychological needs - a sense of contribution and connection for older adults. Research has shown that social isolation significantly increases the health risks. Conversely, even small increases in perceived emotional support result in significant improvement. The proposed platform has the potential to integrate with existing Health IT and telehealth systems to provide a holistic patient-centric solution, focusing not just on medical needs, but on the emotional and social aspects of aging. Three powerful market forces intersect to create a new context in elder care: (1) Reducing rehospitalization has become a National priority, (2) New recognition that family caregiving needs to be an integral part of health care, and (3) Significant shift in age mass. One in five seniors discharged from hospitals is readmitted within the month. Research indicates that a &quot;failing support system appeared to be the most important factor of influence in this respect.&quot; The American College of Physicians now encourages doctors to recognize the value of family caregivers as part of the care plan. Supportive social ties enhance physical and mental health among older adults whereas social isolation, loneliness and stressful social ties contribute to a higher risk of disability, poor recovery from illness, and early death. The company believes that there is significant market for consumer-oriented, social-based, self-care solutions that can integrate gracefully with professional medical monitoring solutions. If successful, the effort could kick start an ecosystem of similar, emotional connectedness solutions and technologies that could positively impact the lives of the elderly, and potentially other isolated groups as well.",

        "abstract": "Multiple air/space-borne sensors can provide position and range information on boosting missiles enabling estimations of their trajectories and likely points of impact.  The earlier a missile&quot;s 3D state estimate can be constructed, the sooner the layered Missile Defense System can engage and defeat the target.  Boosting and / or maneuvering missiles pose a serious challenge to constructing the 3D state vector. A multiple sensor platform constellation will provide the most accurate tracking.  However, in the event of comlink failure, autonomous passive tracking provides a reliable backup for boost phase tracking.  Additionally, in the event of a raid launch, monocular passive ranging (MPR) provides the ability for one platform to geolocate each target in the complexity.  In short, MPR provides a desirable enhancement and essential backup to MDA&quot;s multi-platform infrastructure. The overall objective of this proposal is to experimentally demonstrate the theoretical proof-of-concept work in Phase-I.  In Phase-II OKSI will: (1) fully automate the complete MPR operations including image processing, (2) configure sensors ideal for MPR measurements, (3) deploy these sensors on HALO-I and piggyback on existing data collects, and (4) demonstrate MPR accuracy using the airborne data collected by HALO-I/II.  Finally, OKSI will coordinate with future MDA architectures including Airborne Infrared (ABIR) to assess MPR integration considerations.",

This effort will help accelerate the realization of a scalable air-to-air radar sensor solution supporting SAA functionality on a variety of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), both large and small.  The CEI team offers a unique perspective on SAA radar technology that will benefit the program described by this SBIR topic.  CEI and Ball Aerospace are currently developing a radar supporting the SAA mission for Global Hawk under an AFRL-sponsored program called USTAR: Unmanned Sense, Track, and Avoid Radar.  The team will draw from its experiences with this system to help identify and guide research into areas of component technology and alternative antenna and signal processing architectures which hold the most promise for enhancing the SWaP and performance of SAA radar designs.  BENEFIT:  CEI has developed software and hardware technologies for a variety of government programs, and the team has transitioned over 37 products to production for use in DoD and Government systems.  CEI also has experience commercializing technology developed under Government-funded programs.  Products are packaged as COTS items, listed on a catalog price sheet, supported with technical application notes and marketing materials, and made available for sale to both the commercial and Government markets.  CEI will promote technologies developed under this effort as part of its standard commercial product marketing and sales activities.  The technology enhancements anticipated under this program will reduce cost, size, weight, and power requirements and while increasing system performance.  Enabling SAA radars to operate in smaller SWaP footprints will expand the applications and market for these technologies to a wider range of commercial and Government aircraft, both manned and unmanned.  The ability to enhance commercial manned aircraft with robust non-cooperative collision avoidance capability would enhance air traffic safety.  Advanced SAA radar technologies would help make commercial applications of unmanned aircraft a reality for applications such as overnight freight transport.

        "abstract": "U.S. Navy submarines are equipped with an increasing number of actuators, including azimuth thrusters, that can enable an unprecedented level of maneuverability with a properly designed and executed control system. In this Phase II effort, Impact Technologies has teamed with L-3 Communications and Virginia Tech to continue development of an automated submarine propulsion-enhanced control (ASPEC) system to achieve highly-precise control for autonomous execution of course-keeping, mooring/unmooring, mine avoidance, and collision avoidance. The retrofit control system features an energy-shaping control system with Lyapunov stability guarantees, a nonlinear optimal control allocation scheme to ensure fault-tolerant operation, and a safety-preserving guidance system. A detailed design and integration effort will be undertaken in Phase II which will emphasize integration with existing voyage management systems (VMS). Planned simulation studies will extend Phase I results by assessing maneuverability amidst realistic sea disturbances, providing opportunities to demonstrate and quantify vehicle safety in various operating modes (e.g. station-keeping and course-following). The effort will culminate in representative field trials conducted on a mature scaled, autonomous submarine platform developed by Virginia Tech. The muli-phased effort will provide strong opportunities to demonstrate the technology to stakeholders and ensure widespread adoption of the commercialized product on board submarines and similarly-outfitted Navy vessels.",

        "abstract": "Existing secondary propulsion systems have played an insignificant role within the submarine mission profile. They are relegated to secondary missions and provide a minimal thrust profile. Reliability of these systems is also an issue since they are complicated with many moving parts and driven by external hydraulic systems. Advanced Submarine Control would incorporate COTS vector thrusters, Variable Frequency Driven motors, dynamic positioning control and situational awareness sensors. This system would provide the next generation naval platforms with mission specific capabilities ranging from enhanced littoral and minefield navigation to automated mooring and unmooring. The vector thrusters would be driven by Variable Frequency Driven electric motors which eliminate external hydraulics for auxiliary propulsion. This approach increases reliability and availability and reduces maintenance. ASC would provide potentially enormous cost of life ship savings through reduced manning requirements, elimination of secondary support cost such as tug fees accrued during mooring evolutions as well as reduction in maintenance cost associated with existing secondary propulsion mechanical control systems. Once ASC is integrated into a VIRGINIA Class Block IV the operators would have tremendous ship control especially in coastal areas and transiting rivers and bays.",

New missiles are expected to grow substantially in weight to meet increasingly sophisticated future performance requirements. To offset the expected growth in missile weight, the weight of the current steel canister must be considerably reduced.       Building on the successes of Phase I that examined potential corner designs that were able to withstand a 100 psi internal pressure load, this Phase II program will continue to develop a composite missile canister for VLS applications.

TEMPR is a cost-effective solution that is designed to leverage existing sensors in order to support the Misile Defense Agency&#039;&#039;s (MDA) goal of achieving a reliable early-intercept capability.  TEMPR will improve boost-phase ballistic missile tracking by: (1) providing accurate range estimates at ranges that are physically inaccessible to existing technologies, and (2) correcting angle measurements that are corrupted by atmospheric refraction and turbulence.  Consequently, TEMPR will significantly improve the capabilities of existing airborne infrared surveillance assets for fire control and weapon support in Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) applications. In the Phase I, Argos Intelligence developed the TEMPR models and processing algorithms and demonstrated the feasibility of the TEMPR System concept for representative scenarios and atmospheric profiles using simulated data. In the Phase II, Argos Intelligence proposes to mature and validate the TEMPR models and algorithms using real data obtained from the Missile Defense Data Center and Raytheon Corporation.

NIIRS ratings relate the visual quality of an image to the interpretation tasks for which it may be used. A General Image Quality Equation (GIQE) has been used to predict NIIRS ratings for EO/IR images from image quality parameters (for example, image resolution, sharpness, signal-to-noise ratio, etc.) measured directly from the image by the image analyst. There is considerable interest in developing NIIRS image ratings for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. A NIIRS prediction equation for SAR needs to be developed (a SAR GIQE) that would take into account both the amplitude and phase of SAR imagery and would be applicable to advanced SAR modes utilized by image analysts in exploitation of SAR imagery. This new SAR GIQE would represent multiple SAR products generated from complex, full polarization, and/or multi-pass imagery; advanced modes utilizing these imagery types include detection and recognition, coherent/non-coherent change detection, interferometric and bistatic imaging, super-resolution and ATR processing. SSCI is developing a General Image Quality Equation for predicting NIIRS ratings of SAR imagery.  BENEFIT:  The development of a NIIRS prediction equation for synthetic aperture radar, a SAR-specific General Image Quality Equation, will provide SAR system designers with a tool for predicting the performance of various SAR exploitation modes (detection and tracking, coherent change detection, super-resolution and ATR processing, interferometric imaging, etc.) prior to actually building the SAR system. This SAR-specific GIQE will provide the system designer with the ability to predict functional performance of a SAR design across both employment and scenario, thereby allowing design and procurement decisions guided by the functions the SAR supports; it will also reveal the capabilities, limitations, and sensitivities critical to determining the best use of sensor resources.",

        "abstract": "A dismounted soldier or airman who turns on his GPS receiver on the battlefield depends on a quick and accurate navigation solution, even in areas where the GPS signals may be degraded.  The intent of this SBIR program is to address this requirement by providing military GPS receivers with an external timing signal precise enough to allow direct P(Y) acquisition, greatly reducing the time-to-first-fix (TTFF) even during&quot;cold&quot;starts in GPS-degraded or denied environments.    Under this Phase II effort, NAVSYS will design the software applications required, exportable to a Software-Defined-Radio (SDR) platform, to receive an external timing broadcast, extract the 1-pps signal, and use it to initialize a&quot;cold&quot;DAGR receiver within&quot;warm&quot;start specifications.  NAVSYS will develop these applications on a software development kit for the JTRS HMS radio to allow easy transition in a Phase III effort.      In order to provide a timing signal where no external broadcast is available, NAVSYS will also design a Tactical Transmission Station (TTS) which will transmit its own timing signal (TWWV) using the 1-pps data from an internal GPS receiver.      The reduced TTFF results will be demonstrated using network (NTP), common-view (CV) and Tactical (TWWV) broadcast signals.  BENEFIT:  With an external timing signal precise enough to allow direct P(Y) acquisition, TTFF could be greatly reducing even during&quot;cold&quot;starts in GPS-degraded or denied environments.  This capability will allow the warfighter to more quickly identify his position to others in order to avoid friendly fire or to locate enemy forces.  Any ground force unit which deploys into a combat zone with SAASM GPS receivers could benefit from this application.  Stand-alone and embedded military GPS receivers are widely used in every theater of operations but there is no guarantee that a particular device will not be issued in a&quot;cold start&quot;condition, having been powered down for a significant period of time.  This application will give the warfighter confidence that his GPS receiver will come to full function quickly even in areas where GPS signals may be impacted.   Future implementation could also include applications for intelligent munitions and unmanned ground and aerial vehicles using a JTRS waveform.",

In the future, reusable solid state devices (SSDs) will become so cost effective that they will supplant magnetic tape. These devices can be reused, which will result in cost savings.

        "abstract": "Our Phase I project addressed the challenge of creating a new paradigm for the development of software in which developers evaluate the performance of software architecture and design options early when it can have the greatest impact. Our vision moves software performance analysis from an isolated set of tools that require laborious manual transfer of information among design and analysis tools to an integrated environment in which independent tools share information automatically and seamlessly.  We propose to demonstrate with software prototypes the ability to integrate heterogeneous software design and performance analysis tools using our model interoperability approach. Phase I defined an architecture and enabling technology that makes implementation feasible. The Phase II objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of automating the end-to-end process: translation of software designs from a common design notation (UML) into a performance model interchange format; using it to evaluate properties such as: hardware sizing, timing analysis, scalability; and transforming tool output into results useful for problem diagnosis. The framework will support the addition of tools in a&quot;plug and play&quot;style, thus making the environment easily expandable as new design methods, analysis techniques, and other support tools are desired.   BENEFIT:  Developers of real-time embedded and other software systems are moving to Model Driven Engineering using the Unified Modeling Language to define new systems. When developers create models of their software before building it, there is a significant opportunity to provide performance predictions for design and implementation options that they can use to select options that meet performance requirements. This will increase the likelihood that systems will meet their performance requirements upon delivery rather than fail initially and require extensive re-work to correct problems.  By automating the translation of software designs to performance models, this framework eliminates the need for laborious and error-prone manual translation. This means that performance defects can be detected and corrected early in the development process when they are easier and less costly to repair. Automated translation of designs to performance models also makes it possible to keep the performance models and design synchronized as the software evolves. It is time to make available to developers proper tools, that are easy to use, to prevent performance problems, particularly for real-time embedded systems (RTES) software where a performance failure can have disastrous consequences. Phase II work provides the foundation for one or more Phase III commercial products that could be developed relatively quickly and marketed to both the DoD and commercial clients.",

        "abstract": "The use of underground facilities has become increasingly common with organizations that seek to conceal themselves and their activities. With the increased prevalence of these clandestine facilities comes an increased need for a detection and localization capability.        Most sizable underground facilities incorporate an electrical power source and means for distribution. Power distribution engenders electrical current, which in turn produces magnetic fields, which oscillate at the AC line frequency. Magnetic fields at this frequency are difficult to shield, and their propagation is virtually unaffected by soil or ground cover. Therefore, magnetic field sensors are a logical choice for monitoring underground facilities, and have been deployed for this purpose in various forms.        QUASAR Federal Systems proposes to design and build a compact, air deployable system for localizing underground tunnels/facilities. The cornerstone of the system will be our highly sensitive 3-axis magnetic field sensor. Prior air deployable magnetic sensors have been single-axis. Measuring all 3 field components offers the capability to determine the total field magnitude and direction, thus facilitating the determination of tunnel direction and location. Seismic sensors based on piezoelectric cable sensors will be also be integrated to reject background noise and enhance the detection capability of the magnetic sensors.     BENEFIT:  The result of this project will be a system of air dropppable sensors and processing to acquire and interpret electromagnetic data for the purpose of detecting and localizing underground targets of interest to the DoD. The benefit to the DoD will be ease of depolyment, covertness, and target detection. Commercial applications exist in resource exploration and geophysics.",

This radar has enjoyed legacy success in a number of other programs and systems, and so Phase I radar development will focus on modifying the hardware to support UHF / X-Band operation, versus the existing L-Band / X-Band system.  Concurrently, FIRST RF will develop novel single aperture, dual-band UHF / X-Band antenna to interface to the radar.  The UHF antenna is based on existing wide-band SAR antenna hardware proven through programs such as DARPA and Army&quot;s TRACER programs.  It will be modified to support the simultaneous operation of an X-Band array beneath it.  The X-Band array consists of gimbaled high-gain transmit/receive apertures.  The antenna system supports the most challenging goal of designing for the smallest UAV platform available.  BENEFIT:  Immediate benefits of this lightweight Synthetic Aperture Radar technology include support for operations in the Middle East to detect buried IEDs and tunnels.  The system has been specifically designed to operate aboard the smallest UAVs in DoD&quot;s fleet, including the ubiquitous Shadow 200.  This air-vehicle has gained widespread use across the services, with additional systems, modules and capabilities continually being fielded for this vehicle.  FIRST RF is well positioned with our support JIEDDO-related activities, and so a clear commercialization potential and marketing path exist for this technology.  Extended benefits include border security and Homeland Defense, in terms of a wide-area change detection surveillance system.  This system provides day and night all weather operation, and can be flown aboard relatively quiet and low-observable airframes to support a low-probability of detection ISR system for border protection.",

        "abstract": "We propose to follow our successul Phase I development of dynamic holographic interferometry methods with work extending both DIGHI and RADHI approaches to accurately image surfaces traveling up to Mach 5. We will develop a measurement device that will be used to record high-speed holographic images of surface deformations. This work will culminate in an instrument and software capable of capturing deformations on a nanosecond time scale. A pulsed laser will allow capturing holographic images of deformations with 50 nanosecond exposures and delay of 1 microsecond between pre-event and post-event images. Our software development allows automated post-processing of data for rapid visualization and analysis. We will incorporate multi-wavelength illumination to facilitate scaling of DIGHI measurements to allow holographic imaging of deformations on the order of tens to hundreds of microns. We will further develop models for the RADHI techniques to enable accurate prediction of deformation maps from dynamic recordings of holograms. Finally, hydrocodes such as LS-DYNA will be validated against these measurements. At the end of Phase II the hardware and software developed will be combined to create an off-the-shelf instrument package for use in test facilities as well as industries requiring nanometer- and micron-scale real-time surface measurement instrumentation",

As a result, MANET administrators are forced to use wired-network management tools that perform badly in the MANET environment. Carver is a MANET management tool comprised of distributed data-collection agents and one or more visualization stations. The data-collection agents logically carve the larger MANET into a set of neighborhoods where local management data is aggregated and subsequently forwarded to the visualization station. Armed with MANET situational awareness provided by Carver, network administrators can make informed decisions about node repositioning and reallocation in order to increase MANET fault tolerance, throughput, and quality of service. The Phase II objective is to implement a TRL 6 prototype of the Carver software that reduces MANET-wide management overhead (in terms of transmitted packets) by 40% of that required for a traditional wired-network management approach.",

The value of the RQ-4 Global Hawk and the MQ-1C Warrior in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and the war in Afghanistan, has been well publicized. New, high resolution sensor payloads and an overall increase in network connectivity demand is generating more required bandwidth than existing RF/Microwave links can deliver to UAV missions. Free Space Optical communications (FSO) offer unprecedented bandwidth, but must overcome unique challenges associated with atmospheric channel fading and require precise beam steering capability to illuminate on-the-move (OTM) far-end apertures with their very narrow beams. To address this need, SA Photonics has developed the Raptor FSO Node for airborne and ground based mobile platforms. Raptor is a robust, compact, low power, and low cost mobile atmospheric FSO system that is scalable to a variety of applications. Raptor&quot;s unique approach is to operate within the atmospheric fading environment, instead of trying to correct the channel with complex and expensive solutions such as adaptive optics solutions. To achieve this goal, SA Photonics utilized the latest technologies and techniques from various fields, including optical and wireless communications, forward error correction and digital signal processing. The resulting Raptor FSO Node promises to deliver high reliability, high data rate optical communications for OTM applications.",

Our approach provided very promising results, as it was able to correlate activity patterns of known threatening entities and successfully identify over 90% of the entities in unlabeled data. For the Phase 2 effort, ACCESS will provide new and innovative tools to signals intelligence operators by providing the ability to recognize appearances of similar networks and match networks across disparate data sources, and to categorize the networks based on threat level.

As modern software systems get more complex, being made up of multiple components from various vendors, trace semantics gets harder to apply.  One way to work around these issues to apply the technologies is to instrument the communications interfaces between the components of the system. This can often be done in a passive, non-intrusive manner to generate test traces from a running system that can then be used to generate workflow models and predicate abstractions.  Our solution involves building a complete instrumented test framework comprising empirical instrumented observations. Instrumentation is non-intrusive using lightweight agents to instrument predicates via the Operating System (OS) layer and common middleware protocols. This approach enables component instrumentation without having to compile or link code with the component itself, an absolute need in today&quot;s distributed system-of-systems comprising of disparate OS&quot;s, languages and interfaces. The agents transfer predicate values to the Control GUI over an open API to allow third-party agent development and deployment. The GUI records the instrumented data in a Database.

This prototype has proven that RAM can measure wind speeds with greater than 2% accuracy and with a signal-to-noise ratio better than 10. The theoretical estimates have shown the optical Doppler signal is amplified by the cavity gain medium, enabling a much higher (~10^3) signal-to-noise ratio than traditional laser-based systems. Simulations for determining the optimal emitter size showed that an emitter radius larger than 2.5 cm is sufficient to achieve carrier-to-noise ratio of nearly 1000 at 15 m from the laser using 1550 nm laser wavelength.

        "abstract": "The objective of this proposal is to develop a robust hand-held, tool for inspection of non-metallic armor while the armor is still mounted on ground vehicles. Impacts of sufficient energy, including those which are routine, like impact with road hazards, and handling incidents can damage the armor without visible condition indicators. The extent of repairable damage from ballistic projectiles can also be difficult to determine by visual inspection. In-situ inspection permits condition assessment without returning the vehicle to a depot, and permits assessment of individual armor applique panels without committing the vehicle to depot maintenance. This reduces maintenance cost and improves overall availability. The system will employ a patented microwave scanning device which has been demonstrated to be effective in examining non-metallic armor. The system is in use in the laboratory and field environment, and a Prototype Wireless Hand Held System was created and delivered under Phase I of this SBIR Topic. TARDEC has a laboratory instrument and is testing the prototype system delivered in Phase I. It is the design starting point for this project, which will incorporate lessons learned in Phase I, and deliver 6 Prototype units for field testing. The field experience with the second generation prototype units will be incorporated in a rugged, robust design, which will include a manufacturing specification suitable for procurement. The patented scanning process utilizes microwaves as an interrogating beam to image the volume of a dielectric material. The microwaves are reflected at areas of changing dielectric constant and combine with the emitted signal to form an interference pattern. This reflection returns voltage differences which are measured by the receiver and displayed to indicate the presence of a potential defect, damage or internal structure of interest. The system will enable the user to easily and with fidelity determine if there is damage to the panel while the panel is still attached to the vehicle. The system will also store the data and can export the data in a conveniently accessible format. The proposed technology has been identified by the Stryker Program as an opportunity to reduce operating costs. The letter of support from the Stryker Program office is included in this proposal. It states, in part,&quot;The approach being developed under this project could result in a significant savings in time and cost as well as insure that Stryker armor protection and crew survivability are maintained throughout the vehicle&quot;s lifecycle.&quot;In support of Phase II, PMO Stryker BCT will provide suspect armor panels as well as access to Strykers to demonstrate the effectiveness of the scanners. As indicated, this technology has an excellent potential for application to the Strykers as well as other combat vehicles with ceramic armor panels. The project has advanced through Phase I with active support by Associate Director for Survivability, Tank, Automotive Research Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) and TARDEC staff, who indicate interest in the resulting technology.

To date, POC designed the complete MiRHyC, including housing, dielectric inserts, and electrical and optical contacts. This design was validated using finite element analysis and optical simulation. A housing prototype with an outer diameter of 0.625 in. and mated length (excluding strain relief) of 1.25 in. was fabricated, mounted onto hybrid cables, and tested to withstand&gt;364 lb of tensile load. In Phase II and Phase II Option, POC will optimize the MiRHyC design; assemble and test prototypes; conduct validation tests and demonstrate a technology readiness level&gt;6; develop a preliminary production method; and deliver&gt;2 prototypes to the Navy as per SPAWAR&#039;s letter requesting a revised Phase II proposal.",

        "abstract": "The primary objective of this proposal is to implement an autonomous swath bathymetry survey capability aboard an unmanned undersea vehicle (UUV) using a hybrid sonar that combines the high spatial resolution of a focused multibeam echo sounder in a sector spanning +/-30 deg about nadir with the long range mapping capabilities of a bathymetric sidescan sonar for a total swath angle of up to 160 deg (swath width roughly 11 times the UUV&#039;s altitude above the bottom). This represents a better than twofold improvement in swath bathymetry coverage (hence survey efficiency) over existing solutions that rely on a multibeam sonar system alone, and it fills the near-nadir data gap typical of systems that rely on a bathymetric sidescan sonar alone. In addition, high-resolution acoustic backscatter imagery is obtained concurrently with the bathymetry, thus alleviating the need for a separate imaging survey. In both sonars, dynamic focusing will help constrain the vertical uncertainty associated with each sounding. Likewise, high across-track data density for each ping will provide the redundancy necessary to constrain horizontal uncertainties and resolve navigation offsets. For each ping, the achieved swath coverage will be defined at the across-track limits where sounding uncertainty exceeds a prescribed threshold.",

Current methods require a detailed visual inspection either through engine disassembly or with a borescope. Furthermore, this process becomes increasingly difficult as engines and airframes become more and more integrated, as the access to necessary points on the engine becomes limited. As a result, this constitutes a time consuming and very expensive approach towards obtaining the needed information.  Prime Photonics, LC (PPLC) is in the process of developing a real-time, in situ, foreign object damage (FOD) detection system for use in operational turbine engines.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address a current limitation in manufacturing of electronic devices. At the heart of electronic device manufacturing is the production of printed circuit boards (PCBs), which provide the mechanical support and electrical connection for electronic components. Many reliability issues associated with electronic devices result from non-uniformities in the electrodeposited copper on the PCBs. The drive for improved electronic device performance has necessitated shrinking PCB feature dimensions and increasing complexity of features, which has exacerbated this problem. The objective of this project is to develop sophisticated electrolyte flow schemes that will specifically target manufacturing issues associated with shrinking feature sizes and increased PCB complexity. The development and optimization of these sophisticated electrolyte flow schemes will enhance PCB reliability as well as improve manufacturing throughput for next generation electronic devices. The boarder impact/commercial potential of this project is the production of robust,lower cost electronic devices, which are found in a vast number of end-products,including critical defense, monitoring and safety systems used by the US government and military. The market for electronic devices, estimated to be about a $1.3 trillion dollar industry, is formed by various sectors including computer and office equipment, communication equipment, portable and consumer electronics, medical and automotive electronics. This technology specifically addresses the manufacture of printed circuit boards, a critical component of all electronic devices, which were estimated to be a $53.6 billion market in 2009. A large commercial driver for the ElectroCell technology is the ability to manufacture PCBs at a higher rate, improving throughput and lowering manufacturing costs. This will translate into lower cost electronics for consumers.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop an imaging based monitoring system for the piercing process used in the manufacturing of seamless steel tubes based on the feasibility proven in Phase I. Piercing is the core process of the near net-shape manufacturing process for seamless tubes, which are crucial materials in many critical applications ranging from energy to chemical, automotive, aerospace, and infrastructure. However, being the primary cause for tube wall variations and internal surface quality issues,piercing is rarely investigated due to the lack of proper sensing means. There is a need to improve the piercing process efficiency for higher product quality and lower costs with new sensors. The proposed innovation consists of a set of imaging sensors for measuring the vibrations of the part being pierced. The vibration signals are used for system conditions monitoring for the detection of critical failure modes. The new approach was validated on selected tubes. Further development is proposed to support the commercialization of a new piercing-monitoring system. This project will be carried out by a team of industry-academia collaboration in 24 months. A site-tested prototype will be delivered. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is substantial. This project represents a unique approach of multi-model sensor fusion to controlling a highly stochastic and non-linear process. If commercialized, it may improve seamless steel tubing manufacture through reduced mill downtime, fewer setup pieces, and tightened tolerances, thereby reducing the pollution emissions and costly energy consumption associated with remanufacturing or reworking out-oftolerance products. Industry-wide adoption in the tube industry could yield drastic reductions in waste byproducts and cost savings of $250 million per year. Scientifically, the proposed research could have an impact on the adoption of emerging high dimensional data analysis techniques. The proposed project carries strong educational implication due to the close working relationship with the academia. Social impact is also expected with this project in improved energy preservation and environmental protection. The estimated benefits include energy savings of 3 terawatt-hours and reduction of 300,000 tons of carbon-equivalent emission and 260,000 tons of toxic waste per year. The estimated market size for the proposed iPPM system is $15 million in the US and $200 million globally. Beyond the piercing process, the success of the project will also provide generic modeling and analysis tools for systems with complex information.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop next-generation supercritical CO2 metalworking fluid (MWF) technology for highly demanding metal forming applications. The approach is to deliver specialized environmentally-friendly lubricants with supercritical CO2, achieving tool wear rates, forces, and surface finish at least as good as aqueous-based MWFs that are currently in use. It is anticipated that a much smaller amount of MWFs will be required with this technology. The formulation of new supercritical MWFs and the optimization of flowrates of oil and CO2 for metalworking processes will be studied. The patented supercritical CO2 system (so-called CHiP Lube) will be evaluated in real industrial settings to confirm its capability to replace current MWFs. The effectiveness and efficacy of CHiP Lube system will also be scaled and applied to other common industrial metal working processes such as rolling, extruding, and cutting. The broader/commercial impacts of this project will be the potential to provide an environmentally-benign lubricant system as an alternative to conventional MWFs with equal or better performance and lower cost. At any given time, approximately 2 billion gallons of MWFs are in use in the U.S.A. This represents a massive waste stream that must be treated and remediated. Plus, the negative effects of MWFs on worker health and safety are well documented. The components of CHiP Lube are naturally occurring and used in extremely low quantities. Therefore, the waste treatment and worker health concerns are minimized. CHiP Lube has been demonstrated in simple metal removal applications as providing lower tool wear and/or higher machining speeds than conventional MWFs, thereby leading to a lower overall cost of manufacturing. In addition, no carbon dioxide will be produced to run the process, as the CO2 used in the process will be recovered from other industrial processes such as ammonia and ethanol production.",

Current dewatering technologies (e.g., centrifugation and chemical flocculation) are energy intensive and require chemical additives that can contaminate the oil, resulting in prohibitively high costs to concentrate bio-algae for fuel production. The Phase II program objective is to develop, scale up and integrate the FARADAYIC ElectroConcentration and ElectroFlotation Processes with Harvesting, Dewatering and Drying (HDD) technology being developed by our strategic partner, Algaeventure Systems (AVS), to quickly and efficiently dewater bio-algae.

There is an urgent need for improved genotoxicity assays for safety screening in drug development. The process by which drug compounds are usually screened is expensive, time-consuming, and often does not provide an accurate depiction of in vivo behavior. Phase I of this project developed a full-thickness skin model that can be used in a range of toxicological assays. Phase II will address the limitations of current genotoxicity assays by incorporating fluorescent reporter constructs into the 96-well skin model to create an assay that is high-throughput and accurately distinguishes between classes of genotoxins. The broader impacts of this research are to develop a genotoxicity screen that is more informative, accurate, and high-throughput than existing alternatives. Development of accurate in vitro assays not only reduces the need for animal testing, but can also reduce the risk to patients included in clinical trials by providing better predictions of the human response. Toxicity has become one of the leading reasons for product failure during drug development. The ability for this assay to identify and eliminate harmful compounds earlier in the development process could significantly reduce the costs and accelerate the timeline of drug development.

        "abstract": "The work described herein is designed to take the two unique switch technologies invented in Phase I to the technology level necessary for manufacturing to customer&quot;s specifications. The single-shot explosive driven dielectric puncture switch employs a unique electrically initiated explosive primer developed for applications in firearms and through modification uses the gases generated on detonation for driving an anvil into a switch consisting of metallic shim and dielectric film. The switch is capable of high voltage, high current, high energy applications. The second switch is a miniature sealed gas spark gap consisting of Elkonite electrodes and a ceramic body. In phase I, it was shown that Elkonite electrodes could be bonded to the ceramic switch body and sustain internal gas pressures in excess of 1500 PISG. Switches were pressurized both with Argon and Hydrogen. Prototype sealed gas switches have retained pressure for about 4 months with no loss of performance. In phase II, we propose to fully characterize the performance of each switch, develop life statistics, discover failure mechanisms and from the investigation establish a methodology to design a low cost switch to a customer&quot;s specifications.",

        "abstract": "When a system-of-systems is distributed across the Global Information Grid (GIG), cooperative planning is largely achieved through ad-hoc information sharing, using basic network protocol capabilities, including fire-and-forget mechanisms such as email or similar&quot;manual&quot;forms of electronic file exchange, across a Disconnected, Intermittent, Limited (DIL) communications network. These methods are inherently non-real time, limited in the scope of information that can be communicated, and have significant potential for errors due to manual communication methods. Given the limitations of the DIL communication networks, a capability to eliminate the potential for errors in manual communication methods, reduce the time and manual effort involved, and perform machine-to-machine synchronization is required in lieu of the manual, out-of-band, unreliable and minimal capability in place today. Collaboration Mission Planning applications exchange several information types, with the most common being&quot;Resource Management&quot;,&quot;Alert Management&quot;,&quot;Force Management&quot;,&quot;Track Management&quot;and&quot;Sensor Metrics&quot;. Command and Control Alert Management Services requirements will be used for the first article prototype, with transition to the USW-DSS Program.

Our approaches overcomes all the major hurdles in high power 2um  fiberoptic device fabrications without trading-off of optical performance as well as size and weight.  By using thermally matched materials, our high power 2um fiberoptic devices are designed to be operated in harsh aerospace environments with exceptional longevity. As a technical demonstration, fiber pigtailed isolators have been fabricated in this program to withstand up to the peak power of 2.3 kW at 2um and pulse energy of 312.8\u00b5J. In Phase II, we will continue to improve the isolator high power handling capability and meanwhile demonstrate the prototype of high power modulators and switches for high power 2\u00b5m fiber laser applications. The program leverages on Agiltron extensive commercial high power fiber optic component manufacturing expertise and seeks to realize attributes that are beyond what having been possible. The developments are in close collaboration with Lockheed Martin for early defense application insertions.  BENEFIT:  This program addresses the lack of commercial high power fiberoptic components operating at 2um.  The availability of these components enables the realization of highly desirable high-power, high-efficiency infrared fiber lasers for various military applications, including missile countermeasures, high-resolution, long-range target identification, and remote sensing of biological or chemical agents to develop devices.

        "abstract": "To increase confidence that software is secure, researchers and vendors have developed different kinds of automated software security analysis tools. These tools analyze software for weaknesses and vulnerabilities, but produce massive data with many false positives. Further, the individual tools catch different vulnerabilities, often with little overlap. The NSA tested five static code analysis tools and found that 84pct of the vulnerabilities were identified by only one tool. These results point to the need to combine and correlate the results of multiple tools to ensure comprehensive vulnerability analysis. However, the disparate interfaces and non-normalized results of each tool make correlation of their results taxing to the software developer. The Secure Decisions Division of Applied Visions Inc. is developing a Software Assurance Analysis and Visual Analytics platform that integrates the results of disparate software analysis tools into a visual environment for triage and exploration of code vulnerabilities. Software developers can explore voluminous vulnerability results to uncover hidden trends, triage the most important code weaknesses, and show who is responsible for introducing software vulnerabilities. Visual analytics focus the user`s attention on the most pressing vulnerabilities. By correlating and normalizing data from multiple tools, the overall vulnerability detection coverage of software is increased.",

        "abstract": "Efficient detection of small objects from a distance is an important military application.  The need for such systems is justified through the IED detection problem alone.  This is because IEDs have become a predominant weapon used in asymmetric warfare.  For example, it is believed IEDs are responsible for approximately 40% of coalition deaths in Iraq.  IED detection is challenging as they are typically small, easily deployed, and easy to conceal.    The IED detection problem is sufficiently difficult that no single, existing remote sensor can effectively detect IEDs.  This is because no single sensor has the characteristics needed to overcome all aspects of the IED detection problem.  That is, no one sensor: has a high search rate; can detect buried objects; has sufficient resolution.    However, while no single sensor currently displays all these properties, there are groups of sensors that do.  This research proposal describes the methodology we will employ to design and evaluate an IED detection test bed.  The input to the test bed will be various types of RF and EO sensors.  These signals will be processed and the resulting output will be detection masks overlaid onto the areas surveyed by the sensors.     BENEFIT:  Completion of this effort provides the DoD new methods for the detection of small objects from standoff.  Similar needs exist within other sectors including law enforcement and other government agencies such as US Border Patrol and the Department of Homeland Security.",

        "abstract": "Attitude control of antenna pedestal platforms traditionally require costly inertial navigation systems to provide signal referencing to the pedestal&quot;s rate gyros.  This is primarily due to the rate drift that is inherent across all gyro technologies. Fiber Optic Gyros offer excellent drift and sensitivity performance, with up to 1000 times better bias stability than the best MEMs gyros, and have practically no G-sensitive bias. However, until now, high performance FOGs were very large, expensive and consumed significant power as they must precisely control their fiber-coil temperatures. Such devices are not practical for use on smaller antenna pedestals. SA Photonics has developed key FOG technologies that enable the development of small, high performance gyroscopes that do not require costly temperature stabilization systems. To address the Air Force&quot;s requirement for highly stable attitude determination of antenna pedestals, SA Photonics is pleased propose the Phase II development of small, low power, highly stable  3-axis FOG. This FOG will enable highly stable and accurate pedestal pointing over extended periods without additional sensor systems or external signals such as GPS, to correct for gyro bias drift.  BENEFIT:  The high accuracy, small size and low power SA Photonics proposed 3-axis gyro allows it to be applicable to multiple military applications. Those noted in this proposal include antenna platforms on multiple UAV&quot;s and ground mobile hosts, satellite antenna platforms,  advanced missile interceptor platforms such as THADD, and man portable systems such as JETS targeting system.

Due to this enormous increase in complexity, dynamism, and heterogeneity, it is becoming critically important to develop the capability to characterize the current state of software systems in a way that can be easily understood by novice users and administrators and provide them with automated/semi-automated recovery actions to stop and/or mitigate the impact of cyber-attacks.  In this Phase II SBIR, AVIRTEK will build three ASPS prototypes; test their capabilities in capturing the state of the applications, representing the current states, visualizing the states, and proactively protecting the managed applications and services. AVIRTEK will tailor and deploy the ASPS prototypes in diverse environments/markets and it will perform various types of testing and evaluation. The three prototypes will target the following three environments: industrial control systems, wireless ad-hoc networks, and enterprise environments.",

To address this problem, we developed a preliminary architecture for Cognitive Patterns which includes Cognitive Patterns Knowledge Generation (CPKG) and has the ability to connect to various knowledge-based models, multiple sensors, and to a human operator. CPKG is a knowledge-based system that can understand, adapt to, and intelligently act in novel situations that are not accounted for by the knowledge base implementers, and can do so without much involvement from the human operator. The CPKG system comprises three major internal modules: Pattern Generation, Perception and Action via Vertical Blends and Adaptation via Horizontal Blends. These enable it to create situationally-relevant abstract patterns, match sensory input to a suitable abstract pattern in a multilayered top-down/bottom-up fashion, similar to the mechanisms used for visual perception in the brain, and generate new abstract patterns. The main benefit of Cognitive Patterns is that it will allow for a special class of robots that show a high flexibility in decision making and minimize the need for human effort and intervention.",

The new novel flame holder concept clearly demonstrated an improved LO/LBO performance pver the conventional V-Gutter flame holder. A three-flame test rig which consisted of a gas-generator, spray bars, and test section was also designed and fabricated.

Such an LBO improvement will increase the static stability margin and allow the engine to operate at lower perssure with stable flame. This will enable widen the flight envelop and/or increase thrust for the same stability limit as that of the V-Gutter flame holders by reducing dry pressure losses. The novel concept is already being considered by an OEM of military turbine engines for transitioning it into one of their engines. This novel concept will also be of greate interest to Other OEMs to which it will be marketed at the end of Phase-II. b",

        "abstract": "Presently, there is an increase need for materials that exhibit strong nonlinear absorption for various military applications. In addition, materials with the following characteristics are desired:  variable band gap, a cut-on wavelength of 0.4 through 1.4 micron, and a linear transmission greater than 98 percent from the visible (0.4 micron) through the NIR/SWIR (0.65 through 3 micron). In Phase I, we investigated Cd1-xMgxTe and Cd1-xMgxSe for their usefulness in optical switching applications. These materials have nonlinear absorption in the wavelength range from visible to NIR, and possibly extending to SWIR. Phase II work will further investigate the growth of IIA/B-VIB ternary materials with a goal of standardizing and optimizing the growth procedures that produce device quality crystals. The major challenges in producing and processing these materials include: the highly reactive and corrosive nature of group II A elements and II A- VI compound melts; the phase diagrams of these II-VI materials are not very well understood, and the purity of commercially available group II A elements is only 99.9% which is not adequate to make semiconductor grade materials. As the end result of this Phase II work, we will be capable of producing material that can be directly used as passive optical switching.  BENEFIT:  Presently, numerous military and commercial systems utilize the mid-wave infrared (MWIR) spectral region for target detection. Unfortunately, a significant amount of spectral information is oftentimes lost because of weather or other environmental conditions. As a result, many systems are utilizing the visible (VIS) to the short wave infrared (SWIR) spectral regions. This has lead to an increase in the need for materials that can provide filtering across multiple broad wavelength regions and have the ability to filter out unwanted information.  The materials proposed in this research can be engineered to meet these requirements. Applications include optical limiting, eye and sensor protection, optical pulse shaping, information processing, and laser mode locking.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innvation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an Integrated Circuit (IC) authentication system as a countermeasure to the growing counterfeit IC problem. The goal is to leverage the extremely compact form factor of a patent-pending Micro Mark two dimensional (2D) direct part marking technology to apply permanent, unalterable, unique identification codes to individual IC packages. These codes will be generated from a centralized database then marked onto individual ICs such that they can be read and verified with the database throughout the subsequent supply chain to ensure traceability and authenticity. This Micro Mark technology is small enough (&lt;25um) to fit on the vast majority of IC package form factors and provides sufficient code density to allow serialization. The broader/commercial impacts of this project is to prevent the adverse effects of Integrated Circuit (IC) counterfeiting. ICs are a critical in the design of all electronic products and as our society becomes more and more dependent on electronic products for personal and business use it is important to ensure the correct operation of these products. This authentication system will enable manufacturers to ensure that the ICs they are deploying on their manufacturing lines are the authentic product. This system will also provide additional savings to the industry by reducing or eliminating the costs of manufacturing rework and product recalls due to counterfeit ICs. Moreover, as U.S. military electronic equipment has been infiltrated by counterfeit ICs, this authentication system will provide the systemic approach to stop the infiltration and preserve the performance of these military systems as they were designed and intended. As the technology matures, other industries which demand strict inventory control and efficient product recall (e.g. defense, pharmaceutical, legal, and forensic sciences) could also benefit from the Micro Mark Authentication System.",

        "abstract": "Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) across the services need the capability to operate in civil airspace.  Currently, the lack of Sense and Avoid (SAA) technology is the largest obstacle to this capability.  The SAA problem is all the more challenging when dealing with non-cooperative traffic. It is increasingly becoming clear that a suite of sensors is needed to provide a total solution. Electro-optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors are attractive because of their size, weight and power (SWaP) characteristics. However, range estimation using EO/IR has, in general, some degree of inaccuracy associated with it. Radars can be used to complement them but they may not meet the SWaP constraints of smaller RPA. A well-designed ladar has the potential to efficiently complement EO/IR SAA technologies. During Phase I, UtopiaCompression, in collaboration with SAIC and University of Dayton, designed a novel SAA ladar solution for RPA to complement passive EO/IR sensing. The design feasibility has been shown through high fidelity ladar sub-system as well as integrated system level modeling and simulations. In addition to accurate ranging to intruders, the ladar can also be used to reduce the false alarm rate of passive EO/IR solutions. Phase II will focus on further design optimizations and prototype development.  BENEFIT:  UtopiaCompression&quot;s (UC) system will greatly benefit the Air Force and in general the Department of Defense (DoD) by enabling RPA to operate in a wider region of the airspace as well as take on more challenging missions. Wider access to the airspace is needed for training, security and surveillance and in general to execute missions efficiently. Looking beyond the DoD market, the Department of Homeland Security will also benefit from this technology.  They now use the Certificates of Authorization (COA) process to get limited airspace access, but this is not viewed as operationally sustainable, especially as DHS deploys RPA assets to more challenging venues such as the southwest border.    As its effectiveness in avoiding collisions is demonstrated, UC anticipates a move in the commercial aviation industry to adopt the technology as a pilot advisory system.  This is similar to what happened with T-CAS (Traffic  Collision Avoidance System), a cooperative system for avoiding collisions based on exchanging data through transponder signals.  T-CAS was conceived as an autonomous technology, but eventually adopted as an advisory system because the pilot in command is ultimately responsible for seeing and avoiding traffic as he executes maneuvers.  All revenue traffic (airliners etc) now carry T-CAS.  Similarly, SAA technology, which can detect non-cooperative traffic over a much larger volume of sky than a human and is never distracted, will improve pilot situation awareness and therefore flight safely.  As economies of scale bring the price down to the T-CAS range and test data begin to demonstrate flight safety improvements, it seems reasonable to expect the FAA and commercial aviation entities will adopt technology.  SAIC will support the transition effort for SAA Ladar technology.  SAIC is well-positioned to bring the ladar technology to a level of maturity where it will be of interest to RPA program offices and prime contractors. Additionally, as UC has formal business relationship and collaborative arrangement for other SAA technologies with Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC), UC will work with NGC to transition the proposed Sense and Avoid Ladar for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles technology to the RPA programs by inserting the technology into the existing SAA transition plan now being ably executed by NGC. The UC team will maximize the likelihood of successful transition by working closely with Government stakeholders throughout the Program process.    The largest catalyst for growth in the RPA sector has been, and for the next few years will continue to be, the government&quot;s trend toward information warfare and net-centric systems. A senior analyst with the market research company, Teal Group, Steve Zaloga, identified RPA as a&quot;key element in the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) portion&quot;of this trend, with expansions into other missions expected, as well, with the advent of hunter-killer RPA.  Worldwide RPA expenditures are expected to more than triple over the next decade from $2.7 billion annually to $8.3 billion.  U.S. defense spending on RPA is projected to increase more than two-fold in the next decade, from $2 billion annually to $4.5 billion. Analysts anticipate that a civil market for UAVs will emerge more slowly over the next decade, beginning with government organizations with missions and needs similar to military RPA such as coast guards, border patrol organizations and similar national security organizations.    Beyond military applications, the UC team believes that critical traction is being gained through the efforts of this SBIR program in a primary market with broad economic potential  the RPA market. The combination of UC&quot;s Sense and Avoid Ladar, passive ranging (without the need to maneuver) and the cloud detection and avoidance technologies will provide far superior SAA capabilities for RPA than that which is currently available. This is an important enabling technology because despite a large degree of interest in RPA for a multitude of governmental and commercial purposes, adoption has been slow due to a number of technological and regulatory barriers. One of the most important remaining regulatory and technological barrier to broader adoption of RPA, both in government and commercial venues, is the certification of a system of technology, feedback, analysis and control which can reduce the risk of air to air collision down to that of a manned flight. The technology developed by UC for this SBIR program constitutes a critical enabling technology for removing this barrier. The UC team envisions adapting the resultant technology for ground applications in the future, including Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and OEM automotive electronics applications such as adaptive cruise control (ACC), collision warning and headway control - a lucrative market that reached a size of $810 million in 2007.    UC team is determined to demonstrate success with the Air Force as an initial customer and expand to other service branches and agencies.  During Phase I, phase II development and beyond, the UC team will work closely with the Air Force Research Laboratory, Air Force Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) and SAA prime contractors to transition the technology.",

During Phase I, FIRST RF took an aggressive engineering approach which included antenna modeling, prototyping, and measurement in the installed environment. Phase I ended with a prototype tri-band antenna which meets nearly all the RF requirements of the program. Phase II is focused on optimizing the RF performance, shrinking the height of the antenna by combining apertures, and ruggedizing the antenna for the harsh ground operational environments. The technology is based on FIRST RF&quot;s very successful line of ultra-wideband antennas used for ground-based electronic warfare (EW). By combining apertures, multiple antennas can be fit into the 82&quot;height requirement. In addition to the RF performance of the antenna, the proposed design uses a custom-designed spring-base to dampen vehicle dynamics and a ruggedized radome. Lessons learned from delivering over 130,000 antennas to the field will be applied to this JTRS GMR program.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The purpose of this project is to develop and demonstrate, validated and verified software that will allow realistic blast pressures to be replicated in a completely Lagrangian simulation while minimizing the impact on overall run time and capturing pertinent effects within cluttered environments.  These effects include non-spherical explosive charges, moving explosive charges, strong shocks, reflections, and shadowing.  During Phase I, RHAMM Technologies, LLC successfully developed a prototype user-defined load (Rhammload blast2), compatible with LS-DYNA&quot;s Lagrangian mode, which is capable of modeling all the effects outlined in the original SBIR topic.  We have also shown that test data and hydrocode simulations are available to validate the new blast load code.  In Phase II we will strive to verify the Rhammload blast2 software; validate the Rhammload blast2 software; optimize the Rhammload blast2 software for speed and efficiency; document Rhammload, describing the installation, usage, and theory; update all existing JASPO-developed LS-DYNA threat models; add the ability to use a tabular reference blast; and extend Rhammload further by incorporating features such as the ability to handle shock diffraction around corners and improving blast pressures on yielding structures.  BENEFIT:  Benefits of this technology and the proposed approach include the military benefits of enhanced survivability for our aircraft.  Rhammload will provide to an analyst, for the first time, the ability to model realistic blast effects in an all Lagrangian simulation allowing faster runtime and larger, more complex simulations not previously possible with pure Euler or coupled Euler-Lagrange methods.   In addition, this project will produce updated versions of all JASPO LS-DYNA threat models that take advantage of the new Rhammload.  This will directly improve the survivability of future aircraft.  Mainstreaming the computer aided testing (CAT) concept in the survivability community will also be a benefit of this proposal.  Enhancing aircraft survivability is not just either a simulation or a testing issue.  To get the most survivability for your dollar, you need both.  You need fast running high fidelity simulation (like Rhammload can provide) to help choose the most beneficial tests.  You need realistic, well instrumented tests to ensure you&#039;&#039;re capturing a&quot;real world&quot;survivability picture.  Finally, you need to use the test data to validate additional simulations of excursions from the test scenario.     RHAMM&quot;s strategy for commercialization is straightforward. We have two options that we will pursue.  First, RHAMM Technologies will endevor to sell or license Rhammload to LSTC for inclusion into LS-DYNA. Alternatively, we will sell the userload directly to other companies as an add-on module for LS-DYNA.  Second, the intellectual capital that will be amassed through the completion of this work will enable RHAMM to play a significant role in supporting programs engaged in computer aided testing or threat modeling. This role could yield several million dollars as a welcomed commercialization result with substantial growth probability. Phase III will be focused on enhancing the Phase II Rhammload software to better model non-military threats (explosions not created by munitions).  This would make Rhammload an important tool in guaranteeing the safe handling of explosive materials (fuel tanks, paper dust, mine safety studies, etc.) as well as Homeland Security issues like improvised explosive devices (IED).",

We will demonstrate both a Planning workstation called a Multi-Level Manager (MLM) and an Operating Environment (OE) capable of receiving control plane instructions sent to AMF JTRS radios and forwarding those instructions to simulated software defined radio components in cases where the total set of single-level component destinations spans multiple classification levels.

We call the new MLS embedded system the OE, and we refer to the resulting integrated AMF JTRS radio system as the prototype system.",

PRA will utilize data collected by the Army Research Laboratory Compact Radar to design and analyze clutter identification algorithms that utilize signal statistics in a rule-based algorithm to distinguish between clutter and target returns. The Phase II PRA algorithm approach will essentially identify salient statistical features that separate targets from clutter and a functional methodology that implements these features. The primary focus for Phase II will be integration and test of the PRA clutter mitigation and identification algorithms. PRA will team with ICx Technologies, Inc. and integrate the clutter mitigation and identification capability into the ICx STS-4400 Radar and demonstrate the improved performance in a live demonstration in Phase II.

        "abstract": "Development of crack resistant conductive gap-fillers fits within the Air Force&quot;s goal of investing in low observable maintenance improvements to reduce sustainment costs and aircraft downtime.  Commercially available gap-fillers are initially effective, but performance degrades under thermal and mechanical fatigue resulting in micro- and macrocracks within the matrix. Phase I showed the feasibility of formulating more durable elastomeric matrix resins capable of delivering the required conductivity and fatigue resistance. A 50-fold increase in fatigue crack resistance at 73oF was obtained with the materials developed compared to the commercial gap-fillers tested. The same gap-filler material tested a -65 degrees F showed improvement of 75 percent in crack resistance.  The combination of mechanical and thermal fatigue generates the most aggressive stresses for gap-fillers on aircraft, where temperatures within the range of -65 degrees F to 250 degrees F are experienced.  These stresses occur because of differential thermal expansion and modulus changes in the gap-filler material. Additional testing will be conducted in Phase II to replicate these stresses in the laboratory to determine durability over a range of temperature-stress profiles. The elastomeric gap-filler matrix developed during Phase I will be further refined and fully tested for qualification. The project team assembled includes a major gap-filler producer and airframe manufacturers.  BENEFIT:  Mitigation of cracking within gap-fillers will benefit many modern fighter/bomber platforms by reducing maintenance costs and downtimes. Commercial aircraft could potentially benefit as well from the development of high endurance sealant matrix materials.",

The CB protective garments worn on top of an FR protective uniform could severely limit the mobility of the soldier and cause fatigue. To defend against this deadly combination of threats to soldiers, especially in harsh environments, it is highly advantageous to provide a single layer, light weight, multi-purpose fabric for a garment to provide barrier against fire, water/ liquid and chemical and biological agents. This universal combat garment would serve for daily use and would be designed to be significantly lighter in weight and allow considerable air permeation for comfort in hot climates. Consisting of a single layer fabric design with lightweight construction, it could travel easily in a cargo pocket onto the battlefield. The main objective of this SBIR Phase II project is to develop a single layer nonwoven barrier fabric against the FR and CB threats for use in universal combat garments as opposed to combining two separate layers of woven or knitted barrier fabrics through stitching. In this Phase II effort, Nanosyntex&quot;s approach will be to design and develop a fully bonded, single layer nonwoven composite barrier fabric using all high performance inherently Fire Retardant (FR) fibers having excellent flame and thermal resistance on the inner and outer surfaces bonded to a woven or nonwoven fabric of CB protective barrier fabric made using activated carbon fibers and/or nano-fibers inserted into the middle of the overall structure. This unique multi-tiered composite will be hydroentangled via a spunlace process to produce a single fabric with good breathability, comfort and hand.

Traditional approaches used to render complex objects depend heavily on the offline processing of abstract data in order to put it into a form that is acceptable to the chosen run-time system. There are fundamental disadvantages to this approach including loss of abstraction, increased I/O bandwidth requirements, reduced performance due to CPU-based algorithms, and an inability to efficiently and easily incorporate new data or modifications to existing data. While this approach was ideal in the context in which it was originally developed over 20 years ago, today it is being stretched to the limit of what is practical. This has resulted in the evolution of what was once a great improvement over previous approaches into what is now a typically very costly process for visualizing synthetic environments. The technology we will develop in Phase II will seek to address each of these shortcomings by employing an innovative approach to run-time dynamic database construction and rendering.",

        "abstract": "RF signature requirements for modern aircraft are driving the need for conformal window for future sensor systems. However, limitations on optical systems and physical properties of optically transparent materials currently limit the geometry of current windows and window assemblies. Novel material systems developed by Surmet combine different materials (e.g. ductile metal etc) into structures that combine transparency with structural integrity. Surmet&quot;s ability to incorporate metal and internal structures into ceramic windows holds out the promise of creating Structurally Reinforced OmNi-functional Geometric (STRONG) windows for future aircraft applications.    In the Phase I program, Surmet has demonstrated a ~ 2 fold increase in the toughness and strength of base ALON by additions of a second phase metal. Other unique structures enabling use of several high energy-absorbing reinforcements (metallic, polymer or elastomer) with either ALON or Spinel have also been demonstrated. In Phase II, Surmet proposes to refine and transition this effort to develop full sized toughened ALON or Spinel windows. The reinforcement properties, dimensions, spacing will be well controlled to simultaneously provide desired transmission (~80%) and structural properties viz strength of&gt;500 MPa and fracture toughness of ~5 MPa.m0.5. The newly designed structural windows should provide sufficient deterrent against high velocity threats.    BENEFIT:  Successful completion of this program will result in a fabrication of structural and optically transparent ceramics with OmNi-functional capabilities. The commercial opportunity for this technology may extend to the fabrication of other specific applications for transparent ceramics, such as for smart windows, sensors, specialized equipment for chemical processing, equipment, etc.",

Creare is developing a Small Hole Measurement System (SHMS) that provides fully automated, real-time measurement of the geometry of laser-drilled holes.  During Phase I, we developed a proof-of-concept prototype and demonstrated extremely accurate characterization of the geometry of a range of both conventional and laser-drilled holes.

Key challenges that will be addressed include: the limited real estate available on the soldier platform to accommodate antennas, the impact of the ballistic armor plates on the antenna performance, and the need for the antenna to function in the presence of the soldier&quot;s fighting load and other load bearing item such as a backpack and Camelback. Careful attention will also be paid to the quick release safety features of current body armor such that the antenna system does not hinder emergency doffing of the vest.

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses the key issue in the normalization of software assurance information, how to integrate the vulnerability findings reported by multiple vulnerability detection tools. The normalization will provide normalized, consistent reporting on type of identified weakness (alignment with CWE) as well as normalized, consistent reporting on location and trace of identified weakness within code (source or binary). The project will build upon and extend the results of several recent government-funded programs in the area of software assurance. The phase II R&D effort will utilize phase I deliverables and accomplishments to complete the project and deliver (1) an open-standard-based Run Time Tool Output Integration Framework (TOIF) and (2) the integration of several existing open source vulnerability detection tools into this framework. This will mitigate one of the major practical gaps with today`s software assurance tools, the non-overlapping findings of the current tools and will enable cross-examining the vulnerabilities reported by different tools, something that is currently very dependant on human verification and therefore very laborious. This would enable using multiple vulnerability detection tools in a coordinated manner. The anticipated results will be made available to the community (as open source) of tools vendors, leading to further improvements in vulnerability detection tools through normalization of their outputs, better alignment with existing standards, and better exchanges of software assurance information.",

The proposed Phase II work discussed here is predominantly focused on a laboratory demonstration of the pulsed discharge stage to be carried out by subcontractors Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company and HY-Tech Research.  The experimental and analytic campaign described here will culminate in the required demonstration of heat transfer out of our pulsed discharge cooler stage of 50kW over 20 hrs or more. Modeling improvements are planned to address more fully the electrodynamics of ionization within the device, the role of NOx ions, and non-local transport phenomena.  We are also coupled with a diagnostic effort to allow the validation of the air chemistry code.  The experimental campaign will begin with low voltage assessments of our proprietary cathode in vacuum and extend these to full level operation in vacuum and in air.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed at developing an effective, inexpensive, safe means of controlling diseases in farm-raised catfish. One of the biggest problems in farm-raised catfish is disease that occurs in commercial ponds. Scientists at Auburn University discovered strains of natural bacteria that can be applied to fish feed to control the most common diseases. Lucigen is developing rapid, simple tests capable of detecting these diseases before the fish get sick. The goal is to combine these ideas to develop commercial products to rapidly diagnose and treat the most common catfish diseases. The broader impacts of this research are 1) the preservation of an important industry in economically disadvantaged regions of the rural southeastern US and 2) protection of an increasingly important food source. Since yields of most wild-caught fish are declining, farmed fish are becoming an important food source and an important industry throughout the world. Fish diseases in aquaculture ponds cause losses of up to half the fish before harvest, costing billions of dollars worldwide, and there is no satisfactory means of controlling most of these outbreaks. Antibiotics, vaccines, chemicals or controlled feeding are all prohibitively expensive, harmful to human and environmental health and/or bad for yields. The detection and control of catfish diseases, the immediate focus of this project, addresses the $20-30M in annual losses caused by disease. Longer term, similar biological control systems should be applicable to other fish species in the US and the rest of the world.",

        "abstract": "In recent decades, advances in electronic components have led to smaller devices that generate significantly more heat per unit area. The processes by which waste heat is removed are less efficient, and the system must operate at higher temperatures. Magnet wire is a key component of many of these devices, and the durability of the insulating coating is critical to operation at elevated temperatures. Additional stresses on the wire insulation also come from the use of high-frequency, pulse-width-modulation control schemes. The integrity and lifetime of the magnet wire coating are therefore directly related to system performance and reliability. In previous work, Ultramet developed a rapid, low-cost method of applying oxide, nitride, and carbide interface coatings to carbon and silicon carbide fibers at low temperatures (as low as 100 degrees C) through ultraviolet-activated chemical vapor deposition (UVCVD). In this process, ultraviolet energy is used to decompose coating precursor gases at much lower temperatures than when thermal energy is used alone. The low temperature process has clear advantages over alternative coating methods because it is not line-of-sight and therefore can uniformly coat intricate shapes such as individual fine fibers. In Phase I, Ultramet established the initial feasibility of a continuous magnet wire coating process using low temperature UVCVD for applying a boron nitride high temperature insulating coating on copper wire. BN is an excellent electrical insulator. Although the potential exists to increase the insulating properties and use temperature of organic wire insulators to some extent by adding a BN powder filler, a much greater impact on electrical component use temperature can be achieved by using a pure BN layer. The non-optimized wire insulation coating applied in Phase I was shown to provide effective insulation at temperatures up to 370 degrees C. In Phase II, Ultramet proposes to further optimize the coating for maximum use temperature using low-cost processing and to demonstrate practical application within a high temperature electrical component, in conjunction with a commercial component manufacturer.",

        "abstract": "To address the Air Force need for a new technique for automation of aircraft skin attachment and assembly and Outer Mold Line (OML) control, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposed and successfully demonstrated in Phase I a new metrology system for precise thickness measurements of composite panels and fast measurements of steps and gaps between the panels in the aircraft assembly, utilizing a Low Coherence Interferometric Scanning System (LCISS). The innovation in the LCISS design enabled OML measurements with better than 0.001-in. accuracy and with the required production line operation speed. Based on the demonstrated manufacturing readiness level (MRL) 4, POC proposes to continue development to achieve MRL 7 at the end of Phase II. The proposed system will consist of four major components: LCISS measurement systems to measure step and gap between panels on the F-35 center fuselage; a handheld automatic composite skin-thickness measurement system; software to integrate the thickness measurement system with the LCISS step and gap measurements and calculate the correct shim size for each fastener hole; and optical projection systems mounted on the assembly stations to provide guidance to the assembly technicians projecting button thickness directly on the aircraft at each button location.  BENEFIT:  The proposed development will facilitate achieving the required production rate of military aircraft with significant reduction of required labor and improved assembly quality. In addition to fabrication of military aircraft, the LCISS system will find applications in the assembly of commercial aircraft, ship building, automotive industry, and other industries, where the automation of the assembly process allows for the reduction of component manufacturing tolerances. This system will reduce the manufacturing cost by simplifying the assembly process and reducing labor cost.

Drilling of these holes with current technology can be costly and difficult leading to (a) not enough holes, (b) holes without the proper shape, and (c) defects in the thermal barrier coating resulting from post processing.  ps Lasers have been shown to make very nice shaped holes in the primary material, Hastelloy-X, while maintaining the integrety of the thermal barrier coating.  However, ps pulses lack the high intensity to greatly reduce the machining time, or are incapable of mm depth scales.  Femtosecond pulses do not have any of these limitations, and have enough intensity to drill to cm depths.  Also due to the broadband nature of femtosecond pulses, Optical coherence tomography (OCT) may be used for monitoring depth and possibly the shape of the hole drilled.  BENEFIT:  With rising gas prices, energy savings are critical.  Better cooling holes in turbine fan blades may increase fuel economy for all military, and potentially commercial aircraft.  Small gains in efficiency can have a high dollar value per year in total fuel consumption.

        "abstract": "The Hall thruster propulsion system consists of the thruster/cathode, propellant system and the power electronics.  The power processing unit (PPU) represents the largest fraction of the system dry mass.  In addition, the delivery time, cost of radiation hard electronics and issues regarding pre-launch fuel storage make it difficult for electric propulsion systems to meet the needs of responsive space missions.  In Phase I we addressed the Air Force need for a propulsion system that is both operationally responsive to a launch command and operationally responsive on-orbit.  Busek demonstrated the feasibility of a shift from the traditional architecture of electric propulsion systems.  The approach leverages our flight qualified low power Hall thruster technology and a simplified power processing architecture using a multi-functional auxiliary power converter.  In Phase I we also investigated the technical feasibility of an iodine fueled thruster as a means of reducing the stored propellant tank mass and volume.  Iodine is stored at atmospheric pressure in solid form at three times the density of xenon.  In Phase II we will conduct a comprehensive electronics design and packaging study and build a proto-flight level PPU.  The PPU will be integrated into a flight like system with an exiting thruster and flow control valve.  A hot fire system demonstration will be performed.  In Phase II we will also conduct additional proof of concept tests using iodine propellant.  At the conclusion of the program the integrated system will be delivered to AFRL for extended duration testing.    BENEFIT:  The AFRL IHPRPT Program is investing in the development of long life low power HET systems.  A key technology identified in the Beyond IHPRPT study is an extremely long life, low mass variant of the BHT-200 and BHT-600 HET systems.  The multi-functional converter concept is attractive for its reduction in overall propulsion system mass complexity and cost.  Hall thrusters have also been identified as a key technology for NASA&quot;s vision of space exploration.  NASA missions beyond Earth orbit can be enabled by the wide throttle range and broad Isp-thrust operation of Hall thrusters.  A study conducted by the SMD ISPT Project in 2004 confirmed the significant potential of EP for space science missions, including orbiters about Pluto, Neptune, and Uranus; rendezvous/return with Kuiper Belt Objects and primitive bodies in the outer Solar System; and extensive surveys of major asteroid groups.    Commercial satellite manufacturers; SS/L, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Orbital Sciences have all shown a strong interest in low power HET systems for primary propulsion on LEO spacecraft and station keeping on GEOSats.",

        "abstract": "In support of the H53-K&quot;s CBM/SHM initiative under SBIR topic N05-011, IEM&quot;s INSU (Integrated Networked Sensor Units) system demonstrated the ability to detect and track strains in laboratory components at high rates of speed, store them onboard or transmit them wirelessly. This has included the demonstration of an innovative high-speed sensor networking architecture for wireless sensor nodes, an ultra low power 2-D strain gauge, and prototypes of power harvesting devices. The INSUs offer considerable flexibility through modularity (e.g., swapping out sensor boards while retaining the main sensor core). NAVAIR, through PMA-261, indicated that similar capability was very much desired at a smaller form factor. In this Phase II.5 activity, IEM will develop the&quot;IntelliPenny&quot;sensor node, a literal penny-sized sensor node which will sacrifice the flexibility to focus on CBM strain monitoring exclusively, but retain the other key features of the INSU node. The IntelliPenny will incorporate a power harvesting or simple, robust wireless recharging method to eliminate the need for maintenance on these devices, which will record data in flight at high speed to detect both long-term and transient strain on rotorcraft components and transmit it only after landing to a central HUMS data collection system.",

        "abstract": "The principal aim of this program is to develop non-toxic corrosion resistant coatings to replace cadmium for tailhook applications on the Joint Strike Fighter. These coatings need to be dense, effective at preventing corrosion of the substrate alloy, and applicable onto non line-of-sight component regions. Cadmium replacement coating compositions explored in this work are aluminum based alloys deposited using an advanced physical vapor deposition technique which allows the generation of aluminum alloy coatings with uniform composition, high coating density and a relatively low modulus to promote coating adhesion. The deposition techniques employed also enable coating deposition onto non-line-of-sight areas of complex components. Corrosion testing and electrochemical screening was used in Phase I to identify and demonstrate coatings with promising corrosion resistance. During the proposed Phase II effort, work will be performed to further develop and optimize novel coating compositions for tailhook substrate alloys and characterize coating performance through qualification testing. Process optimization for the coating of tailhook components utilizing DVTI&quot;s production scale coating facility is also envisioned. A significant outcome of this study is the establishment of non-toxic corrosion resistant coatings and coating processes that provide the required corrosion resistance while reducing the usage and exposure to toxic materials.",

These technologies support both single mode and multi mode fibers and waveguides, are compact with small footprints, lightweight, support hundreds of channels, and are optimized for use in extreme aerospace environments tolerating the effects of shock, vibration, temperature, humidity, pressure extremes, and EMI effects.  Connectorized versions allow for simple removal and replacement of cards in the box, and are both tolerant of contamination and readily cleanable.  Finally, these devices are capable of low insertion loss, low crosstalk, and broad spectral performance.  Specialized versions are optimized for a number of specific functions.  The Phase-II effort includes further design, optimization, and demonstration of the technologies. The optimization is performed with extensive input from AFRL personnel, government users, and DoD Prime Contractors.  BENEFIT:  The anticipated benefit from this research is the creation of a family of high performance intra-box optical-interconnect devices that both decrease system size, weight, volume, and cost as well as increase system reliability and maintainability.

        "abstract": "Hypersonic propulsion systems are characterized by high Mach number gas flows over vehicle surfaces and internal ducts. The flow often includes shock waves, shear layers, vortices, and separated flows. The ability to measure surface quantities such as pressure and skin friction on a hypersonic inlet model would provide increased insight into the complex flow characteristics that govern inlet performance. Unfortunately, nonintrusive sensors require optical access that has been difficult to obtain. Optical sensors for measurements of pressure (Fast Pressure Sensitive Paint), skin friction (Surface Stress Sensitive Films), and velocity (Particle Image Velocimetry) offer non-intrusive measurements on surfaces and in flows, exactly the capability that is needed to study hypersonic inlets. Unfortunately, the size of the cameras and light sources that are used in these systems have precluded their use in regions like an internal duct. During the past several years, camera and LED technology has evolved dramatically resulting in small packages for both imaging and illumination. Combining this new hardware with state-of-the-art optical technology for fast PSP, S3F, and PIV measurements will result in a set of sensors that can be miniaturized and utilized for non-intrusive measurements of pressure, skin friction, and velocity in traditionally inaccessible regions of the model.  BENEFIT:  There is considerable interest in measurements of unsteady pressure, velocity, and skin friction for evaluation of computational models and study of flow physics on hypersonic inlets, compressors, artificial hearts, and other wind tunnel models and flows with limited optical access. This system will provide advancement of the state-of-the-art in this field as the proposed research will develop a system for the measurement of continuous distributions of skin friction and pressure, and velocity in the flow, using a miniaturized imaging system for data acquisition. This miniaturized imaging package, and the associated tools should be useful for a variety of fluid studies from hypersonic inlets and low speed wind tunnels to biological flows.",

        "abstract": "UAVs must also operate over civilian populations; this imposes strict safety requirements.  Traditionally, developers verify and validate entire software systems as a whole.  This ensures that a problem in a non-critical component does not impact a safety-critical component.  Unfortunately, testing the entire system is cost prohibitive, especially since it requires retesting when there is any change in any component.  RTI proposes to develop a&quot;mixed-criticality&quot;separation middleware that allows building systems from independently-certified components.  We will base our work on the widely-adopted Object Management Group (OMG) Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard, extending it to separate communications by levels of criticality.  As the leading DDS vendor, RTI is uniquely qualified to deliver and support this important technology.  We will also work with top partners.  Verocel, the leading provider of expertise and services for Software Verification, will provide tools and expertise to ensure that we build a certifiable design.  Wind River Systems, the leading real-time operating system vendor, will ensure that our design works with separation kernels.  Boeing, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon will ensure practical application.  This team will deliver a quality, certifiable architecture that works on real UAVs.  This proposal will enable new UAV mission capabilities at affordable cost.  BENEFIT:  RTI was founded on the premise of successfully commercializing advanced research. RTI enjoys a 100th Percentile DoD SBIR Commercialization Achievement Index (CAI), placing it in the top 1% of companies receiving SBIR funding. Our basic strategy has two facets: (a) Providing research to AFRL will further the overall UAV flight control community&quot;s effort to speed the adoption mixed-criticality technologies, thereby increasing general market demand for RTI products and services. (b) This research also will help in the certification and acceptance of our own&quot;RTI Data Distribution Service, Safety Critical Edition&quot;product offering. RTI Data Distribution Service, Safety-Critical Edition has been designed to the rigorous standards for safety certification, but is not yet certifiable. The overall market for this technology is emerging. To date, several commercial vendors are supplying pieces of the overall solution. We see our domain expertise, product performance, and customer support as primary differentiators between our potential competitors and us. We expect the proposed work done for this mixed-criticality SBIR effort will have applicability to both commercial and government unmanned system customers. Our architecture will let developers assemble precertified distributed components on an advanced UAV. It will support mixed-critical components and information flow, enforcing tightly controlled interactions. The final system will enable lower cost, lower power, smaller UAV designs that can execute complex missions. Most importantly, it will enable piecewise certification without requiring recertification of the entire UAV. This mixed-criticality distributed architecture will transform UAV designs.",

Testing will consist of evaluating the embedment of conductive media and other portions of the developed embedded power system in both static and dynamic loading and temperature ranges. Recurring labor and qualitative manufacturing data will be collected during manufacture of the full-scale article which will be used to evaluate cost and developed manufacturing processes compared to traditional approaches.  BENEFIT:  The need for structurally embedded signal cabling is primarily being driven by the U.S. defense industry for future aircraft development programs.

The first technique is a photogrammetric method wherein sequences of store drop images, obtained from a system of high-speed cameras, will be used to compute store position, velocities and accelerations. The second method is an onboard store micro-telemetry system, consisting of a pair of 3-axis linear accelerometers to obtain the 6-DOF movement of the store model that will be transmitted back to a receiver. The store release is synchronized with a series surface pressure transducers that enable the determination of the flow state at the time of release and during the entire drop event.

        "abstract": "This Phase II effort will demonstrate a standard method of measuring the high-temperature, inter-laminar tensile (HT-ILT) strength of ceramic-matrix composites (CMCs). Jet engines with higher turbine gas temperatures for higher specific thrust and efficiencies require the use of SiC/SiC CMCs with known mechanical properties at high temperature (2300  degrees F). The typically poor ILT strength of CMCs containing 2-D woven fibers imposes artificial limits on the design of hot section components. The method is needed by engine developers to avoid the expense of over-built airfoil components, particularly rotating components. It would not only help determine the design limits of CMC materials, but also aid the discovery of ways to improve ILT strength. Furthermore, HT-ILT testing could be used to screen materials for processing defects and qualify them for service (i.e., quality assurance testing as well as studies of material fatigue). The program will extend the room-temperature method, ASTM C1468 for ILT testing of CMCs, to testing at =2400  degrees F, by demonstration and validation of a new ceramic-based adhesive capable of 6 ksi strength at high temperatures.",

The alloys currently used for Navy helicopter masts (such as 4340 or 9310) provide high strength but offer limited corrosion resistance, and are typically coated (and re-coated during overhaul) with toxic cadmium plating. S53 is a new ultra-high-strength, corrosion-resistant steel developed by QuesTek with its proprietary Materials by Design development process. S53 is commercially available from two U.S.-based suppliers and has received industry certifications, including SAE (AMS5922) and MMPDS approvals. In applying S53 to rotorshaft masts, QuesTek will further develop the surface hardening process developed during the Phase I effort to accommodate gears, splines, bearings and other hard contact points. QuesTek will also produce demonstration components that will be manufactured with the inclusion of the new surface hardening process.",

Extension of the single modulator design with an innovative subranging architecture has a potential performance leap (&gt;30dB) in signal-to-noise ratio and spur-free dynamic range. The subranging ADC concatenates the ranges of a coarse and a fine ADC through an inter-range interface, which presents implementation challenges due to its inherent complexity. Advances in mixed-signal design concepts for the inter-range interface during Phase I, propelled by the imminent transition to the faster and denser next generation Josephson junction circuit fabrication, now enable realization of the a subranging ADC with 20 dB dynamic range enhancement. We propose to design and develop a series of subranging ADC chips of increasing performance during Phase II. Each chip will include two ADCs and an inter-range mixed-signal interface. This will be followed by construction and delivery of complete receivers in Phase III. Recently, we have made significant advances in demonstrating and delivering complete receiver systems by combining superconductor chips with other cooled and un-cooled electronics to Navy laboratories.",

        "abstract": "This reseach addresses innovative techniques that will provide robust multi-sensor (infrared and radar) classification tools to assist the operator&quot;s rapid and accurate classification of ships and small boats in the littoral.   Radars employing Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) processing have been employed by the Navy in numerous radars for ships classification at ranges greater than 30 NM while imaging infrared (IR) systems classification ranges are nominally less than 5 NM. When within range and during clear weather, the IR system usually provides for more robust classification than the ISAR; however, the airborne platform must expend both time and fuel to get close enough to classify with the IR. To minimize this loss in time, platforms like the MH-60R and the future Fire Scout have radars onboard with ISAR capabilities to prescreen the contacts at long range before the decision is made to fly in for a closer examination with the IR.  As these systems fly toward the potential threat vessel, the number of pixels on target increases in the IR system to the point where it can sense the vessels shape and motions even before it is within full classification ranges. This information can potentially be used to improve the ISAR&quot;s classification capabilities even at these extended ranges. As the platform gets even closer the simultaneous obtained IR and ISAR can be fused together to provide the operator with additional information for making the critical decision whether to engage the threat vessel with weapons.",

Prototype hardware that triggers these revolutions is delivered under this project. A radio and its antenna have been necessarily collocated since their invention more than 100 years ago. The length of radio-antenna connections is limited by Ohmic loss in the coaxial cable and this limitation gets rapidly worse as the operating frequency increases. The short radio-antenna distance creates two limitations that are ingrained in tactical communications doctrine: (1) Tactical communication links are truncated by obstructions and terrain, while Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) links require satellite communications (SATCOM) equipment. (2) Survivability of a modern command center is degraded by its antennas, which declare&quot;Here I am!&quot;to everyone with eyeballs or direction finding (DF) equipment. The JTRS JPEO has an opportunity to radically revise these two limitations by extending the existing GMR system with new RF-over-fiber technology. The proposed effort develops RF-over-fiber links for the GMR system and delivers two sets of prototype hardware.

The results will be displayed in a multi-dimensional trade space that considers the cost, schedule, performance, and risk.  At the heart of the framework will be a Human Performance Assessment Tool that can be tailored based on the level of system design knowledge available at different stages in the acquisition life cycle. Existing cost systems and models will be leveraged and integrated with FTI&quot;s affordability tool infrastructure to minimize development risks and costs.

The proposed approach centers on defining an enhanced, UIML-based user interface design process, and then defining tool support needs for this process. The intent is to span the gap between usability and object-oriented software engineering by supporting rapid prototyping of user interfaces for usability engineering, while providing the ability to generate object design data for the overall system&quot;s object model and tactical HCI code for deployment. UIML and its associated tools form a bridge between the user interface designer and the application modeler, allowing early and frequent integration of the user interface design process and the application development life cycle.

One major challenge is insuring that the human-technology interfaces for these systems eliminate as much as possible the heavy performance cost of context switching which occurs when personnel attend to different missions or tasks or respond to alerts and warnings. In Phase I, Infoscitex designed the Support Environment for Automatic Context-switching User Experience, or SEACUE, a tool to help automate the selection and display of task-relevant context for human-system interfaces. The key to the approach is a deep understanding of both the nature of context in user interface design for Navy applications and of the domain in which the user interfaces must operate. In Phase II, SEACUE will be fully implemented as a functional prototype and tested within the USW DSS application environment. Ultimately, this tool will produce highly effective interfaces that minimize the disruptive effects of context switching across Navy applications.",

In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of the SMILA system by measuring the velocity of unidirectional airflow in a laboratory environment with accuracy of within 2% in the velocity range 04 miles per hour. Additionally, less than 2 cm spatial resolution at 10-ft measurement range was achieved with the prototype using only 6-mW laser power.

We will carry out all necessary tests to qualify the new material as flight-hardware.

The process is compatible with established CMOS manufacturing infrastructure and has the promise of much lower cost than competing approaches. The measured quantum efficiency at 1064nm demonstrates a 30x improvement over incumbent technologies and the demonstrated detector performance exceeds detectivities of 1x10^14 Jones.

        "abstract": "Ultra Short Pulse (USP) laser technology offers compelling capabilities for the defense, medical and material processing industries. The development of this technology into commercial devices has been limited mostly by the size, cost and pulse energies provided by current USP laser systems. Fiber-based USP lasers have dramatically decreased the size of this technology, but the amplification of high energy pulses is still necessary to achieve the desired success for commercial USP laser devices. Power scaling of fiber lasers and amplifiers requires increasing the signal mode size to avoid nonlinear impairments and optical damage. Established approaches to scalability are inherently limited since the signal mode becomes progressively more unstable with effects such as mode competition and scrambling as the size increases. As described in this proposal, the capability to scale fiber amplifiers beyond the 100 pulse range, in a single polarization state, with high beam quality and in a compact form factor is achieved using higher order mode (HOM) propagation. Higher order modes have demonstrated scalable mode size with a high degree of stability in passive fibers. They are also fully compatible with existing or enhanced all-glass pump combiners and fiber fusion and assembly techniques. This program seeks to further advance the state of HOM fiber amplifiers, as well as develop the associated components to handle the high energy pulses generated by the amplifier.",

This coating technology will serve as a replacement for MIL-PRF-85285 paints and has demonstrated compatibility with MIL-PRF-23377 / MIL-PRF-85582 primers. Throughout the design process, the interrelationships between coating porosity / thermal insulation, aerospace environmental durability and spray depositability were continuously optimized to produce thermal barrier coatings that may be used with MIL-PRF-85582 primers to protect aircraft surfaces from high temperature engine exhaust (&gt;350 oC). The principal objectives of the Phase II SBIR program are to demonstrate optimized coatings meet MIL-PRF-85285 durability requirements, protect aircraft structures from mechanical deterioration / fatigue effects resulting from cyclic exposure to high temperature engine exhaust and may be integrated within military aircraft in place of MIL-PRF-85285 paints for greater component lifetimes and lower life cycle costs.

        "abstract": "Although the turbine engine has revolutionized both military and commercial aircraft, future requirements for more capable, durable, and cost-effective aircraft systems can only be achieved through even greater advancement in propulsion capability. Necessary performance improvements for turbine engines include increased thrust, lower fuel consumption, and reduced emissions by means of higher operating temperatures; reduced weight; improved durability; and lower development and procurement costs. Innovative design and manufacturing concepts in combination with the use of the advanced high-temperature materials are needed to achieve the higher operating temperatures necessary for greater engine efficiencies.  The development effort for a Ceramic Matrix Composite (CMC) Low Pressure Turbine (LPT) Blade is addressed through the development of a series of net shape or near-net shape subcomponent preforms that are designed, fabricated into CMCs, tested, and analyzed. Each subcomponent design is an integrated engineering effort where analytic modeling approaches capable of predicting the effects of design features and manufacturing processes on component performance and durability are developed and validated by thermal/mechanical testing. The approach breaks down the complexity of the LPT Blade geometry into a series of independent material and structural problems with special attention paid to the development of robust and cost-effective manufacturing processes. The effort culminates in the manufacturing of several prototype LPT Blades for spin test evaluation.   BENEFIT:  The development of a CMC LPT Blade will enable performance improvements of increased thrust, lower fuel consumption, and reduced emissions for turbine engines by means of higher operating temperatures.  The advancement will inherently benefit both military and commercial turbine engine applications.  The greater understanding of CMC materials, behavior, and test methods will enable more efficient concurrent designs and facilitate additional applications of these high temperature materials.",

        "abstract": "Sonobuoys are used in marine surveillance to provide information regarding detection and classification of marine vessels by employing acoustic sensors. However, there are situations, particularly in littoral environments, in which the efficacy of acoustic sensors can be significantly compromised. In these instances, some level of performance enhancement may be possible by using supplementary sensing techniques such as electromagnetic sensing. Current electric-field sensors, used for detection and classification of marine vessels, collect only horizontal electric-field measurements. A sonobuoy capable of also collecting vertical electric field measurements would enable exploitation of all electric-field signals emanating from a submerged vessel. These signals may be particularly useful in environments in which the quality of acoustic data from traditional sonobuoys is compromised. QUASAR Federal Systems proposes to develop an innovative underwater E-field sensor appropriate for collecting vertical E-field measurements over a large effective aperture that can be integrated with sensors that measure the horizontal E-field components. The vertical E-field sensor will be a low-cost design suitable for scale-up to mass production.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This proposal describes hot section radar sensors and data processing algorithms that address the technology gap between NSMS and strain gage vibration surveys.   The radar-based approach provides data that can be processed in the time and frequency domains to accurately track blade vibration down to very low levels.  With this new capability to directly measure blade vibration frequency, the work in this project becomes the enabling technology for a hybrid NSMS system.  The hybrid NSMS relies on existing NSMS measurements of turbine blade vibration amplitude and extends that capability with direct frequency measurements from the radar system.  The work in this project will be planned, performed, and reviewed in close cooperation with the Propulsion Instrumentation Working Group (PIWG) and its member companies.  This lays the groundwork for a transition path for this technology, establishing a modular upgrade to existing turbine NSMS systems in use by gas turbine manufacturers and government turbine test facilities.    BENEFIT:  Improvements in blade health monitoring capability will significantly reduce the cost and risk of development and operation of military and commercial gas turbine engines, industrial steam turbines used for power generation, as well as many types of industrial compressors and expanders.  The costs associated with maintenance, downtime, and readiness are already well established and understood by both military and industrial users.  The technology plan has been developed to allow a smooth transition, as an add-on module to existing systems.  This leverages the existing NSMS infrastructure, and removes some potential barriers to technology transition.  By designing the system to meet the requirements of the PIWG community, demonstrating the improvement to existing NSMS systems in that community, and validating the system with laboratory and engine tests, Mechanical Solutions is confident that a successful technology transition will occur.",

        "abstract": "This document presents Optical Sciences Corporation&#039;&#039;s Phase II SBIR proposal for the design and fabrication of a prototype infrared (IR) projection system for wide field of view (WFOV) sensor testing in a cryogenic-vacuum environment.  The WFOV IR projector system will be capable of projecting complex scenes overlaid with precision unresolved dual-band targets, which cover a wide FOV and have a wide temperature range, high spatial resolution, high temperature resolution, and highly correlated multi-band spectral output.  The innovative technologies developed in the Phase II for WFOV sensor testing including infrared fiber coupled semiconductor lasers for dual-band unresolved targets and a cryogenically operated digital micromirror device (DMD) for resolved extended background scenes optically combined using an infrared rear-projection screen.  The engineered rear-projection is the key technology for efficient image combining for complex scene projection for into a WFOV broadband collimation optical system providing a highly correlated multi-band spectral output over a large FOV for space sensor testing.  BENEFIT:  The advanced WFOV cryogenic-vacuum compatible projector system developed under this effort will be used in government and contractor electro-optic test facilities for the simulation and testing of advanced space-based IR sensors.  Other commercial spin-off applications include testing of WFOV imaging IR sensors used in the homeland security, medical imaging, police surveillance, fire fighting, and collision avoidance systems. At the subsystem level the infrared rear-projection screen, fiber coupled quantum cascade lasers, and cryogenic operating DMD will alone provide new commercial avenues.  The rear-projection screen operating in the infrared offers a new method for scene combining making it conceivable to tile large format scene to produce ultra-high resolution infrared scene projections.  Larger formats greater than 2000 x 2000 or even 4000 x 4000 could be developed and successfully marketed.  MWIR and LWIR emitting semiconductor lasers are in great demand for gas analysis and spectroscopy.  Fiber coupled lasers operating in this&quot;fingerprint&quot;region of molecular absorption could be valuable tools for exploitation in new portable devices. Finally, the biggest pay-off from the Phase II effort for OSC would be the successful development of a cryogenically operated DMD.  Developing this capability would allow OSC to add this option to its line of IR scene projectors for IR testing in the laboratory or in the field marketing to domestic and foreign defense and aerospace industries.  In addition, a cryogenically operating DMD would lend itself to many infrared spectroscopy applications performing as a digitally tunable broadband grating.",

During the phase I effort, RSI demonstrated a decrease in firing energy of 40% using the new ULEEFI initiator and a new bridge design.  The ULEEFI is capable of delivering timing accuracies, which allow multi-function output capabilities in the warhead design. Reynolds Systems ULEEFI initiators employ the use of RSI-007 explosive, a CL-20 based explosive that was developed under a SBIR with the Navy. The RSI-007 has unique energy characteristics including short run up to full detonation and extreme energy density, making the explosive an excellent choice for compact weapon systems. RSI -007 can also double as both an input material and a warhead output material.

Prototype demonstration hardware was developed through the course of this project that permitted Nova Sensors to perform side-by-side performance comparisons with existing FLIR units currently in service by the United States Air Force at Edwards AFB. Under the Phase 1 SBIR project, a new sensor control architecture was implemented to continuously optimize the operation of the infrared focalplane array (IRFPA), the critical sensor component at the front end of the FLIR system, so as to maximize the pilot&quot;s display contrast over the full range of operational temperatures.  A prototype infrared camera system (hardware and software) was developed at Nova Sensors for this purpose; it was taken to the USAF Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB and testing was performed on this unit to verify that it was indeed producing optimized MWIR FLIR sensor data.  The proposed Phase 2 effort seeks to commercialize this approach using two independent means and further the technology development by utilizing all-reflective optics and enhanced fixed-pattern noise reduction techniques to achieve background-limited performance (BLIP).   BENEFIT:  Significant improvements in the quality of MWIR video imagery over that produced by imaging systems currently in service by the USAF will be obtained by using the improved imaging systems produced in this project.  Literally thousands of existing systems are currently fielded and these improvements have the potential to dramatically increase our warfighter&quot;s ability to sense their surroundings.

Our solution will be robust even against anticipated future drive features and drives modified by criminals to have certain anti-tamper properties.  This is important as it is nearly certain that manufacturers or criminals will develop such countermeasures to systems not designed with such foresight.  Examples of related technology include modern flash drives which employ encryption, authentication, and anti-tamper technologies, like the IronKey (www.ironkey.com), Seagate Full Disk Encryption, and others.  We will design our system to be user friendly: specifically, it will illustrate exactly what must be done with a given drive.  Law enforcement personnel will access and copy password-protected hard disk drives quickly and with confidence in maintaining evidence integrity for later prosecution.  We envision an expanded market of state and local investigatory organs which will benefit communities by placing the resource close to more searches in order to obtain timely clues to related criminal efforts.  Indeed, such functionality will be needed in the future as more sophisticated criminals use computers to organize their enterprises.",

Government agencies temporarily share access to their logical systems, often during critical times (e.g. emergency events) but must do so in a way that protects both against system misuse and privacy concerns. Queralt`s service is based on open ratified standards that facilitate scalable interoperability between agencies. This service protects against system misuse by increasing the security options of policy creators, to include location-based attributes. \n\nDuring Phase II, Queralt will deliver an end-to-end Identification Management (IdM) prototype which gathers location of the person requesting access to the logical system, and formulates a request from the enforcement point to the decision point, with appended user location coordinates.\n\nQueralt will develop and test market a Policy Enforcement Point, and location-based service which can be deployed and seamlessly co-exist with current solutions in a Federated Identity Management system.\n\nAnticipated Benefits: The ability to use location in IdM will enable DHS, and customer agencies, to implement more rapid and secure information sharing protocol. The use of policies that reason with geographical boundaries of events and user locations drastically reduce the time required to setup secure sharing of sensitive information across agencies during critical events, something that will increase the effectiveness of rapid response operations. It will do so through an automated decision making process that requires less human resources, hence less costs, while enforcing more secure policies that check both user credentials and physical presence in the area of a rapid response operation before granting access to sensitive logical resources, hence less risk of system misuse.",

        "abstract": "Better methodologies for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria and viruses are needed.  A particular problem with current antibody-based assays is cross-reactivity with similar, but harmless, species.  Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc. proposes developing nucleic acid-based affinity reagents (aptamers) against botulinum neurotoxin, as well as against a model pathogenic virus (VSV) and spore (Bacillus subtilis).  Aptamers displaying fast binding rates (kon) will be selected to increase the speed of the assay.  A novel approach using bivalent, bispecific aptamers will be utilized to achieve binding affinities at least equal to that of typical antibodies.  The aptamer selectivity will be enhanced by employing counterselection procedures whereby aptamers binding related species are deselected.  Finally, the aptamers will be applied to an ELISA-like protocol and their performance directly compared to antibodies.  \nAnticipated Benefits/Commercial Application\nA more rapid, sensitive, and selective assay for the detection of bacteria and viruses will have widespread applications in homeland security, the military, healthcare, and food safety.  The assay could be used to screen ports of entry, public places of interest, and military sites for evidence of biological threat agents.

        "abstract": "First described in the early 1990`s, short tandem repeat (STR) analysis is the gold standard of human identification. With a false identification rate as low as one in hundreds of trillions, STR analysis is a powerful tool for determining human identification objectively. The goal of this work is to improve the ability to evaluate kinship based on STR analyses.  By creating an STR assay system that allows more accurate determination of kinship, DHS responsibilities such as granting asylum,  processing applications for relatives to come to the US, and deterring child trafficking and illegal adoptions can be enhanced significantly.   Current STR assays are highly effective for determining the likelihood of first degree relationships (parent-child and sibling-sibling) but are less effective at more distant relationships.  By increasing the number of STR loci tested in a given assay, more distant relationships can be determined.  The proposed work would result in such an improved assay, building on NetBio`s experience in designing systems that rapidly process nucleic acids without human intervention.  It is hoped that this technology will improve the safety of society in general, and protect some of the most vulnerable members of our society in particular.",

Here, we propose a sensor that is based on stable biomolecules that act as ligands for the target(s) of interest.

This effort will apply advanced mesh networking, embedded processing techniques, unattended nodes design and semantic data analysis to develop a Semantic Mesh of Intelligent Sensors, (SMIS) system for enhancement of situational awareness, security and environmental analysis.  The system will include an intuitive user interface with back-end semantic processing, a dynamically adjustable web of sensors with on-board processing, along with the use of standards-based protocols to ensure that the system is open, extensible and upgradeable, supporting integration with existing data mining systems.",

        "abstract": "With growing concerns about the security of our borders and vulnerable entry points video imagery has emerged as a high potential surveillance data source for generating real time situational information. This potential comes with its challenges due to the large volumes of data need to be processed, lack of smart sensors to automatically detect and understand video content, bandwidth limitations to distribute the video to the hands of decision makers to provide actionable intelligence for first responders. Our proposal addresses each of these challenges, including end-to-end system integration with specific attention to deployment and life cycle costs with Smart Sensing and Video Understanding in a sensor web platform: \n1.We embed the video content analysis processing into the video sensor with our Smart Video Node to offload processing of video to the sensor edge,\n2.We use inexpensive ad hoc netted sensor motes to cue video sensors to collect and process data only when a mote field is triggered based on commanded rules, \n3.We use a sensorweb platform to quickly discover sensors that are available, seamlessly integrate and collect data from disparate sensors, perform system leverage, remotely task sensors and receive alerts from multiple sensors.",

        "abstract": "State-of-the-art turreted infrared imagers can stream high-definition, dynamically sensitive, telescopic video to users searching for a person in the water (PIW).  This capability has not yet been matched, however, with automated detection systems.  Search rate and detection probability are currently limited by the capacity of human users to visually process and interpret video data rapidly.  Fatigue, distractions, and recognition time are limiting factors.  Lynntech has conceptually proven an automated system, WAIRI, which acquires and analyzes thermal data over a wide field of view for PIW detection.  The system continuously determines likely targets within the wide field of view and presents them sequentially to a human user at high image magnification for identification.  Phase I scaled testing demonstrated 99 percent detection probability for a PIW in sea state 3 conditions at a search rate of 360 km2/hr.  Additionally, the system was both highly resistant to solar glint and able to detect hypothermal targets.  Production of a flight-operational system and live, open-ocean PIW search testing will be conducted in Phase II.  Low implementation costs and ease of integration with existing airborne turreted infrared imagers significantly enhance commercial viability.  Potential customers include rescue, police, and military agencies.",

        "abstract": "Current biodetection systems first collect airborne pathogens in a liquid, followed by detection While aerosol sampling technologies have been driven to protecting larger spaces, requiring large liquid collection volumes (several ml), state-of-the-art biosensors have been moving to ultra-low sensitivity needing only a very small fraction (few ml) of this collection volume. This mismatch leads to decreased assay sensitivity, increased probabilities of false alarms and increase in logistical burden. Addressing this issue, our overall objective is to design and demonstrate a novel electrostatics-based sampler that captures agent containing particles into order of magnitude smaller collection volumes that can then be processed directly by sensors. In Phase I, a novel electrostatics-based air-to-air aerosol concentrator was conceived, fabricated and demonstrated to be capable of concentrating particle over multiple orders of magnitude. Electrospray-based volumetric capture of focused particles was also demonstrated to hold great promise for highly efficient scrubbing of particles within the small volume constraints. During Phase II, these individual components will be further optimized and subsequently integrated along with COTS components to develop a sampler prototype. The sampler prototype will be challenged with both simulants and selected threat agents. Our unique development approach synergizing state-of-the-art simulation-based design with advanced prototyping and experimental testing, along with the experienced team assembled, minimizes technical risk and accelerates development cycles.",

The Smart Sensors system concept combines low-cost, COTS sensor systems with advanced digital signal processing technologies and algorithms with the aim of providing automated, high-performance wide area search and target discrimination to the U.S. Border Patrol and other government entities. As an option to the main task proposed under Phase II, Vista will also: a.) extend the range and robustness of the system through hardware upgrades, b.) improve the sensitivity and reliability of the system through algorithmic and software upgrades, and c.) realize rapid gains in performance through two additional field experiments that will leverage the lessons learned and insights gained through \"real world\" experiences in the Southern Border environment. Vista Research anticipates that by the end of Phase II sufficient progress will have been achieved that a fully integrated, real-time operational Smart Sensors capability can be rapidly prototyped, tested, and productized under Phase III, with the goal of pursuing actual deployments within the setting of the Southern Border security infrastructure as soon as possible.",

        "abstract": "Since botnets have both host and network components, detection must occur from both hosts and the network.  A problem is that network management systems have no visibility of hosts, and host detection systems have no visibility of the network.  Network management systems generate mountains of data that overwhelm network security administrators.  Many host-based products use signatures to detect viruses and spyware, but stealthy malicious bots are not being detected.  More flexible behavioral based host detection systems are emerging, but these products require frequent modification, have variable accuracy performance, and are limited to endpoint awareness, so they do not add to enterprise-level awareness.  HBGary intends to develop a botnet detection system that automatically collects host and network evidence from all over the enterprise and reasons over that evidence as would a subject matter expert to determine if botnets are present.  Essentially, the system will automate the analysis and conclusions of subject matter experts.  The system will instruct the security response team operator on what actions to perform.  The system will also provide a human analyst the ability to \"drill down\" to forensically analyze the threat.",

Just as handheld metal detectors are used to detect weapons on selectees and after walkthrough metal detector alarms, the proposed trace detection wand may be used to resolve alarms generated by the trace portal or imaging systems. In addition, at checkpoints where there is not sufficient space or the necessary throughput for portal systems to be deployed, the trace detection wand can be used with a detector, in place of large and expensive portal systems.  The proposed trace detection wand is designed to release particles and vapors from cloth, preconcentrate both particles and vapors in the wand, and then detect them with an ion mobility spectrometer (IMS) in a few seconds.",

The project primarily addresses the needs of first responders for detection of bioterrorism agents directly at the site of suspected attack. TIRF Technologies proposes to develop such handheld biosensor based on total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) combined with electrochemistry (TIRF-EC). The envisioned TIRF-EC sensor is capable of detecting multiple bioanalytes in a matter of several seconds or a few minutes. The detection limit is at the level of single molecules. Inexpensive sensor cartridge carries array of receptor molecules and contains all reagents for detection. The sensor cartridge is also equipped with a module, which performs sample preparation. To carry out the analysis, the operator inserts the cartridge, applies unpurified sample to the entrance port, and in several minutes reads the results of analysis at the handheld device. If manufactured massively, the envisioned biosensor will cost $200-400, and disposable sensor cartridges - $5-10. \nIn Phase I, the feasibility of highly multiplexed handheld TIRF-EC biosensor was successfully demonstrated. A 4-pixel prototype of TIRF-EC sensor was built and tested. Since the electronics of 4-pixel prototype is capable of supporting up to 100 photodetectors, only several quantitative steps separate the project from building a highly multiplexed handheld biosensor. This Phase II application seeks support to develop a 64-analyte handheld biosensor based on TIRF-EC. Phase I also demonstrated the feasibility of rapid sample preparation integrated into miniature TIRF-EC sensor cartridge. In Phase II,  64-pixel TIRF-EC sensor and respective sensor cartridges will be developed, prototyped and validated in conjunction with reagentless fluorescence assays for detection DNA/RNA and protein signatures of bioterrorism agents. \nThe envisioned handheld TIRF-EC biosensor will enable first responders with a powerful tool capable to rapidly detect multiple bioterrorism agents with minimum false positive and false negative responses. This will allow for designing efficient counter measures and avoiding unnecessary interruptions of normal life. TIRF-EC biosensor represents a flexible platform technology; it can be reconfigured for other applications.

Our main overarching technical goal is to eliminate the need for PCR based detection, while retaining the necessary sensitivity, selectivity, rapid response, and robustness required in rugged field environments. Having completed the Phase I effort, we confidently believe based on the data generated that we have demonstrated the feasibility, in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, rapid response of the assay approach.

To support this critical surveillance activity a Phase I Program established a relatively low cost, long life, moored buoy based vessel detection / signal processing system concept, that could be readily deployed by Coast Guard or Navy vessels in forward areas as a barrier and have an acoustic detection range of 20NM. The system would provide a communication link to a shore station for sorting and tracking the detected vessels of interest. The Phase II program will fabricate and deploy such a deep ocean, moored acoustic array prototype system to demonstrate operational performance. Contact and track reports will be relayed back to a shore station. LewTech Company plans to commercialize the resulting technology from this program by fully supporting the Coast Guard / Navy Maritime Domain Awareness mission requirements.

The card also logs forensic information and monitors network traffic to scan for malicious behavior. Software developed for our Phase I feasibility study demonstrated that our key components, file hashing and memory scanning, are capable of detecting current and expected rootkit technologies.Another component allows enterprise administration and information gathering across large organizations, and aggregates periodic information snapshots for security auditing and forensics.

        "abstract": "Hardware Assisted Security Platform - HASP Brief Technical Abstract of Project  The HASP (Hardware Assisted Security Platform) is a multi-purpose high-performance low-cost security engine that can enable significant improvement and innovation in a large variety of current and future security applications. HASP value comes principally from five features:  -    It can control host access to the network connection -- meaning it can selectively prevent the host from receiving and sending information through the network -- enabling a higher level of security assurance.   -    It can be impervious to data stream content -- meaning it cannot be compromised by data-stream born attacks, such as buffer overflow -- enabling a higher level of security assurance.  -    It can accomplish arbitrarily complex signature detection with no effect on pattern detection time -- which means added detection complexity can be employed to reduce false positives and false negatives, to detect increasingly sophisticated attack signatures, to verify the integrity of entire blocks of host code, and to enable new protective and preventive measures -- enabling a higher level of security assurance.  -   It has a fully scalable and general-purpose pattern detection architecture that can keep pace with increasing stream-speed and pattern-capacity needs -- meaning it can provide a compatible forward migration over time -- reducing the cost of application upgrade and migration and provide more affordable security.  -   It can be implemented as a stand-alone ASIC/SoC (e.g., on a desktop/server NIC board) or integrated inside the host`s network-interface SoC (e.g., in a laptop/mobile LOM device)  -- which means very low cost (under $20 retail possible) , with no trade off in speed or detection-pattern capacity -- providing compelling high-performance security and become ubiquitous in both stationary and mobile computing resources.   Certain realities of the current situation shape both the commercialization-enabling activity during Phase 2 and the post-Phase 2 commercialization strategy:   -    HASP provides a new pattern-detection processor architecture that requires rethinking and reformulation of traditional pattern-detection approaches, and enables new detection approaches impractical with existing processors. Therefore application prototyping that learns how to employ these new capabilities should be instigated and enabled by this Phase 2 project as early as possible.  -    HASP provides a general-purpose security platform that can facilitate a wide range of end-point security applications such as IDS, IPS, firewall, anti-malware, information leakage prevention, root-kit detection, web-access attacks , and SCADA-controlled equipment protection. Therefore a variety of security application prototyping activities should be instigated and enabled as early as possible.  -    Lead times for ASIC/SoC devices are in the neighborhood of 18 months. The Phase 2 project will create a development platform for applications that will want to take advantage of ASIC/SoC costs as FPGA costs are generally too high for an affordable end-point HASP Therefore, ASIC/SoC development and commercialization channels must be engaged as early as possible during Phase 2.  -    Snort is a highly utilized open-source IDS system that benefits from a broad-based collaborative open community actively identifying new-intrusions, and then crafting and disseminating Snort-compatible detection-signatures. HASP can host an improved performance Snort processor for existing signatures, while opening the door to a new class of signatures that takes advantage of the USee complex-pattern capabilities. Therefore work during Phase 2 that guides and engages the Snort community in HASP application and signature development should be instigated and enabled as early as possible.  -    The DETER laboratory is an effort \"to create, maintain, and support a collaborative and vendor-neutral experimental environment for cyber-security research. It is intended to provide a center for interchange and collaboration among security researchers and testbed builders.\" The nature of the new capabilities offered by HASP should appeal to DETER`s research community and result in innovative applications. Therefore, enabling access to HASP prototypes through the DETER lab should accomplished as early as possible during Phase 2.  Proof is in the pudding -- so application must be prototyped during this Phase 2 project that show superior capability.  -    Get multiple security application suppliers developing prototype applications as early in the project as possible -- on an FPGA-based prototype-development board.  -    Get a broad variety of multiple application started in prototype, such as IDS/IPS, firewall, extrusion prevention, possession detection, Internet access/content control, etc.  Work with established security majors: eg, Cisco, McAfee, and Symantec. They have  update and support services in place, market presence, and leading edge performance problems to solve. Microsoft is a new entry in the security application space and a prime candidate to pursue as well -- because of their dominance in related markets and their need to find an entry edge.  Seek and engage established NIC/LOM suppliers (eg, Broadcom, Intel). The goal is to have NIC/LOM  suppliers include an ASIC/SoC HASP as part of their offering. The strategy relies on their interests in finding new non-commodity-product values, and leverages the natural fit with HASP and the trends toward integrated security functions. The network connection device/card is both the most natural location as well as the most affordable location for HASP capability to reside. This eliminates duplication of network interfacing and traffic normalization, and offers the potential for co-location inside the same SoC chip. NIC/LOM suppliers are already moving into the security application space, and should find the HASP concept both a natural extension of current business strategy and an opportunity to rise above commodity-product status.  Also seek and engage ASIC/SOC and multi-core processor suppliers: eg, Intel, AMD, IBM. Though multi-core generally means duplicate general purpose processors, these suppliers also employ \"IP core\" with special functionality in their multi-core processor chips.  The ultimate objective is a multi-purpose security processor integrated with the network interface and populated by applications from a variety of security application vendors. This project lays the foundation for that eventuality by building a functional prototype, engaging application developers, and engaging ASIC/SoC commercialization channels.  The project focuses on four goals: 1.    Prototyping a HASP implementation on an OTS (off the shelf) FPGA board that paves the way for a production ASIC/SoC implementation.  2.    Prototyping a functional application development capability for security applications. 3.    Engaging five security application developers in using beta versions of 1 and 2. 4.    Engaging ASIC/SoC developers in HASP-device commercialization preparation. 5.    Engaging NIC/LOM suppliers in HASP-device commercialization preparation.",

None of the current mechanical vehicle stopping technologies meet the requirements for small, portable highly effective vehicle-stopping devices.

Our research has indicated that current vehicle stopping technologies place the user in danger during deployment.  ESA has developed a device that is a significant improvement over current technologies in that it is not as sensitive to the kinetic energy of the entire moving vehicle and is deployable from a safe distance. Our innovation is a portable, lightweight, inexpensive device that can be readily deployed and remotely activated by ground-based personnel or from helicopters.

In Phase I, two generations of working prototypes were developed, fabricated, and demonstrated to DHS and to an Under Secretary of Defense.  In Phase II we will extend the SPIDER concept to two protective network meshes: one similar to that of Phase I, and a new one with stretching capability to dramatically improve false alarm rate.

(formerly System Detection) concerns the second phase for research, development and commercial release of a novel method to detect malicious code exploits in network traffic. The successful Phase 1 project led to several new innovations and improvements, and commercial development is under way. The PAYL Payload Anomaly Detection sensor will be completely implemented in the CounterStorm AntiWorm-1 product platform and introduced to commercial and government sites. New features of the PAYL anomalous payload detection sensor created under Phase 1 funding demonstrated highly accurate detection and generate signatures for zero-day worm exploits. Experimental evidence demonstrated that \"site-specific models\" trained and used for testing by PAYL can detect new worms with high accuracy in a collaborative security system.    In Phase 2 we continue to build on a new approach that correlates ingress/egress payload alerts to identify the worm's initial propagation.\nThe method also enables automatic signature generation very early in the worm's propagation stage. These signatures can be deployed immediately to network firewalls and content filters to proactively protect other hosts. Tests and evaluations of sensor performance are also proposed for Phase 2.   Collaborative research and development by CounterStorm and Columbia University will address several basic problems dealing with handling encrypted content traffic and scaling the sensor to high speed network rates.  Significant engineering activities are needed to embed solutions to these performance issues into the CounterStorm AntiWorm-1 Platform. The speed of gigabit networks strains the limits of what can be detected in real-time, especially when decrypting content flows. There are currently no Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) solutions offered today that provide highly efficient content-based anomaly detectors operating on high-speed networks without packet loss.  By overcoming these obstacles, we can provide the first effective content-based anomaly detection system to secure high speed networks.   The CounterStorm AntiWorm-1 platform with PAYL technology improves accuracy for all worm detection and blocking.  More importantly, PAYL facilitates the detection and blocking of non-scanning 'zero-day' worms, adding a significant layer of security to critical IT infrastructures for commercial and government entities.",

(formerly System Detection) concerns the second phase of research, development, and commercial release of Worminator, an innovative and effective approach to anonymously sharing and correlating security information in real-time.  The overriding principle of Worminator is that cross-domain collaboration enhances accuracy and efficacy by enabling rapid detection of worms, zero-day exploits, and slow-and-stealthy attacks currently undetected by existing products.  The overarching goal of this Phase 2 effort is to fully incorporate the Worminator technology into CounterStorm`s AntiWorm-1 commercial security product, providing an effective defense against emerging threats.    CounterStorm`s Phase 1 effort oversaw the successful development and deployment of the first-generation Worminator architecture at commercial and academic sites.  Using Worminator to correlate alerts from CounterStorm's Surveillance Detection Engine, we demonstrated a dramatic reduction in the alert stream, yielding a manageable number of actionable alarms.  This Phase 2 effort is organized into four components.  First, we will extend Worminator`s collaboration capabilities beyond the sharing of attack source addresses.  As a part of this effort, we will integrate Worminator with CounterStorm's Payload Anomaly Sensor (PAYL is the topic of another SBIR Phase 2 proposal). PAYL and Worminator together provide real-time sharing of automatically-generated content signatures to inoculate collaborating sites against attack.  Second, we aim to support anonymous collaboration. Third, we plan a fully commercialized implementation of Worminator as an extension of CounterStorm's AntiWorm-1 architecture. Finally, in collaboration with Columbia University, we plan to conduct a comprehensive study of real-world attack behaviors over time, including coverage, response rates, and efficiency under different exchange algorithms.  Incorporation of the Worminator technology enhances AntiWorm-1 by allowing rapid and anonymous sharing and correlation of threat information in real time, thus giving sites the ability to block malicious activity before it is seen locally.",

Phase I of this program successfully identified critical terahertz atmospheric transmission windows with high precision, defined the best candidate imaging system, and carried out an analysis of this system resulting in detailed system performance predictions.  Compact and efficient semiconductor terahertz quantum cascade lasers are currently being developed by several companies (including Spire) and laboratories, and will soon be commercially available.  Using these laser sources as illuminators and local oscillators, a small and portable imaging system based on ultra-sensitive, room temperature, coherent heterodyne detection is proposed.  Terahertz radiation, with its submillimeter wavelengths, is non-ionizing and low in energy, avoiding environmental safety issues.  Working with the University of Massachusetts Lowell, Submillimeter Wave Technology Laboratory as a subcontractor, Phase II will involve (a) completion of the imager system design begun during Phase I, (b) assembly of a breadboard imaging system, and (c) demonstration and evaluation of the imaging system under simulated field conditions using representative or surrogate explosives and weapons.  Commercialization of the imaging system will be carried out utilizing Spire's Biomedical manufacturing, marketing, and sales resources.  The commercial availability of terahertz imaging systems will have a strong impact on homeland defense, military and police surveillance, biomedical technology, agricultural inspection, transportation security, analytical instruments, and high-resolution spectroscopy.  Homeland defense and military applications include detection of hidden weapons and explosives, while biomedical applications include DNA identification and analysis, high resolution spectroscopy for organic material identification, discrimination between normal and cancer cells, and potential identification of other tissue abnormalities.

The overall goal of this R&D effort is to optimize\ndetection of LVP compounds by improving system signal-to-noise through\ncarefully evaluated modifications to the various subsystems of the\ndevice.  We propose to enhance the device by: 1) continued development\nof sensitive chemical sensors for a range of LVP compounds, 2)\ndeploying these chemical sensor on a novel filament substrate that\nincreases signal amplitude, 3) improving the optoelectronics to\nefficiently illuminate and interrogate the chemical sensors, 4)\nimproving vapor sampling to effectively present LVP odors to the\nsensor array, and 5) developing new data processing algorithms to\nreduce sensor signal variability.  These enhancements will be\nincorporated into a new prototype device that will be thoroughly\ntested and quantitatively characterized.

The overall objective was to determine the system architecture necessary to maintain communication with virtually all containers both in port and on ships.    S5 Wireless has spent 18 months researching the elements and markets surrounding container tracking for security and supply chain tracking.  We invisions a system that will identify containers that have been screened as safe at the point of stuffing, verified as having not been tampered with at the port of debarkation, and confirmed that they have not been tampered with en-route to the United States.  This Phase II proposal outlines S5 Wireless' intent to take the research performed under Phase I, as well as ongoing commercial work, to develop a prototype version of the system that will be productized and deployed in an industry that has 200 million container movements annually, a system with low economic impact on the container shipping industry and on the global supply chain, while achieving benefits in security and supply chain visibility and protection.",

The proposed system will include a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) chemical sensor array, sampling pump and a MEMS preconcentrator optimized for the selective and sensitive detection of a variety of high risk TICS that pose a threat to homeland security.  Because of the diverse nature of these compounds we have designed a flexible system that allows for multiple modes of operation.  The system will accommodate wall mounted or handheld operation and samples can be introduced from ambient air or by direct input from a swipe.  Ultimately this program will yield a small, rugged, lightweight, low-power detection system.   In Phase I we began optimization of our MEMS chemicapacitor sensors for some LVPs including a pesticide, explosive and mercury.  In a Phase II design reviews we will expand the list of LVP TICS to include other high priority TICs.  Our proposed MEMS preconcentrator provides high throughput and high collection efficiency while using minimum power.  In Phase II we propose to integrate our sensors, a preconcentrator and a sampling system and to evaluate the system by exposures to LVP TICS.",

        "abstract": "Accidental spills or intentional releases of toxic industrial compounds (TICs) are significant threats to human life.  Early detection and warning of the presence and distribution of these hazardous materials in the environment is very important in the prevention of injury and loss of human life.  However, the monitoring for low vapor pressure TICS (LVTICs) in the atmosphere is problematic because these materials can be present in different forms that are not easily detected by conventional instruments.  As part of a successful Phase I development effort, Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) has demonstrated the feasibility of developing a system to sample and concentrate all forms of LVTICs in the atmosphere, and to continuously assay and detect LVTICs sampled from the atmosphere using a highly sensitive immunoassay technique.  The goal of the Phase II work is to formalize and refine the design of the Phase I system to produce a tested and validated prototype capable of demonstrating the detection of LVTICs under conditions reflecting realistic monitoring and detection scenarios.  In Phase II, displacement immunoassay protocols will be developed for additional classes of LVTICs, and a means to simultaneously monitor multiple classes of LVTICs will be constructed.  A prototype bench level instrument, including an improved innovative air sampler, will be designed and fabricated to demonstrate the monitoring of LVTICs.  At the end of Phase II, IOS will be prepared to market the monitor system to potential customers and to design the manufacturing processes needed to produce LVTIC monitors for sale to military and civilian markets.",

        "abstract": "Current antibody- or enzyme-based chemical and biological sensors generally suffer from several disadvantages including involved development cycles, short shelf life, implementation difficulties, and no clear path for new receptor development.  We propose an approach based on the use of computationally designed proteins (CDPs) as receptor scaffolds.  Such scaffolds overcome many of the problems encountered with biosensors.  Significantly, this approach is a general method that provides a path to rapid development of specific receptors.  In Phase I, we demonstrated the ability of solutions of computationally designed proteins to display a fluorescent signal change upon ligand binding, we attached computationally designed proteins to solid surfaces, and we demonstrated that fluorescently tagged, immobilized phosphonate-binding proteins can display fluorescent signal change upon ligand binding.  Thus, we are confident that continuation of this project will yield favorable results.  Specifically, during Phase II, we will continue development of biosensors that incorporate engineered periplasmic binding proteins that recognize and report organophosphate mimics and hydrolysis products of well-known nerve agents.  The primary goal will be incorporation of highly stable CDPs into a prototype device for the detection of hydrolysis products of sarin and soman.  We will continue our collaboration with Dr. H.W.

Rather, they are an essential first step in providing therapists with initial exposure to basic skills and strategies; to assure that clinicians implement this and other evidence based therapies consistently, effectively, and with adequate fidelity to manual guidelines, ongoing supervision and feedback via monitoring of clinicians&#039; implementation of TSF are essential. However, there are no existing tools available for use by clinical supervisors to guide performance monitoring and feedback in clinicians&#039; implementation of TSF.  The aim of this Phase II SBIR is to develop a supervision toolkitfor TSF and to conduct a randomized training trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the TSF Supervisor&#039;s Toolkit on the ability of clinical supervisors in community-based settings to accurately evaluate clinicians&#039; fidelity (e.g., adherence and competence)in delivering TSF. We have successfully completed Phase I and have demonstrated the feasibility and promise of a prototype version of the TSFToolkit in training clinical supervisors to accurately monitor and provide effective feedback on clinicians&#039; fidelity and skill in TSF. Specific aims for Phase II include the following:  1. Complete a full web-based multimedia training program for the TSF Supervisors Toolkit. The program  would be modeled on the highly successful supervisor&#039;s toolkit for MotivationalInterviewing developed  by Dr. Carroll and colleagues for Motivational Interviewing Assessment: Supervisory Tools for  Enhancing Proficiency (MIA: STEP, http://www.nida.nih.gov/blending). Accuracy in using the supervisor rating form and independent ratingsof skill in providing TSF supervision, and submission of a taped example of a supervisory session that demonstrates adequate skill (clarity, completeness, support) would serve as basic criteria for certifying qualified individuals as TSF supervisors.  2.Conduct a randomized trial in which 105 clinical supervisors would be randomized to (1) the TSF  Supervisor&#039;s Toolkit website, (2) a two day didactic training or (3) reading the TSF manual alone.  Outcomes will include independent ratings of the supervisors&#039; ability to conduct an effective feedback/ supervision session, the ability of the supervisors to accurately assess clinicians&#039; adherence and competence in delivering TSF, satisfaction with training, and relative costs of the three approaches.  The development and systematic evaluation of the Toolkit represents the next major step broadening the availability of high quality training and supervision in TSF and thus addresses a major gap in the ability of clinical programs to implement this and other evidence based practices (EBP) effectively.

There is a significant need for minimally-invasive, non-intrusive, wearable, and cost-effective devices that can be integrated into the daily lives of the elderly. Existing measures for age-related changes and processes have a number of limitations. For example, patient questionnaires require the participant to self-report information that is highly subjective. Other technologies require the patient to perform or comply with rigid testing procedures. Yet other technologies only collect a single point of data or require invasive procedures. There is a need for sensor technology which requires little participation by the patient and provides continuous, real-time data collection. Such sensor technology would provide researchers and clinicians vital information as to the variations and rates of changes in physiological parameters during the slow progression of the aging process.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Defining the molecular mechanism that leads to cellular aging and neural degeneration has proven to be difficult. Many types of damage are thought to contribute to senescence and neural degeneration and include mitochondrial and nuclear DNA mutations, protein misfolding, aggregate formation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and stem cell senescence. However, a consensus has not yet developed as to which mechanism plays a causal role in aging. Indeed, each tissue may have aselect set of processes, or  Achilles&#039; heel  that further exacerbated cellular decline. In the nervous system there is an agreement that mitochondrial senescence, the accumulation of ROS-dependent damage and the formation of protein aggregates or inclusion containing ubiquitin are involved with the most human neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer&#039;s and Parkinson&#039;s disease. There is a growing understanding that the autophagy pathway is involved with maintaining the mature nervous system by facilitatingthe removal of cellular damage and protein aggregates. The pathway is highly conserved and we found that expression profiles of autophagy genes show a significant decrease in the aging Drosophila CNS. At the same time, markers of cellular damage and aggregates, such as insoluble ubiquitinated aggregates (IUP), show a dramatic increase. Genetic analysis also shows that mutations in key genes significantly shorten adult lifespans (35 to 60%) and cause progressive neural defects that share striking similarities to those seen with Alzheimer&#039;s and other neurodegenerative disorders. Of greater significance is our observation that enhancing autophagy in the aging nervous system suppresses the accumulation of cellular damage (IUP) and significantly extends adult life spans. This work shows that examining factors that promote healthy neuronal aging can be done using Drosophila as a model system. In this proposal we take advantage of the conserved regulation of autophagy to identify neural protective compounds that enhance the pathway, promote longevity and neural function. This project involves several validated and optimized assays proposed in our original Phase-I application that were designed to identify compounds that enhanced autophagy, suppressed aggregate formation and extend life spans. In Specific Aim 1 an additional assay, which assesses the ability of different treatments to suppress oxidative stress was included. Specific Aim 2 represents an expansion of our drug-testing platform to assess the effectivenessof different compounds to promote neuronal health and function by examining their effect on several adult behaviors that show an age-dependent decline. Specific Aim 3 takes advantage of the conserved regulation of autophgy and other key protective pathwaysto identify those neural protective compounds that alter gene expression profiles in the aging nervous system. The goal of this proposal is to better understand the role of clearance pathways on aging and to develop in vivo assays that identify drugs thatcould be used for the treatment of human neurological disorders.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Presently there is no effective treatment for Alzheimer&#039;s disease and other age-related disorders that affect millions worldwide. Developing an effective method for validating neural protective compounds would streamline the development of life saving therapies. The research outlined in this proposal used Drosophila to develop several medium-throughput in vivo screening techniques that can identify novel therapeutic compounds for the treatment of aging disorders.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Workers aged 50 and older are at particular risk for a variety of diseases and disabling conditions that can erode their health and productivity and increase the costs of health care. Research has shown that worksite-based health risk appraisals and tailored, theory-based health promotion programs can provide cost- effective means to improve the health and productivity of the workforce. However, these promising interventions have not been specifically developed for, or applied to, older workers, despite the potentially greater need for disease prevention in this age group, and the likelihood that the return on investment could be higher for this age group than for younger workers. In recent years, Internet-based health improvement programs have been developed and tested in the workplace, and the evidence from several studies, including studies conducted by our organization (ISA) in multiple workplaces, has indicated that web-based health promotion programs can be efficacious interventions for improving the health of the workforce. Building on ISA&#039;s extensive experience in worksite health interventions (including previously developed and tested web-based interventions), the proposed project will develop and test an innovative web-based program - science-based, media-rich, tailored, and highly interactive - designed to reduce the health risks of older workers. The project will also include the development of a toolkit for managers that is designed to foster the adoption of policies and practices that support the web-based intervention and related worksite improvements. Phase I will involve the development and feasibility testing of the prototype, along with specific milestones that must met before moving to Phase II. Phase II will involve the full development of the web- based program for older workers, followed by a field test of the program, including a randomized controlled trial with a sample of employees. The EMC Corporation, a Fortune 500 company with 26,000 employees, hasenthusiastically agreed to serve as the site for both phases of the project. The final program will be marketed to workplaces through concentrated efforts by ISA&#039;s Center for Workforce Health.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Workers aged 50 and older areat particular risk for a variety of diseases and disabling conditions that can erode their health and productivity and increase the costs of health care. A variety of health promotion interventions have been shown to be effective for the mainstream workforce, and offer promise for improving the health of older workers as well. The outcome of this Fast Track project will be the development and test of an innovative, web-based health promotion program for older workers consisting of a comprehensive, tailoredprogram for employees and a toolkit for managers. The effective development and test of this program could provide a mechanism for broad dissemination of efficacious and cost-effective health promotion interventions to workplaces and an ultimate decrease in the prevalence of disease and disability in older Americans.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective is to design, implement, and clinically assess ETSense , an adaptive, compact, portable essential tremor (ET) monitor for optimizing therapeutic interventions. ET is characterized primarily by postural and kinetic (action) tremors of the limbs, which are rated by various subjective tremor rating scales. These scales all provide a discrete, subjective symptom rating at a discrete point in time, require a clinician to visually assess the patient, and cannotcapture complex fluctuations that occur throughout the day in response to interventions. Objectively capturing ET symptoms continuously during daily activities and using adaptive algorithms to both classify tremor types and severity will help clinicians better titrate therapy to minimize symptom fluctuations and expand care to rural and underserved populations. The Phase I ETSense effort successfully used kinematic data recorded from a sensor unit placed on the finger of subjects with ET to discriminate tremor from voluntary motion associated with daily activities and objectively quantified tremor severity with scores highly correlated with clinicians&#039; qualitative ratings, providing a standardized platform for continuous ET assessment. Tremor quantificationalgorithms were extrapolated to non-standardized tasks, suggesting that it is feasible to rate tremor continuously throughout the day during activities of daily living. The three primary innovations of the proposed system include: 1) a compact, portable, user-worn device for continuous monitoring during ADLs, 2) intelligent, adaptive algorithms to continuously classify tremor type and rate severity, and 3) web-based access to symptom response reports. The clinically deployable system will be contained in alightweight, finger-worn housing for continuous wear while patients perform everyday tasks at home or in public. A push button diary will allow the patient to indicate when medication is taken. All data will be stored in memory for subsequent analysis andreport generation detailing symptom fluctuations in response to therapeutic interventions. Adaptive algorithms developed in Phase I will be further optimized to account for voluntary motion that can create tremor false positives or mask over kinematic tremor signals. The system will shift between scoring algorithms (i.e. rest, kinetic) based on any voluntary motion detected. After data collection is complete, clinicians will use a web-interface to view patient reports. These reports will detail tremor type,severity, and fluctuations, as well as when medication was taken to aid clinicians in optimizing existing therapeutic interventions or in the research and development of novel treatment protocols. We hypothesize that the commercial ETSense system will 1)continuously quantify tremor severity throughout the day during activities of daily living, 2) improve patient outcomes with better and/or faster medication optimization, 3) decrease healthcare costs by reducing office visits, and 4) enable the testing andvalidation of novel therapeutic interventions, facilitated by high-resolution continuous home monitoring.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Essential tremor, characterized primarily by tremor during movement, affects approximately 4% of the population overage 40 in the United States, though exact prevalence may be much higher since up to 90% of ET patients do not seek treatment. The proposed ETSense adaptive, portable essential tremor monitor will classify tremor type and rate tremor severity continuously throughout the day while a patient performs typical activities, which should help clinicians to better prescribe treatment and aid in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pelvic organ prolapse is a highly prevalent condition affecting at least 50% of women in the US during their lifetimes. Some loss of utero-vaginal support occurs in most adult women; however, the true etiology of prolapse and differences seen among individuals is not entirely understood. Changes in the elasticity of the vaginal walls, connective support tissues and muscles are thought to be significant factors in the development of pelvic organ prolapse. We propose to develop a device entitled Vaginal Tactile Imager (VTI) for 3-D visualization and assessment of mechanical properties of pelvic floor tissues. VTI is based on the Tactile Imaging (TI) technology based on principles similar to those of manual palpation. In Phase I we designed and build 1- prototype of VTI with tactile sensor array and a motion tracking sensor, tested the training procedure with the phantoms and initiated the clinical development study with 30 patients to optimize the VTI, examination procedure,data processing algorithms and visualization approaches. Clinical results demonstrate applicability of proposed approach for 3-D imaging of the vagina and surrounding structures and characterization of normal and pelvic organ prolapse conditions. In PhaseII we plan to build VTI 2-prototype, complete the bench verification studies, EMC and safety testing in the accordance with regulatory compliance to bring the device to clinical validation study with 200 patients, 2 sites, and 5 operators. The proposed device will quantitatively evaluate multiple mechanical and structural properties of vaginal walls, such as elasticity distribution, Young&#039;s modulus, elasticity contrast, size and shape of abnormal tissue, provide prolapse characterization and assess resultsof reconstructive surgery. The completion of proposed project promises to gain scientific knowledge, provide new technical capability and improve clinical practice in gynecology.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pelvic organ prolapse is a highly prevalentcondition affecting at least 50% of women in the US during their lifetimes. The goal of this project is to develop Vaginal Tactile Imager (VTI) for 3-D elasticity imaging of pelvic floor tissues and prolapse characterization that could improve pelvic floordisorder diagnosis and treatment.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This grant will seek to develop a methodology that will allow us to test whether a promising new class of drugs for Alzheimer&#039;s disease is having the desired effect in the human brain. This methodology will allow pharmaceutical companies to make informed decisions about which drugs to advance into late stage clinical trials, and to optimize dosing and administration schedules based on pharmacodynamic response. C2N Diagnostics has licensed the platform technology from Washington University to carry out the company&#039;s stable isotope labeling kinetic (SILK) assay. This assay is used to measure production and clearance rates of proteins in the brain. Previously, this methodology has been applied to measuring production and clearance of total A2 from the brain, and evaluating the biologic activity of certain compounds in clinical development for the treatment of Alzheimer&#039;s. To measure the biologic activity of an emerging class of compounds, gamma-secretase modulators, we need to be able to measure the production and clearance of the individual A2 isoforms, specifically A2 38, 40 and 42. The experiments proposed in this grant will develop this methodology in Phase I of this grant. In Phase II, the methodology will be applied to asmall patient study. Applying the technology to a proof of concept human study will greatly facilitate commercialization of the technology. Further, this technology will greatly enhance our understanding of how AD metabolism plays a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alzheimer&#039;s disease is a growing problem with an estimated 5 million people currently affected in the US. There are currently no disease modifying drugs approved for AD, in part due to a paucity of relevant toolsto measure biologic activity and clinical efficacy for these types of drugs. The proposed experiments are intended to allow C2N to help pharmaceutical companies optimize the quality of their drug development efforts and to expedite bringing promising disease modifying treatments to the clinic.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the well known baby boomer generation surges toward retirement age, the issue becomes more significant each day of how this generation of 78 million seniors will be able to remain as independent as possible while increasingly burdened by the onset of multiple, chronic, medical conditions and a decline in cognitive abilities. Concurrent with the dramatic increase in the numbers of seniors with disabling conditions, the Medicare system is expected continue to reduce services due to economic conditions and budgetary constraints. Additionally, the rate of demand for professional health care and direct-care workers is expected to dramatically outpace supply over the next decade. Consequently, community-based care of seniorswith disabilities will be more and more in the hands of the individuals themselves and their family caregivers receiving limited guidance from professional care organizations. One of the biggest issues that face home care agencies is the lack of consistency in care giving caused by inexperienced or changing caregivers and the high cost of home visits to monitor health plan compliance. The result of these inadequacies is that all too often many seniors with disabilities are prematurely moved to more restrictive, expensive and institutional living environments that would not be necessary if home health care was provided in a more consistent manner with predictable quality. One approach to help avoid premature removal from community living arrangements is to use new technologies to help improve self-directed personal health care compliance along with remote health monitoring tools for professional caregivers to enable seniors to  age in place  while maximizing quality of care for seniors with disabilities. Therefore, in this project we will build on the successful results of Phase I to develop HealthCare Manager, a personal healthcare support system using powerful mobile computer devices to make it easier for seniors to perform personal health care activities, such as knowing when and how to take medications or comply with therapy routines, and to track health care actions that have been completed. This innovative approach will help enable elderly individuals to  age in place,  maximize the consistency and quality of self-care, and avoid premature relocation to institutional settings. This approach uses new technologies to help seniors engage in self-directed personal health care while also employing remote health monitoring tools for caregivers and health professionals. A prototype system was developed in Phase I and tested for usability with 32 seniors by AbleLink&#039;s project partner, the University of Colorado&#039;s Gerontology Center. The results provided strong preliminary support demonstrating the utility and usability of the HCA system. For example, when using the HCA technology seniors performed a novel task at a 99.1 percent accuracy rate, with no prior knowledge of how to complete the specific health care task. Additionally, seniors using the HCA system were able to respond to the time-based reminders to perform a specific health care task 100 percent of the time, even with the mild distraction of watching a nature film during the testing period.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objectives of this project areto research, design and develop HealthCare Manager (HCM), a software system for improving consistency and quality of implementing home health care regimens for seniors living in their own homes. This relates to the mission of NIH by providing a support tool that will enable seniors to perform personal health care tasks more consistently and accurately, thus promoting individual health and quality of life.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer&#039;s Disease (AD) is a significant neurological disorder that afflicts more than 4.5 million Americans and more than 10 million people worldwide. The lack of a cure for AD will result in a demand for better and safer AD drugs. All of the drugs on the market today have serious side effects. Recently, researchers at The Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute, Rockville, MD have hypothesized and shown that protein kinase C (PKC) and its activation are important means of ameliorating AD pathophysiology and cognitive impairment. They have shown that sub-nanomolar concentrations of bryostatin 1, a potent PKC activator, dramatically enhance the generation of non-amyloidogenic soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) in fibroblasts from AD patients. Bryostatin 1 was effective in reducing brain amyloid plaques (A240 and A242 in AD) in double-transgenic mice while improving behavioral outcomes and the rate of premature death. These researchers have also shown that bryostatin 1 not only produces a neuroprotective effect but also enhances cognitive memory in AD animal models. Bryostatin 1 is a complex cyclic macrolide molecule that occurs in very small concentrations (~ 5 to 25 ppm) in a bryozoan, sometimes referred to as a  sea moss  found off the coast in Southern California. Bryostatin 1 is also more hydrophobic than paclitaxel, the potent anticancer drug with well-known formulation difficulties. Aphios has developed and patented improved methodologies and manufacturing processes for cost-effectively isolating pharmaceutical-grade bryostatin 1 from Bugula neritina. Our scientists and engineers have also developed methods for formulating hydrophobic molecules such as bryostatin 1 in stable, readily bioavailable oil-basedformulations, and novel nanotechnology formulations of bryostatin 1 that will further improve oral bioavailability. Aphios&#039; Zindol(R) product, which contains oil soluble gingerols and shogaols, recently completed a successful Phase II/III clinical trial for nausea and emesis in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Our Phase I Specific Aims are to: (1) Develop conventional and nanotechnology oral formulations of bryostatin 1; and (2) Test stability of selected formulations under accelerated conditions of temperature and humidity, and evaluate in vitro characteristics and in vivo efficacy. We have set three milestones to be achieved before moving on to Phase II. Our Phase I milestones are as follows: stable  lyophilized  and/or  oil-based nanoparticles formulation of bryostatin-1 in the size range of 100 to 200 nm range containing 1 to 10 5g/mL bryostatin 1 with a drug:polymer ratios of 1:10 to 1:100; brief (5-15 minutes), low dosages (0.04-0.2 nM) and application frequencies 1-2 x /week will provide maximal PKC activation and minimal downregulation; and 30% to 50% enhancement of learning and memory in the wild type of mice and even greater enhancement in the transgenic mice due to neuroprotection. Our Phase II Specific Aims are as follows: (1) Specific Aim1: For selected formulations, radioactive bryostatin 1 will be assayed to determine the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution. Pharmacologic efficacy will also be measured, particularly in the brain and plasma compartments by total PKC activity, membrane/cytosolic PKC activity ratios, and phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 MAP Kinase; and (2) Specific Aim 2: Establish cGMP manufacturing of the bryostatin 1 API (active pharmaceutical ingredient) and FDP (final or formulated drug product) at the pilot-scale level. Establish a Drug Master File, design IND-enabling preclinical studies and Phase I/II clinical trials, and draft IND package: In a Phase III commercialization effort, we will conduct IND-enabling preclinical in vivo studies, including toxicology, efficacy, pharmacology and stability testing of selected formulation of bryostatin 1 drug product under Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) conditions. These studies will be conducted by a CRO such as Southern Research Institute or Covance Laboratories. As part of ourcommercialization effort, Aphios Corporation will also establish a wholly owned subsidiary Amylon Pharmaceuticals to focus on the discovery and development of novel therapeutics for Alzheimer&#039;s Disease and Cognitive Disorders with bryostatin-1 as its leadcompound. Amylon Pharmaceuticals will raise a Series A round of  20 million USD in equity capital to accelerate the development of bryostatin 1 for Alzheimer&#039;s Disease and Cognitive Disorders. This capital will be utilized to: (i) establish a management and product development team; (ii) conduct Phase I human clinical trials; (iii) research and development of second- generation products; and (iv) manufacture cGMP products over a two-year period. Within 12 months of the Series A raise, Amylon plans to initiate the establishment of a  25 million USD Series B round to conduct Phase II clinical trials in year 3. Later, Amylon plans to do an IPO to raise  100 million to conduct Phase III clinical trials and commercialize bryostatin 1 for Alzheimer&#039;s Disease andCognitive Disorders. Alternatively, at this stage, Amylon will merge with a mid-tier public company or be acquired by a multinational pharmaceutical company.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alzheimer&#039;s Disease (AD) is the third largest cause of death in America and among the highest in the industrial world. AD is a significant neurological disorder that affects more than 4.5 million Americans and more than 10 million people worldwide. This problem will increase with the demographics of aging populations inUnited States, Europe and Japan. Experts estimate that 22 million people around the world and more than 8 million Americans would be affected with AD by 2025. The total market of AD drugs in 2005 was over  2.7 billion. Due to the changing demographics, themarket is expected to grow quickly. Because of the growing number of new cases each year, the market is expected to grow at a rate of 17.5%. To meet this unmet medical need and market demand, we propose to develop a novel therapeutic that has the potential to significantly reduce the personal quality of life and national financial impact of this debilitating disease.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The present lack of blood-based diagnosis requires AD patients to be subjected to either invasive spinal fluid (CSF) tapping, expensive MRI or PET imaging, or arduous psychological testing, all unsuitable and costly forour elderly. Strategically, we shall address this unmet need by generating systemic biomarkers detectable in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) and serum/plasma, focusing on two classes of molecules, micro- RNAs and their target genes, which generally exhibit an inverse relationship because the former noncoding RNA functions by partially repressing the latter s expression as a  dimmer switch , via binding either at the co- ding region of the message, thus degrading it, or at the 3 -untranslated region, toinhibit translation. Thus, key microRNAs and their targets can serve as disease biomarkers, in  see-saw  balance, applicable for new diagnostics and/or therapy. Our pilot study with a small cohort of 16 AD and 16 age-matched normal elderly controls (NEC)revealed: 1. Predominant down-regulation of gene expression at the message level in AD PBMC; and 2. Correlated up-regulation of microRNA (miR) expression in PBMC of the same individuals. In this proposal, we focus on a specific up-regulated microRNA, miR-34a, whose known targets are SIRT1, cdk4, cdk6, cyclin E2, bcl2, etc. SIRT1 is a member of the 7-member Silent Information Regulator protein family. Caloric restriction extends longevity through triggering expression of SIRT1, which can also be mimicked byresveratrol, a red wine polyphenol. SIRT1 reduction is linked to accumulation of Tau and A242 production, two hallmarks of AD etiopathogenesis. Thus, we suggest that in AD there is a systemic effect detectable in PBMC and serum/plasma; up-regulated miR-34amay induce down-regulation of SIRT1, with attendant pathophysiologic results. In this proposal, we plan to generate for this  see-saw  of changes miR-34a/SIRT1 Target Pair Ratio (TPR) indices, to quantify both disease presence as well as progress; the indices should also provide an unprecedented evaluation of drug efficacy. This Fast-track proposal of two phases is planned with our existing small cohort study as the roadmap for the larger cohort investigation: Phase I of six months with our existing small16 AD and 16 NEC sample cohorts to: Aim 1. study possible down-regulation of miR-34a s known targets; and Aim 2. develop a feasibility study of pilot miR-34a/SIRT1 TPR-indices; and Phase II of two years with larger cohorts of 200 AD and 200 NEC participants: Aim 1.Establish a Bio-Repository of PBMC-DNA, -RNA and -protein specimens, and serum/plasma samples for assays in Aims 2 and 3; Aim 2. Generate PBMC-based miR34a/SIRT1 (and other targets) TPR indices; and Aim 3. Perform feasibility study to develop serum/plasma-based miR- 34a/SIRT1-TPR indices. Success of this project will allow us to generate PBMC- and serum-based miR-TPR indices as personalized diagnostics for AD victims, meeting an urgent need in health care, a huge gain for disease victims, their caregivers, and our society at large.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  At present, the absence of any blood-based diagnosis for Alzheimer s disease (AD) requires patients to enduring arduous neuropsychological testing, invasive cerebrospinal fluid tapping, and/or expensive MRI or PET imaging, with definitive diagnosis deferred until brain autopsy. Our preliminary findings, based on new science concerning a novel molecular species, microRNAs (miR) and their  see-saw  partial repression of the expression of their target gene(s), suggest that potential disease biomarkers for AD are detectable systemical- ly in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and/or serum/plasma, and may be quantified as miR-Target Pair Ra- tios (TPR). Our plan is to define AD-specific TPR indices, initially focusing on miR-34a and its target, SIRT1, whose reduction is known to be associated with increased Tau and A242, two hallmarks of AD etiopathogene- sis; our ultimate goal is a  Tool-Box  of TPR indices, miR-34a/SIRT1-TPR being the first suchAD diagnostic, indicating not only disease presence, but also its progress (and even drug efficacy monitoring), a huge strate- gic gain for the victims of this costly disease, and our society at large",

In developed countries, adults, particularly the elderly, experience a higher death rate due to diarrhea than children. Results from in vitro and preliminary in vivo studies lead us to hypothesize that oral administration of recombinant human lactoferrin as a medical food might be able to prevent and reduce antibiotic associated diarrhea in adults. The present fast track SBIR Phase I and II proposal plans totest this hypothesis with a clinical trial involving 260 subjects. In phase I, we will produce 25 kg of testing materials, recombinant human lactoferrin, from rice grain and at the same time obtain IRB approval of the clinical trial. In phase II, we will conduct the clinical study in four test sites in Baltimore. We expect that the study will prove that recombinant human lactoferrin is able to reduce incidence of antibiotic associated diarrhea by 50% and if patients do get diarrhea, the diarrhea days will be shorten by half.

My Health Care Manager (MHCM) has developed the Senior Care Navigation System (SCANSTM) to provide decision support to Geriatric Care Managers (GCMs), registered nurses and social workers, in the construction of consumer-side care plans for seniors and their caregivers. SCANSTM provides interventions and practical, real-world tools to extend the healthy and active years of life and assist families with critical decisions. Automatic acquisition of knowledge will help to augment MHCM&#039;s research staff in order to keep the SCANSTM knowledge base up to date for providing effective and efficient senior care plans. The overall goal for this Fast-Track SBIR research will be for MHCM in collaboration with the Indiana University&#039;s School of Informatics to develop an automated knowledge acquisition system that will acquire knowledge from health literature pertinent to senior care. This knowledge in the form of  best practices  will be used as part of the SCANSTM decision support system. Theautomatic acquisition of knowledge will greatly increase the overall productivity of the SCANS Research Team. The improvements in quality, timeliness, breadth, depth, and volume of research will be a marketable feature of the SCANSTM product. During PhaseI, MHCM will validate the feasibility of automatically acquiring knowledge in literature for senior care planning. MHCM will develop knowledge extraction methodologies for geriatric care in Phase I and will implement 3 of 40 MHCM defined care categories. Phase II will expand on the algorithm(s) developed during Phase I to include an additional 30-37 care categories. MCHM will also develop geriatric care intervention discovery algorithms to be used in finding, updating, and evaluating new knowledge to be included in the SCANSTM knowledgebase. MHCM will verify and validate the feasibility of the knowledge acquisition methods by comparing the current manual research process with an automated acquisition process using literature. MHCM will then augment the knowledge discovered through text mining with an existing Bayesian Reasoning Network model to make the SCANS TM an efficient decision support system for geriatric care. With the completion of Phases I and II, commercialization of the knowledge acquisition system for SCANSTM can then proceed in Phase III of the project.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this Fast-Track research application is to improve the quality, depth and breadth of research reference material held in the Senior Care Navigation System, SCANS, knowledgebase used by our Geriatric Care Managers. The knowledgebase helps our GCM&#039;s to prepare comprehensive care plans for elders and their care givers covering 40 care categories. The intent is to expand the knowledge of and coordinate the services available to seniors and their families for improving their quality of life and for extending independent living.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Nearly 70 million people in the US suffer from arthritis related conditions[1, 2]. Of these, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cases constitute approximately 3 million. RA is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease that primarily results in erosive destruction of articular joints with additional variable extra-articular effects. The growing elderly population coupled with the prevalence of RA in the elderly age group (up to a third of cases) highlights the critical need to develop effective treatment options to reduce the health care burden of the US in the coming couple of decades.  NovelMed has developed a potent anti-arthritic pharmaceutical agent YalcioMab that specifically blocks the activation of the alternative complement pathway. This compound prevents TNF-1 (tumor necrosis factor 1) production by monocytes; effectively inhibits inflammation and joint destruction in an animal model of RA; and exhibits a good safety profile in initial studies. This Fast Track application proposes to further develop YalcioMab as a potent anti-arthritic agent through 1) evaluation of its efficacy in prophylactic and therapeutic models of rabbit models of antigen-induced arthritis (AIA); 2) characterization and in vivo testing of its chimeric version c-YalcioMab; and 3) production, characterization, in vivo and toxicological evaluation of its humanized version h-YalcioMab.  NovelMed expects that following this important research, h-YalcioMab will be ready as a product for pre-clinical IND (investigational new drug) work. Based on the preliminary results obtained so far, NovelMed projects that h-YalcioMab treatment will be more specific than current drugs, infliximab (RemicadeTM) and Enbrel, which also target basal levels of TNF-1 in the humanbody. NovelMed has filed patent applications protecting YalcioMab and its analogs and has exclusive rights on the new biologic. NovelMed is supported by funds from the NIH and a couple of investors, and is a fully equipped drug discovery company focusingon biological agents. Overall, the proposed work is in the direction of a cost-effective, efficacious and safe therapeutic agent for preventing joint destruction in RA patients through regulation of a specific complement- mediated inflammatory response.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects nearly 3 million individuals in the US, yet no effective and safe treatment is available. Current therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which primarily target inflammation, are not effective in all patients. NovelMed has developed a potent anti-arthritic pharmaceutical agent that shows excellent results in limited animal model studies. NovelMed&#039;s therapeutic agent prevents activation of neutrophils, monocytes and platelets, which together drive inflammation and joint destruction associated with RA. This application proposes to develop the pharmaceutical agent through in vitro and in vivo studies so as to file an IND application with the FDA in the near future.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The recent call for elimination of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum and eventual eradication of all malaria has focused attention on this disease, which is responsible for hundreds of millions of cases and a million deaths annually. An ideal tool for eliminating P. falciparum, the causative agent of 99% of all malaria deaths, would be a highly effective vaccine that prevents blood stage infection and thereby prevents all disease and transmission. When attenuated P. falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ) are administered by the bite of infected mosquitoes, gt 90% of human volunteers are protected against experimental P. falciparum challenge and protection lasts at least 10 months. Sanaria&#039;s goal is to develop and commercialize an attenuated PfSPZ vaccine that prevents P. falciparum blood stage infection in gt 90% of recipients; a vaccine that could be used to eliminate P. falciparum from the world. This vaccine has the potential for gt  1 billion annual revenues in markets in the developed and developing world. Sanaria has succeeded in accomplishing the goals of its Phase II SBIR grant, 5R44AI055229-05, including robust, reproducible, and consistent manufacture and release of clinical lots of the PfSPZ Vaccine, and in 2009 will be initiating a Phase 1 clinical trial to assess safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of the PfSPZ Vaccine. After demonstrating safety in that trial, the goal is to move as swiftly as possible to safety and proof of concept efficacy studies in African adults, young children, and infants. These will be followed by additional Phase 2 studies, including dose optimization studies, and then pivotal Phase 3 studies to support licensure. Based on the results of 6 successful production campaigns undercGMPs, which have manufactured PfSPZ Vaccine for the first clinical trials, Sanaria has identified specific aspects of its manufacturing process and control assays that represent either bottlenecks or opportunities for significant improvement. The goal ofthis proposal is to focus on these bottlenecks and opportunities by conducting innovative research and development to establish and finalize a more efficient, scaled-up, validated manufacturing and release process for the PfSPZ Vaccine. To address this overarching goal Sanaria will reduce the quantity of blood products and personnel used for the production of gametocytes to feed to mosquitoes, increase the efficiency of mosquito production, and increase the numbers of sporozoites produced and harvested from infected mosquitoes. The increased efficiency will be accompanied by scale-up of the entire manufacturing process, and improvements in throughput, specificity and sensitivity of assays used for in process control during manufacture and release of the PfSPZ Vaccine. An essential element of this application is that all of these improvements will be validated for subsequent production of PfSPZ Vaccine under cGMPs. Success in this Phase II SBIR renewal will leave Sanaria ideally placed to design and constructa facility in which the PfSPZ Vaccine can be optimally manufactured for pivotal Phase 3 studies, licensure and commercial launch of the PfSPZ Vaccine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malaria causes 500 million clinical cases and 1-3 million deaths annually, is responsible for gt1% loss of GDP in Africa annually and is a serious concern for travelers and military personnel. Sanaria&#039;s goal is to develop and commercialize a gt90% protective malaria vaccine for three primary markets with a potential for gt 1 billionannual revenues: 1) Travelers from the developed world to malaria endemic areas. 2) Infants and young children in the developing world. 3) Adolescent girls in the developing world. Success in this Phase II SBIR renewal will leave Sanaria ideally placed todesign and construct a facility in which the company&#039;s malaria vaccine can be optimally manufactured for pivotal Phase 3 studies, licensure and commercial launch.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The continuing increase in the number of surgery, transplantation, cancer and other immunocompromized patients, that need treatment for fungal infections, together with the fact that only one new class of antifungal therapeutics has been introduced to the market in over 30 years has created an immediate need for new and better antifungal drugs with novel modes of action (MoA).  The natural product compound Aureobasidin A (AbA) is a potent, fungicidal drug with a novel MoA that also does not elicit resistant pathogen strains. Unfortunately, although efficacious and very well tolerated, native AbA&#039;s target spectrum is too narrow to be clinically attractive. Of the two major human pathogens, Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp., AbA only has efficacy against Candida. However, exploratory synthetic chemistry work has demonstrated that structural modifications can convert native AbA into compounds that have close to equal efficacy against both pathogens. The required chemistry, however, is complicated and expensive, to the extent that it constitutes a barrier against development of these compounds into commercial products.  The overall goal of the project outlined in this proposal is to use a novel genetic engineering approach to introduce the structural modifications required to confer Aspergillus spp. activity to AbA, thereby avoiding the high cost of synthetic chemistry and allow commercialization of an efficacious, well tolerated antifungal drug with a novel MoA.  In Phase I, the gene, aba 1, encoding the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) complex responsible for synthesis of AbA in the producer organism was identified, cloned, sequenced and mapped. Phase II has to date produced methodologies and a set of genetic tools thatallow efficient engineering of the aba 1 gene. Also accomplished to date is the successful engineering of the aba 1 gene, the generation of engineered strains producing structurally modified AbA molecules and the generation of significant new data on the unique properties of fungal NRPS complexes. Production of structurally altered cyclic peptides by engineering of a fungal NRPS complex has not been reported previously. The project has to date produced two publications, one issued patent and one pending patent application. The continued Phase II work will involve engineering of the specific modifications required to confer Aspergillus spp. activity to AbA and the preparation/selection of a producer strain capable of high production levels.  Successful completion of the project will: [1] provide an efficient, well-tolerated drug to a market with a strong demand for new products; [2] address a very immediate need from a growing patient population which currently have very few treatment options; and [3] provideproof of concept and critical tools for a novel and potentially very powerful approach to the discovery of new and improved therapeutics.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The continuing increase in the number of surgery, transplantation, cancer and other immunocompromized patients, that need treatment for fungal infections, has generated an immediate unmet need for new antifungal drugs with novel modes of action. The proposed project will add a potent, efficacious, well-tolerated and economical drug to an inventory of antifungal drugs that currently is both limited and associated with significant limitations.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sepsis is a prevalent and life-threatening medical condition characterized by development of a dysregulated inflammatory immune response and associated tissue damage. This dysregulated inflammatory response is initiatedby activation of Toll-Like receptor (TLR) signaling in response to bacteria and/or bacterial products, such as LPS. Current treatments are limited and involve the use of antibiotics to control infection and supportive measures to assist patients with multi-organ failure. New treatment strategies are needed to address the dysregulated immune response seen in patients with sepsis, thereby limiting tissue damage and enhancing survival rates. We have identified and characterized a novel peptide, termed P13, apotent yet temporary inhibitor of intracellular TLR signaling. Studies performed under the current Phase II SBIR grant have i) demonstrated that P13 is a potent inhibitor of in vivo serum inflammatory mediators in animals administered both low-dose and high-dose LPS, ii) established the efficacy of P13 to significantly enhance survival rates in a lethal high-dose LPS-induced model of sepsis, iii) established the efficacy of P13 to enhance survival rates in the clinically relevant cecal ligation and puncture(CLP) polymicrobial sepsis model, and iv) demonstrated in pilot experiments a favorable safety profile for P13. P13, when administered after initiation of systemic inflammation and disease, improved the survival rate in these models 30-50% as compared with 0% survival in control treated animals. The primary goal of this Phase II Renewal Application is to complete all pre-clinical efficacy and safety testing required by the FDA for approval of this peptide as a new therapeutic in human clinical trials. Based on our studies showing efficacy of P13 to improve survival rates in sepsis pre- clinical models and data demonstrating a favorable safety profile, we propose in this Phase II Renewal Application to conduct all necessary studies required by the FDA to position P13 for human clinical trials. These studies will include establishing optimal P13 treatment parameters in the CLP model and development of a sensitive assay for detection of P13 in serum and tissues (specific aim #1). These studies will support appropriate P13 dosing and exposure parameters for the IND-enabling studies required by the FDA for drug approval. In support of the IND filing to the FDA for drug approval of P13, an optimal clinical treatment protocol and identification of biologic markers associated with P13 treatment will be determined (specific aim #2). Detailed IND-enabling studies for P13, providing a complete non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and toxicology data package will be performed (specific aim #3). At the conclusion ofthis Phase II Renewal Application an IND will be filed with the FDA for use of P13 in a Phase I human clinical trial.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New treatment options are needed for patients with bacterial-induced sepsis, a disease with increasing morbidity and mortality. We have identified a novel anti-inflammatory peptide that has demonstrated efficacy to limit inflammation and increase survival rates in an animal model of polymicrobial sepsis. Our current studies will complete all pre-clinical andsafety testing required for FDA approval of this peptide to initiate human clinical trials as a new treatment for sepsis.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is the leading cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Current antibiotic treatments exhibit failure rates as high as 18%, even when the organism is susceptible to the antibiotic being administered. The goal of this project is to address this critical medical need by identifying specific inhibitors of the type-three secretion system (T3SS) and developing them into novel therapeutic agents against P. aeruginosa. T3SS is the major virulence factor contributing to the establishment and dissemination of P. aeruginosa infections and is utilized by the bacterium to secrete and translocate toxin effectors into host phagocytes, thereby weakening the host&#039;s innate immune response. The presence of a functional T3SS is significantly associated with poor clinical outcomes and death in patients and markedly reduces survival in animal infection models. The T3SS inhibitors developed in this project will be administered therapeutically and prophylactically in combination with anti-pseudomonal agents to inhibit the T3SS-mediated intoxication of phagocytes and thereby potentiate a robust host innate immune response and enhance the activity of co-administered antibiotics. In Phase I, we discovered 15 novel inhibitors of P. aeruginosa T3SS in 3 different chemotypes, with the following properties propitious for further development: (a) novel, chemically tractable structures, (b) highest potency of any reported P. aeruginosa T3SS inhibitors (IC50=1-2 5g/ml), (c) selectivity indices (CC50/IC50) gt50, (d) favorable preliminary structure-activity relationships (SAR), including strict stereo-specificity of activity, clear definition of substituent size at the stereocenter, and identification of five modifications in three regions of the scaffold that increase potency; and (e) not subject to efflux in P. aeruginosa. Our strategy in Phase II is to optimize the most promising of these structures as preclinical candidates. Biochemical and molecular genetic approaches will be applied to identify the molecular target of these inhibitors and the frequency of mutation to resistance. Following toxicity and pharmacokinetic assessment, inhibitors will be tested for efficacy as single agents and in combination with anti-pseudomonal agent ceftazidime in two murine models of P. aeruginosa infection, acute pneumonia and bacteremia. The major milestone of this proposal is to select anti-T3SS pre-clinical candidates, which will be advanced to Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling toxicology and safety pharmacology studies in Phase III of this project. We will accomplish the following specific aims: (1) synthesize structurally diverse analogs of the phenoxyacetamide hit series based on structure-activity relationships; (2) prioritize analogs by potency and selectivity of T3SS inhibitory activity, as well as favorable ADME properties; (3) identify the molecular target of the phenoxyacetamide T3SS inhibitor series and the frequency of resistance; (4) determine acute toxicity, pharmacokinetic parameters, and efficacy of lead compounds in animal models.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacterial pathogens represents an unmet medical need. Type-three secretion is a mechanism used by many pathogenic bacteria to increase their virulence in human infections. Bacterial toxins secreted by this method reduce the protective effect of the infected individual&#039;s own innate immune system. Successful development of an inhibitor targeting this virulence mechanism will provide a new weapon to combat acute infections such as pneumonia and bacteremia.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The National Institutes of Health considers the development of therapeutics against potential bioterrorism agents a national research priority. There is a particular need for immunotherapeutics against Ebola virus (a Category A agent). Because of Ebola&#039;s lethality and reports that it has been weaponized, public health officials and defense agencies have mounted a concerted effort to encourage development of countermeasures for protecting civilian and military populations. There are currently no drugs available for preventing or treating Ebola virus infection. Passive immunization with antibodies has been shown to be effective against a wide variety of viruses. Because of their excellent safety profile and efficacy, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are a rapidly growing class of therapeutic drugs. Mapp has been developing MB-2003, a mAb based anti-Ebola product. The current configuration of MB-2003 consists of 3 mAbs that individually and in combination have been shown to provide significant prophylactic and therapeutic protection in mice. As a result of completion of the Phase 1 activities, the MB-2003 cocktail has also been shown to provide 100% protection in macaques against a highly lethal challenge. This is the first time antibodies have been shown to protect primates against Ebola - previous experiments with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies have failed to provide any protection. Because of the rapid onset and high lethality of Ebola virus, we anticipate the MB-2003 product will be administered intravenously as a pre-exposure and/or post-exposure prophylactic. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: Specific Aim 1. Determine the final MB-2003 product configuration. Tests in the macaque model will determine whether the final MB-2003 configuration will be one, two, or three mAbs. Dose ranging studies will be performed to identify the protective dose, and time course experiments will determine the therapeutic window for MB-2003. Specific Aim 2. Finalize the MB-2003 liquid formulation. An optimal liquid formulation for the mAb(s) selected in Aim 1 will be identified in collaboration with Formatech (Andover, MA). Specific Aim 3. Complete IND-enabling testing and submit an IND. MB-2003 will be manufactured and formulated under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). All IND- enabling pharmacology, toxicology, and Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) studies will be performed, with a final goal of filing an IND to support a Phase 1 human safety trial.

During the mid-to-late 1990s, advances in treatment slowed the progression of HIV to AIDS and related deaths. Unfortunately, the treatment often leads to the emergence of drug resistant mutants of HIV-1. The knowledge of the HIV-1 variants present in a patient is extremely important to effectively plan diseasemanagement. It is estimated that about 10% of HIV-1 infections in the US is caused by drug resistant HIV-1 variants and current guidelines recommend HIV-1 resistance genotyping before therapy and to monitor therapy effectiveness. However, current tests that rely on conventional DNA sequencing methods do not detect low-levels (lt 20%) of drug-resistant strains and therefore may not provide the necessary diagnostic information for effective treatments. The goal of this proposal is to develop a highly sensitive comprehensive and cost-effective system for HIV-1 resistance genotyping based on IBS&#039; high-speed massively parallel DNA sequencing system (RESIQ ). IBS&#039; sequencing-by-synthesis system is based on the use of cleavable fluorescent nucleotides with reversible terminator technology. These features enable efficient removal of fluorescent signals and sequencing of repeats. During Phase II, a prototype sequencing instrument prototype will be constructed and extensive validation of the prototype using validatedclinical samples will be performed. Dr. Daniel Kuritzkes, an expert in the HIV-1 treatment and resistance will serve as a consultant for this project. Successful accomplishment of the Phase II project will result in the development of highly effective andcomprehensive RESIQ  system for rapid, sensitive cost-effective HIV-1 drug resistance genotyping. 0        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed research is aimed at the development of a high-sensitivity sensitive, cost-effective HIV-1 resistance genotyping system which is powered by massively parallel DNA sequencing by synthesis (SBS). Compared to current technology based on DNA sequencing, the Intelligent Bio-Systems&#039; approach will be able to rapidly detect low levels (1-20%) of multiple drug resistant HIV-1 variants in patient&#039;s plasma. The major application of the SBS-GEN HIV-1 genotyping product will be the detection of the presence, at levels 1-20%, of the viral population with drug-resistance. The SBS-GEN HIV-1 genotyping system will be used in patients undergoing anti-retroviral drug therapy to monitor its effectiveness, changing the treatment regimen, or patients newly diagnosed with HIV-1 infection. 0",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a worldwide health problem, and its treatment and prevention remain a major challenge. Existing therapies are only partially effective and have serious side effects. No vaccine is currently available. RNA interference (RNAi) offers a novel therapeutic approach for treating HCV infections. We have identified a class of shRNAs, called sshRNAs, which have smaller length and appear to act via a somewhat different pathway than ordinary shRNAs or siRNAs. We have further identified very potent sshRNA (IC50 lt  10 pM) targeting the HCV internal ribosome entry site (IRES), a highly conserved and essential but  undruggable  part of the viral RNA. In Phase I, we tested a large number of chemically modifiedversions of these inhibitors to find types and patterns of modification that would stabilize them in serum without compromising their activity. We identified rules for effective modification and found that such modifications eliminate any stimulation of the innate immune system that can occur with unmodified sshRNAs, particularly if they are blunt-ended. These studies were recently published in two papers in RNA. In Phase II, we will: 1) synthesize chemically modified versions of our alternative lead shRNAusing the rules identified in Phase I, and verify their potency and lack of immunostimulatory properties; 2) find optimal combinations of lead shRNAs to minimize shRNA-mediated HCV viral resistant variants; 3) complete screening of nanoparticle formulations to identify the platform that provides the best sshRNA delivery to liver using a mouse reporter model; 4) investigate the toxicity of lead formulated shRNA; and 5) verify the therapeutic efficacy of lead formulated shRNA in an animal model that supportsHCV infection. Upon completion of this work, we will be in a very strong position to attract a partner to fund the remaining IND-enabling preclinical studies, file an IND, and proceed with clinical trials.

A two-year Phase I research has discovered novel molecules with potent antimalarial activity against both sensitive and resistant malaria strains in rodent models. Lead compounds are low in toxicity and possess high oral bioavailability and other ideal ADMET properties. The potential for development of resistance was confirmed to be small and a scalablechemical synthesis was also established. After pre-IND meeting with FDA, the proposed SBIR Phase II research was designed. Under Phase II support, we will perform: (I) Scale up synthesis of two lead compounds and cGMP manufacturing of one compound for GLPtoxicity studies; (II) Range-finding toxicity and pharmacokinetics in monkeys; (III) Repeat dose toxicity in monkeys; (IV) Antimalarial activity in Aotus monkeys infected with P. falciparum; (V) GLP toxicology studies: definitive 28-day toxicity study with toxicokinetic, functional observations battery and micronucleus evaluations. An investigational new drug (IND) application will be filed with FDA at the end of Phase II research. The novelty of the project is the discovery of new molecular entities. Theproject involves standard approaches to drug development, but the multidisciplinary team and multi-institution collaboration that has been assembled will accelerate the generation of clinical candidates.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malaria is one of the most common infectious diseases in the world. It affects approximately 250 million people and leads to 1-3 million death a year. The increasing prevalence of multiple drug resistant strains in most malaria endemic areas has significantly reduced the efficacy of current antimalarial drugs for prophylaxis and treatment of this disease. This project focuses on the development of a novel therapeutic agent for preventing and treating P. falciparum malaria. The novelty of the research is the discovery of new molecular entities.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective for this Phase II application is to develop a cartridge-based automated molecular diagnostic platform to rapidly and cost-effectively detect and identify influenza viruses. The system will automate all keyfunctions for sample processing including extraction, amplification, colorimetric detection on a low- density microarray, and image/result interpretation. The idea is to make the system easy to use so that personnel with no PCR or microarray experience could obtain an unequivocal answer with minimal hands- on time. The motivation for the proposed work is the tremendous impact influenza viruses have on human and animal health and the need for rapid, inexpensive tools for strain surveillance. The intent is to significantly enhance influenza virus surveillance by providing a new tool to affordably and rapidly identify influenza viruses without expertise in PCR methods and without exclusive reliance on existing, sometimes poor performing, rapid immunoassays. The marketing plan involves providing the instrument to customers at no capital cost (i.e., the  reagent rental  concept). Therefore, the instrument will be designed with simplicity and low cost in mind. Our market entry point will be influenza surveillancesites, such as state public health labs, where the FluChip assay could be used to track viruses without the need to diagnose patients. Long term, we will use data acquired in these early studies to formulate an FDA submission for 510(k) clearance for use as an in vitro diagnostic.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a Phase II proposal to advance development of disubstituted tetrahydro-triazolo-pyrimidines (TTPs) as specific inhibitors of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) secretion in chronic infection. High serum levels of HBsAg (antigenemia) are believed to underlie immunotolerance toward the infection. Although they are clinically beneficial, the current small-molecule therapies rarely result in significant loss of serum HBsAg, elicit varying degrees of resistance, and are not curative. The parent compound of the TTPs was discovered in a high throughput screening campaign for HBsAg secretion inhibitors in a cell culture model. As proposed in our Phase I project, we 1) carried out extensive SAR studies to explore the salient features of the original structure, resulting in an increase in potency of more than 10-fold and improved chemical tractability; 2) confirmed the prediction that this compound family is active in inhibiting HBsAg secretion of HBV variants that are resistant to current small molecule drugs; and 3) identified formulation conditions for two lead compounds, improved solubility through salt formation, and characterized them in vivo for single dose ADMET properties. In Phase II of our project, we propose the following aims: 1) characterize the racemic properties of one lead compound, to determine whether enantiomeric separation will be necessary; 2) develop scale-up chemistry protocols amenable to eventual GMP manufacture, and produce sufficient non-GMPmaterial for Phase II in vivo studies; 3) carry out dose range-finding ADMET studies on the lead compounds; 4) determine efficacy of the lead compounds on antigenemia in mouse and woodchuck models of hepatitis B, with an eye on possible toxicity due to HBsAg retention in the liver; 5) assess the potential for synergy in combination studies with our compound and current antivirals in cell culture and in vivo models; 6) submit the best lead compound to GLP- compliant IND-enabling studies. Concurrent with theabove aims, we will 7) attempt to identify the precise molecular target of the TTPs through affinity studies. At the end of Phase 2, a TTP compound will be ready for IND filing and eventual clinical trials.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatitis B is listed by NIAID as a Small Business High Priority Area of Interest. In response, this is a proposal for the development of a drug that lowers blood serum levels of hepatitis B virus surface antigen. This new drug would function through a different mechanismthan the currently approved anti-hepatitis B drugs, and may be of use in multi-drug  cocktails  to treat cases of drug-resistant infection, and to extend efficacy. At the end of the proposed project, the novel compound would be ready to enter clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This research project aims to develop fluidic glycan microarrays for the quantitative profiling and characterization of pathogens, and for the screening of pathogen inhibitors and the development of vaccines. The approach targets a common mechanism at the initial stage of pathogen attack: the recognition of and attachment onto host cells via multivalent interaction between receptor proteins and glycan molecules. The tremendous variation in glycans and the complexity inmultivalent interaction have necessitated the use of large-scale profiling and analysis techniques, particularly glycan microarrays. The proposed fluidic approach overcomes two major limitations of current glycan microarray technology: the lack of mobilityand the difficulty in quantitatively controlling glycan density. Multivalent cell surface interactions often require mobility of the fluidic cell membrane environment and are strong functions of surface glycan density. In order to quantitatively apply theglycan microarray in profiling and characterization, one must ensure mobility and control of glycan density over a broad range. The specific aims during phase-II are: Aim 1: using haemagglutinin, a predominant antigen on influenza viruses, and the dendritic cell receptor DC-SIGN, a binding receptor for mannose moieties on HIV-1 virus, as model systems and establish the roles of secondary interactions in binding affinity, avidity, and specificity. These experiments will establish the general applicability of the fluidic microarrays in profiling and characterizing complex pathogen-cell surface interactions; Aim 2: using several strains of E. coli with varying affinity and selectivity towards mannose as model systems and establishing that the fluidic and density gradient glycan microarray can be used to quantitatively profile the variability in binding affinity and multivalency among strains of the same species. Quantifying such variability is essential to the understanding and surveillance of how random mutations can lead to new pathogen threats, as exemplified by the recent outbreaks of avian flu and swine flu; Aim 3: To establish chemical procedures for the optimization of the fluidic glycan microarray, including spatial confinement of the supported lipid bilayer spots, efficient blocking of surfaces outside the spotted areas, recoverability in drying and rehydration of the microarrays, and long term stability of content glycan microarrays. These practical issues must be addressed in developing the fluidic glycan microarray as a viable product. The long-term goal of this RandD plan is to develop an effective high-throughput tool in the combat against pathogen threats.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This research project aims to develop cell-membrane mimickingmicroarrays of sugar molecules for the profiling and characterization of pathogens, and for the screening of vaccines and inhibitors against pathogens. )",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This SBIR Phase II proposal is a plan to further develop a novel therapeutic approach that will save the lives of patients with sepsis. Despite the increased understanding of the complex pathophysiology of sepsis, severe sepsis still results in significant morbidity and mortality. As such, there is an urgent unmet medical need for an effective novel therapy for septic patients. The global market potential for sepsis treatment is estimated at over  30 billion annually. Thus, successful development of a new anti-sepsis therapy will not only have a positive impact on health care, but also will have significant commercial benefits. A balanced inflammatory response is an essential element of a successful host defense after injury. However, excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines may cause further tissue injury. Macrophages/Kupffer cells play important roles in producing proinflammatory cytokines in sepsis. The nervous system reflexively regulates the inflammatory response in real time. We have demonstrated that the release of the sympathetic neurotransmitter, norepinephrine (NE), from the gut is increased in sepsis, and that NE potentiates endotoxin-induced TNF-( upregulation via the A subtype of (2-adrenoceptors (i.e.,  (2A-AR) expressed on the surface of Kupffer cells. Pre-treatment with a specific (2A-AR antagonist, 2-[(4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl) methyl]-2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-1H-isoindole maleate (BRL- 44408 maleate), downregulates TNF-(, attenuates tissue injury,and improves survival in a rat model of polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). However, it remained unknown whether the delayed administration of BRL-44408 maleate (which is more clinically relevant) reduces sepsis-induced mortality as well. Accordingly, the primary objective of our completed Phase I project was to determine the effect of delayed administration of BRL-44408 maleate on sepsis-induced inflammation, organ injury, and mortality. We have clearly shown that administration of BRL-44408 maleate at 5 h after CLP (i.e., at the early stage of sepsis) is protective in experimental animals. These results have established the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed Phase II project. We therefore continue to hypothesizethat the administration of the small molecule drug candidate BRL-44408 maleate in established sepsis attenuates tissue injury and improves survival. In this Phase II proposal, we will perform detailed toxicological evaluation and pharmacokinetic characterization, and determine the optimal protective dose(s) and time- course of BRL-44408 maleate in sepsis in the rat. In order to advance the technology to clinical trials, the efficacy of BRL-44408 maleate will be tested in a rabbit model of sepsis. These proposed studies should provide important preclinical data that will help us filing an IND application to the FDA to initiate clinical trials in order to obtain commercial utilization of BRL-44408 maleate as a safe and effective therapy for sepsis.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death in intensive care units. Over 210,000 people succumb to this overwhelming infection in the United States annually. A recent epidemiologic study estimated that more than 750,000 people develop sepsis each year at a cost of  16.7 billion nationally. Given the intensive and prolonged care necessary to treat patients with sepsis, the economic burden is profound. Thus, there is an urgent unmet medical need for an effective novel therapy for patients with sepsis.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis with an estimated two billion people currently infected worldwide and over nine million new cases detected annually worldwide. This is the largest killer of patients with HIV/AIDS. Current methods of diagnosis are complex, time-consuming, unreliable or unaffordable for most countries where the disease presents a significant public health threat. New diagnostics are critically needed to address the global tuberculosis burden and improve control programs. Our Phase I studies have clearly demonstrated the feasibility of developing a rapid and accurate test for tuberculosis. In collaboration with the Infectious Disease Research Institute, scientists at Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Inc. have identified a set of novel seroreactive antigens, designed several highly performing polyepitope fusion proteins, and applied the selected antigens in the Chembio&#039;s innovative immunoassay format, the Dual Path Platform (DPP(R)), with proven high accuracy of rapid serodiagnosis. We found that a DPP test prototype had a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 95% in evaluations with serum samples obtained from culture-confirmed patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis from endemic regions in Brazil and Indonesia. In this Phase II application we propose to complete development and evaluation of the rapid diagnostic test for tuberculosis which will have required performance and operational characteristics. The specific aims are to: 1) optimize assay design, 2) determine diagnostic test performance, and 3) validate test production protocols in preparation for regulatory approval. We expect that the proposed DPP assay will demonstrate improved sensitivity and specificity over the existing rapid tests and will be applicable for expedited diagnosis of tuberculosis worldwide.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis remains one of the leading causes of mortality due to infectious disease worldwide. The current methods for diagnosis of tuberculosis are time-consuming, complex and laborious, and/or too expensive for routine use in resource-limited settings where most of patients live. The delayed or missed diagnosis leads to spreading of infection, progression of disease,and increased mortality. The research proposed here aims at developing a simple and rapid (20 minutes) point-of-care diagnostic test that would improve control programs by helping accurately detect new cases of tuberculosis, enabling timely antibiotic therapy, and preventing disease transmission. In addition to the visual reading, there will be an option for automated readout of the test result. The proposed assay will be fully validated and evaluated with serum samples from six countries representing various geographical areas and epidemiological setting associated with tuberculosis. These studies will demonstrate superior sensitivity and specificity as well as improved operational characteristics over the existing technologies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Yellow fever virus (YFV) was at one time endemic in the United States and represents a mosquito-borne emerging/re-emerging human pathogen that causes up to 20% mortality. The current live attenuated YFV vaccine was developed in 1936 and following the development of a virus seed lot system, it has not been modified or otherwise improved in over 50 years. According to the CDC, this vaccine causes 47 severe adverse events (defined as resulting in hospitalization, long-termdisability, or death) per million vaccinations. More recent reports indicate that vaccine-associated neurological disease occurs at an approximate rate of 1 case per 10,000 vaccinations. YFV vaccination of infants lt 9 months of age has been contraindicated since the 1960&#039;s due to high rates of vaccine-associated encephalitis in this age group. The overall (all ages) mortality rate following YFV vaccination is estimated at 1 to 2 deaths per million doses. More recently, YFV vaccination has been found to cause severe viscerotropic disease in a substantial number of patients gt60 years of age (an incidence rate of approximately 1:50,000 doses administered) and these cases result in approximately 50% mortality. This indicates that YFV vaccination is not only contraindicated in infants, but is also not recommended in the elderly due to the increased risk of severe and life-threatening disease. Increased monitoring efforts have also documented several cases of vaccine-related fatalities in young, otherwise healthyadults with no known pre-existing immune deficiencies. There is currently no alternative to live YFV vaccination. In this proposal, we will prepare an inactivated YFV vaccine under GMP conditions and perform the necessary safety, potency, and stability studies required for a future IND submission to the FDA. This vaccine is based on proprietary new technology used to develop inactivated vaccine formulations that can be used to immunize vulnerable populations such as infants and the elderly, in addition toother healthy populations. Preliminary data is provided demonstrating that an H2O2-YFV vaccine is feasible to manufacture, highly immunogenic, and provides full protective immunity against lethal viscerotropic yellow fever. In this project, we will prepareclinical grade vaccine under cGMP conditions, perform in vitro and in vivo safety/toxicity tests, and determine vaccine potency and long-term stability. The successful completion of these objectives will result in cGMP-grade vaccine material suitable forfuture initiation of a Phase I clinical trial.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this Phase II proposal, we provide strong preliminary data from our Phase I application demonstrating the antigenicity, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of a proprietary new vaccine platform that can be used to develop a safer and highly effective YFV vaccine.",

Specifically, a two-week regimen of oral TPX-6001 and TPX-7001 achieved a 50-90 % reduction in the severity of multiple disease indicators in mice with advanced IBD. Importantly, co-administration of ATRA with TGF?1 was essential to achieving maximal therapeutic efficacy and disease amelioration was associated with enhanced T-regulatory cell activity in the colon.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a novel automated platform to enable rapid, sensitive, user-friendly, and cost-effective screening for the antibiotic resistant bacteria that frequently cause serious healthcare associated infections. Every year, about 100,000 deaths result from 2 million serious healthcare associated infections at an estimated cost of  35B. About 20,000 fatalities are caused by the bacterium methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Many healthy individuals are colonized with MRSA. When these MRSA carriers are hospitalized, the resistant microbe can cause serious infections for the carrier and others in the hospital. Several recent studies have shown that hospitals can significantly decrease the number ofhealthcare associated infections by using rapid tests to screen admitted patients for MRSA colonization and then treating the colonized patient with rigorous infection control procedures. New rapid MRSA tests based on PCR are fast, but are either too expensive or too complex to be implemented in most hospitals. Traditional microbiological methods for screening patients for MRSA are inexpensive but are too slow (1-2 days) to most effectively lower infection rates. We recently completed a Phase I project demonstrating the feasibility of a novel, rapid, simple, and cost-effective method for MRSA screening that should for the first time allow any hospital to implement rapid testing for infection control. The platform technology uses low-cost non-magnified digital imaging to rapidly count individual fluorescently labeled S. aureus cells. The test determines whether a patient&#039;s sample contains MRSA by testing for S. aureus cells that can grow in antibiotic-containing media during a brief incubation. The rapid (3.3hr) Phase I MRSA test&#039;s analytical sensitivity is comparable to PCR tests (10 CFU/sample). When applied to clinical nasal samples (n=163), the test showed high clinical sensitivity (95%) and specificity (98%) comparable to the on-market PCR tests. We alsodesigned, developed, and integrated a fully functional automated bench top analyzer prototype and developed and manufactured a low-cost consumable prototype for the MultiPath MRSA test. Here we propose to build on our Phase I work to develop a prototype automated platform and MRSA test cartridge that can be used in subsequent Phase III beta field trials. Specifically we aim to (1) further decrease time to results and develop optimized stable reagents; (2) develop a low-cost MultiPath MRSA/SA test cartridge;(3) develop a low-cost automated beta MultiPath analyzer; (4) integrate and verify the platform functionality; and (5) demonstrate the performance of the MultiPath MRSA/S. aureus (MRSA/SA) test. Achieving these Specific Aims will enable subsequent Phase III beta field testing that will in turn support a future regulatory submission. The MultiPath platform will also be able to accommodate a broad menu of tests for agents that cause healthcare associated infections (e.g., vancomycin resistant Enterococcus and C. difficile), infectious viruses, food pathogens, toxins, molecular disease markers, and drug discovery targets.",

The parasite has been found to persist in blood products collected from infected individuals, thereby posing a serious transfusion safety risk. Moreover, Chagas&#039; disease has been imported to non-endemic countries including the United States due to the extensive immigration of residents from Latin America.

Recent studies by the American Red Cross and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have revealed a progressive increase in Chagas&#039; seroprevalence in the U.S., reaching levels as high as one in 5,400 blood donors in areas with large immigrant populations such as Los Angeles. As an inevitable consequence of the rise in Chagas&#039;-positive blood donors, cases of transfusion-transmitted Chagas&#039; disease have been documented in the United States and Canada in recent years. Chagas&#039; disease has also been shown to be transmissible congenitally and by organ transplantation. These facts underscore the increasing attention to Chagas&#039; disease as a public health and blood safety issue, and the need for more effective means to screen and identify T. cruzi - infected individuals and blood donations in the U.S. and worldwide. At present, screening assays have been approved for blood donors, but no validated confirmatory assay exists for Chagas&#039; disease. Radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) has been in use for this purpose, but has not been validated and is not readily accessible or practical for the majority of blood bank and clinical laboratory users. In Phase I, we have developed a prototype Chagas immunoblot assay based on a combination of native and recombinant antigens for detection of T. cruzi antibodies and differentiation from cross-reactive pathogens including Leishmania. This assay has shown extremely high sensitivity and specificity in preliminary studies. We propose in Phase II to complete and scale up the immunoblot assay for manufacturing, validate its performance in a clinical study with blood donor and patient serum samples, and submit for regulatory approval for blood screening and clinical diagnostic use.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chagas disease has become a significant threat to public health and to the blood supply, both in the U.S. and worldwide, due to increasing immigration from endemic areas. While screening tests for Chagas&#039; antibodies are available, no confirmatory test has been validated or approved. In this project we propose to complete development, validate and submit for regulatory approval a confirmatory immunoblot test for Chagas&#039; disease, for use in patient diagnosis and blood donor screening.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  ImmuRx is developing a novel and potent immunotherapeutic product to stimulate the immune system. This will significantly increase the efficacy of existing and new therapeutic vaccines for the treatment of cancers suchas melanoma, lymphoma and lung cancer and for chronic infectious diseases such as Hepatitis C. The barrier to the induction of protective, therapeutic immunity to cancer antigens has been the inability to create vaccines that can elicit very high numbersof tumor-reactive T cells in the cancer and patient microenvironment. The innovative ImmuRx approach takes advantage of the novel and patented synergistic impact resulting from the combined adjuvant activity of two different immune system activators, a CD40 agonist and IFN-(2b or a Toll-like receptor agonist (TLR*).    ImmRx&#039;s unique approach is that the combination therapy activates both the adaptive and innate immune system in vivo, as opposed to the approach of stimulating effector T cell expansion ex vivo, and this will leads to a long lasting and effective immunity. Further, it provides a much more effective means of stimulating protective immunity in patients compared to single agent products. CD40 agonists, TLR agonists, and IFN( have all been tried separately in the clinic for treatment of immune-responsive cancers and the results have generally been disappointing. INtron(r) A (IFN-(2b) is a commercially available therapeutic used to treat patients with advanced/high-risk melanoma, but use of this product has resulted in marginal survival gains at best and at a cost of significant toxicity.    ImmuRx has demonstrated a significant increase in antigen-specific T cell activation in murine models. Given this potent impact on immune function, we expect this product will provide a breakthrough that may finally unlock the potential of active immunotherapy for a wide variety of cancers and chronic infectious disease. The competitive advantage of the ImmuRx platform has been demonstrated in animal testing in solid tumors, hematologic cancers and infectious disease. The initial therapeutic target for ImmuRx&#039;s product is advanced melanoma, a devastating cancer that has a low but reproducible response to immunomodulatory agents. This validates the use of ImmuRx&#039;s active vaccine approach for this disease. IFN-(2b as a single agent is approved for treatment of Stage III melanoma, but has marginal effect on the overall survival. ImmuRx&#039;s adjuvant platform and vaccine technology will provide clinicians with a significant improvement over IFN-( monotherapy, enabling a single treatment to stimulate high frequencies of tumor-specific effector T cells and to increase tumor regression in late stage melanoma.    The funding requested for this SBIR Phase II award will be used to perform step-wise and sequential IND-enabling activities that will propel this exciting technology towards the clinic and its eventual approval for use in the treatment of cancers in humans.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ImmuRx is developing a novel and powerful immunotherapeutic product to stimulate the immune system. This will significantly increase the efficacy of existing and new therapeutic vaccines for treatment of cancers such as melanoma, lymphoma and lung cancer and for chronic infectious diseasessuch as Hepatitis C. The product will consist of a single injection that will increase both types of immune system function and will provide a long lasting and effective response. The initial product will be developed and tested for efficacy in advanced melanoma. This proposal requests funding for development activities that will enable ImmuRx to move the product towards eventual human clinical evaluation but does not request funding for clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Through Phase I studies, we have identified five lead small molecule compounds with drug-like properties that  activate innate immune response pathways and inhibit the replication of RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus  (HCV), influenza virus (FLU), and West Nile virus (WNV). There is a tremendous commercial demand for new antiviral products with novel mechanisms of action that target a broad spectrum of viruses. Most previous and ongoing pharmaceutical development programs involve screening for inhibitors of essential virus enzymes, with comparatively little investment in drugs that modulate the host immune response to infection. In this  proposal, we focus drug development efforts on the host side of the virus-host interaction in order to discover  and develop new antiviral products with novel mechanisms of action that are more effective and less sensitive to virus escape through mutation. In Phase 1, high-throughput screening of a 20,000-compound maximally  diverse library, as well as a targeted library that was comprised of small molecules predicted by in silico modeling to bind to the RIG-I receptor, allowed identification of drug-like activators of an IRF-3 responsive  promoter. Compound hits were counter-screened for target specificity and cytotoxicity, and validated for IRF-3 activation/nuclear localization, dose-dependent activation of interferon-stimulated gene (ISG)-reporter expression, and the ability to induce endogenous ISG protein expression in native 293 cells. Antiviral, mechanistic, and medicinal chemistry characterization of the hits resulted in the identification of five fully-validated lead compounds suitable for optimization and further pharmaceutical development. Phase 1 lead compounds decrease viralprotein expression, RNA release, and infectious virus production in cell culture models of HCV, WNV and FLU. Genomic profiling demonstrates that lead agonists can activate a discrete antiviral gene program composed of a limited number of relevant innate immune targets. Based upon this initial effort, three Specific Aims are proposed for Phase 2. In Specific Aim 1, we will use strategically designed compound derivatives and biological and physiochemical assays to enhance lead compound potency and antiviral activity and identify lead structural classes and optimized drug leads for further characterization in exploratory tolerability and pharmacokinetic studies. In Specific Aim 2, the mechanism of action and scope of antiviral activity of lead structural classes will be characterized. Finally in Specific Aim 3, we will define the repeat-dose tolerability and in vivo antiviral properties of a small number of optimized drug leads in rodent  models in order to support the selection of one lead and one back-up preclinical candidate for further  commercial development. Key program innovations include the development of RIG-I-targeted antiviral drugs with a broad spectrum of action and drug-like physiochemical properties. The significance of the program derives from the global burden of viral diseases that may be addressed by these new drug candidates.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have utilized a unique drug discovery strategy to identify potential new antiviral drugs that work by activating a faster, more potentimmune response to fight off virus infection. Our goal is to optimize lead candidates for further development as antiviral drugs for a variety of viruses, including influenza virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and West Nile virus. Because these drugs will activate the natural immune response, they are likely to be more effective and less prone to failure resulting from viral drug resistance.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): H5N1 is a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus that can cause severe disease and death in humans. H5N1 is spreading rapidly in bird populations world-wide and there is great concern that this virus will begin to transmit between people and cause a global pandemic catastrophe. Vaccines are the cornerstone strategy for combating avian flu but there are complex challenges facing us today including, (1) the inability to manufacture the vast numbers of safe and effective doses needed to prevent infection on a world-wide scale; (2) the fact that the current vaccines are ineffective and require large doses, and (3), virus strains are continually changing, which complicates vaccine strain selection. TRIA Bioscience Corp. is developing a novel adjuvanted vaccine for pandemic H5N1 Flu that should solve many of the scientific and technological barriers confronting this field. The vaccine antigen is recombinant H5 haemagglutinin (rH5), which uses a production process that simplifies many of the manufacturing issues associated with conventional vaccines, and the adjuvant (GLA-SE) that combines two clinically-validated strategies for augmenting vaccine performance, a synthetic Toll-Like Receptor-4 agonist, GLA, and an oil-in-water emulsion, SE. We are building on our compelling Phase I SBIR data by proposing activities leading up through an IND. First, we will compare GLA-SE activity against two simpler GLA-formulations designed to streamline adjuvant development and regulatory approval. Second, we will establish vaccine protection in ferret challenge models and establish safety and immunogenicity end-points in non-human primates. Third, we will manufacture and release cGMP-grade H5 protein and adjuvant, and obtain FDA clearance for a Phase I clinical trial. The results from this study will provide a relevant measure of dose sparing for vaccine manufacturers and inform clinicians about a new tool for inducing broad immunity against drifted strains of H5N1 virus. The US and world governments are investing billions of dollars in pandemic preparedness measures and TRIA will be well-positioned to participate in this market. This vaccine&#039;s design is broadly applicable to other infectious diseases, which increases its commercial potential evenfurther.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is great international concern that the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus will cause a pandemic infection resulting in millions of deaths. We are developing an adjuvanted vaccine with new technologies that will streamline manufacturing constraints and prevent H5N1 infection on a global scale.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Virally-encoded neuraminidase plays a key role in the life-cycle of the influenza virus. A class of anti-influenza drugs that inhibits the action of neuraminidase has garnered increasing interest in the pharmaceutical industry due to their selectivity and potency. The inhibitors are transition state analogs of the enzyme substrate, sialic acid, and are highly efficacious in in vitro and in vivo studies, with IC50 values in the nM range. However these drugs are very polarand consequently have poor oral bioavailability. At TSRL, we have a developed an amino acid prodrug strategy that targets intestinal transporters for enhanced uptake. Subsequent activation of the absorbed prodrug can then occur either through targeted enzymatic hydrolysis of the prodrug or chemical breakdown of the prodrug to the activate parent compound. This strategy is based on a molecular mechanistic understanding of the transport and activation pathways in cells and tissues and the interaction of prodrug structures with these pathways. In this proposal, we have developed novel amino acid prodrugs of two neuraminidase inhibitors and provide strong supporting data showing that these prodrugs are actively transported by intestinal transporter and are wellabsorbed. We show that through our approach, we can boost the oral availability of selected neuraminidase inhibitors to an extent that they are effective in animal models of influenza and have high potential to be developed as oral drug products. In the current project, we propose to select a lead neuraminidase inhibitor by in vivo (mouse and ferret) testing of the developed series of compounds against a range of influenza strains, including recent H1N1 isolates, seasonal flu isolates, drug resistant virusand high pathogenic strains of the virus. Our  molecular mechanistic  approach to prodrug design has enormous potential for the development of orally effective neuraminidase inhibitors.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: TSRL has developed an approach to improve the oral bioavailability of anti-influenza drugs, thus making them suitable for oral delivery. We propose to synthesize and test a series of these compounds for their potential as oral anti-influenza agents. Ultimately, this approach may increase thenumber of potent anti-virus compounds that are available for therapeutic and prophylactic treatment of influenza.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are the most toxic substances known to humans, causing respiratory failure. Because of their lethality and ease of production, the Department of Defense (DoD) designates BoNTs as a categoryA  bioterrorism agent. Developing effective, post-exposure antagonists to BoNT is among DoD&#039;s top priorities. Despite their lethality, BoNTs have cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications and are currently FDA-approved for treating glabellar lines (wrinkles), cervical dystonia, chronic migraines, blepharospasm, cranial nerve VII disorders, and cosmoses. BoNTs provide relief of muscle tension by silencing neurons that cause muscle contraction. For many disorders, BoNT-based treatments provide significant and long lasting pain reduction. BoNTs&#039; exquisite specificity for neurons and long time of action make it a lead candidate for treating neurological and muscle disorders where other treatments have failed. Developing new BoNT-based therapies is hindered by the lack of assays to measure BoNT activity. Currently, the only widely accepted method involves injecting BoNT into mice and counting how many mice die after 1+ days. This process is slow, requires special facilities, and is very low-throughput; antagonistscreening or developing new BoNT-derived therapeutics is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. BioSentinel recently developed engineered cell lines that stably express a reporter for the detection of BoNT/A in living cells. These cell lines will become BoCell  A, a cell-based assay for the detection of BoNT/A. The overall objectives of this Phase II proposal are to commercialize and validate the BoCell  A assay and develop cell-based assays for detecting BoNT/B and E. Because BoNT has three activities-cell receptor binding and uptake, vesicle translocation, and target cleavage-a cell-based assay is required to effectively measure BoNT activity. BioSentinel developed a cell-based assay that measures BoNT activity by using fluorescence emission to monitor BoNT cleavage of SNARE proteins, the target of BoNT. BioSentinel will validate the BoCell  A assay for biological relevance and high-throughput applications, and begin working to develop a second-generation BoCell  A assay with sensitivity that matchesthat of the mouse bioassay. In addition, BioSentinel will build upon its Phase I accomplishment of identifying reporters that detect BoNT/B in living cells and engineer cell lines that stably express the reporters. Finally, the BoCell  A assay will be engineered for the uptake and detection of BoNT/E. BioSentinel proposes to develop, validate, and commercialize assays that will enable researchers, clinicians, and pharmaceutical companies to rapidly quantify BoNT preparations, perform quality control measures, screen for new BoNT-based therapies, and screen for BoNT antagonists. Because of increased pressure for animal-free, high-throughput assays, a cell-based BoNT detection assay is greatly desired by researchers and industry, and would open a gateway to developing new BoNT-based therapies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Botulinum neurotoxins are extremely lethal bacterial toxins that attack the nervous system and are considered a significant bioterrorism threat. Botulinum neurotoxins are also widely used for cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications providing relief of muscle contraction and pain. BioSentinel proposes to develop a high- throughput assay for measuring botulinum neurotoxin activity in living cells, providing a much needed platform for screening antagonists to BoNT and developing new BoNT-based therapies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large efforts are currently underway funded by the NIH, the Gates foundation, and the WHO, to reduce the spread of HIV transmission by developing an effective microbicide. The CAPRISA trial with tenofovir gel is the first demonstration of prophylaxis against HIV and HSV using a topical microbicide. Because protection increased with increasing adherence, and because intravaginal rings (IVRs) may increase adherence, the development of a ring formulation of tenofovir is anurgent global priority. We have developed a platform technology for the sustained local release of antivirals that has led to the only FDA approved sustained-release antiviral device: the Vitrasert(R). We propose to adapt this technology to develop a sustained release IVR formulation for tenofovir. The original aim of this proposal was to develop IVRs to release acyclovir, since genital herpes co-infection significantly increases the rate of HIV transmission. The disappointing results of the Partners trialwith oral acyclovir and the recent positive results for tenofovir from the CAPRISA trial in the prevention of both HSV and HIV suggested to us that tenofovir is a better drug on which to concentrate our efforts. We discussed this change with program officers at the DAIDS and with our Scientific Review Officer. It was the consensus that acyclovir should be replaced by tenofovir. In phase 1 of this proposal, we demonstrated preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetics of acyclovir in a murine model. With work funded elsewhere, we have also completed safety and pharmacokinetic studies with rings releasing tenofovir. Efficacy studies with tenofovir rings in the macaque model are ongoing. We also fabricated human-sized rings releasing both tenofovir and acyclovir and have demonstrated safety of these rings in a sheep model. In phase 2 we propose to the work necessary to obtain an IND from the FDA for the tenofovir IVR. The specific aims of this 3 year AT-SBIR are: 1, to establish a GMP manufacturing facility for intravaginal rings; 2, to manufacture a lot sufficient to carry out pre-clinical studies under GMP; 3, to perform animal trials necessary to support an Industry Sponsored Investigational New Drug Application (IND); and 4, to manufacture lots of tenofovir drug-eluting intravaginal rings under Good Manufacturing Procedures sufficient for large scale Phase 3 clinical trials The milestones for successful completion of this proposal are the granting of an IND from the FDA, and the production of clinical trial lots sufficient for pivotal trials.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Each day 15,000 people are infected by HIV, the majority in sub-Saharan Africa and a growing percentage women infected though heterosexual sex. The broad long term goal of this project is to empower women to protect themselves from HIV infection through the development and manufacture of improved vaginal ring formulations for microbicides based on the sustained release drug delivery of tenofovir, the only antiretroviral that has been proven to prevent HIV transmission when used topically. Our clinically proven sustained release drug delivery platform uniquely allows us to deliver drug of both high and low aqueous solubility. We propose to utilize this platform technology to develop long-term vaginal ring formulations for the microbicide tenofovir.",

Passive immunotherapy with a small numberof broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) in SHIV challenged macaques bodes well for the ability of infusion of neutralizing MAb to prevent such transmission in humans. However the amount of MAb required would overwhelm current fermenter-basedproduction systems and an alternate system for MAb production is a high priority. Due to recent innovations, transient plant (Nicotiana bentamiama) expression platforms now represent some of the most rapid, cost effective and productive in existence; capable of producing grams of recombinant MAbs in weeks. In the Phase I feasibility study, high mannose and complex glycoforms of 2G12, 2F5, 4E10 b12, m43 and m9 MAbs were transiently produced at 80-100 mg/kg leaves (except for the scFv m9) and each exhibited similar, and, in the case of b12, better neutralizing titers than their CHO-derived counterparts although differences were observed in antibody dependent cellular cytoxicity activity. In Phase II, high mannose, complex and 11,3-fucose/21,2-xylose-negative/low glycoforms of three new broad and potent MAbs (PG9, PG16, VRC01), in addition to b12 and 2G12 from Phase I, will be produced in a p19 enhanced plant expression system (200- 500mg/kg) and assessed for in vitro for both their neutralizing and F3-mediatedantibody effector activity (ADCC and ADCVI).

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Yersinia pestis is designated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and NIAID as a Category A bacterial pathogen. Y. pestis is the etiological agent of the plague (Black Death), a transmissible disease that has beenresponsible for millions of deaths throughout the course of history. Although the natural occurrence of this disease is now relatively rare, the possibility of terrorist groups using Y. pestis as a bioweapon is real. Because of the disease&#039;s inherent communicability, rapid clinical course, and high mortality, it is critical that an outbreak be detected quickly. Therefore methodologies that provide rapid detection and diagnosis are essential to ensure immediate implementation of public health measures and activation of crisis management.  The long-term goal and commercial application of this proposal is to develop a plague diagnostic detection kit. The Phase I research successfully completed the proof of principle study and generated a recombinant luxAB (&#039;light&#039;)-tagged reporter phage for the detection of Y. pestis. Y. pestis specific phage are currently used by the CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) as a diagnostic standard for the confirmed identification of Y. pestis; however, the phage lysis assays are laboratory based and require 2 to 3 days to complete. In contrast, the technology described in this proposal does not require sample processing, a laboratory environment, or extensive incubation periods. The Phase I results demonstrated that the luxAB reporter phage rapidly conferred a bioluminescent signal response to an attenuated Y. pestis strain and displayed potential as a plague diagnostic. The Phase II research will build upon the Phase I foundation with the goal of generating a plague diagnostic kit. The Phase II research will: (i) increase the specificity and sensitivity of the reporter phage for Y. pestis (Aim 1); (ii) demonstrate the utility of the reporter phage against a library of wild-type Y. pestis strains (Aim 2); (iii) analyze the specificity of the reporter phage for Y. pestis using a panel of pathogenic non-pestis Yersinia species (Aim 3), and (iv) analyze and optimize the ability of the detection system to function directly with clinical specimens (Aim 4).  Collectively, this research will provide the foundation for a plague diagnostic kit using novel &#039;light producing&#039; reporter phage that rapidly, sensitively, and specifically confer a bioluminescent phenotype to Y. pestis. The vision of the product is that it can be used as a diagnostic for suspected plague-infected patients with cultivated isolates or directly with infected clinical specimens in a laboratory setting or as a portable camera-based assay. The long-term goal of our research is to develop a reporter phage-based multiplexassay for the identification of different bacterial priority A pathogens.

A rapid diagnostic test kit is essential in order to specifically diagnose the disease, prevent the spread of the disease, and to save lives.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to develop ultra-sensitive ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) methods for quantification of HIV p24 antigen. At present, the p24 antigen test is relatively insensitive, being able to detect only 5- 10 pg/ml. This quantity of antigen may not be present in the serum of infected individuals, even when the virus is actively replicating. In fact, only about 50-60% of AIDS patients, 30-40% of ARC patients, and 10% of asymptomatic patients will have p24 antigenemia that is detectable. Therefore, the development of more sensitive p24 antigen tests is of great importance. It is in this context that we are proposing to develop a highly sensitive p24 antigen assays that will be less expensivethan RNA viral load tests and appropriate for use both in developed and developing countries in which the limitations of infrastructure and laboratory capability prohibit nucleic acid testing. The specific aims of the Phase I and Phase II, in part, include 1) analyzing and optimizing of all variables affecting the accuracy and functionality of the p24 tests; and 2) validation of the HIV-1 p24 detection assay. Advantages of the proposed assays such as the increased sensitivity, signal-to- noise ratio, and dynamic range, reduced time and low cost of the analysis substantiates our belief that the proposed amplification method has a prominent commercial and scientific potential. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of the proposed method will allow using HIV p24 antigen tests for monitoring HIV infection, blood screening, identification of acute infection, to assist in the diagnosis of infection in the newborn, and in detecting antigen in supernatants from cultures. The performance of the developed tests will be improved significantly as compared with that for conventional assays. Successful completion of these studies will be beneficial for public health, and make available all of the technology needed for a substantial business opportunity to license the technology and manufacture commercial products.",

No effective therapy exists to mitigate the hematologictoxicities of TBI. Herein G-Zero Therapeutics seeks to further the proprietary development of small molecule inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and CDK6 which have recently been demonstrated to ameliorate ARS and rescue survival of mice afterlethal-dose TBI. CDK4/6 inhibitors induce selective cellular quiescence increasing radioresistance of human cell lines in vitro and mice in vivo. Treatment of wild-type mice with CDK4/6 inhibitors induces reversible pharmacological quiescence (PQ) of earlyHSPCs but not most other cycling cells in the bone marrow or other tissues. Selective PQ of HSPCs decreases the hematopoietic toxicity of TBI, even when administered well after TBI. These results demonstrate an effective method to mitigate the hematopoietic toxicity of IR in mammals. In this proposal, we seek to optimize DMPK of G-Zero&#039;s CDK4/6 small molecule inhibitors to ensure sufficient pharmacokinetic (PK) properties (T1/2 gt4hrs, oral bioavailability gt40%, and an attainable peak serum concentrationat least 10 fold higher than its in vitro IC50). Evaluation of inhibitors for acute induction of PQ (a 4-fold or greater increase in the frequency of HSPC in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle at 24 hours post-gavage without increased cell death) will serveas a pharmacodynamic (PD) marker for in vivo efficacy. Using compounds that pass these PK and PD screens, non-GLP rodent efficacy studies will be assessed using survival and protection of blood cell counts when administered post-IR.

The Liat Dengue Assay will utilize the Liat Analyzer to enable the minimally trained personnel to perform the dengue infection test at a hospital, clinic or physician&#039;s office in less than 1 hour. By enabling effective and sensitive dengue infection testing, we expect that the Liat assay will allow clinicians to quickly diagnose patients with dengue fever or dengue hemorrhagic fever and initiate appropriate treatments. The Liat Dengue Assay overcomes the limitations of current dengue infectiontests, whose long turnaround time and technical complexity requires testing to be performed in centralized laboratories, resulting in missed opportunities for disease treatment or the continued use of ineffective treatment regimens. The assay will also beamong the first near patient nucleic acid tests, and will provide significant benefit to patient health and welfare, as well as enhance the preparedness for this emerging disease.  In Phase I, we propose to transfer the Liat Dengue Assay to manufacturingand perform analytical sensitivity and specificity studies. In Phase II, we propose to complete the analytical studies, develop and validate manufacturing processes for the Liat Dengue Assay, and conduct clinical sample study to validate the assay.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complications arising from pathogen infection incur a tremendous societal cost both in morbidity and mortality (as high as 50-60%), as well as in care and treatment estimated in billions of dollars. In susceptible patients, infection induces mis-regulation of the innate immune system that can culminate in systemic inflammation, severe illness and death. The development of probiotics with the capacity to dampen or modulate this response would have enormous value and numerous medical applications. Scarab Genomics has developed Clean Genome(r) E. coli strains that are devoid of all deleterious gene sequences and are tolerated better than existing strains in mammalian systems. Such reduced E. coli strains can provide immediate protection against a lethal dose of infecting bacteria as well as toxins in mice, presumably by suppressing the extreme inflammatory response, or by raising the level of preparedness of the innate immune system, or both. This protective effect has greatpotential for use in clinical populations, both as an intervention for serious infections including sepsis and septic shock, and as a prophylactic to reduce the chance of infection in at-risk patients. Ideally the treatment would provide universal protection against any pathogenic challenge. In Phase I of the proposal, feasibility parameters including dosing regimen, route of delivery and the ability of non-viable preparations to protect against sepsis will be examined. In Phase 2, Clean Genome(r) strains that contain alterations in membrane lipopolysaccharide (the bacterial component strongly associated with innate immune activation) will be evaluated for protection against sepsis. Further, we will determine whether protection by reduced genome strains extends to other Gram-negative bacterial strains. To establish clinical relevance, a mouse model will be used to demonstrate protection by Clean Genome(r) strains of lethal doses of pathogenic E. coli strains including O157:H7, a colonizing, Shiga toxin-producing strain. An additional protective strain that will be tested in this context is the E. coli strain Nissle 1917, which has been in use as a probiotic for many decades and which has the capacity of colonize the intestine. Nissle 1917 is currently undergoing genome- reducing deletions at Scarab that have been targeted to enhance its safety and stability. The development of Nissle 1917 as a probiotic against infection and sepsis will result in protective colonizing bacteria for oral delivery. Our core competence in the targeted reduction and modification of E. coli will enable us to develop probiotics for the treatment of infection and sepsis.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The impact of these Clean Genome(r) products on human health could be highly significant, reducing complications associated with surgery or antibiotic treatments. Protection is likely to extend to many other bacteria and viruses, providing innate protection against septic toxicity and/or ameliorating their pathology, resulting in substantialsavings in health care costs. Further, development costs would be much lower than for conventional drugs, and pharmaceutical production of clean bacteria would be economical and highly efficient.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic and infected wounds significantly affect the quality of life for millions of US citizens and are associated with increased risk of complications including the devastating consequence of amputation. As of 2006, infections of diabetic foot ulcers resulted in 82,000 amputations each year and it has been estimated that these numbers will increase by 10% annually. Moreover, in an extensive study of several types of chronic wounds including diabetic foot ulcers, venousleg ulcers, and pressure ulcers, 60% were found to contain bacterial biofilms. The National Institutes of Health estimates that 80% of human infectious diseases are directly related to bacterial biofilm formation. Furthermore, it is widely recognized thatbacterial biofilms are highly resistant to antibiotic treatment. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that biofilm formation acts as a major impediment to the healing of cutaneous wounds. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for novel strategiesto disrupt biofilm formation in these wounds.         The specific aims for this Fast-Track SBIR translational research proposal are designed to advance the development of ExpressGraftEnhance tissue, an antimicrobial living skin substitute created by Stratatech Corporation that has been shown to inhibit the growth of multidrug-resistant bacteria in an in vivo burn infection model (Mol Ther. 2009 Mar;17(3):562-9). Stratatech has established an interdisciplinary series of collaborative partnerships with industry, academia, and the U.S. armed forces to test ExpressGraftEnhance its effectiveness in preventing or disrupting biofilm formation by multidrug-resistant bacteria. Phase I milestones will 1) demonstrate that hCAP-18/LL-37 secreted by ExpressGraftEnhanceis efficacious against biofilm formation in vitro, 2) develop potency assays to monitor this bioactivity and 3) optimize ideal production and storage conditions for this living skin substitute tissue. The Phase II study will: 1) determine the efficacy ExpressGraftEnhance tissue in preventing or disrupting bacterial biofilm formation in vitro, 2) demonstrate the efficacy of ExpressGraftEnhance tissue against biofilm formation in both murine and porcine in vivo wound models of biofilm infection, 3) implementand qualify cGMP manufacturing processes and potency assays for ultimate clinical use and 4) demonstrate that late passage cells used to create ExpressGraftEnhance are karyotypically stable, non-tumorigenic, free of viral adventitious agents, and maintaintransgene stability and integrity. Stratatech&#039;s ultimate goal is to commercialize the ExpressGraftEnhance skin substitute for use in treating cutaneous wounds that are refractory to healing due to bacterial colonization and biofilm formation by wound pathogens. The studies of this proposal are designed to generate preclinical data that are required to support translation of the ExpressGraftEnhance technology into human clinical trials.         Bacterial biofilms have become recently become recognized by the medical community as significant barriers to wound healing, and the National Institutes of Health estimates that 80% of human infectious diseases are directly related to bacterial biofilm formation yet no biological treatment options that specifically target biofilm infection have been developed and marketed. The goal of this translational Fast-Track SBIR proposal is to develop a series of collaborative partnerships to expedite the development of an innovative antimicrobial therapeutic aimed at accelerating the healing of wounds by preventing or disrupting wound biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant bacteria. The development of a cultured human skin substitute specifically engineered to disrupt biofilms would target the needs of the millions of patients afflicted with hard-to-heal skin wounds by both eliminating the impediment to healing while also promoting healing, reducing pain, and reducing the likelihood of other major complications.",

This has also renewed interest in positioned other envelope-based subunit immunogens that may provide a better booster to achieve protection. One such immunogen is the Full Length Single Chain (FLSC) a gp120 human CD4 fusion that replicatesthe conserved envelope-CD4 complex, a key transition state that all HIV isolates must realize during infection. In 2 rhesus macaque studies, rhFLSC, a surrogate version of FLSC that contains CD4 derived from rhesus macaques, provided statistically significant protection (rapid clearance of post-acute plasma viremia, as well as potent and sustained suppression of tissue viremia) against rectal challenge with R5 tropic, and heterologus SHIV162P3. This observation indicates that FLSC could provide similar effects in humans and may provide the foundation for an effective vaccine against HIV. The goal of this project, therefore, is to initiate the preclinical development of FLSC in preparation for its evaluation in Phase I clinical trial as the next step in discerning whether FLSC can be an effective HIV vaccine. To reach this goal, this Fast Track Phase 1 and 2 project has the following aims. Phase 1 Segment Aim 1. Develop pedigreed HEK293 cell lines suitable for the production of FLSC. Aim 2. Identify and optimize release assays. Phase 2 Segment Aim 3. Manufacture lots of material suitable for potency studies (Aim 4) and preclinical toxicology (Aim 5). Aim 4. Confirm that FLSC/adjuvant formulation induces CD4i responses in rabbits. Aim 5. Evaluate FLSC in preclinical safety studies. Overall, the single chain complex has emerged as one of the rare envelope-based subunit immunogen that by itself affords protection against mucosal infection with a completely heterologous SHIV. These findings suggest that single chain complexes should be considered as viable candidates for a vaccine against HIV-1.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 500,000 bone-grafting procedures are performed each year in the United States.5 Autologous iliac crest bone graft continues to be the gold standard, because it provides essential elements for bone formation: progenitor cells, an osteoconductive matrix, and osteoinductive molecules. However, iliac crest harvest is associated with a significant number of complications and often provides an inadequate volume of graft.6 To address these limitations, much work has been done to improve alternative grafts with better osteoconductive matrices and exogenous delivery of osteoinductive agents such as the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs).7 Currently there are only a few basic point-of-care devices to isolate progenitor cells, which are essential elements to foster bone healing. However, these devices are limiting because they are expensive and because they either enrich a non-specific cell population potentially diluting out desired cells or they enrich a specific cellpopulation using antibodies and consequently have safety concerns. Therefore, a safe, inexpensive device that could enrich adult stem cells from a bone marrow aspirate (BMA) or other tissue stroma at point-of-care would be of significant clinical benefit.In this phase II proposal, we will continue to develop a cell isolation device to enrich the multipotent subpopulation of cells in human bone marrow known as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). (*2)Furthermore, we will demonstrate versatility of the isolationdevice by showing that we can capture adult stem cells from adipose tissue. The advantage of adipose tissue is the availability of greater numbers of bone healing cells. We have identified and synthesized an MSC-binding peptide that can isolate adult stemcells from bone marrow and adipose tissue, and these isolated cells are multipotent. The MSC-binding peptide will be covalently attached to a solid support matrix and will form the functional core of the cell isolation device. The cells isolated will be captured and released using the prototype device, and different concentrations of cells will be tested in bone healing of a rat calvarial defect. An isolated pool of MSCs has the potential to serve key clinical functions in a range of indications includingosteoarthritis, Chron&#039;s disease and soft tissue repair such as tendon, ligament or wounds. This product will provide a safe and cost-effective point-of-care isolation system for the preparation of autologous cells.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bone grafting is widely used in orthopedic surgery to treat fractures and large bone defects and to achieve spinal fusions. However, harvesting a bone graft from patients is associated with a significant number of complications and often provides an inadequate amount of tissue. While alternatives to bone grafts have shown promise, there is still room for considerable improvement. Therefore, a device, like the one proposed in this SBIR application, that could isolate adult stem cells efficiently and quickly in the operating room would be of significant clinical benefit in a number of clinical indications.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): At some point in their lives, 80 percent of the work force will suffer some form of back pain. It is the leading cause of work-related disability in the U.S., costing billions of dollars in lost productivity and high medical, insurance, and legal costs. For workers suffering from nonspecific low back pain (NLBP) that does not require medical attention, the American College of Physicians (ACP) and American Pain Society (APS) recommend a multidisciplinary approach to painmanagement that integrates cognitive, physical, and educational interventions. However, this type of program is not commonly available. There is a critical need to develop evidence-based multidisciplinary NLBP programs that can be widely disseminated and reduce the financial, physical, and emotional impact of NLBP on employers and employees.  The proposed project will finish development and evaluate the effectiveness of a six-week web-based multidisciplinary program for workers suffering from NLBP that doesnot require medical treatment. The website will have tailored strands for four different job-types: a) desk job, inactive (i.e., Phase I; workers who are seated 50 percent or more of the day); b) non-desk job - inactive (i.e., cashiers or food service workers who usually stand while working, but are relatively inactive otherwise), c) non-desk job, active (i.e., active physical labor, such as construction workers), and d) truck and heavy equipment operators (i.e., individuals who work while seated and are subject to heavy vibration). In alignment with the ACP and APS guidelines, the program will include a Back Pain Assessment Tool to screen out individuals who require medical care and most likely do not have NLBP, provide evidence-based information on self-care options (e.g., heat and ice), provide information on the use of over-the-counter medication, and offer cognitive behavioral training to reduce psychosocial risk factors (e.g., fear and avoidance). The program will assist users in setting behavioral treatment goals and will help them schedule return visits. The program will incorporate video and animated tutorials, motivational peer testimonials, behavior modeling demonstrations, and informational articles.  The Phase I prototype was assessed by a panelof experts, including physicians and members of APS, and was tested by an Internet sample of workers experiencing low back pain. Evaluation results indicated the program accurately developed appropriate educational approaches for case studies presented bythe expert panel. Internet users were very satisfied with program content, functionality, and usability, and they showed significant gains in measures of knowledge, self-efficacy, attitude, and intentions.  In Phase II, the complete program will be developed and evaluated in a randomized controlled trial with 300 workers diagnosed with NLBP. The evaluation will be conducted entirely online, across the United States.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Back pain, which afflicts 80 percent of adults at some pointin their lives, is best treated with a multidisciplinary approach combining psychological, physical, and educational strategies. Unfortunately, workers who suffer nonspecific back pain that does not require medical care have few options. Doctors focus onpatients with underlying conditions, and clinics offering multi-disciplinary care for back pain aren&#039;t readily available. In response, the proposed Internet program will provide worksite employees with a 6-week multidisciplinary intervention for self-treatment of back pain.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The frequency with which tendon ruptures occur is increasing due to medical advances that allow an aging population to remain physically active longer than previously possible. There is a great deal of controversy in the orthopaedic community regarding the most effective way to treat such injuries. While progress has been made in improving the method of fixation of torn tendons, further advancements are needed to allow for earlier and more aggressive rehabilitation withfewer complications such as rerupture or tendon stretching. Some tendon repair techniques include use of a graft to reinforce conventional primary suture repair of the rupture. These grafts are secured to the injured tissues at only a few points via suture. Thus, loads in the tendon are concentrated at these suture points, as well as at the primary repair suture site. By securing the graft to the repair, and distributing the load over the entire graft/tendon interface, the patient can potentially begin postoperative rehabilitation much sooner. Early mobilization has been found to be critical in regenerating well-organized and functional tendons. Marine mussels provide the inspiration for the new technology presented in this proposal. By releasing rapidly hardening, tightly binding adhesive proteins, marine mussels have the ability to anchor themselves to various surfaces in a wet, turbulent, and saline environment. Both natural proteins and their synthetic mimics have been shown to bind strongly to various substrates ranging from metal surfaces to biological tissues. In this proposal, biomimetic synthetic adhesives will be combined with natural scaffolds to create a novel bioadhesive membrane. The intent is to secure such a construct over the entire surface area of a ruptured tendon, reinforcing traditional suture repair, and creating a repair that is stronger than with sutures alone. The feasibility of using such a construct as an augmentation device for tendon repair will be developed and tested.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The incidence of tendon injuries has been increasing over the past several decades. Tendon ruptures require a prolonged period of recovery, and dramatically affect a patient&#039;s quality of life. Numerous surgical and rehabilitative treatments have been introduced, but none have been overwhelmingly successful and widely accepted. In an effort to enhance and accelerate tendon healing, a novel bioadhesive membrane construct to augment tendon repair is proposed and developed herein.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA interference (RNAi) has the potential to revolutionize treatment of dominant genetic disorders. Small inhibitory RNAs (siRNAs) are highly potent and selective, demonstrating remarkable single-nucleotide specificity.Clinical trials using siRNAs are currently underway for a number of indications including skin. Facilitated by Phase 1 funding, a small one patient phase 1b clinical trial was undertaken for pachyonychia congenita (PC). This ultrarare skin disorder is caused by mutations, including single nucleotide changes, in the genes encoding keratins 6, 16, and 17. The major complaint of PC patients is the debilitating painful callusing and blistering which occurs on or near the pressure points of the feet. These defined regions on the soles of the feet were targeted for local siRNA treatment by intralesional injection of siRNA (TD101) with encouraging results. Unfortunately, the pain associated with injections into lesions (oral pain medication and regional nerve blocks were required to allow treatment), prevents widespread use of this mode of administration. This observation has led to intense efforts to identify patient-friendly (i.e., little or no pain) delivery options. This clinical trial was the first human use of siRNA in skin and also the first siRNA to target a mutated gene.  In Phase 2 of this proposal, we extend the progress of Phase 1 and the Phase 1b clinical trial. We have found that unmodified or stabilized siRNAs are not taken up readily by skin keratinocytes but that modified, so-called  self-delivery  (sd) siRNAs are. Additional optimization of the sd-siRNA will be undertaken in mouse and human skin models followed by synthesis of GMP material for mouse and rabbit toxicology studies and clinical trialsin which the siRNA will be delivered by dissolvable microneedle arrays or a topical GeneCream  formulation, both developed and manufactured at TransDerm. GeneCream and microneedle arrays are both designed to effectively deliver sd-siRNA with little or no pain (microneedle protrusions are designed to only penetrate to the non-innervated epidermis). Although PC is a rare disease, the nature of the disorder makes it an ideal prototype skin disorder (defined mutations with expression in limited, defined areas)for first-in-man siRNA skin clinical trials, and we fully expect the lessons learned will be readily generalized to other skin disorders.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite the discovery of the underlying mutations responsible for many inherited skindiseases, few effective treatments have emerged. The discovery that siRNAs can be developed to target specific disease-related mutations portends the advent of a new treatment paradigm. We have identified a potent and selective siRNA that targets a singlenucleotide mutation in the keratin 6a gene that is responsible for the rare skin disorder pachyonychia congenita and blocks its expression. This siRNA (known to the FDA as TD101) was successfully tested in a Phase 1b clinical trial. Despite signs of efficacy, the painful nature of the administration route (intradermal injection of large volumes) required that we develop a more patient-friendly delivery system. Phase 2 of this proposal allows preclinical studies enabling a second clinical trial using microneedles loaded with a self-delivery version of TD101 siRNA. The lessons learned in applying siRNA technology for treatment of PC should be readily generalizable to a host of other dominant skin disorders and likely to other disorders resulting from mutated or overexpressed disease-causing genes.",

Low back pain (LBP) syndromes include spinal degenerative conditions with and without nerve root or cauda equina irritation. These syndromes represent some of the most common reasons for patients to seek medical attention. LBP syndromes associated with neurological irritation are often effectively treated, whereas those not primarily associated with neurological irritation have proven resistant. The greatest current challenge in the clinical care of patients with LBP syndromes is identifying those who sufferfrom active neurological irritation and therefore may benefit from interventional therapies, such as corticosteroid injection (ESI). However, there is currently no validated test to discriminate between patients who will or will not respond to ESI. For example, only ~50% of the gt10 million yearly epidural steroid injections successfully relieve pain. Many patients that don&#039;t respond to initial steroid injections will receive follow-up injections at the same or a different spinal location. These unnecessaryinjections are costly and have side effects. In Phase I, we developed and validated an assay that can prospectively identify patients who will respond to steroid treatment. Our Specific Aim in Phase II is to collect the necessary data for FDA regulatory approval of the Cytonics assay as a diagnostic tool to identify patients who will respond to steroid injection therapy for LBP due to radiculopathy. To achieve this Objective, we will carry out the following Tasks: Task #1: Validate our assay to meet FDA manufacturing guidelines. Task #2: Carry out a large prospective study appropriate for obtaining PMA clearance using our validated assay. Task #3: Prepare and submit a PMA to the FDA. The assay will be sold as a kit, complete with all of the reagents required for the assay. We will provide the diagnostic kit to CLIA labs that are interested in providing the testing service, many of which will be located in surgical hospitals or outpatient centers. We will utilize a network of medical product distributors to provide information on the diagnostic to spine surgeons, neurologist, and pain management specialists in an effort to encourage the use of the test for their patients. We will also publish and present extensively on results of using our product. Phase II will result in a diagnostic assay to be submitted for FDA approval.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a project to develop a diagnostic assay that helps physicians know when to use steroid injections for treating back pain. Currently, 10 million such injections are made each year at a cost of about  2000 per injection. Half of the injections are ineffective. Our assay will allow physicians to know when a patient will not respond to an injection, thereby avoiding the needless injections and saving about10 billion dollars per year in ineffective treatments, as well as allowing the physician to focus on treating the patient more effectively.",

        "abstract": "Products produced from Hydrastis canadensis L. commonly known as goldenseal are among the top 20 herbal supplements sold in the U.S. and the sixth most used botanical in children. However, there has never been a controlled clinical study to evaluate its safety and effectiveness for any indication primarily due to the lack of a well characterized, standardized product. This lack of data not only presents a challenge to public health but also impedes economic development of the plant as a viable crop option for growers as well as environmental efforts to conserve the plant through cultivation. The goal of this project is to develop a series of research grade products from Hydrastis suitable for use in NIH funded pre-clinical and clinical studies. Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of using biological activity as a complementary marker for product standardization purposes and determined the optimal combination of plant parts which result in the maximum amount of activity with minimal adverse effects. In PhaseII, OrganiPharm, LLC will collaborate with a highly skilled and complementary team of scientists to build on these initial efforts by developing a prototype batch of research grade Hydrastis products that have been standardized to produce repeatable bioactivity and sufficiently characterized so as to meet FDA requirements for a botanical product Investigational New Drug application. The standardization method is innovative and based on the theory that berberine, reported to be the primary active compound inHydrastis, is in its least active, most toxic form when isolated from the whole plant matrix and that other compounds in the plant work synergistically to increase activity and reduce toxicity. Therefore less berberine is needed in the whole plant productto achieve a comparable level of bioactivity allowing product activity to be indexed to that of reference standard, i.e. 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 times the standard. Phase II will 1) Validate that starting material from disparate sources is similar in chemical composition and bioactivity to the material used in Phase I, 2) Establish a prototype batch of research grade USDA National Organic Program certified Hydrastis in each of four formulations, a) powder, b) tincture, c) solid extract, and d) powdered root extractplus a placebo for each, 3) Chemically characterize the batches in detail and conduct stability testing, 4) Establish a Drug Master File (DMF) for each of the Hydrastis formulations to be available for reference by researchers developing study protocols requiring a Botanical Product Investigational New Drug application. This project will have a significant impact on the herbal supplement industry by offering a model for increasing the reliability of Hydrastis products through biological standardization. Theproject will have a significant impact on public health in this country by facilitating the development of safety and efficacy data for a widely used botanical product that would otherwise been impossible to achieve.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in x-ray detectors and microcomputers have enabled compact and affordable computed tomography (CT) imaging devices to be successful in dental and otolaryngology applications. This technology holds promise for neurosurgical applications. Specifically, intraoperative imaging updates would benefit minimally-invasive treatment of brain cancer by providing anatomic updates to the surgeon and localization data updates to surgical navigation for more accurate, safe and complete neoplasm removal. In this project, a compact intra-operative flat-panel CT imager integrated with a surgical navigation system will be developed. The product will use advanced imaging methods to produce low-artifact soft tissue images, even in the skull base and posterior fossa, which are typically challenging regions for x-ray imagers. The product will offer soft tissue image quality unprecedented for x-ray based surgical navigation. It will also be the most compact and OR-friendly image-guided neurosurgical navigation system available to date. Phase 1 work demonstrated the feasibility of using flat panel cone beam CT for low contrast imaging, as required for neurosurgical applications. In Phase 2, further efforts are proposed to advance soft-tissue imaging capability and to integrate the imager with surgical navigation tools. A prototype will be evaluated in a pilot study for the specific minimally-invasive neurosurgical task of transphenoidal endonasal pituitary tumor resection surgery. Ifsuccessful, approximately  13 M in annual revenue and 15 additional jobs will be generated in the southeast Michigan life sciences corridor.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Minimally invasive surgical procedures have many benefits to public health including reducing the medical risks and costs associated with brain cancer surgery. However such procedures are often time consuming and technically difficult as the surgeon is unable to directly visualize the area of the operation. In this project an intraoperative surgical system is developed with onboard imaging capability in order to enable minimally invasive brain surgeries to be performed more safely and completely, by providing hi- resolution imaging of the brain while the surgeon operates through the patients nose.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this research is to commercialize a device (the Oncoscope Panocyte  system) used to guide biopsy selection in patients with Barrett&#039;s esophagus (BE) during standard endoscopy surveillance for early- stage esophageal cancer. Barrett&#039;s esophagus most often develops in patients with chronic acid reflux and is the strongest risk factor for development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. The current standard of care for surveillance, random biopsy guided by white-light endoscopy, is severely limited, since early-stage lesions are not visible during imaging and only a small amount of at-risk tissue can be screened during a single procedure. The Panocyte  system utilizes technology based on angle-resolved low coherence interferometry (a/LCI). It provides a highly sensitive tool for cancer screening through its ability to make quantitative measurements of cellular characteristics, such as nuclear size, that are known to be highly correlated to cancer progression. The non-invasive and real-time nature of the Panocyte  system allows clinicians to examine a greater portion of at-risk tissue, and its ability to selectively probe the basal layer of tissue, where disease first manifests, allows them to detect esophageal cancerin its pre-cancer stages when it is effectively treatable. With these capabilities, using Panocyte  to guide biopsy selection during esophageal endoscopy procedures could ultimately deliver earlier detection via more thorough examination, a reduction in health-care costs by minimizing biopsy of non-dysplastic tissue, and overall improvement in patient outcomes and quality of life. In Phase I of the NIH SBIR program, Oncoscope successfully developed a commercial prototype a/LCI device capable of discriminating between non-dysplastic and dysplastic tissues in a rat Barrett&#039;s esophagus model. In Phase II, we expanded on the Phase I work by improving the Panocyte  system design for enhanced commercial and clinical viability, while also demonstrating its clinical operating characteristics in vivo as part of a 175-patient pilot trial. With the following specific aims, our research plan for Phase IIB will build further toward full commercialization by conducting product verification and validation of the esophageala/LCI clinical system, culminating in the submission of our regulatory application to the FDA for a/LCI-guided excisional biopsy in the esophagus: (1) Finalize product development and perform initial manufacturing and assembly in order to complete designverification of the esophageal a/LCI clinical system, (2) Conduct pivotal clinical trial and user interface study for design validation of using a/LCI to guide excisional biopsy in the esophagus, and (3) Complete manufacturing process validation and designtransfer of the esophageal a/LCI clinical system.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of this research is to commercialize a new instrument for detecting early-stage esophageal cancer based on a novel optical technique, angle-resolved low coherence interferometry (a/LCI). The proposed a/LCI instrument will serve as a guide to biopsy selection during endoscopy in patients with Barrett&#039;s esophagus, enabling real-time non-invasive evaluation of tissue health in situ prior to tissue removal and greatly improving upon the current standard of care, random biopsy. Using a/LCI to target biopsies has the potential to greatly improve surveillance of esophageal cancer by detecting it in its early stages while it is still treatable.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is based on a recent discovery that tumors can bioconvert non-absorbing small metal nanoparticles into intense infrared (IR) absorbers. In preliminary tests, non-IR absorbing 15 nm gold nanoparticles wereimmunotargeted to human tumors in mice which then became highly IR absorbing. The amplification factor in IR absorption can be a factor of 20 or more, which is not accessible by use of other much larger nanoparticles (~130 nm) that are designed to initially absorb IR. This factor greatly enhances the tumor- to-non-tumor distinction. The small size also enhances tumor uptake. Treatment with IR led to rapid and complete tumor ablation in 1 cm tumors, whereas the tumors were not controlled in irradiated mice without the gold. This new IR bioamplification process will be studied and optimized to treat squamous cell carcinomas, which comprise 90% of head and neck cancers. Epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFr) are overexpressed by these tumors and covalent anti-EGFr antibody-gold conjugates will be used for targeting human A431 tumors in mice. A microscopic study will document tumor and normal tissue responses. In Phase II, this novel therapy will be optimized with respect to gold size and targeting ligand. TheIR hyperthermia therapy will then be combined with radiotherapy, since we have recently shown that hyperthermia and x-rays are highly synergistic in treating squamous cell carcinomas. The new combination therapy should better avoid damage to salivary glands and surrounding normal tissue, which is one of the serious side effects of current therapies. In order to demonstrate safety and safety limits, an acute, subacute, and long-term toxicity study will be conducted. Work will culminate in a product for FDA approval of clinical trials. If successful, this new approach could improve the treatment of head and neck as well as other cancers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A novel cancer treatment using nanotechnology has recently been developed that is very promising inpreliminary animal studies. It also may be used for sensitive early detection of tumors and enable image guided interventions. If successful, it could improve detection and treatment of head and neck tumors as well as other cancers.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Though AML is one of the most common forms of leukemia in adults; the 5 year survival is less than 20-50% in adults and significantly lowers in the elderly. The remarkable success in treating one relatively uncommon subset of AML, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), with all trans- retinoic acid (ATRA) illustrates the great promise for differentiation therapy. Utilizing ATRA, the presumed cure of 75-85% of patients is possible but only for this rare AML subset. ATRA&#039;s remarkable success stems from the fact that AML is a disease characterized by the arrest of differentiation of immature myeloid cells. ATRA overcomes this block in differentiation by forcing leukemic cells to mature. After leukemic cells undergo terminal differentiation, they lose their ability to proliferate. We have recently found that a plant-derived alkaloid holds promise as an AML therapeutic for non-APL leukemia due to its ability to induce potent AML differentiation. The major aims of this phase II project are to perform preclinical efficacy and toxicity studies in order to develop our optimized form of this plant-derived alkaloid into a clinical agent. As differentiation therapies are able to treat leukemia without the necessity for overt cytotoxicity,this work has the potential to lead to much needed more efficacious, less toxic, and better tolerated therapy for patients with AML.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is highly relevant to public health as its main objective is to develop a novel therapeutic regimen for patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia that is both efficacious and has low toxicity. As current AML therapeutics has poor efficacy and high toxicities, there is a significant need for new therapies and therapeutic approaches for AML.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most patients with solid tumors die of tumor recurrence at the same site or metastasis of the tumor to distal sites. An intermediate step in both recurrence and metastasis is a stage called tumor dormancy, where the cancer cells are suppressed by a normal extracellular matrix (ECM) and by other mechanisms. Such cells can appear histopathologically normal and therefore escape detection. Like metastases and recurrent tumors, dormant cells are resistant to traditional therapeutics. Breast cancer, in particularly triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and basal like breast cancer (BLBC), are poorly differentiated, highly aggressive (recurrent/metastatic), refractory to treatment and dormant tumor cells have been found years after remission in BC patients. Sometimes, these suppressed cells will reactivate and begin actively growing, forming either a metastasis or a local recurrence.  DormaTarg, Inc. has developed a novel drug testing platform to model suppression by the normal ECM (U.S. Patent 7,575,926). We have used this model to screen chemical libraries for compounds capable of preferentially killing dormant cancer cells in an effort to target metastasis and recurrence at a previously unexploited point, the dormant or suppressed tumor micrometastasis. In our first screen of 2,300 compounds, three lead compounds were identified, designated DT-310, DT- 320 and DT-330. In the phase I portion of this SBIR proposal, these compounds were evaluated in an in vivo model of tumor dormancy (Patent Pending) and in an established metastatic orthotopic basal- like breast cancer (BLBC) model. It was found that one compound, DT-320, had superior antitumor efficacy and low toxicity in these models as compared to standard agents doxorubicin (DOX)and gemcitabine (GEM).  The goal of the studies in this phase II application is to complete pre-good laboratory practices (pre-GLP) evaluation of DT-320 to support DormaTarg, Inc. moving forward with an IND from the FDA for this first in class therapeutic. Aim 1 is to determine the odse escalation, scheduling and reversibility of the antitumor effect of DT-320 in vivo. Aim 2 is to extend the anticancer efficacy of DT- 320 in breast tumors in vivo. Aim 3 evaluates the pharmacokinetic parameters of DT-320 invivo. Aim 4 characterizes of mechanism of DT-320 tumor kill.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and basal like breast cancer (BLBC) are often highly aggressive (recurrent/metastatic). While there are several therapies available for TNBC/BLBC, survival rates for these cancers remain low. This project tests a novel approach to treating TNBC/BLBC, attacking dormant tumors.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malignant gliomas represent a heterogeneous family of tumors that are poorly responsive to current treatments. A major obstacle to the effective management of these lesions involves the difficulty in delivering adequateconcentrations of therapeutics to the tumor cells. In addition, the inability to image the distribution of therapeutic agent hampers the planning of subsequent treatments. LNK Chemsolutions, LLC (LNK), a small business entity, and the University of Chicago Hospitals (UCH), have been engaged in the development of a novel polymeric nanoparticle (NP) for the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that NPs bearing magnetite within their shell, can i. be dispersedin the rodent brain by convection enhanced delivery (CED), ii. transport viable chemotherapeutic agent and iii. be visualized by standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The overall goal of our Phase II proposal is to incorporate the specific propertiesoutlined above to develop an NP that can be used for imaged-guided treatment of brain tumors. Throughout the study period, NPs will be manufactured at LNK and subsequently tested at UCH. In Aim 1, we will use both in vitro and animal models to critically examine NPs for targeting and delivery of chemotherapy and siRNA. After identifying a prototypical NP that has the necessary characteristics for in vivo targeting and therapy, we will next investigate potential toxic effects related to infusion of these NPsinto normal animal brains. In Aim 2, we will harness the ability of these polymeric, magnetite-bearing NPs (PMNPs) to be imaged by MRI, and test whether multiple imaged- guided treatments can improve the therapeutic response compared to unguided treatments. Following studies in rodents with glioma xenografts, in Aim 3 we will move on to study PMNPs in spontaneous canine gliomas. Dogs have significantly larger brains than rats and, more importantly, canine gliomas have many of the characteristics of human tumors. After examining PMNP toxicity in normal dogs, we will enroll companion dogs with spontaneous tumors into a specific protocol involving CED of chemotherapy encapsulated NPs. Animals will be treated and followed with real-time MR imaging and NP distribution pattern and animal survival documented. While the first 3 Aims are being completed at UCH, at LNK studies will concurrently be conducted to improve the EDH manufacturing technique specifically to optimize production of NPs that have characteristicsnecessary for CED (i.e. diameter lt  100 nm) (Aim 4). Following the completion of the above Aims, it is anticipated that we will have developed a method to efficiently manufacture a targeted nanoparticle vector that can be used to deliver a range of therapeutics for the treatment of malignant brain tumors. Importantly, such a product also has the potential to make a significant impact in the management of other diseases both in and outside of the nervous system.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposalfocuses on development of a core/shell nanoparticle for delivery of therapeutic agents for the treatment of malignant brain tumors. Important properties of these nanoparticles include their ability to be targeted to specific cells and to be imaged by routine MRI. As delivery of therapeutic agents to tumor cells is a major obstacle to the effective management of brain tumors, this vector system can make a significant impact in the management of this devastating disease.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2009, there were 219,000 new lung cancer cases reported. Roughly one-quarter of these patients will be considered candidates for  curative  surgical resection, where the preservation of lung function must be balanced against the extent of tissue removed. As a result, patients requiring these limited resection procedures suffer a high risk of developing local tumor recurrence, including early stage patients (16% local recurrence rate), due to the increased presence ofmicroscopic tumors cells remaining at or near the resection margin. Recurrent lung cancer is resected if possible, but the extent of disease or inadequate pulmonary function often limits treatment to palliative chemotherapy or external radiation therapy.There is currently no established standard of care for preventing locoregional tumor recurrence following resection. Fifth Base has developed a unique, and simple to use, drug eluting implant that reduces the incidence of locoregional cancer recurrence bylocally delivering therapeutic levels of drug to the site of highest risk of recurrence for over several months. The local delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to the resection margins would reduce the significant side effects associated with systemic administration, change the paradigm to  see and treat  at the time of surgery, allow the surgeon to excise a smaller margin while treating the residual tumor burden effectively and locally, reducing the tumor recurrence while preserving lung function. Fifth Baseproposes to advance our technology down the path of commercialization by the completion of the following Phase II proposed aims: 1) scale-up of monomer synthesis, 2) cGMP large scale synthesis of polymer with in-process validations, 3) performance of chemistry, manufacturing, and controls validations required for drug-eluting devices, 4) performance of FDA-required ISO-compliant biocompatibility studies including in vivo chronic toxicity, and 5) investigation of pharmacokinetic, distribution, and excretionof paclitaxel following orthotopic implantation of the drug-loaded polymer implant in a large animal lung model. With the successful completion of the key technological objectives in this Phase II SBIR proposal, along with work currently being performed in parallel, we will produce a batch of cGMP manufactured and packaged devices and performed nearly the complete battery of preclinical safety and toxicity testing required by the FDA for regulatory approval sufficient to initiate clinical trials. Phase IIIwill consist of a large animal safety study, obtainment of IDE/IRB clinical site approval, followed by the Phase I first-in-human clinical safety trial.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A critical property of radiation detectors is stopping power, which describes the efficiency of the detector in collecting radiation. In order to minimize patient dose, it is helpful to increase stopping power, since stopping power is inversely related to the dose required for obtaining high-quality patient images. Stopping power is strongly related to the effective atomic number of the detector material. Designers of radiological devices would prefer to build radiationdetectors from materials with very high effective atomic numbers, such as lead. Unfortunately, most elements with higher stopping powers are not good candidates as radiation detector materials, because electrical charges (created by radiation in the detector) cannot be easily moved out of the detector material. As a result, instruments placed outside the detector are unable to measure the charges caused by radiation in the detector material. The process of removing charge from the inside of the detector into the outside world (where that it can be measured) is called  charge transport . In Phase I, we showed that it was possible to cut the Gordian knot of detector specification, by separating the goal of creating high stopping power from the challenge of favorable charge transport. This separation was accomplished by creating a matrix in which quantum dots made of high-atomic- number material (i.e., lead sulfide) were interspersed within a silicon matrix. Quantum dots are small collections of atoms that havedifferent electrical properties than the bulk versions of these atoms. We used the high stopping power property of the lead sulfide, and the favorable electrical properties of the quantum dots, to convert radiation into charge with high efficiency. We usedthe silicon matrix to transport the charges effectively from the quantum dots to the surface of the silicon matrix, so that the charges could be amplified and provide strong signals to outside instruments. An additional benefit of using silicon as the host matrix was that we showed we could build circuit elements (e.g., amplifier components) on the same material as the radiation detector. Having demonstrated feasibility, our next goal is to ready the product for commercialization by optimizing detector quality. This project represents the first successful application of nanotechnology to direct-conversion radiation detection. It promises to reduce radiation dose to patients and to lower health care costs. In addition to the diagnostic radiology market, theplatform technology will be useful for homeland security and broad-spectrum surveillance for the consumer and defense markets, with potential cross-fertilization to the solar power industry.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The current primary form of treatment for all stages of colon cancer is surgical resection, with overall survival rates depending upon whether the cancer recurs and metastasizes. The likelihood of recurrence is directlyrelated to the stage of cancer, which is determined by the depth of tumor penetration into the wall of the colon. Recurrence rates range from 20% in stage I, up to 40% in stage II patients and up to 60% in stage III patients. However, colon cancer stagingis not an accurate method for predicting recurrence. In fact, all existing approaches to postoperative surveillance of patients with colon cancer are inadequate because disease recurrence is only detected when interventions have relatively little benefiton patient survival. Several prognostic markers have been proposed but because of a lack of specificity and sensitivity these have not been approved for use as clinical markers. New colon cancer markers that could accurately predict recurrence would be valuable for identifying patients that are at risk of cancer and may benefit from adjuvant therapy shortly after resection. The long-term goal for this project is to develop a molecular diagnostic assay that can be used at the time of resection of a primary colon tumor to identify patients with a high risk of recurrence. We will focus on microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers in these studies. Within the last two decades there has been great interest in miRNAs, which are noncoding small RNAs that have been initially identified as regulators of development, and have more recently been demonstrated to have a role in a number of cancers. Additionally, miRNA expression patterns have been shown to be highly predictive of cancer type, making them ideal as prognostic indicators.Our preliminary investigations have revealed miRNAs that are highly predictive of recurrence, but these studies need to be validated and expanded. We will utilize a comprehensive miRNA expression profiling system to the expanded miRNA discovery and buildbiomarker sets for prediction of recurrence of CRC. Bioinformatics analyses will be used to establish prognostic indices with high performance in predicting recurrence. In phase II we will implement design features on the validated biomarker set to developa robust, reliable, and reproducible qRT-PCR assay for miRNA analysis. We anticipate that our studies will be the foundation for a comprehensive clinical test to assist physicians and patients in the management of colon cancer recurrence.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Resection of colon cancer is often not effective because patients with significantly advanced disease have a high likelihood of recurrence and metastasis. Our long term goal is to develop a prognostic assay for colon cancer recurrence thatwill improve clinical management of colon cancer by identifying patients prior to clinical manifestation of recurrence, and at a stage at which medical intervention may benefit the patient.",

It is considered the most significant complication of head and neck cancer therapy. Oral mucositis is accompanied by tremendous pain and can cause life threatening complications. Dysfunction in swallowing following laryngeal cancer therapy can be particularly debilitating. The development ofchemoprotectants is the central goal of this proposal. In preliminary studies, Reaction Biology Corporation has discovered selective, reversible, small molecule caspase inhibitors, which have multiple advantages compared to the compounds in the clinical trials. For example, caspase inhibitors from many pharmaceutical companies&#039; drug discovery programs have one of more of the following characteristics: irreversible, peptide-mimic, Pan-caspase inhibitor. In Phase I studies, these compounds are very active incell based assays, demonstrated significant cell death prevention activities in chemical and radiation induced cell death in normal cell lines. In this Phase II application, we will continue to improve these inhibitors in potency and efficacy in cell based assays and DMPK profiles, to look for the final lead(s) in animal model tests. In this new proposal, the key aims are: 1) Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) studies to improve caspase inhibitors&#039; potency; 2) Define caspase inhibitors&#039; treatment conditions in vitro in conjugation with chemotherapy and radiation treatments; 3) Test caspase inhibitors&#039; tissue penetration and efficacy in protecting oral mucous cells from radiation therapy in 3D oral mucosa model.

Reaction Biology Corp. has discovered a few novel, potent and selective caspase inhibitors and would like to evaluate their cell death protection activities in chemotherapy and radiation induced apoptosis assays. Additional SAR studies will improve the potency of these compounds, and studies in 3D oral mucosa models will further reveal tissue penetration and cell protective properties of caspase inhibitors without testing in vivo animalmodel, which will help to eliminate toxic and ineffective compounds in early stage, and reducing the number of studies in animal models in the future.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cisplatin is a widely used cytotoxic agent with therapeutic activity against various tumors, but also with substantial side effects, including nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and myelosuppression. Therefore, a chemoprotective agent which reduces the side effects of cisplatin without affecting its efficacy would have significant clinical benefit. Currently, amifostine is the only FDA approved chemoprotective drug for cisplatin therapy. Amifostine is a sulfur-containing agent that reduces side effects resulted from both chemotherapy (including cisplatin) and radiotherapy regimens. Unfortunately, there are significant limitations associated with amifostine including its potentially serious side effects and potential tumor-protective effect. An ideal chemoprotector should not interfere with cisplatin&#039;s therapeutic effect, and with little or no toxicity by itself. As such, in our recently completed SBIR Phase I study, we investigated a small-molecule modulator of tumor necrosisfactor alpha (TNF-a), UTL-5g, as a leading chemoprotective agent. Based on this SBIR Phase I study, UTL-5g has been shown to reduce levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) elevated by cisplatin, indicating the protection of kidney and liver by UTL-5g. Blood levels of TNF-a elevated by cisplatin were also lowered by UTL-5g in a dose- dependent manner. An exciting finding is that not only UTL-5g did not reduce the antitumor effect of cisplatin in vivo, pre-treatment of UTL-5g actually increased the therapeutic effect of cisplatin. In addition, UTL-5g has a very low acute toxicity. All these exciting results from the SBIR Phase I study indicate that continued preclinical development is warranted. The specific aims of this SBIR Phase II study are: [Aim 1] Compare the chemoprotective effects by both oral gavage and ip injection (which was used in Phase I) in animal studies and determine the optimal oral dose of UTL-5g. If the ADME study shows that UTL-5g may be a pro-drug, we will also use the same protocol to study the chemoprotective effect of the metabolite(s). [Aim 2] Use the optimal oral dose of UTL-5g (determined in Aim 1) and increasing doses of cisplatin dose to find whether the MTD of cisplatin in mice can be increased by UTL-5g. If the MTD of cisplatin does increase, conduct a therapeutic assessment of cisplatin at the new MTD with and without UTL-5g. [Aim 3] Use the optimal oral dosage from Aim 1 to conduct the ADME study. [Aim 4] Scaleup the synthesis of API and prepare up to 1 kg of UTL-5g. [Aim 5] Conduct the 28-day repeat- dose toxicity studies in two species under GLP condition, employing the oral dosage form of UTL-5g. [Aim 6] Develop an oral formulation of UTL-5g suitable for thefirst clinical trial; develop and validate an analytical method for the oral formulation; define the specification and conduct a stability study on the oral dosage form. [Aim 7] Prepare a draft protocol suitable for the first Phase I clinical trial. [Aim8] Compile a pre-IND package in the format according to FDA&#039;s guidance for Industry and be ready for a pre-IND meeting with the FDA.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This SBIR Phase II study is the continuation of the successful SBIR Phase I study to conduct the preclinical development of a small-molecule TNF-a modulator, UTL-5g, as a chemoprotective agent to prevent/reduce side effects induced by cisplatin without compromising its therapeutic effect.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently available anti-angiogenic drugs inhibit VEGF/VEGFR signaling, which leads to transient vascular regression followed by rebound of drug-resistant vasculature, which significantly decrease the therapeutic efficacy of very expensive anti-angiogenic treatment. To overcome this problem, we are developing a cytotoxic 177Lu radiopharmaceutical, scVEGF/Lu. This radiopharmaceutical is based on engineered single-chain VEGF (scVEGF) and it accumulates in tumor endothelialcells via endocytosis mediated by overexpressed VEGFR-2. In Phase I we optimized the composition of scVEGF/Lu, assessed its radiotoxicity and dosimetry and performed initial therapeutic efficacy and mechanistic studies in orthotopic breast tumor models. Our results demonstrate that a single injection of a safe dose of scVEGF/Lu induces destruction of tumor vasculature sustainable for at least 30-35 days and a widespread apoptosis in tumor without significant overall radiotoxicity. In contrast, FDA-approvedsunitinib and bevacizumab failed to induce sustainable destruction of tumor vasculature, suggesting potential advantages of scVEGF/Lu.  In Phase II we will focus on late pre-clinical development of scVEGF/Lu as a novel component of anti- angiogenic therapy, using orthotopic mouse models of recurrent breast cancer, including a model of human triple negative breast cancer. First, we will establish the dose- and time-dependences for scVEGF/Lu-induced destruction of tumor vasculature and potential roles of overexpressed endogenous VEGF and immunocompetent environment in therapeutic efficacy of scVEGF/Lu. Next, we will establish optimal sequence for scVEGF/Lu-doxorubicin combination as adjuvant therapy for recurrent breast cancer. Considering that scVEGF is a physiologically active protein, we will also establish the safety profile for scVEGF-PEG-DOTA conjugate. We expect that by the end of Phase II of the project we will have evidence-based indications for safe use of scVEGF/Lu in adjuvant anti-angiogenic therapy for breast cancer. We will also have a GLP-grade for dosimetry studies. This data will be used for filing IND or eIND with FDA for Phase I clinical trials with scVEGF/Lu in breast cancer. We believe that this novel targeted radiopharmaceutical may provide a new line of attack on breast cancer, and eventually will be explored for treatment of other cancers.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To increase the efficacy anti-angiogenic therapy, it is necessary to sustain tumor vascular regression and to inhibit vascular rebound. For this, we develop a novel 177Lu radiopharmaceutical, scVEGF/Lu, which delivers lethal doses of 177Lu in tumor endothelial cells. In orthotopic models of breast cancer, scVEGF/Lu induces destruction of tumor vasculature and widespread apoptosis in tumor, without significant overall radiotoxicity. In this project we will evaluate the potential of scVEGF/Lu as a novel component of anti-angiogenic therapy that could make a significant impact on outcome of triple negative breast cancer. We expect that this study will provide evidence-based indications for safe use of scVEGF/Lu as a mono- or combination therapy as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. We believe that this novel targeted radiopharmaceutical may provide a new line of attack on breast cancer and eventually will be explored for treatment of other cancers.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II SBIR project is aimed at developing a novel type of drugs, termed SNX9-class compounds, with a unique combination of two anticancer activities. The first is a selective antiproliferative effect on tumor cells relative to normal cells. The second is the inhibition of chemotherapy- or radiation-induced expression of multiple genes encoding secreted tumor-supporting factors with mitogenic, antiapoptotic and angiogenic activities; as a result, SNX9-class compounds potentiate the induction of apoptosis by conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. Studies conducted during Phase I of this project showed that both activities of SNX9- class compounds are due to their ability to inhibit CDK3. This understudied member of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family is apparently unneeded by normal cells, based on its very low expression in normal human tissues and spontaneous germline inactivation in laboratory mice. However, CDK3 is overexpressed in different cancers, where itacts as an oncogene enhancing the activity of transcription factor AP1 (Jun/Fos). This tumor selectivity advantageously distinguishes CDK3 as a cancer target from cell cycle-regulating CDKs (CDK1, CDK2, CDK4/6), which are targeted by pharmaceutical CDK inhibitors, previously developed by others. Computer modeling and structure-activity analysis conducted during Phase I indicate that SNX9-class compounds selectively inhibit CDK3 through binding to a newly identified allosteric pocket that distinguishes CDK3from the closely related CDK2 and other CDKs. The first aim of the proposed Phase II study is to develop new, more potent and selective SNX9-class CDK3 inhibitors through rational drug design, based on computer modeling of SNX9-CDK3 interactions. The second aim is to test the effects of SNX9-class compounds on the production of multiple tumor-supporting secreted factors by chemotherapy- and radiation- damaged tumor cells, at the levels of RNA, protein, and paracrine anti-apoptotic activity. The third aim isto test SNX9-class compounds for their antiproliferative activity in different colon carcinoma and glioblastoma cell lines, the tumor types that are indicated by CDK3 expression and inhibition assays to be most likely to be susceptible to CDK3 inhibitors.The fourth aim is to evaluate SNX9-class compounds that show in vitro potency and CDK3 selectivity by assessments of in vivo toxicity and pharmacokinetics in rats (which, unlike laboratory mice, express functional CDK3). The results of these assessments will be used to select the compound with the most favorable pharmacokinetics and the least toxicity for in vivo efficacy studies, which constitute the fifth and the final aim of this proposal. In vivo tumor-suppression studies will be conducted in rat xenograft models of human colon carcinoma and glioblastoma (intracranial model). A compound showing safety and efficacy in vivo will be selected for preclinical and clinical development as a new anticancer drug.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of thisPhase II SBIR project is to develop a novel type of drug with a unique combination of two anticancer activities: selective killing of tumor cells and increasing the effect of existing anticancer drugs. Both of these activities are mediated through the inhibition of a protein CDK3, which is not needed by normal cells but plays an essential role in cancers. In the proposed program, improved CDK3 inhibitors will be developed through computer modeling and chemical synthesis and tested for activity against coloncancer and an intractable brain tumor glioblastoma.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Targeted therapies have the ability to specifically interact with and block proliferation of cancer cells by interfering with targeted gene products required for the malignant phenotype. Unlike conventional cancer chemotherapies, targeted therapies do not harm normal cells of the body. This class of therapeutic has been met with considerable clinical success indicating that there is a great need for new targeted therapies that block progression of other types of cancerfor which no targeted therapy exists.  We hypothesize that all hematopoietic cells (normal and cancerous) express genes responsible for maintaining the blood lineage and blood cancer phenotypes, and that the products of these genes can be exploited by newtargeted therapies. Identification of these hematopoieitc-specific lethal genes would allow for the development of novel targeted therapies for combating diverse blood cancers, and for developing tissue-specific, targeted conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with greatly reduced morbidity and mortality. We tested this hypothesis in the course of Phase I studies, and demonstrated that pooled shRNA genetic viability screens could be successfully used to identify novel lethality drug targets specific for hematopoietic cancer cell types. We also identified small molecule agents that exhibited hematopoietic-specificity closely correlating lethality profiles of the shRNAs identified in genetic screens.  In order to translate this researches into the future development of novel classes of targeted therapies, we propose in the Phase II studies to concurrently apply genome-wide RNAi-based genetic screening and small molecule library high-throughput (HT) screens to identify lethality genesand cytotoxic small molecules specific for members of a diverse panel of hematopoetic cell lines. The hematopoieitc-specific lethal shRNAs, and small molecules targeting lethality genes will be further validated using a wide panel of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell lines and normal PBMC. Similar toxicity/lethality profiles will allow us to prioritize cytotoxic compounds based on their mechanism of action and simultaneously identify their specific drug target(s). These studies will be extended to the lead compounds for targeted therapy of hematological cancers in Phase III of the project in a joint drug development project between Cellecta and Tartis, Inc.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The relevance of the proposed research to public health is that it may identify new drugs or biomolecules targetable by drugs, for treatment of blood cancers such as leukemia, or for new, reduced toxicity ablative drugs for stem cell transplantation conditioning.",

For this reason, in modern technically demanding radiation therapy for prostate cancer, it is standard practice to localize the prostate on most days treatment as an aid to achieve the goal of delivering a high dose to the prostate while protecting nearby radiosensitive normal tissues. The Phase I study established the feasibility of a novel approach that uses unique mathematical properties of a class of statistically trainable deformable shape models to estimate treatment image data by mapping reference CT image data into the treatment space based on measured positions of markers implanted in the prostate.

The envisioned commercial form will accept input data from multiple devices including the treatment planning system, treatment machine, and marker tracking system, and will communicate output data to the treatment planning system.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this proposal is the development, evaluation and validation of an accurate, low cost diagnostic test that can discriminate prostate cancer from benign prostatic hyperplasia to a Specificity of 85% at aSensitivity of 85%.  Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, with a probability of 1 in 6. Approximately 29% of all cancer cases in males are prostate cancer with 27,050 deaths estimated in 2009. As in most cancers, early and accurate detectioncan be life saving. However, a major deficiency of the current prostate cancer screening test, PSA, is that it does not discriminate between cancer and a common benign condition; benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). In fact, 88% of positive PSA tests are attributed to BPH. Although BPH is a non-threatening condition, only expensive biopsies can distinguish it from prostate cancer.  Technological Innovation. Inanovate has partnered with investigators at Brigham and Women&#039;s Hospital (BWH) to  identify a seriesof auto-antibody biomarkers capable of distinguishing prostate cancer from BPH to a Specificity of 85% at a Sensitivity of 85%. The proposed diagnostic test integrates this biomarker panel with a novel biochip platform capable of accurately screening multiple low concentration proteins from blood samples at the point of care. The platform includes a nano-particle surface technology that improves assay sensitivity by controlling the distribution and orientation of proteins across the biochip surface; and areal-time fluorescent biochip scanner and analysis methodology that enables the discrimination of &#039;specific&#039; (true) biomarker signals from &#039;non-specific&#039; (false) signals. Phase I Summary. The objective was to demonstrate the feasibility of using a nano-particle biochip surface technology in combination with real-time florescent imaging to measure the concentration of multiple autoantibody biomarkers for accurate detection of prostate cancer. In Phase I a prototype system was developed and tested. Followingreviewer critiques from the original Phase II submission, the prototype platform has been substantially re-engineered, and the performance significantly improved. Through Phase II, this system will be advanced for point-of-care (PoC) use, in parallel withvalidation of the auto-antibody biomarker panel in preparation for multi-site clinical trials. Phase II Objectives. 1) Develop PoC version of the real-time flow-based screening platform, 2) Validate biomarkers using real-time measurement, 3) Prepare regulatory/commercial plans for clinical trials.  Commercial Opportunity. The potential market for a point-of-care prostate cancer screening is estimated at over  2B  p.a. Furthermore, by helping make accurate cancer screening available and affordable to everyone, we see the  underlying diagnostic platform proposed herein playing a key role in moving the health industry&#039;s focus away from  inefficient late stage treatments, towards early stage diagnosis and lower cost therapies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The most common cancer in men is prostate cancer, with a lifetime probability of 1 in 6. Approximately 200,000 new  cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed per year with nearly 30,000 deaths. The current FDA approved diagnostic test  for prostate cancer (PSA)has a limitation in that serum levels of PSA are elevated in both prostate cancer and Benign  Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). Most men with an elevated PSA level turn out to not have cancer; with unnecessary  biopsies performed in as many as 88% of men (over1 million each year) at a cost of  2 billion p.a. to the US health  system. A low cost test which can accurately distinguish prostate cancer from BPH is critically needed.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of the proposed research is to thoroughly characterize a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds and inhibits human Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2; basic FGF) for potential use in cancer therapy.FGF2 can directly stimulate tumor cell proliferation and also induces migration, proliferation and differentiation of endothelial cells, so is a potent angiogenic factor. FGF2 is strongly expressed in most gliomas and in renal cell cancer (RCC), contributes to progression of prostate tumors, and is a factor for the growth of melanomas, but has been most strongly associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the predominant form of liver cancer (hepatoma). The Applicant has generated an anti-FGF2 mAb, GAL-F2, and shown that it neutralizes all tested biological activities of FGF2 and, importantly, strongly inhibits the growth of tumor xenografts from three different HCC cell lines. The GAL-F2 mAb has already been humanized to generate HuGAL-F2, a mAb potentially suitable for administration to human patients. Hence, the overall goal of the proposed research plan is to generate a data package of functional assay results, mechanism of action findings, animal model studies and initial safety studies that will support filing of an IND for this humanized mAb. More specifically, the binding affinity of HuGAL-F2 for human and mouse FGF2 will be precisely determined, and assays will be conducted for HuGAL-F2 inhibition of (i) binding of FGF2 to its cellular receptorsFGFR1-4, (ii) FGF2-induced phosphorylation and cell proliferation, and (iii) FGF2-induced angiogenesis. The ability of HuGAL-F2 to inhibit growth of xenografts from several HCC and RCC cell lines will be explored extensively. In these studies, HuGAL-F2 will be tested both as a single agent and in combination with other drugs: Nexavar, approved for treatment of HCC and RCC; Sutent, approved for treatment of RCC; and Avastin, currently in clinical trials for HCC. The mechanism of action of HuGAL-F2 against tumor growth will be investigated by measuring cellular proliferation, angiogenesis and apoptosis in xenografts from mice treated with the mAb. To expand the potential indications for HuGAL-F2 to brain cancer, the effectiveness of this mAb in treating orthotopic xenografts generated from glioblastoma (GBM) stem cells will also be investigated, as such xenografts replicate the characteristics of true clinical GBMs with high fidelity. Finally, to advance the humanized mAb toward an IND for clinical trials and to help attract a corporate partner/licensee to sponsor further development, a standard tissue cross-reactivity study and an initial toxicology study in rodents will be performed.

The objective of the planned program is to test a monoclonal antibody that targets a growth factor believed to be involved in many tumors. The antibody will have the potential to be an effective drug for various types of cancer including liver, kidney, and brain.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer symptoms due to disease progression or side effects caused by cancer treatment are prevalent. Most cancer patients are treated in outpatient settings, having to self-manage these symptoms at home. For a variety of reasons, symptom self-management by patients and their caregivers can be a tremendous burden on themselves, resulting in suboptimal patient outcomes and increased healthcare costs due to unnecessary hospitalizations or clinic visits. The goal of this project is to develop a home-based Cancer Symptom Management (CSM) system to promote patient self-management of cancer symptoms and treatment side effects and facilitate remote management by the care team. The anticipated benefits include improved patient self-reported outcomes, better self-efficacy, better patient-provider communication, and reduced hospital stays/clinic visits. This is a Fast Track application. Our Phase I aims include: 1) the collection and analysis of system requirements via focus groups and interviews; 2) the design and development of a working prototype via iterative user- centric design and object-oriented software development methodologies; and 3) the evaluation of system usability and user acceptance via a small-scale pilot test. Our Phase II aims include: 1) the development of the final product by adding multimedia patient education contents and by thoroughly examining system architecture level issues such as performance, scalability, and maintainability; and 2) a larger-scale randomized controlled trial at two clinical sites to evaluate the efficacy of our symptom management solution.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work is intended to improve access to care, promote patient self-management, facilitate provider-patient communication, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. The effort is of particular public health interest since with the aging population the number of oncology patients is expected to increase and telemedicine technologies couldfacilitate more accessible quality care for patients in remote rural locations as well as frail or disabled patients in urban settings. In addition, home-based symptom management solutions could reduce unnecessary emergency room and clinic visits, hence reducing healthcare costs as well as conserving energy.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress toward full development of ViewRay&#039;s Renaissance  System 1000 MRI image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) system is being threatened by the growing shortage of helium worldwide. This pioneering technology is aimed at treating cancerous tumors in the abdomen where bodily functions cause significant organ displacements making precise dose delivery difficult or impossible. Liquid helium is presently essential for operation of present day low temperature niobium-titanium (NbTi) based superconductor magnets. Helium worldwide is being depleted at a rate exceeding the capacity of the current natural gas wells (helium is a byproduct of some natural gas wells) around the world. The US strategic reserves are being sold off to stabilize the price but to little avail; the price of helium continues to rise. Projections from a variety of sources all point to major shortages and the price increases in the 2010-2015 time frame and beyond. This will threaten all helium users but most of all the MRI industry. Already, the three major MRI manufacturers, have development programs aimed at converting from re-condensing liquid helium bath cooling to dry conduction cooling to cryocoolers using magnesium diboride (MgB2) superconductors. Hyper Tech has active programs with all three to utilize magnesium diboride (MgB2) superconductors. Magnesium diboride superconductors have the unique property of being superconducting a full 30 K higher than the currently used niobium titanium (NbTi) while being in the same wire form suitable for large magnet manufacturing. MgB2 enables converting from the liquid helium bath cooling to conduction cooling because of this wide temperature margin needed to accommodate temperature gradients in the magnet. Even without the urgency brought on by the helium shortage, it is cost effective to all MRI manufacturers to transition their background magnets from liquid helium bath cooling to dry conduction cooling. With an inventory of ~2000 liters of liquid helium in a standard NbTi based MRI magnet, there is the ever present danger of a quench and sudden release of gaseous helium. A rupture disc and large exhaust duct to the outside are required for all present MRI installations. In addition, the dewar and vacuum enclosuremust be ASME pressure vessel certified in case of an over pressure due to a failed rupture disc. These factors make a significant cost impact on the initial price of an MRI and the follow-on maintenance. This Phase I, Phase II Fast Track SBIR endeavors toremove the helium shortage obstacle facing ViewRay&#039;s development while at the same time providing an avenue to significantly lower the unit cost of their commercialized Renaissance  System 1000. During this program Hyper Tech will perform the necessary research in order to develop and fabricate a helium free background magnet system using its MgB2 superconductor wire. We will supply the magnet system to ViewRay who will incorporate it into their Renaissance  System 1000 MRI IGRT system and perform imagingtests to verify the overall magnet system performance compared with the present NbTi superconducting magnet based imaging system. This will lead to clinical validation of the fully integrated IGRT with Hyper Tech&#039;s MgB2 based background magnet system.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The first true, real time MRI image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) system that delivers gamma radiation to malignant tumors with pinpoint accuracy in spite of organ movement will be demonstrated by ViewRay Renaissance  System 1000 using Hyper Tech&#039;s magnesium diboride superconducting magnets. The Hyper Tech MgB2 magnet system will significantly lower the cost and on-going maintenance costs of ViewRay&#039;s cancer treatment technology. In addition, the magnet system will be safer andless prone to quenching than presently used magnet system.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a Fast-Track proposal to develop a tissue-based genetic test for BRCA1 hereditary ovarian cancer. Ten percent of unselected US ovarian cancers are BRCA1 hereditary cancers with truncating mutations in the BRCA1gene. It is important to know which ovarian cancer patients have BRCA1 hereditary ovarian cancer because BRCA1 patients have an increased risk of breast cancer and their relatives with mutations have an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. These subsequent cancers would be discovered early or prevented if widespread genetic screening was available and recent data indicates that BRCA hereditary cancers respond to targeted therapies such as cis-platinum and PARP inhibitors. We have developed an antibody-based tissue truncation method to identify BRCA1 hereditary cancers and were able to correctly identify 5/5 BRCA1 hereditary cancers and 20/200 sporadic cancers in a pilot study. This approach visualizes protein truncation by showing with immunohistochemistry (IHC) that the N-terminus is present but the C-terminus is absent. The product (test) will be an antibody-based IHC diagnostic kit for cancer tissue samples which hospital labs will use to identify hereditary cancers. We have already successful developed and published a similar IHC method to identify BRCA2 hereditary cancers with sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 98%.The milestones for the Phase I proposal are: 1) Determine optimal tissue preparation protocols for IHC with both N-terminal and C-terminal BRCA1 antibodies. 2) Develop a quantitative scoring system for N-terminal and C-Terminal BRCA1 immunostaining on ovarian tissues with intra-assay variability of 15% and inter-assay variability of 20% or less. 3) Demonstrate that a C-terminal to N-terminal ratio for protein truncation (BRCA1 Truncation Ratio) can distinguish 20 hereditary BRCA1 ovarian cancers from 50 sporadic ovarian cases with greater than 90% sensitivity and specificity (comparing different scoring systems). Upon completion of these milestones we would pursue the following Phase II milestones: Milestone 1a: Determine the specificity of the BRCA1 truncation ratio in 20 ovarian cancers in patients known to have BRCA2 mutations. Milestone 1b: Determine the specificity of the truncation ratio in 10 ovarian cancers in patients reported to have polymorphisms/missense variants of BRCA1. Milestone 2: Determine if the BRCA1 truncation test can achieve 90% sensitivity and specificity in a clinical trial of 300 ovarian cancer samples (sample size to provide 30 BRCA1 hereditary cancers). The medical application of breast/ovarian cancer genetic testing is a proven market since Myriad Genetics annually grosses  150 million on DNA sequencing.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Successful completion of this Fast-track research will establish a new tissue- based genetic test for BRCA1 hereditary ovarian cancer based on an IHC method to visualize protein truncation. This simpler more widely applicable approach will help predict appropriate therapy for patients with BRCA1 hereditary cancer and identify many more families with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and consequently help patients and their relatives by identifying individuals likely to develop subsequent breast or ovarian cancer which might beprevented by tamoxifen and/or screening.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In comparison to standard x-ray therapy, proton therapy allows an increased dose of radiation to a tumor and by reducing the amount of radiation to healthy tissue. As a result, it provides the best possible option for using radiation to control and eliminate tumors with the least short and long term toxic side effects. Currently less than 1% of all radiation therapy patients receive proton therapy while the number of patients that would benefit substantially from their use with current protocols is estimated to be over 30%. The major barriers to greater utilization of proton therapy are the size and cost of the facilities. The layout of the current proton therapy treatment centers is dominated by the size of the iso-centric gantries that rotate the proton beam dose delivery system around the patient. ProCure&#039;s focus for this project is to invent a new gantry concept using modern robotics and high temperature superconducting magnets that will greatly reduce the gantry sizeand mass, the power needed to operate it and consequently the contribution of these gantries to the facility cost. ProCure proposes to research new technology that would reduce the gantry mass by an order of magnitude and cost by a factor of three.  PhaseI research will allow ProCure to determine the optimal design and components needed for a compact and low cost gantry based on novel beam scanning concepts and the use of high temperature superconducting magnet technology for use in Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy. In the first 12 months of Phase II, ProCure will work on constructing prototype magnets for the selected gantry concept, build key temporary magnet supports and nozzle components and in the next six months of Phase II, ProCure will carry out experiments using a full scale system in the Proton Dosimetry Test Facility recently commissioned at the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility.  In Phase III, ProCure will complete the tests of the magnetic and nozzle operation at IUCF and make initial submission to the FDA. ProCure will construct a first prototype of the full rotating mechanical support system for the gantry and install the full system for mechanical system tests. In parallel, ProCure will start the acquisition process for the first systemsthat will be installed. Finally, FDA complete system testing for full FDA 510k approval will be performed.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proton therapy provides the best possible option for using radiation to control and eliminate tumors with the leastshort and long term toxic side effects; however, only less than 1% of all radiation therapy patients receive proton therapy. The major barriers to greater utilization of proton therapy are the size and cost of the facilities. ProCure&#039;s new proton beam delivery concept will greatly reduce the size and mass of the system and the power needed to operate it, and consequently, help to bring this highly effective form of cancer treatment to the mainstream of radiation therapy.",

Given the current paucity of linguistically appropriate services and the association between LEP status and adverse health outcomes (including inadequate use of analgesia for pain control, increased number of diagnostic tests, extended length of hospital stay, and overall dissatisfaction with care), a new paradigm for language- concordant patient-provider communication is needed. This system will also contribute to reducing the burden and stress on nurses by offering an efficient method to process reoccurring patient requests. The primary objective of Phase I is to develop a functional prototype of the envisioned software in English, Chinese and Spanish. Monolingual speakers of the target languages and English-speaking healthcare providers will be recruited to test the prototype and evaluate its efficacy and ease of use in communicating a pre-determined set of sample patient requests. In Phase II, the closed-ended request database will be markedly expanded and additional language versions will be incorporated. The system will undergo clinical testing during a 13-month multi-site trial in collaboration with a large urban medical center. Outcome measures will include patient quality of care, patient satisfaction, provider satisfaction, and workflow efficiency.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: For the 24 million individuals in the United States with limited English proficiency (LEP), the current paucity of linguistically appropriate services poses a significant barrier to obtaining equitable healthcare. This Fast-Track proposal seeks to develop a patient-driven, multilingual software application for touchscreen use at the bedside to facilitate the communication of common requests between hospitalized LEP patients and hospital staff. Effective communication is essential to ensuring quality of care for LEP patients, mitigating documented adverse health outcomes such as inadequate use of analgesia for pain control, excess number of diagnostic tests, extended length of hospital stay, and overall dissatisfaction with care.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PSMA is an important biomarker for prostate cancer prognosis and an appropriate target for therapy due to its restricted expression mainly on late-stage, androgen-independent and metastatic prostate cancer cells. Whilecurrently there is only one clinical PSMA targeted agent for SPECT imaging (the antibody-based Prostascint ), high-affinity small-molecule inhibitors to PSMA have not been fully exploited for targeting and imaging prostate cancer. The overall objective ofthis application is to optimize a novel imaging probe for the in vivo detection of PSMA positive prostate tumors. Our central hypothesis for the proposed work is that an F-18 labeled irreversible inhibitor to PSMA coupled with PET scan could be used for prostate cancer staging as well as localization of lymph and bone metastasis. The rationale for undertaking the proposed research is that optimized F-18 labeled PSMA imaging constructs will serve as the foundation for a clinically relevant imaging modality for the diagnosis and post-treatment assessment of prostate cancer. This labeling needs to be in a chemistry that is readily available to the growing number of hospitals with cyclotrons and PET scanners. Additionally, demonstrating the effectiveness of ourprostate tumor imaging probes in vivo and safety in animal models will serve as initial steps for the subsequent development of a radiotherapeutic agent for clinical use. The PIs will test the central hypothesis and accomplish the overall objective of thisapplication by pursuing the following specific aims: Phase I 1) optimize the nucleophilic 18F labeling of CTT-54; 2) chemical/biochemical evaluation of lead compounds from AIM 1. Phase II Aims: 1) In vivo evaluation of selected PET tracers produced by Phase I and In vivo testing of lead compound for safety and pharmacokinetics Milestones include: labeling of CTT-54 with 1) an overall yield of 40%, high specific activity (gt500 Ci/mmole), stability of gt90% for up to 6 hours, 2) targeting of prostate cancerin mouse xenograft model and 3) a safety profile that will support filing an IND. The proposed work is expected to yield the following outcomes. First, a labeling chemistry that can be used in any one of the 277 PET centers in the United States. Secondly,a safety profile of the labeled lead compound that would support an investigation new drug application with the FDA. The high- affinity small-molecule targeting platform upon which our lead compound is based is unique compared to other targeting moleculesbecause it has demonstrated irreversible binding to the prostate tumor biomarker PSMA. These unique characteristics make this compound is a more attractive targeting platform for prostate tumor binding with enhanced translational potential. It is expectedthat the proposed work will result in optimized prostate cancer imaging agents, which is important because better detection agents are essential for assisting clinicians in staging prostate cancer, developing personalized therapy, and monitoring treatment.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this application is to develop a novel clinically relevant diagnostic for prostate cancer that capitalizes on the potency and specific affinity of small-molecule inhibitors to PSMA. The overall objectives of this application are to further the development our primary PSMA inhibitor, CTT-54 by optimizing the 18F-labeling chemistry, demonstrating PET imaging of prostate cancer in animal models systems, and initiate toxicology studies in support of clinicaltrials. The preliminary data presented demonstrates that a small molecule inhibitor of PSMA can target and image prostate cancer when coupled to a radionuclide tracer.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This SBIR grant application for the clinical development of a novel vaccine to treat patients with sarcoma is based on a foundation of 30 years of studies at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). During these30 years, the antigens expressed by various cancers (neuroblastoma, sarcoma, breast, ovarian, melanoma, etc.) were defined using Immunohistology, SCLC and sarcomas were identified as having the most intense expression of immunogenic antigens, and sarcomasselected as the most suitable setting for the initial proof of concept randomized trial. Three cell surface antigens most relevant for a sarcoma vaccine and uniquely over-expressed in all types of sarcomas were identified as the gangliosides GM2, GD2 and GD3. The benefit of immunization with ganglioside-KLH conjugate vaccines or treatment with monoclonal antibodies against these gangliosides was demonstrated in preclinical studies, with the most striking benefit resulting when the targets were micrometastases or circulating tumor cells; a setting comparable to the adjuvant setting in the clinic. Responses to treatment with murine mAbs against each of these antigens have been seen in both preclinical studies and clinical trials. Conjugate vaccines against allthree gangliosides have also been used in clinical trials. Vaccination with either the monovalent (GM2) or bivalent (GM2/GD2 or GD2/GD3) gangliosides has demonstrated very mild toxicity profiles and consistent high titer antibodies in the clinical trialsconducted to date. The objective of this combined Phase I and II SBIR grant application is to evaluate for the first time the clinical efficacy of a trivalent ganglioside vaccine plus immunological adjuvant in sarcoma patients. Over the initial 6 month Phase I portion of this STTR proposal, scale-up of production of the final component (GD2-KLH) will be performed, and the trivalent vaccine will be vialed and released. This will involve a significant scale up in the complex preparation of GD2 and trivalent vaccine compared to what we have previously undertaken. Also, protocols in at least 5 of the 11 medical centers will be IRB approved and investigator training will be started in preparation for initiation of the Phase 2 trial. The Phase II portion of this proposal will support conduct of the randomized, multi-center Phase 2 trial. It is hoped that this double-blind trial will prove pivotal for this sarcoma population of patients and that it will facilitate subsequent trials with this same vaccine in patientswith neuroblastoma and pediatric sarcomas. The translational research objectives proposed here will add depth to our understanding of the role of antibodies in this setting while they validate the use of a PCR based circulating tumor cell (CTC) assay forprognostic and possibly staging purposes, and as a surrogate marker for vaccine efficacy.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies induced by the proposed trivalent vaccine against sarcoma gangliosides GM2, GD2 and GD3 are ideally suited for eradicationof free tumor cells and micrometastases. If antibodies of sufficient titer can be induced against these antigens to eliminate these sarcoma cells from the blood and to eradicate micrometastases, this would dramatically change our approach to treating sarcoma patients. Establishment of new metastases would no longer be possible, so more aggressive local therapies (including surgery or radiation therapy) might result in long term control of metastatic sarcoma. The primary endpoint for this pivotal multicenterrandomized trial is improvement in progression-free survival at one year.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that control gene expression by regulating messenger (mRNA) translation. miRNAs can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, and the differential expression of miRNAs has beencorrelated with cancer diagnosis, staging, and prognosis, and has been used to nominate therapeutic targets. Much of what is known about miRNAs in cancer comes from genome-scale miRNA expression profiling. Unfortunately, despite hundreds of published studies using miRNA profiling data, at present a basic cancer biologist lacks tools to survey the differential expression of one or more miRNAs in a specific cancer type or across the global collection of miRNA expression profiling studies. Barriers include identifying available data, platform heterogeneity, analysis methods and meaningful presentation of results. Thus, a useful solution must address a number of challenges, including the growing number of miRNAs, multiple technologies and reporters used to measure miRNA expression, disparate clinical and experimental facts, and producing biologically meaningful analyses. Here we propose to develop a solution for a biologist seeking to explore a single miRNA or a miRNA signature across the global collection of cancer miRNA data sets. To accomplish this, our overall goal is to collect all publicly available cancer-related high throughput miRNA data, to standardize the disparate data at three levels - sample data, expression data, and statistical analyses - and to present the data in a consistent, comparable format that is also fully integrated with existing, mRNA and DNA copy data in Oncomine. In Phase I we will 1) Establish and implement sample metadata curation strategy for 3 micro-RNA profiling datasets to demonstrate feasibility of applying a controlled vocabulary and ontology to miRNA sample metadata; 2) Establish and implement platform mapping strategy for 3 micro-RNA profiling datasets to demonstrate feasibility of standardizing disparate miRNA platforms intoa single, unified format; 3) Perform differential expression analysis on 3 micro-RNA profiling datasets to demonstrate feasibility of creating automatically standardized analyses following the curation and mapping steps conducted in Aims 1 and 2. Upon successful completion of Phase I, we propose the following Phase II aims: 1) Development and Implementation of a scalable process for capturing and curating micro-RNA genomics data and integration into Oncomine by developing software to support the scalable catalog and capture of miRNA sample data; 2) Development of a scalable micro-RNA genomics platform mapping and data warehouse strategy and integration into Oncomine, by developing tools to accommodate dynamic naming conventions for micro-RNAS and mapping tocommon identifiers, and 3) Development of automated analysis methods for analyzing micro-RNA profiling datasets and integration into Oncomine by developing automated differential expression, co-expression, outlier, and meta- analysis capability across themiRNA database, and integration within the established Oncomine database.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite the substantial efforts of scientist to understand the molecular basis of cancer, these research gains have been difficult to translate into clinical practice, and cancer remains a leading cause of mortality in the United States. This proposal seeks to make micro-RNA data - which is clearly correlated with cancer diagnosis, staging, and prognosis - easily accessible to cancer researchers via thecancer genomic portal Oncomine. If successful, this effort will improve public health by providing researchers with additional data and tools to understand and treat this biologically complex disease.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): College student-athletes are at increased risk of heavy alcohol use, smokeless tobacco use, and the use of performance enhancing substances as compared to non-athlete college students. Despite recent research underscoring the need for athlete-tailored interventions, there are no evidence-based options for the prevention of substance use among college student-athletes that take into account their unique patterns and motivations for use. This void leaves colleges with feweasy-to-use, effective, and economical options for meeting the needs of their student-athletes and the minimum drug education requirements set by their governing organizations. The broad aim of the proposed study is to use the innovative Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST; Collins et al., 2005, 2007) to develop a highly effective Internet-delivered program (myPlaybook) for the prevention of substance use among college student-athletes. The MOST approach is a systematic method for making decisions aboutprogram development and adaptation that are based on the performance of individual program components. The five core lessons of myPlaybook will undergo two rounds of randomized experimentation and targeted revision. At the conclusion of the second round, the newly optimized version of myPlaybook will be assembled and evaluated in large-scale Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). This  beta  version of myPlaybook will be compared to an Internet-based college alcohol intervention with proven effectiveness with general college students (College Alc; Bersamin et al., 2007; Paschall and Antin, 2008; Paschall et al., 2006). This approach will allow us to 1) develop an intervention that is optimized for considerable impact on substance use outcomes and 2) demonstratethe need for interventions specifically adapted for college student-athletes. The proposed research will be among the first demonstrations of the MOST approach for building and evaluating behavioral interventions with greatly enhanced public health impact.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project has the potential to contribute to the health and safety of the more than 460,000 college student-athletes in the US. A contribution to the science of prevention will be made by demonstrating an innovative approach for the development and revision of behavioral interventions that focuses on achieving both statistical significance and optimizing public health impact.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this SBIR is to develop an online tool, Synthetic Controls, to help local evaluators and others charged with demonstrating evidence of effectiveness of drug prevention programs obtain evidence for assessingthe effectiveness of their interventions. Synthetic Controls will provide useful analyses and simultaneously relieve local evaluators of the burden of having to identify, convene, maintain, and administer surveys to a comparison group. The system will meta-analytically combine archived data from previously administered surveys - including evaluation data from intervention groups of relevant programs and from control groups where available - to establish counterfactuals for local evaluators. Thus, rather than relying on gold-standard methods (e.g. randomized control trials) for assessing impact, the goal of this approach will be to provide a statistically reliable method for determining the impact of local programs by comparing current performance against benchmarks set by an accumulated database of previous evaluations.  During Phase I, we were able to demonstrate the feasibility of using an extant database for completing a pilot test of proposed methods. We refined statistical methods for completing analysesusing referent data. We completed extensive analyses to demonstrate the feasibility and utility of the proposed methods.  During Phase II, we propose to complete the following tasks:  1. We will design a database that will efficiently reconstitute variousconfigurations of data to allow users to select appropriate comparison groups.  2. We will develop data analysis algorithms that will construct appropriate comparisons for behavioral and mediating variable analyses.  3. We will develop protocols to automatically link the application to data collected by local evaluations conducted using Evaluation Lizard.  4. We will develop protocols to provide a method to import data collected by local evaluations conducted using other (not Evaluation Lizard) services.5. We will design a Synthetic Controls user interface that will allow clients to register, manage projects, complete analyses, and download reports.  6. We will conduct an alpha test to debug the system.  7. We will conduct a beta test to demonstrate thatthe system will work with a variety of potential clients.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Currently, local evaluations of drug prevention programs lack the ability to assess effectiveness because few, if any, include control or comparison groups against which to establish the degree to which they have reduced the rate of drug use onset. This project will provide an innovative strategy whereby local drug prevention evaluations can compare their findings with the findings of previous local evaluations. This will allow programs to assess their relative effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II application continues development of the Pain Assessment Interview Network - Clinical Advisory System (painCAS), a systematic and tested computer-administered assessment of chronic pain patients. Initial Assessment and Follow-up modules assess relevant health and functioning information of patients as they enter or continue treatment for chronic pain. Provider Initial and Follow-up Reports organize patient information in a convenient way that brings to theprovider&#039;s attention notable health and functioning issues. The assessment includes an evaluation of risk for misuse and abuse of prescription pain medication. painCAS also generates a report specifically intended for patients. Finally, painCAS includes provider-focused tools for uploading and analyzing aggregate data for patients who have taken the painCAS assessments, as well as a Decision Support resource that can help guide treatment. Such a pain management resource would allow a physician to maximize the available time in a clinic encounter while minimizing potential adverse impacts of treatment, such as abuse or misuse of analgesics. A convergence of factors suggests the time is right for a clinical tool like the painCAS: (1) increasing pressure from healthcare policy makers and payors to systematize care, documentation, risk assessment, and prescribing; (2) public demands for adequate pain treatments; (3) public, industry, and regulator concerns about prescription medication misuse and abuse; (4) increasing acceptance of computer assessment and tools (including EMRs) in clinical settings; (5) increasing interest in clinical pathways and disease management to improve the efficiency and quality of care, and (6) an increasing recognition of the importanceof understanding certain chronic conditions from a multidimensional perspective. Despite the need and several prior efforts to develop electronic pain assessments, the American Academy of Pain Medicine (AAPM) notes that no system has yet been widely adopted. Building on our prior work developing and disseminating electronic assessments as well as an innovative combination of features that add value to the system, a strong case can be made that the painCAS will be adopted. During Phase I, the groundwork waslaid for a system design that will fit into the flow of clinical activities, meet important assessment and reporting needs, and provide relevant information directly to patients. Phase II will see the completion of remaining components of the assessments and design and the building of the completed painCAS system to be tested in a field trial. In Phase II, a multilevel, controlled, randomized clinical trial of patients in pain specialty clinics will test the impact of painCAS on treatment process and outcome against a painCAS assessment only condition and a treatment-as-usual condition. The tested hypotheses are that the painCAS will: 1) standardize documentation of chronic pain assessments, 2) increase the likelihood of discussion of appropriate topics andissues during the medical visit, and 3) improve the patient&#039;s satisfaction with treatment. Secondary analyses will examine the extent to which painCAS use is associated with improvement in pain functioning, mood, and misuse/abuse of medications. The proposed painCAS potentially addresses limitations of existing efforts to enhance assessment and practice in the treatment of chronic pain.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As society increasingly demands that medical professionals address the complex clinicalpresentations of patients with chronic pain, it is increasingly important that providers have the benefit of standardized computer- administered assessments along with computerized treatment recommendations. Successful development and dissemination of a comprehensive, integrated Pain Assessment Interview Network - Clinical Advisory System (painCAS) will go some distance toward enhancing assessment and treatment of chronic pain and be perceived as highly valuable to stakeholders. We believe this product hasenormous commercial viability and public health importance and that its innovative combination of features will overcome obstacles to adoption that have plagued other electronic pain assessment systems.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The majority of adolescents struggling to avoid substance use during early recovery are also coping with many other issues (e.g., peer relationships) for which they require consistent support. We propose to develop an online relapse prevention program for adolescents called Staying Off Substances (SOS). Specific content in the program will be recommended to counselors based on their client&#039;s a) age, b) current motivation level, and, when available, c) reported needs andstrengths on the Comprehensive Health Assessment for Teens (CHAT(R)), a Web-enabled interactive adolescent self-report assessment for use in treatment settings. Whereas current online programs for adolescents are geared for primary prevention, CHAT(R): SOSwill be an intervention for use in clinical populations. Counselors will assign the client&#039;s user name to access privileges for that content and/or other content per their clinical judgment. We expect that CHAT(R): SOS will ultimately have six modules corresponding with the CHAT(R) subscales (i.e., Psychological Health, Family Relationships, Peer Relationships, Tobacco Use, Alcohol Use, Drug Use). CHAT(R): SOS will include opportunities to reinforce the skills and philosophies that adolescents learn in treatment through online interactive exercises, writing activities, and access to a supportive, online community. This resource will be available to them during treatment and post-treatment to help them navigate challenges in early recovery. Adolescents willreceive tailored recommendations and an individualized user experience because CHAT(R): SOS will utilize an innovative content management and logic solution called Ektron. CHAT(R): SOS will also provide counselors with guidelines on how to use this programwith their clients (e.g., in sessions, during aftercare) and custom user reports. To demonstrate the feasibility of the program concept, the Phase I study focused on the Peer Relationships domain. All feasibility criteria were met and findings indicated:(1) Proposed content was based on highly positive findings from concept mapping, as well as usability and acceptance testing with clients and experts. Ratings of potential effectiveness and appeal were high. (2) Usability testing indicated that the programwas usable by the target audience, the skills and outcomes were relevant to the target audience, and the program was regarded as potentially very helpful to the treatment process. We surpassed feasibility benchmarks for both clients and experts. (3) Our technical/design team a) produced a demonstration program that was perceived by key stakeholders as highly usable and engaging multimedia program and b) determined the necessary technologies to produce the complete program in Phase II. In Phase II we will develop the program then test its efficacy in a field trial. The field trial will examine the primary hypotheses that, relative to the control condition (CHAT(R) only), CHAT(R): SOS will be associated with significantly higher motivation, higher self-efficacy, more relapse coping, and lower substance use.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescent substance abuse is a significant public health issue. Unfortunately, the 2005 federal Treatment Episode Data Set indicated that less than 150,000 adolescents received treatment. Typically, 75% of those who receive treatment relapse within the following year. To address the need for cost-effective assessment, Inflexxion, Inc. developed the Comprehensive Health Assessment for Teens (CHAT(R)), a Web-enabled interactiveself report assessment for use in treatment settings. We propose developing a supplemental online relapse prevention program called CHAT(R): Staying Off Substances (SOS). CHAT: SOS will use an adolescent&#039;s 1) age, 2) motivational level, and, when available, 3) responses to the CHAT(R) assessment to recommend Web-based relapse prevention content to address the adolescent&#039;s individual needs. This resource will be available to adolescents during treatment and post-treatment to help them navigate challenges inearly recovery.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditionally, Mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonists have not been given as first line treatments for neuropathic pain due to their significant adverse side effects. Biousian Biosystems Inc, (BBI) is developing novel glycosylated peptide-based delta opioid receptor (DOR) targeted drugs for the treatment of chronic pain. Preclinical profiles for DOR agonists indicate broad-spectrum analgesic efficacy with greatly reduced side effects compared to the currently used MOR opioidanalgesics. The glycosylation of DOR selective peptides also represents a BBI platform technology that improves stability and enhances other PK characteristics of the parent peptide including oral and CNS bioavailability, issues that have impeded the development of peptide- based therapeutics. A successful glycopeptide drug would represent a novel, first in class therapeutic agent with significant advantages, thereby transforming the development of peptide, as well as pain therapeutics. BBI successfully completed its phase I SBIR grant, meeting or exceeding all milestones within the specific aims, and doing so on time and within budget. This included the synthesis of a library of glycosylated deltorphin-based peptides that possess predicted selectivity and efficacy for the delta opioid receptor (DOR). More specifically, a lead candidate emerged (BBI 11008) and backups were identified. These compounds have high affinity (low nM) and functional potency in vitro, and are at least 1000x functionally selective forDOR over MOR and kappa opioid receptors (KOR). Select compounds were advanced into in vivo antinociceptive studies, and demonstrated excellent efficacy in acute thermal nociceptive and sub-acute inflammatory pain models. Additional studies were performedin parallel with Phase I funded RandD efforts in order to begin assessment of safety/side-effect profiles and oral formulation/bioavailability. This phase II SBIR application is a logical extension of the RandD successfully completed in the company&#039;s PhaseI award. The proposed studies will further advance the pharmacology of a lead compound (BBI 11008) through a development tract that, if successful, will culminate in a successful IND filing. This will be achieved in Specific Aim 1a by determining and critically evaluating the DMPK properties of BBI 11008 and in Specific Aim 1b by identifying potential safety risks of the lead candidate BBI 11008. In Specific Aim 2, we will assess the potency and efficacy of BBI 11008 in the rat spinal nerve ligation (SNL)model of neuropathic pain. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, the relative side effect advantage of BBI 11008 will be determined compared to drugs used in neuropathic pain. BBI 11008 will be assessed in in-vivo models of respiration, abuse potential, tolerance/dependence and gastric motility and compared to side effects typically associated with traditional MOR agonists, e.g. morphine and/or gabapentin, a drug commonly prescribed for neuropathic pain. The research is complemented by a commercialization plan and the drug development expertise of BBI employees, advisors and collaborators as documented in the grant application, biosketches and support letters.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Traditionally, Mu opioid agonists have not been given as a first line treatment for neuropathic pain due to their significant adverse side effects. Biousian Biosystems, Inc (BBI) is developing novel glycosylated peptide-based, delta opioid receptor-targeted drugs to treat chronic pain with improved efficacy and without the significant side effects of currently used opioid analgesics. BBI plans to continue a successful Phase I program with studies that will further advance the pharmacology of a lead compound (BBI 11008) through a development tract that, if successful, will culminatein a successful IND filing.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The subject of this Phase II proposal is the completion of a GPCR screening panel for CNS- related receptors, enabling the discovery of therapeutic candidates acting at multiple GPCR targets. Most endogenous GPCR ligands activate multiple receptors. These ligands achieve biological efficacy through a  selective non-selectivity ; whereby a small subset of receptors is activated to varying degrees by a specific ligand. Similarly, many effective drugs for neurological andsubstance abuse disorders are effective only because they modulate multiple targets. Unfortunately, current drug discovery technologies only permit ligand discovery one receptor at a time, effectively leaving any beneficial  off-target  receptor interactions to chance. In order to purposefully identify compounds that modulate multiple receptors of interest, a system is needed that profiles these responses simultaneously. In Phase I studies, Primity developed a novel GPCR assay and cellular barcoding systemthat enabled the simultaneous screening of eight GPCR targets in a single well of a microtiter plate. This Phase II proposal further expands the Neurological Disease Panel to 54 targets providing a global view of compound action across dozens of validatedCNS drug targets. The techniques used for detecting GPCR activation will be optimized for high-throughput screening, and the data analysis automated, to enable screening of 4,000 wells (gt100,000 data points) per screening day. The system will be benchmarked with a pilot screen of 1500 compounds to establish feasibility of massively parallel GPCR screening. The extension of targets to 54, coupled with the demonstration of the appropriate screening metrics outlined in this proposal, will provide the foundation for commercializing this technology as a novel screening platform for the purposeful discovery of pleiotropic ligands for neurological GPCR targets.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Neurological diseases involve a complex web of receptors with highly redundant functions making it difficult to achieve therapeutic efficacy using a traditional &#039;one drug, one receptor&#039; model. The system described here facilitates highly efficient compound screening across a broad range of CNS- related targets to identify unexpected activities of known drugs and enable the discovery of drugs that simultaneously target multiple receptors.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the current economic climate, community colleges are playing a more vital role than ever in educating the workforce. Enrollment at community colleges has grown by 17 percent since fall 2007 to a total enrollment of 8million (AACC, 2010a). Moreover, President Obama has called on community colleges to produce five million more graduates by 2020 (Gonzalez, 2010). However, community college students have a number of psychosocial and health behavior risk factors for failing to meet their academic goals. Among first-time students who start at a four-year college, approximately three-quarters persist to the second year, compared to roughly half of first-time students who start at a two-year college (McIntosh and Rouse, 2009). The objectives of the proposed research are to create the first comprehensive wellness and alcohol and other drug (AOD) intervention prevention program specifically for community college students. The following Phase I specific aims were successfully completed: (1-3) Interview students, health staff, and institutional decision makers; (4) Produce Content, Design, and Development Plans; (5) Create a demonstration; (6) Conduct usability and acceptance testing with students; (7) Conduct acceptance testing with institutional decision makers and health staff, and (8) Complete the Phase II research design. Results indicate that the MSB-Community College program has feasibility as an intervention and as a technical project. The specific aims of the Phase II are to: (1) Convene an advisory board of community college presidents and health professionals to inform implementation strategy; (2) Produce the online program, and (3) Conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the online program. We hypothesize that, compared to students in the control group, students exposed to MSB-Community College will demonstrate: (1) decreased stress; (2) increased use of protective behavioral strategies; (3) decreased substance use negative consequences; (4) decreasedsubstance use, and (5) increased college adjustment. Secondary hypotheses are that students will report: (1) increased likelihood of reaching a personal academic goal and (2) increased likelihood of attainment of a degree/certificate, or persistence witha program of study. The innovation of the current Phase II application is in adapting to a new population theoretical approaches that have been successful in research with four year students. This will be achieved by creating a program that is informed byadvances in four-year college health programs while incorporating findings from research with community college students to create appropriate content, features, and a delivery method. Successful completion of the aims of this Phase II application will expand the field of college health by acknowledging and addressing the needs of a large and diverse, yet underserved, population. If the program is successful, it will have a significant public health impact in terms of improving the health of almost half ofall undergraduates (AACC, 2010a), with the secondary goal of also increasing retention.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the SBIR Fast-track application, we propose to create and evaluate an online skills training experience for medical students to properly assess patients in pain, minimize potential opioid misuse, and maximize pain treatment. Our curriculum will provide an awareness of the risks of the addictive substances, as well as the benefits of utilizing opioids to treat pain. A lack of clinical skill when assessing pain and addiction potential can lead to under-treatment of pain, overuse of opioids in at-risk patients, diversion, exposure to addictive substances without proper monitoring, and worsening of prior addictive disease. The project will create a novel, interactive, Web-based curriculum that incorporates a remote Standardized Patient (SP) interview into the learning experience. SPs are now a common part of medical education and success with SPs (via face-to-face interactions and a telephone interview) is now a required part of the Step 2 (CS) US Medical Licensure Exam (USMLE). The examination uses Standardized Patients in multiple case situations to train the medical students in areas of medicine which they might encounter in their practices. Our project is unique in that we will utilize remote SPs for the actual trainingof medical students; thus ensuring learning, practice, and rehearsal of the skills medical students will need later in their professional life. The product builds on standard tools of the Internet including chat-based communication, web collaboration, andremote interactions. The final product has the potential to deliver a cost-effective training experience to students throughout years 1 to 4 of any medical school. It will also provide a stable framework upon which course directors and clerkship directorscan further build and refine patient assessment and care skills. Phase I will 1) develop a complete curriculum plan for 5-7 modules on the topic of pain and addiction, 2) complete a needs analysis to define how best to use an SP interview within a learningmodule, 3) finalize a prototype module including a standardized patient learning experience, case scenarios, interactive questions, didactic information, and links to additional resources, 4) create the standardized patient case for the prototype module,and 5) conduct qualitative and quantitative usability testing on the learning experience with the standardized patient as a teaching component. An expert panel incorporating medical school, standardized patient, and topic expertise will assist throughout development and evaluation and rate the success of the Phase I project. Phase II will: 1) complete the content including additional SP experiences, 2) outline a plan to create a  train the course/clerkship director  module to guide implementation, 3) evaluate the program with medical students, 4) evaluate the program and prototype with consultants and course/clerkship directors, and 5) complete and publish the completed curriculum, resources and supplementary materials on a website. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:The ravages of chronic pain are easily understandable; pain is a universal phenomenon that is essential to survival if we are to avoid or attend to unpleasant stimulation. Addiction is less well understood since not all of us are equally liable to suffer from the diseases of addiction. Nonetheless the destructiveness of addiction is apparent to all. Misuse of controlled substances is also poorly understood and often unanticipated. We chose the intersection of pain and addiction/misuse as the focus of this product because it of the tremendous education potential of this topic. The topic can not only effect knowledge, attitude, confidence and understanding of each issue, but can also break stereotypes and teach a full range of doctoring from compassion to strict rule-following. It introduces the legal challenges of medicine as they relate to federal and state oversight and the need for an integrated long term approach to fully address a patient&#039;s medical issue",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to reduce risks for alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse in workers, work groups, and work settings. Annual national surveys continue to show problems with employee AOD abuse andits impact on health and productivity. To address this challenge, the proposed project will develop an electronic prevention program that has the capacity for sustained diffusion into the work environment. It will be based on an evidence-based program (Team Awareness) designed for classroom use, and incorporate recent technological innovations in Internet- based education and social interaction. An electronic program of this sort can reach more workers than classroom training, and provide materials they can come back to for reference and retraining. This Fast Track application has four specific aims: (1) develop a prototype electronic program (called TeamUpnow) that is attractive, dynamic, and supports social interaction with both Internet and cell-phone technology; (2) build the program, using feedback from an expert review and pilot-test of the prototype; (3) test the effectiveness of TeamUpnow in a six-month randomized trial with 48 work departments, drawn from three distinct organizations; this controlled study will assess changes in AOD use, workplace drinking climate, help-seeking attitudes, and utilization of employee assistance services; and (4) evaluate use of the program among workers who receive it. To appeal to workers, the program will couch health messages in a series of highly interactive simulations in five different areas: tolerance, coping skills, relationships, wellness, and giving and getting help. Information in this learning center is reinforced through quizzes and a learning game that can be played in three modes (solo play, with a team, and in team competition). Quizzes and game play also allow users to earn incentives. Phase I will develop a program prototype and pilot test it to ensure usability and functionality are as expected (Aim 1). Three key milestones to be met are (1) prototype development for evaluation of proof of concept, (2) pilot testing, and (3) identifying prototype revisions for Phase II production. Phase II evaluation involves a cluster randomized trial wherein groups will be randomly assigned to receive (k=24) or not receive (k=24) TeamUpnow. Phase II evaluation involves an estimate of 384 workers completing pre-post surveys. The project involves strategic partners in the field of employee assistance (EAP) services andsoftware design for online marketing. The online, social, and game play aspects of TeamUpnow (including a cell-phone interface) give the program especially strong potential to reach young working adults who are at greatest risk for AOD abuse.        PUBLICHEALTH RELEVANCE: Adult employee alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse have continued to be a problem for employers and society despite recent developments in workplace prevention programming and policies. The proposed project is relevant to public health inaiming to reduce worker AOD abuse and encourage help-seeking. It will take an existing and effective classroom AOD prevention program and re-develop it as an Internet- and cell-phone based learning tool and team-oriented game to appeal to a wide group ofworkers. The program will also link directly to employee assistance resources (e.g., counselors) so users will be able to both receive and suggest help to peers, as in the original classroom design.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Longitudinal trials are trials in which researchers track outcomes over a period of time. These trials play a prominent role in many fields including drug abuse, aging, medicine, social science, and education. Longitudinal studies, by their nature, often address issues that have important implications for long-term health and development. Also, because these studies are often seen as definitive, their results may have a substantial impact on policy. There have been morethan 50,000 of these studies published, and the use of this design has been increasing in recent years. The statistical procedures required to plan and to analyze a longitudinal trial are substantially more complex than those used for simple randomized trials. Popular software packages such as SPSS, SAS, and Stata include modules for the analysis of longitudinal trials, and the vast majority of these trials are analyzed using these kinds of modules. By contrast, there is no commercial software to compute power for these trials, and the use of proper techniques to compute power when these studies are being planned is extremely rare. In most cases researchers compute power by ignoring the longitudinal aspect of the study and using techniques intended for simple randomized trials. This is a serious problem because this approach can yield estimates of power that are substantially in error. The goal of this project is to develop software to compute power for longitudinal studies. The program will work with an array of study designs, and it will incorporate a sophisticated user interface to address the kinds of real-world issues that must be addressed in a power analysis. On the input side, it will allow users to enter the kinds of data that they are likely to have,and to do so using a clear and intuitive interface. On the output side the program will create tables and graphs that allow the user to quickly assess the impact of all assumptions, and to determine how changes in the design would affect power and costs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Meta-analysis is the statistical procedure employed to synthesize data from a series of studies. As such, it falls at the core of evidence-based policy in such fields as alcohol and substance abuse, medicine, social science, ecology, education, gerontology, among many others. The current generation of meta-analysis software is designed for the situation where each study contributes one (and only one) effect size to the analysis. However, many meta-analyses do incorporatestudies that report more than one effect size. In particular, studies sometimes report effects for more than one outcome, for more than one time-point, and/or for more than one intervention. In these cases the standard formulas and software cannot be used, and there are no good options for performing the analysis. The only software that can be used in these cases requires a high level of statistical expertise, and additionally requires the user to provide information, such as the correlation matrix among outcomes, that the user is not likely to have. Therefore, as a practical matter, there are no good options for performing a meta-analysis involving more than one effect size. Under a series of earlier grants we developed a program for meta-analysis that iscurrently in use at some 10,000 institutions around the world, including thousands of hospitals, universities, and agencies such as the FDA, CDC, NIH, WHO, among many others. Our plan is to expand this to work with studies that report more than one effectsize, and that will not require the user to supply a correlation matrix.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The current generation of software for meta-analysis can only be used when each study provides a single effect size. The goal of this project is to develop software for meta-analysis that can be used when some (or all) studies report an effect for multiple outcomes, time-points, or treatments. This software will not require the user to provide a correlation matrix among effects.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): According to the MarkeTrak VII survey (Kochkin 2008), there are roughly 35 million individuals in the US with some degree of hearing loss. Of these, almost 10 million have hearing aids and 67,000 have cochlear implants.The goal of auditory (re)habilitation (AR) programs is to build the listening skills of individuals with hearing loss, so that they can comprehend the language in their environment. With appropriate hearing devices and AR, individuals with hearing loss can begin to discriminate and identify the speech sounds in the spoken language around them.  In Phase I of this project we developed an adaptive computer-guided AR software program called the Sound Identification Tutor (SIT) that focused on sound identification and discrimination. For a video demonstration showcasing the SIT please visit http://www.biospeech.com/research/ar.html. The SIT provides an automated sequence of sound targets to be trained and it chooses the type of target depending on the performance of the user. It also chooses whether to present the target in auditory or audiovisual mode. The SIT uses natural human audiovisual recordings of all the word targets. It also uses child-friendly images of simple words to make this software suitable andfun for children. The results of an evaluation of the software with 24 children and adults showed that over a course of 10 sessions subjects significantly improved their sound identification skills. Children benefitted more from the automated lesson sequence than adults. Adults tended to prefer to choose their own sound targets to train on. In addition, we showed that subjects improved on specific sound targets they trained on, but problematic targets from the pre-test that were not trained on did not improve in the post-test. This showcases the fact that improvements were not caused by increased exposure to speech but by training specific sound targets.  In this Phase II proposal, we will extend the SIT and develop it into a marketable product. The proposalconsists of the following aims: (i) To Build a Spanish Version of the SIT; (ii) To Extend the SIT with Words Embedded in Sentences with Optional Background Noise and Multiple Speakers; (iii) To Extend the Open- Ended Training Module of the SIT; (iv) To Expand the SIT to Create a DVD installer, Interface with the Web, and Develop an In-home Login UI; (v) To Evaluate the Program Specifically for In-home Use; (vi) To Create a Built-in Assessment Protocol to Produce User-specific Listening Intervention PlansPUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the United States, there are roughly 35 million individuals with some degree of hearing loss and of these, almost 10 million have hearing aids and 67,000 have cochlear implants who need intensive auditory (re)habilitation(AR) training to fully realize the potential benefit of their prostheses and attain intelligible speech. Face-to-face AR training with a specialist is expensive, not always covered by insurance and not always feasible because clients may not have access toa specialist, esp. if they speak a different language. The proposed project will expand upon an adaptive computer-guided software program (the Speech Identification Tutor, SIT) that focuses on learning phoneme discrimination and identification and will provide a Spanish version of the software, provide additional synthetic voices for open-ended training, provide an additional adaptive sentence task where individuals are exposed to words embedded in sentences, with background noise, and multiple speakers and will be evaluated for in-home use by a larger group of users.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 110 children in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that there are currently 730,000 children in the U.S. between 0 and 21 with ASD. Language impairment is a common characteristic of ASD, commonly affecting the acquisition of more abstract language components (i.e. prepositions, adjectives) and concepts. Fifty percent of ASD individuals are unable to interpret or use spoken language in other thanrudimentary ways, greatly inhibiting learning at all grade levels and settings. The value of language skills and comprehension to classroom learning is well established. Research shows that visual supports (images and videos) are an effective language support tool for children with ASD. However, existing visual instruction methods use isolated language elements and do not teach critical contextual relationships (such as generalization) between the real world and language representations. Based on prior research it is logical, but untested, that a structured application of video-like scenes and corresponding discrete images could accelerate acquisition of language skills and, by extension, learning by ASD children. The proposed project, Digital Interactive Scene Program for Language in Autism (DISPL- A) Phase II will give teachers the ability, via a web-based authoring environment, to create highly interactive lessons incorporating custom-animated scenes which will help ASD students improve, in progressive fashion, generalization and language skills. The DISPL-A Phase II innovation lies in the combination of six effective strategies for teaching language coupled with a sophisticated animation engine that generates custom animated scenes  on demand . Proven, effective instructional approaches are needed as the ASD population continues to grow. Researchers will evaluate the hypothesis: DISPL-A Phase II can (a) improve the ability to generalize, leading to (b) greater language ability, including complex sentence structure comprehension and use in children with autism. Research will be conducted as a single subject experimental design (Barlow, Nock and Herson, 2009; Kearns, 2005). A multiple baseline across behaviors design with a multiple probe component will be employed. DISPL-A Phase II extends the work begun in the successful DISPL-A Phase I effort and will be integrated into MTT&#039;s commercially successful product  VizZle(R) . Based on current sales and user growth rates of VizZle(R), DISPL-A Phase II may, in the next five years, be able to help 15%-30% of the estimated 730,000 children with ASD  learn how to learn  by improving language skills and generalization abilities.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With an estimated 730,000 U.S. school-age children currentlywith autism, and a high growth rate over the last 20 years, effective and practical autism treatments are needed. There is currently no treatment except educational development of communication capabilities. Visually-based language tools are considered oneof the most effective means of developing language skills. A web-based system easily accessible by all caregivers could provide a valuable and inexpensive means of assisting individuals with ASD.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Hearing loss is the number one disability in the world. There are currently over eight million Americans that wear hearing aids and approximately 200,000 cochlear implants in use worldwide. For many years, hearing aids and cochlear devices were primarily powered by disposable zinc-air batteries. However, given the inconvenience, cost and environmental impact due to the replacement and disposal of non-rechargeable zinc-air batteries, the cochlear industry and hearingaid industry are actively developing rechargeable battery powered devices. Front Edge Technology is proposing to develop a new type of rechargeable battery for Behind-the-Ear (BTE) cochlear implants and for BTE hearing aids. Compared to the existing state-of-the-art products, the proposed battery has twice the energy density, three times the battery life, and one quarter of the recharge time. More importantly, the proposed battery will have the highest safety standard, which is crucial to a head-worn hearing device. In the Phase I work, FET has demonstrated a 12-mAh battery with a footprint suitable for BTE devices. Phase I results also demonstrated greater than 500 Wh/L in energy density, recharge in one hour, and good capacity retention after cycling. In Phase II, we will further develop a 110-mAh battery in the same footprint. This battery will have innovative safety structures integrated at the cell level so that in any abusive conditions, the battery surface temperature will not exceed 50oC. Phase II work will also demonstrate a 12.5-mAh hearing aid battery with the same dimensions as a size-13 Zn-air battery. Successful development of the proposed batteries will have major contributions in the development of smaller and better next generation cochlear implant BTE devices and hearing aids. The high expected maturity of the battery at the end of the Phase II program will facilitate a quick commercialization of the new batteries.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The energy-density, service life, and safety of currently available rechargeable batteries are inadequate in meeting the challenging power requirements of next generation cochlear implants and hearing aids. Front Edge Technology&#039;s proposed high-energy thin-film battery will enable the development of smaller and better hearing devices.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this program is to develop the tools, protocols and facilities needed to produce multielectrode arrays (MEAs) out of known biocompatible materials for eventual use in humans. This willrequire construction and commissioning of a computer-aided design (CAD), good manufacturing practice (GMP) facility and framework capable of fabricating a 2-dimensional MEA using an ultrashort (sometimes referred to as ultrafast) laser-based micromachiningprocess. The direct-write technology developed herein will enable fabrication of an MEA out of flat platinum sheet material without the handling steps that compromise material plasticity in current designs. This array will then be laminated between two encapsulating layers of biocompatible polymer that serve to electrically isolate each electrode while providing flexible, mechanical support. We will use this technology to fabricate a robust, high quality, reliable cochlear implant (CI) electrode array functionally similar to those in clinical use today. We anticipate this new process technology will eliminate defects introduced during the current, hand-assembly process that results in failure and subsequent loss of residual hearing, compromised functionality, and higher cost. This effort will be performed in collaboration with a third party who wishes to evaluate this new technology as a possible replacement for their current method of manufacture. We anticipate that this program will improve health and functionality for the deaf community, especially for children during their formative years, in support of NIH&#039;s mission to improve health by mitigating disability.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this program is to develop the flexible, computer-assisted, integrated manufacturing cell required to fabricate neural prostheses of arbitrary shape and structure using ultrashort pulses of light. Commercial utility will be demonstrated by producing a novel, robust cochlear implant electrode array in collaboration with a well-known commercial manufacturer of cochlear implants. In furtherance of NIH&#039;s mission to reduce the burdens of illness and disability, we anticipate this program will result in a substantial improvement in quality, performance and size ofthis particular device and lay the foundation for production of a broad spectrum of medical device components serving other medical needs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Approximately 10 percent of hearing aid wearers have 10 dB loss of ability to understand speech in noise, in the sense that they require a signal-to-noise ratio 10 dB better than normal-hearing listeners. Since at many restaurants and social gatherings the normal- hearing listeners themselves are forced to carry on conversations near the limit of their ability, those with a 10 dB or greater  SNR loss  are left out of the conversation. Being left out of normal socialinteraction often leads to depression and physical problems.  The aim of this project is to develop a second-generation multi-talker, multi-listener  (R) version of the original Companion Mics system. The original system allows one listener to hear three talkers with a 15-20 dB improvement in signal-to-noise ratio, which allows someone with a 10-20 dB  SNR loss  to carry on a conversation easily in a noisy situation.  The goal of the second-generation design is to a) improve user acceptance by dramaticallyreducing the size and weight compared to the existing device, c) add the capability to allow two or more listeners to listen, c) increase ease of use by eliminating the need for the users to remember to turn the Listener Units on before the Talker Unit, d)reduce the latency below 32 mS. This will be pursued following the method of the first generation, which is extensive reprogramming of a Bluetooth chip set to allow more listeners and talkers and increase the bandwidth to 7.8 kHz and reduce the distortionof typical Bluetooth- programmed circuits to essentially zero.  In order to obtain information that may help determine that a smaller device will be more acceptable, two university clinics, Pittsburgh University and the University of Iowa and one privateclinic (Northwest Speech and Hearing in Illinois) have agreed to perform a series of experiments to:  a) compare the impression of individuals from the public at large on several 7-point scales ( appears old  to  appears young,  for example) to see if thesmaller size is accompanied by a significantly better reaction to the devices as worn,  b) investigate the degree of increased acceptance (if any) to physical models of the old and newer devices reduce the stigma of using the device  c) obtain before and after measurements of benefit and satisfaction using several known scales including APHAB, SADL, COSI, GLASCO, PIADS, and DOSO.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Being left out of normal social interaction often leads to depression and physical problems.Approximately 10 percent of hearing aid wearers have a sufficient loss of ability to hear in noise that they are excluded from conversations at many restaurants and social gatherings where normal-hearing listeners themselves are forced to carry on conversations near the limit of their ability. The planned device will allow several talkers to be heard clearly by two listeners with severe hearing loss, listeners who would otherwise not be able to participate.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Loss of hearing affects the quality of life for individuals. The number of Americans with hearing loss is increasing as baby boomers age and younger citizens damage their hearing with personal audio devices. By 2025, approximately 40 million Americans are projected to be hearing impaired, an increase of 23% from current numbers. Hearing loss may be treated, but at a cost. Only 25% of the hearing impaired in the United States use electronic devices to improve their hearing, with quality hearing aids retailing from  2000 to  3000. Customer satisfaction reports show that ongoing expenses and battery life are two of the biggest concerns. This SBIR project by Packet Digital will advance the commercialization of a revolutionaryjust-enough/just-in- time  power management solution that will extend battery life in hearing aid products. Packet Digital&#039;s patented On-Demand Power(R) technology monitors entire systems to determine power needs and adjusts energy delivery accordingly.We have proven this method to provide the greatest efficiency in power consumption and battery life. By applying our technology to hearing aid products, we believe we can deliver a 20% to 40% battery life extension for hearing aid users. Current power management solutions for hearing aids implement software-commanded power management methodologies, with dedicated code written to conserve energy. Packet Digital&#039;s revolutionary hardware-based approach produces less latency and drives system-wide energy savings through a real-time approach that is independent of usage models. Our autonomous, hardware-based approach is also easier to implement because it&#039;s less complex and requires less integration than traditional power management methods. In Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of our power management solution for hearing aid products. Objectives of our Phase I research include:  7 Documenting the architecture, power demand, and operation of hearing aids and hearing products  7 Developing algorithms that automatically determine the energy demand of hearing product circuitry  7 Demonstrate results of autonomous power management on a hearing product prototype In the Phase II effort, we will iteratively refine the advancements made during Phase I to deliverand prove a 20% to 40% battery life extension in a hearing product prototype. To accomplish this, we will develop a silicon prototype of an autonomous power management circuit that will be integrated into a hearing aid demonstrator.         PUBLIC HEALTHRELEVANCE: Packet Digital proposes to drive commercialization of an advanced power management solution that will extend battery life in hearing aids and hearing products by 20% to 40%. We will research the feasibility of and design a prototype for integrating our revolutionary On-Demand Power technology into a hearing aid device. By doing so, we hope to reduce two of the biggest sources of dissatisfaction amongst hearing aid wearers - ongoing costs and battery life.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hospitalized patients faced with sudden inability to speak (e.g., patients with tracheal intubation) are unable to verbalize even the most basic comfort and care needs, or their urgent safety needs. These patients and nursing staff must consequently resort to alternative nonverbal communication strategies such as gestures, mouthing words, or the use of alphabet boards, which are slow, energy-draining, and ineffective. These strategies are also inadequate for expressing emergent, life-threatening needs such as inadvertent disconnection of ventilators/oxygen or a blocked airway. Currently, no standards of practice, commonly used best practices, or software/devices exist to facilitate the care of suddenly speechless (SS) patients. Clearly, current practice lacks effective approaches to prevent and rapidly treat dangerous situations in this highly vulnerable population and to lessen patients&#039; frustration, anxiety, fatigue, and dissatisfaction with provided care. The purpose ofthis innovative project is to (1) advance development initiated during our Phase1 SBIR grant # 1R42NR010842-01 of communication software uniquely designed for this population, conduct a research study to determine whether GatorVoice improves SS patients ability to communicate with nursing staff, and produce a commercially viable communication device. Based on our Phase I project, GatorVoice is the first solution of its kind tailored specifically to communicate the needs of SS patients. Our pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of GatorVoice in the hospital setting. In addition, it will be the first system to provide data capturing from patient-staff interactions that can be organized as summary reports and printed out by nurses for use during shift reports. The project&#039;s emphasis is consistent with NINR&#039;s research focus including: 1)  seeking ways to reduce the burden of illness and disability by understanding and easing the effects of acute and chronic illness  and 2)  technologies to be used in the hospital... that improve symptom evaluation in persons with chronic conditions  (Omnibus Solicitation for SBIR/STTR Grant Applications, 2010). A study is proposed to examine the effectiveness of GatorVoice in facilitating the communication process for SS patients. A quasi-experimental study will be conducted with SS participants using GatorVoice and a control group of SS participants using current communication methods, e.g., paper/pen, gestures (and an Urgent Button developed for this study) to communicate. Outcome measures will be ease of communication, frustration with communication, and satisfaction with communication method. In a qualitative study, we will examine nurses&#039; experiences with communicating with SS patients, and the impact that communication methods have on that process. An iterative process of product development and clinical testing will be used throughout Phase to advance maturation of GatorVoice software and integration into one or more hardware platforms, thereby bringing the system to the commercial stage.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Currently, hospitals do not have effective or reliable methods to assist patients faced with sudden inability to verbalize their needs. The purpose of this project is to continue development of a communication product that will assist suddenly speechless hospitalized patients to effectively communicate their needs, test the device with patients in the hospital, and produce a viable product for commercialization. Availability of a reliable communication method at a time when critical needs surface (e.g. breathing difficulty) has significant potential to improve patient safety and other essential communication between patients and nursing staff.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publicized findings from the largest US study performed on dental health in 25 years indicating that while oral health is improving for most Americans, tooth decay among preschool children (between the ages of 2 and 5 years old) increased from 24% (between 1988-1994) to 28% (between 1999-2004). Of the types of oral formulations, mouthrinses are especially appealin     not only because of simplicity and conveniencebut also for high-risk caries groups including those with orthodontic brackets and retainers, prostheses and restorations, dental erosion, children with developing permanent dentition, and those experiencing hyposalivation caused by medications and/or cancer treatments. Published studies reveal that multi-mineral treatments, including fluoride, calcium, and phosphorous can act synergistically to provide enhanced levels for protection compared to single mineral treatments. However, a major problem facing multi-mineral formulations, however, is that bioavailable fluoride and calcium cannot coexist in a single stable formulation for long periods of time, which ultimately reduces the shelf-life and therapeutic performance of the multi-mineral formulation. Because of the sensitivity of fluoride, currently there is no single-compartment multi-mineral mouthrinse available commercially in the US. Indiana Nanotech has patent- pending technology that functionalizes 2-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) with sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) to create TCP-SLS hybrid materials that are compatible with fluoride. Importantly, when combined in an established and commercially available OTC fluoride mouthrinse formulation, TCP-SLS boosted enamel fluoride uptake (~ 25%) and strengthened enamel &#039;white-spots&#039; (~ 50%) relative to the commercial OTC fluoride mouthrinse. The long-term goal of this research is to commercialize an economical OTC multi-mineral mouthrinse formulation that provides increased dental health benefits than would otherwisebe observed with fluoride alone. As part of our development and commercialization activities, we have developed this Phase II research proposal to the NIDCR that addresses the following Specific Aims: 1) Evaluation of stability and in vitro efficacy of NaFmouthrinse formulations containing TCP-SLS. These activities include FDA- recommended laboratory studies, including fluoride bioavailability, enamel fluoride uptake, and white-spot lesion reversal via remin/demin cycling; 2) understand the remineralization effect of TCP-SLS. This will include extending our current understanding of TCP-SLS by probing the bonding and interface characteristics of TCP-SLS, as well the enamel tissue that is treated with TCP-SLS and fluoride; and 3) Evaluation of the most promising prototype mouthrinse formulation against a commercially available fluoride mouthrinse rinse in a placebo-controlled double-blind cross-over in situ clinical study.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionpublicized findings from the largest US study performed on dental health in 25 years indicating that while oral health is improving for most Americans, tooth decay among preschool children (between the ages of 2 and 5 years old) increased from 24% (between 1988-1994) to 28% (between 1999-2004).

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Oral mucositis is a frequent and painful complication of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immune compromise. Mucositis is associated with significant morbidity including pain, oral lesions, dehydration and nutritional compromise including limiting calorie intake and malnutrition as well as the high risk for systemic infection. In addition, mucositis can lead to systemic toxicities and is associated with symptom complexes that include fatigue, and mood change. The complexity of mucositis pathology is compounded, particularly in the case of myelosuppressed and immunocompromised individuals, by opportunistic pathogens. Current management does not prevent mucosal except in limited indications and do not provide reliable resolution of mucosal lesions. Because of the multi-faceted components contributing to the severity of mucositis, a wide variety of treatment options have been tested including simple oral hygiene, infection prevention, anti- inflammatory agents, reactive oxygenspecies, salivary function modifiers, coating agents and growth factors. Although these therapies may have efficacy in some cases, a more comprehensive treatment approach is urgently needed. Synedgen is developing an antimicrobial platform based on soluble chitosan derivatives that rapidly clump bacteria, disrupt their biofilms and ultimately kill a wide variety of resistant and non-resistant strains. In addition, the soluble chitosan derivative has demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties and the abilityto stimulate wound regeneration. This research aims to provide in vitro data to assess the doses, treatment regimes and formulations that will be effective in prophylaxis and in enhancing resolution of oral mucositis induced by radiation in pre-clinical animal studies. In vitro studies will assess the chitosan derivative&#039;s effect on the ability of bacteria to form biofilms and effect on wound healing. Testing in animal models will demonstrate the appropriate dosing and formulation for efficacy in preventing bacterial colonization as well as provide clear evidence of the products ability enhance the natural history of onset to healing in an animal model. Toxicology studies required by the FDA will be contracted to assure compliance with regulatory guidelines. With successful demonstration of efficacy and safety of this oral care product, Phase 2 testing in human trials can be initiated with a goal of rapid commercialization. The successful result of this work will be the optimization of safe and effective formulation, administration protocol and completion of pre-clinical testing required for a highly effective oral therapy that clinical prevents opportunistic infection, and enhances the healing process of oral lesions.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Oral mucositis is a painful, debilitating complication that occurs regularly with chemotherapy, radiation treatment or immuno-suppressants. While many treatments exist to manage the pain and begin to control the outcomes of the lesion development, few treatmentsare effective. This funding supports an effort to develop an FDA approved daily oral treatment that prevents bacterial infection and complications in mucositis while actively promoting healing and resolution of the oral lesions.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large mandibular segmental defects resulting from tumor resection, trauma, and congenital anomalies remain one of the most difficult clinical challenges in CMF reconstruction. Autologous tissue grafts and synthetic materials are the current clinical gold standard but suffer from significant drawbacks that make these solutions far from ideal. In particular, prosthetic devices implanted to fill mandibular bone defects and attached to the adjacent host tissues with titaniumplates or screws are prone to failure due to metal fatigue and fracture or bone resorption at the host tissue-metal interface. To compete in the CMF reconstruction market, a degradable biomaterial platform able to act as a carrier for osteobiologics mustbe established. Tissue Regeneration Systems, Inc (TRS) has developed a platform technology to design and fabricate bioactive resorbable coated devices for CMF reconstruction. TRS also completed a SBIR phase I to demonstate the fidelity and reproducibilityof its platform. With this proposal, we will move modular osteoconductive scaffold platforms in two aims: 1) determine the best osteoconductive coating conditions in vitro for cell and protein attachment, and 2) test our CMF scaffolds in a clinical settingto reconstruct large mandibular defects in a large animal model, the Yorkshire pig.  Successful completion of this proposal will represent a significant advance in TE reconstruction of mandibular defects, using an innovative modular osteoconductive scaffold. Furthermore, testing in a large pre-clinical animal model will give TRS the data necessary to support a 510K submission for FDA device approval.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mandibular reconstruction following tumor resection, trauma, and congenitaldefects remains one of the most difficult challenges in craniomaxillofacial (CMF) surgery. Successful reconstruction must simultaneously fill complex defects, sustain chewing forces, and achieve a complete repair of compromised bone tissue. To address these issues, we propose to engineer modular osteoconductive scaffolds for use with intra Operating Room (intraOR) biologics to reconstruct large segmental mandibular defects in a pre-clinical porcine animal model. These bioresorbable scaffolds will address current limitations in mandibular reconstruction associated with the use of metal plates including dehiscence, fatigue fracture, hardware loosening and difficulties in achieving complete aesthetic and functional reconstruction.",

If successful, such compounds may also be useful for the treatment of a subset of patients with Type I diabetes as well.  The overall goal of this proposal is to engage in lead optimization studies of new molecular entities already identified by HPRL scientists that activate the IRS2-branch of the insulin signal transduction cascade in mammalian cells. The NIH SBIR funding support will be used to focus research at Housey Pharmaceutical Research Laboratories (hereinafter  HPRL ) to further develop for future commercialization initial discoveries made in the laboratory of Dr. Morris White at the Children&#039;s Hospital of Boston, Harvard Medical School, and investigators at the Joslin Diabetes Center. These discoveries have been licensed to HPRL for therapeutic applications.Compounds that activate the IRS2-branch of the insulin-mediated signal transduction cascade have been identified by HPRL as a result of a high throughput screen (HTS) using a target-protein specific cell-based assay system. A subset of these compounds exhibit substantial ability to stimulate cell growth in an IRS2- specific manner. A selected group of such compounds will undergo testing in rodent and human 2-cells together with both in-vitro and in-vivo lead optimization studies in mice. Following successful completion of these studies, a small number of novel, lead-optimized new molecular entities should emerge which may be suitable for advancement into formal preclinical investigational new drug (IND) studies for the treatment of patients with Type II diabetes.  HPRL is a fully functional chemical and biological research laboratory that is equipped for modern molecular and cell biological studies, including high throughput screening. Support through the SBIR Phase II Renewal Grant mechanism provides the opportunity to utilize the infrastructure at HPRL for novel and creative projects at the cutting edge of drug discovery and design. Since diabetes is a major disease of substantial proportions world-wide, pharmaceutical products and licensable technologies developed by HPRL will have substantial market opportunities.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colonoscopy is the preferred method to screen for colorectal cancer, a disease that afflicts 115,000 new patients a year. Several million screening, diagnostic and therapeutic colonoscopies are performed each year in U.S. hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers. However, colonoscopy remains a highly operator dependent activity and no clear definition of skill exists. There is very limited understanding of the methods used by endoscopist to execute a safe and effective colonoscopy and there is a significant need for technology to improve training and to provide a means of assuring that examinations are performed in a safe and effective manner. The Colonoscopy Force Monitor (CFM), which is being developed under this grant,appears to fill the clinical void. CFM is a wireless force-measuring handle attached to the colonoscope shaft to provide a physician with a real-time feedback on the force and torque applied during colonoscopy. The CFM is designed to improve training of endoscopists and establish best practices for performing colonoscopy by quantitative characterization of examiner performance. In addition, the use of CFM could reduce or, under some circumstances, eliminate the use of deep sedation for colonoscopy, and lessen the overall cost of the exam. The main objective of this Phase II Competing Renewal grant is to advance the CFM to the pre-manufacturing level; to complete clinical studies required for the PMA application processes; and to prepare regulatory submission for the market clearance of the CFM technology. In Phase II of this project we developed the 2-prototype CFM hardware and software as a basis for a pre- - production prototype, built a preproduction prototype and obtained clinical feedback on its functionality; characterized CFM use by experienced endoscopists and defined CFM capability for colonoscopy training. Most of the technical requirements to the CFM technology including adequate range and accuracy of force measurement, convenient grip, disinfection and automated engage/disengage mechanism were implemented and tested in the CFM prototype. Laboratory validation tests and endoscopists&#039; feedback confirmed the functionality of the CFM. Clinical studies performed by experienced endoscopists in communityand academic centers and trainees confirmed the clinical usefulness of CFM as practical tool that for the first time allows comprehensive characterization of a critical aspect of endoscopist behavior. The technical tasks of the current project will be related to the manufacturability aspects of CFM, further optimizing the device to address issues raised by the users during clinical testing of the Phase II prototype and development of a classifier system to efficiently characterize the colonoscope manipulation pattern. Large multi-site clinical study that will engage prominent academic institutions with the endoscopy training centers will be performed to collect evidence of clinical safety and efficacy for FDA review. Engineering documentation and all regulatory compliance activities for regulatory filing will be completed.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Several million colonoscopies are performed each year in the U.S. However, colonoscopy remains a highly operator dependent activity and no clear definition of skill exists. The aim of this project is to bring to clinical practice a technology and a device for quantitative characterization of examiner performance to improve training of endoscopists and establish best practices for performing colonoscopy.",

Infected, nonhealing skin wounds contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality in individuals with diabetes mellitus and are a major reason for hospitalization of people with diabetes. In the United States alone, each year there are 1.5 million new cases of diabetes diagnosed in people aged 20 years or older. Hospital discharge data indicatethat up to 20% of all diabetics hospitalized in North America within a given year will experience nonhealing skin wounds usually localized on ankles, feet, and heels. Unfortunately, the number of hospital discharges in the United States for diabetes-related amputations has risen in the last decade and as of 2006, 82,000 diabetes-induced lower extremity amputations occur each year. For the diabetic patient, amputation of one limb is associated with a poor prognosis for the contralateral limb, and a decreased rate of survival in general. An alarming 85% of diabetes-related lower extremity amputations have an infected, chronic, nonhealing skin wound as a primary causal factor.  To address the critical need for innovative therapeutic approaches for treatment ofchronic nonhealing skin wounds, Stratatech Corporation has used the NIKS(R) cell line to generate an antimicrobial living human skin substitute. A unique property of the NIKS(R) cells is that they are a long-lived keratinocyte progenitor and consistent source of genetically uniform, non-tumorigenic, pathogen-free human cells. Because they are readily amenable to genetic modification through the use of non-viral vectors, the NIKS(R) keratinocytes are ideal for ex vivo genetic modification approaches to create human biological skin substitutes with enhanced antimicrobial capabilities. Stratatech strategically focused on the endogenous host defense peptide human cathelicidin (hCAP-18/LL-37) because it exhibits antimicrobial activity against a broad range of microorganisms, fungi, and viruses and is a critical component of innate defenses against wound infection.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this work is to complete development of a novel antibacterial, acute hemodialysis catheter and conduct the preclinical testing required for FDA approval. This product will address 3 major unmet needs for intravenous catheters by: (1) providing dual function coatings that are resistant to both biofilm and thrombus, (2) incorporating antimicrobial technology that will not stimulate the growth of antibiotic resistant bacteria, and (3) improving the durationof antimicrobial activity relative to existing products. The coating is based on a combination of a novel protein resistant block copolymer and an antimicrobial peptide. Coatings will be produced by binding the peptide to surfaces in two modes (via a flexible tether and via entrapment). Recent studies indicate that this is a viable approach based on the peptide&#039;s behavior and suggests antimicrobial activity can be maintained when bound to a surface if sufficient solvent accessibility and molecular mobilityare preserved. A layer of the antibacterial peptide prepared in this way should be safe, functional, and long-lasting. A key feature of this technology is that it kills bacteria through a multi-tiered mechanism that is fundamentally different from that ofclinical antibiotics and is unlikely to cause bacteria to develop resistance. During the proposed period of support, the coating composition and application process will be optimized. Coated catheters will be evaluated for coating efficacy against clinically relevant bacteria strains, durability and mechanical properties to ensure that the coating process developed does not alter the necessary mechanical properties of the catheter. Coating components will be produced under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMPs) and a GMP manufacturing process will be developed and implemented for production of the fully coated and assembled catheter. Preclinical testing required for FDA approval of the coated catheters will also be completed. At the end of this development program, the company will be ready to submit a 510k application and plan to begin post approval clinical testing. The results of this work will have a significant impact on the ability to deliver quality care to both acute and end stage renal disease hemodialysis patients and will decrease their risks of morbidity and mortality due to infections. It will also have a significant impact on the ability to control the rapidly growing cost of treating these patient populations by preventing costly catheter related blood stream infections.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibacterial coatings are key to the prevention of medical device related infections, which are a cause of high morbidity and mortality, longer hospital stays, and unnecessary treatment costs. This project aims to develop a new antimicrobial coating technology and apply it to produce an antimicrobial hemodialysis catheter that will prevent biofilms without compromising the efficacy of the limited arsenal of clinical antibiotics. This technology is expected to substantially decrease morbidity and mortality for acute and chronic hemodialysis patients as well as help contain their treatment cost by preventing infections. This research program will potentially yield a solution to the fundamental problem ofbiofilm formation on medical devices and will be an important step toward responsible infection control.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION: Renal transplantation is the most effective and cost-efficient form of renal replacement therapy for a burgeoning population that presents with end-stage renal disease. Although organ donation has become a national priority, the gap between the number of patients awaiting a kidney vs. the number of available kidneys continues to widen exponentially. In many countries within the European Union, utilization of  donation after cardiac death  (DCD) kidneys is steadily increasing, expanding the donor pool by gt50%. Given the high incidence of cardiac deaths in this country, aggressive pursuit of the DCD kidney pool could potentially reduce waitlist periods to months, if not days. Risk for delayed graft function (DGF) with the attendant risks for increased recipient morbidity, chronic allograft nephropathy and increased medical costs has however tempered DCD kidney utilization in this country. Development of strategies that limit normothermic reperfusion injury, promote renal repair, reduce the incidence and/or duration of DGF and improve long-term outcome can greatly enhance acceptance and recruitment of DCD kidneys. Angion Biomedica is developing BB3, a small molecule hepatocyte growth factor mimetic that exhibits significant tissue protective activity in numerous models of acute renal injury. Importantly, this small molecule has completed clinical safety trials in both healthy volunteers and in patients with renal impairment. The present proposal is a pilot evaluation of safety and efficacy of intravenously administered BB3 in recipients of kidneys from DCD donors who are risk for developing DGF. This trial, to be conducted at Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands, is unique in that it compares drug vs. placebo outcome in kidney recipients from the same donor with direct evaluation of function (creatinine clearance) in the graft. Results from this pilot study will form the basis of conducting a large multi-center Phase III trial evaluating efficacy and safety of BB3 in DCD kidney recipients at risk for DGF. Successful completion of these trials will more than likely change the kidney donor recruitment landscape here in the US.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study has significant clinical ramifications. A small molecule that improves post-transplantation function and outcome in higher risk donor kidneys can potentially increase the donor pool thereby reducing significantly the number of deaths in patients awaiting kidney transplant.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Constipation is a common symptom affecting between 2 percent and 27 percent of the population in Western countries. In the United States, it results in more than 2.5 million visits to physicians, 92,000 hospitalizations, and laxative sales of several hundred million dollars a year. The use of a device to electrically stimulate smooth muscle proves particularly useful in clinical applications associated with the gastrointestinal tract. Specifically, electrical stimulationhas been shown to be effective in the treatment of indications including gastroparesis and obesity and more recently, chronic constipation. The technology surrounding smooth muscle stimulation devices has not been optimized. This can primarily be attributed to a gap in knowledge and research surrounding the response of smooth muscle to stimulation with various electrical parameters. The specific aim of our Phase I project was to experimentally determine the optimal electrical pulse waveform type and pulseduration for the energy efficient stimulation of smooth muscle. In summary, the results show an average energy savings of 44% when using truncated exponential biphasic waveforms with pre- measured charge transfer as compared to using traditional rectangular constant current pulses. The objective of this phase II proposal is to design, build, and test an energy efficient implantable smooth muscle stimulation device for the treatment of chronic constipation. The device will deliver the optimal electrical pulse parameters and pulse shape for maximum energy efficiency as determined in the Phase I research. A series of colonic transit studies will then be performed in canine subjects to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device. The long-term goal of thisresearch is to design, build, and commercialize a fully implantable, FDA approved, energy efficient smooth muscle electrical stimulation device to treat chronic constipation.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic constipation causes a decreased qualityof life in up to 27% of the U.S. population, and is associated with 2.5 million visits to doctors and 92,000 hospitalizations annually. Most pharmaceutical treatments (i.e., laxatives) are not effective in treating chronic constipation. Availability of theproposed energy efficient Colon Motility Pacer (CMP-1) will help to increase the quality of life associated with chronic constipation.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PD2007 is a selective DAT inhibitor that P2D Bioscience (P2D) is developing for the treatment of obesity. PD2007 is an analog of benztropine (Cogentin) a non-Scheduled, safe FDA-approved drug in clinical use for over 40years. Structure-activity-relationship studies were conducted to improve PD2007 efficacy while decreasing side-effects. Our SBIR Phase 1 data demonstrate that PD2007 produces sustained weight-loss and decreased body fat. PD2007 appears to decrease body weight by increasing energy expenditure, a novel mechanism of action. PD2007 is radically different from the non-selective DAT inhibitor, amphetamine, a potent anti-obesity drug: For example:  1. PD2007-induced weight-loss appears due to increased energy expenditure unlike the appetite suppressant amphetamine 2. PD2007 is not addicting; amphetamine is an addicting Schedule II drug of abuse 3. PD2007 does not affect blood pressure or heart rate; amphetamine significantly increases both 4. PD2007 is not a stimulant; amphetamine is a widely used stimulant 5. PD2007&#039;s pharmacokinetics are consistent with once a day dosing while amphetamine requires multiple daily dosing for efficacy. The purpose of the proposed SBIR Phase 2: 1) Aim 1 will further assess whether PD2007 has a novel mechanism of action in inducing weight-loss - enhanced energy expenditure, and 2) Aims 2, 3, 4 and 5 represent preclinical safety studies responsive to FDA-guidance ICH M3 for the successful submission of a PD2007 Investigational New Drug(IND) application. This IND would allow clinical testing of PD2007 in humans. Specifically: Aim 1: Determine if PD2007-induced weight-loss is associated with increased energy expenditure, lipolysis and/or glycogenolysis. Aim 2: Assess PD2007 genotoxicity.Aim 3: Assess PD2007 absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME). Aim 4: Assess oral PD2007 safety pharmacology in three studies. Aim 5: Assess repeated PD2007 dose toxicity in rats.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the present application,we propose preclinical studies to determine if PD2007, our anti-obesity drug, has a novel mechanism of action. PD2007 appears to increase energy expenditure and general activity rather than the standard weight-loss method of suppressing appetite. By increasing energy expenditure and general activity, PD2007 would be a healthier way to lose weight. Also, preclinical safety studies will be performed that are required by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These studies, once completed, will allow thestudy of PD2007 for the first time in humans including those with obesity.",

This highly miniaturized sensor technology can be integrated into audio headsets, headphones, hearing aids, and ear jewelry for seamless mobile monitoring of energy expenditure. Valencell&#039;s long-term goal is to augment Healthset technology to provide a seamless mobile energy balance monitoring solution, integrated within a single, wearable, wireless, highly miniaturized, audio earpiece. This mobile solution will satisfy several imminent public needs: 1) the clinical need for an all-in-one wearable energy balance monitor for disease prevention and health management, 2) the academic need for a portable, automated physiological data collection tool, and 3) the consumer demand for an engaging, mobile fitness assessment platform. The specific goal of this Phase II program is to clinically validate a scalable and seamless energy expenditure monitoring platform. This work will involve implementing improvements to Healthset sensor technology as well as optimizing the statistical models relating sensor metrics to energy expenditure. Furthermore, a mobile solution for integrating energy expenditure monitoring (via Healthset technology) with energy intake monitoring (via 3rd party web applications) will be implemented and validated. This mobile solution will connect the user&#039;s wireless Healthset earbud and mobile handset with 3rd party mobile web applications (such as food and weight diaries), and the combined data will be processed to provide a meaningful and useful energy balance metric. This mobile solution will allow 3rd party applications to provide important energy intake data to the Healthset platform, including food diaries and wireless scales, as well as emerging sensor technologies currently under development by universities, government labs, and industry. In this NIH Phase II program, Valencell will: 1) fabricate and qualify Phase II Healthset prototypes for mobile energy expenditure monitoring, 2) optimize statistical models for estimating total (TEE) and resting (REE) energy expenditure, 3) implement a seamless mobile solution integrating energy expenditure with energy intake, and 4) validate the mobile solution in a field environment. This Phase II program will demonstrate a seamless energy balance monitoring platform that is suitable for transitioning to large-scale commercialization in a Phase III program.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Modifiable health risk factors such as high stress, poor diet, and a sedentary lifestyle account for 25% of all medical expenses and millions of deaths per year worldwide. Seamless mobile energy balance monitoring can empower individuals to live healthier lives, saving trillions in medical expenses.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene therapy in the context of diabetic kidney disease holds tremendous promise, although concrete progress in the field has been difficult to achieve. Specifically, the growth factor TGF-2 is known to play a critical role in glomerular matrix expansion and progression of glomerular fibrosis, and inhibition of TGF-2 activity by neutralizing antibodies has shown striking efficacy in several animal models of diabetic kidney disease. However, as is the case with many targets of molecular therapy, TGF-2 is strongly implicated in numerous somatic processes, and off-target inhibition may pose severe detrimental effects. Means by which TGF-2 therapy could be targeted specifically to the impaired kidney could offer a critical breakthrough in making gene therapy for kidney disease a reality. In the current proposal, we aim to develop a novel microbubble-based delivery vehicle for targeted TGF-2 gene therapy. We have developed a microbubble that can be conjugated with a payload of plasmid or siRNA, and targeted to the diabetic kidney by means of a selectin-binding targeting ligand. These agents can be administered intravenously, and their accumulation within the kidney monitored by non-invasive ultrasound imaging. Release of the siRNA payload and transfer into the targeted glomerular cells is mediated by application of high-power ultrasound energy specifically to the kidneys, which causes rapid destruction of the microbubbles and a transient poration of the adjacent cells. Remaining untargeted agents are cleared to the liver, spleen, and lung, where agent destruction by deflation exposes any residual siRNA to endogenous nucleases, thus potentially reducing off-target effects. We aim to evaluate this targeted siRNA delivery strategy inseveral clinically-relevant mouse models of diabetes. TGF-2 knock-down, and reduction in mesangial matrix expansion, will be assessed longitudinally. We will also systematically assess the payload capacity and stability of the agent, and evaluate toxicityand biodistribution in rodents. We anticipate that successful completion of the proposed aims will demonstrate efficacy of this targeted delivery technology for treatment of diabetic kidney disease, and provide Targeson with critical data needed to advanceto the next stage of development for clinical use.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Few techniques for targeted gene therapy are available, especially in deep tissues such as the kidney. This project will examine the ability of a targeted ultrasound-basedtechnique to deliver a therapeutic siRNA to diabetic kidney, and determine whether this strategy is able to ameliorate glomerular fibrosis in animal models of the disease.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (IgAN) is one of the most common glomerulopathies worldwide, leading to kidney failure in up to 40% of those affected. This illness is caused by inflammation of the kidney brought about by extensive IgA1 protein deposits in all the renal glomeruli. It is considered likely that any therapy that can safely remove this IgA1 protein from the kidney will reverse the illness. We will develop IgA protease of Haemophilus influenzae as an injectable biological therapeutic for this purpose. Bacterial IgA proteases all have unique substrate specificity for human IgA1. In preliminary studies we have purified Haemophilus IgA protease to homogeneity and developed a mouse model of IgAN in which human IgA1 complexes were directed to the mouse glomeruli. The IgA protease successfully removed these IgA complexes from the kidney in vivo, suggesting the possibility that these enzymes can be used as a biological therapeutic for patients with this disease.  The problem we face is that the enzyme is large, MW 109 kDa, and likely to elicit antibodies when injected intravenously. We plan to minimize this immunogenicity with pegylation, epitope masking, and removal of amino acid sequences that are not essential forfunction. As we reported in the first application, we were successful in preparing crystals of the enzyme that were observed to diffract to ~2.7 E, and this recently led to our success in solving the structure of the Haemophilus influenzae IgA protease to1.75 E resolution. Because the structure shows the mechanism by which IgA protease recognizes and then cleaves IgA1, we now know how to modify certain regions of the protein without losing bioactivity. Also, the structural analysis suggests several additional ways to reduce antigenicity.  In Phase I we will use the recent structure information to introduce two mutational insertions that can be cleaved by furin, a specific enzyme that is intended to reduce the IgA protease size without modifying its function. In Phase I we also will extend our panel of monoclonal antibodies to define where the major epitopes are on the enzyme protein so we can remove one or more these regions to reduce immunogenicity. In Phase II we will make final reductions in enzyme sizeand will introduce modifications to reduce immunogenicity, and then will compare native and modified forms of the protease for immunogenicity in mice. We will then compare these forms for their effectiveness in removing renal IgA1 in mice, using our validated model of IgAN.  Our goal for this fast track project is to produce a modified, effective IgA protease with low antigenicity for treatment of IgAN. The immediate next step after this project is to seek FDA approval to begin clinical trials of our candidate drug. The long term goal is the successful completion of clinical trials, and the entry of our product into the clinical marketplace.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     We are developing a new drug that will arrest and reverse Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy, a kidney disease that begins in children and young adults and often progresses to kidney failure. The illness is caused by material (a protein called IgA) that accumulates in the kidney, and slowly causes inflammation and kidney damage. The drug will be injected into patients, with the intent to remove this protein material. The expectation is that the treatment will arrest kidney damage, and restore kidney function.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Lipella Pharmaceuticals Inc. has been funded by National Institutes of Health Small Business Innovation and Research (SBIR) grants to develop intravesical liposome nanoparticles to treat overactive bladder (OAB), interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS). The current SBIR will allow Lipella to expand its portfolio of patent applications regarding specific intravesical liposomal delivery techniques using liposomes as platform technology. In recent years, intravesical injections of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) have revolutionized the treatment of intractable lower urinary tract symptoms associated with idiopathic OAB or neurogenic detrusor overactivity. However, BoNT treatment is attended by many adverse effects such as impaired detrusor contractility, large post-void residual volumes and urinary retention. We hypothesize that adverse effects of BoNT can be drastically reduced by restricting its action only to urothelium and suburothelium space. We can achievethe objective of topical delivery of BoNT to bladder urothelium by using liposomal nanotechnology.  The phase 1 funding for this project supported the laboratory scale development towards a liposome based liquid instillation of BoNT with significant physiological effect in bladder without any adverse effects on bladder histology. The studies described in phase II will test the hypothesis that liposome encapsulation provides higher therapeutic efficacy and safety (improves therapeutic index) than the currently used method of cystoscopic injection of BoNT. In addition, we will optimize the liposome platform technology for BoNT in comparison to a small molecular weight potent drug (tacrolimus) to achieve desired product stability of liposome formulation and shelf life that can sustain commercial use.  Funding of this SBIR-II will allow Lipella to bridge our technology to additional intravesical drug delivery applications and will allow Lipella Pharmaceutical to prepare IND package for regulatory submission. Lipella has come a long way since the initial discovery and translation from academic to biotech startup. With the challenging economy condition and reduction in early-stage biotech venture capital funding, the importance of this SBIR-II to Lipella&#039;s future cannot be understated and it fulfills the important mission of NIH on bringing research discoveries from lab to the clinic. With the support of the NIH, Lipella can become a sustainable tax paying company that improves the health care of Americans and supports the local and national economy.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lipella Pharmaceuticals Inc. has been funded by National Institutes of Health Small Business Innovation and Research (SBIR) grants to develop intravesical liposome and is now expanding itsportfolio to intravesical liposomal drug delivery techniques. The development of a safe and effective liposomal liquid delivery of drugs into the bladder, without the need for endoscopic intervention and minimal risk of systemic toxicity, urinary irritation or retention is a priority. Drug delivery to block bladder inflammation will be an objective of this project and the successful completion of this grant will allow Lipella Pharmaceuticals to prepare a regulatory submission of liposomal based drug delivery IND.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes is a public health problem of epidemic proportions. It adversely affects morbidity, mortality, and overall healthcare costs. It is well known that frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and good glycemic control can improve both cost and outcome. SMBG is not adequately embraced because current technology is painful, requires blood, and can be costly. Thus there is an urgent need for a noninvasive blood glucometer that removes all of the impediments tooptimal SMBG.  Grove Instruments (GI, formerly VivaScan) has developed noninvasive glucose measurement technology that can meet the needs of the burgeoning diabetes population. GI&#039;s noninvasive blood glucometer is based on real-time measurements of near-infrared (NIR) light absorption by glucose in blood using a patented Optical Bridget (OB) method. Previous SBIR grants and private company funds have enabled GI to develop and clinically test an advanced engineering prototype handheld noninvasive blood glucometer.  Grove&#039;s current objective is to develop our NIR transflectance fingertip prototype instrument into a personal handheld noninvasive glucometer ready for commercialization. To achieve this goal we have these specific aims: we will design, build and test 1) a next generation fiberless optical measurement head that is insensitive to alignment of laser diodes and other optical components and is mass-manufacturable at low cost 2) a new ergonomic finger port that provides for physiologic positioning, stability and maximal perfusion, and 3) electronic and mechanical modules to achieve 50% size reduction.  Other important aims include: 1) development of a detailed and sophisticated understanding of the microcirculatory capillary arcades to refine detection and quantification of microcirculatory blood volume variation patterns during measurement; 2) develop a new method to precisely measure plasma volume variation during fingertip reperfusion; 3) develop advanced signal processing and feature extraction techniques to improve glucose measurement precision and repeatability, and 4) perform pilot clinical studies and determine the performance accuracy and repeatability of the new (GI210) device. The proposed device has dramatic implications for the quality of glucose control for diabetic persons, their quality of life and longevity. Optimizing SMBG with the GI noninvasive fingertip glucometer can lead to improved clinical outcomes and substantial cost savings to the diabetic individual and to the entire health caresystem.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Grove Instruments intends to promote the benefits of good glycemic control by bringing to market a completely noninvasive, bloodless, and painless glucometer that allows all people with diabetes to test their blood sugar optimally and thus improve their glycemic control. Existing finger prick glucometers are not being used routinely because they are painful and inconvenient. Grove&#039;s personal noninvasive glucometer will enable diabetic persons to test as frequently asdesired without discomfort or increased cost helping them improve their glycemic control and the health of millions while reducing health care costs associated with diabetes.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disorders of iron metabolism are among the most common human diseases. During the last decade, rapid progress has been made in the understanding of the molecular basis or iron homeostasis and its disorders. The peptidehormone hepcidin has emerged as the master regulator of iron metabolism. Dysregulation of hepcidin is the principal or contributing factor in most systemic iron disorders. There is a well recognized unmet need for a robust and widely available clinical assay for serum hepcidin but progress towards this goal has been slowed by the poor immunogenicity of hepcidin. Intrinsic Life Sciences (ILS) developed and validated the world&#039;s first serum hepcidin immunoassay (competitive ELISA), that relied on a finite supply of high quality rabbit polyclonal antibodies. In order to increase the availability and standardization of the hepcidin ELISA, Phase I SBIR funding was used to produce murine monoclonal antibodies against hepcidin. Under Phase II of this proposal we will: 1) Use the monoclonal antibodies to optimize and validate a 2nd generation improved competitive ELISA for hepcidin 2) Produce additional monoclonal antibodies to hepcidin and develop and validate a two-monoclonal antibody sandwich ELISA. Successful completion of Phase II will enable ILS to deliver a hepcidin immunoassay prototype suitable for FDA approval and widespread adoption by clinicians and researchers.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With Phase II SBIR funding, Intrinsic Life Sciences (ILS) willdevelop the first prototype diagnostic tests suitable for FDA-approval for the iron-regulating hormone hepcidin.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are the most common hospital- acquired infections, accounting for over one million cases and hospital costs of more than  500 million each year in the U.S. alone. Recent reimbursement changes from the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services will place this cost burden directly onto hospitals, creating an immediate incentive to address this neglected aspect of care. The current paradigm for preventing bacterial UTIs has been to introduce antimicrobial agents to reduce the occurrence of bacteriuria. However, antimicrobial agents produce resistance patterns that make indwelling catheter infections more difficult to treat. No antimicrobial catheter now on the market has been endorsed by either CDC/APIC due to a lack of clinically relevant supporting data. Sharklet Technologies therefore proposes to further develop a novel Foley catheter design that inhibits bacterial colonization and that does not rely on traditional antibiotic coatings or treatments. Our Phase I SBIR work proved the feasibility of using the novel Sharklet  micro-pattern polymer surface to inhibit bacterial biofilm growth-setting the stage for a larger Phase II project designed to fully prototype and demonstrate the potential for the Sharklet technology. The overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to commercialize a silicone Foley catheter with the Sharklet micro-pattern that will reduce CAUTI. During Phase I the Sharklet RandD team demonstrated this new concept by reducing colonization of uropathogenic Escherichia coli with in vitro via testing of three Sharklet micro-patterns relative to a smooth surface and by successfully fabricating silicone tube prototypes with the Sharklet pattern on the extraluminal and intraluminal surfaces. Based on that success, Phase II work will focus on the following three Aims: First, to extend in vitro efficacy testing to three additional, relevant uropathogens and to test inhibition of bacterial migration in an in vitro bladder model. Second, Sharklet-patterned Foley catheters will be manufactured via our OEM partner, Medical Components Inc. The manufactured catheters will undergo standard testing to ensure they meet FDA criteria for biocompatibility and functional performance, as well as repeated in vitro bladder model testing to obtain device claims for the FDA 510(k) submission that will be made at the end of Phase II. Third, Phase II will conclude with a pilot clinical study to evaluate the ability of the Sharklet-patterned Foley catheter to inhibit bacterial migration on the catheter surface. This study will be an integral precursor to a statistically powered clinical trial for confirming the Sharklet Foley catheter&#039;s ability to reduce CAUTI. Phase II success will set the stage for providing a much-needed tool for clinicians/hospitals to improve patient care and reap significant cost savings with the reduced burden of infection enabled by the Sharklet Foley catheter. The Phase II data is critical for engaging the  Phase III  investors/industry partners needed to complete the required development/approval work and to ultimately commercialize this new technology.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are the most common hospital- acquired infections, resulting in significant patient setbacks, discomfort, and medical costs of over half a billion dollars annually in the U.S. alone. With its successful Phase I SBIR work, Sharklet Technologies proved the feasibility of its new Sharklet  micro-pattern concept (based on shark skin) for Foley catheter manufacture that inhibits bacterial colonization without the use of antimicrobial coatings or treatments. The Sharklet team now proposes a Phase II project to fully prototype and demonstrate efficacy of the Sharklet Foley catheter in preparation for the FDA clearance required to ultimately commercialize a new product that will substantially reduce the occurrence of CAUTI.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ion channel drug discovery has been hampered by the lack of cell-based high throughput screening (HTS) assay to physiologically and pharmacologically characterize compound activities. Cytoptics Corporation (Cytoptics) proposes to develop a new generation of chloride ion and pH sensing luminous quantum dots (QD) indicators to measure intracellular chloride ion concentrations, [Cl-]i, and pHi for fluorescence microscopy and cell-based high throughput screening (HTS) targeting GI drug discovery. These fluorescence microscopy and cell-based HTS assays utilize the size-tunable, non- overlapping emission wavelengths, ion-selective QD to measure [Cl-]i and pHi simultaneously in T84WT /T84C1C2 as well as in HEK293WT/HEK293C1C-2 cells. Using the quantum dots (QD) as Forester Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) donors and the respective Cl- and H+ chemical sensors conjugated to the QD as acceptors, these two nanosensors, Cl-QD and pH-QD, quench their fluorescence intensities of the QDaccording to the concentrations of the Cl- and H+ bound to their respective Cl- and H+ sensors. We have accomplished all the proposed Phase I objectives, namely, 1) synthesis and spectral characterization of chloride ion sensing luminous QD, Cl-QD; 2) development of a loading protocol of the Cl-QD into T84 cells; and 3) measurements of the physio-pharmacological [Cl-]i responses in T84WT and T84C1C-2 cells using the Cl- QDTM. In Phase II, Cytoptics will incorporate and extend the accomplishments of Phase Ito produce six assays to target the cell-based GI drug target discovery market. They are (1) the Cl-QDTM assay for fluorescence microscopy; (2) the Cl-QDTM assay for cell- based HTS; (3) the pH-QD assay for fluorescence microscopy; (4) the pH-QD assay forcell-based HTS; (5) the Cl-QDTM and pH-QD integrated assay for cell-based HTS; and (6) the Cl-QDTM and pH-QD integrated assay targeting C1C-2 channels using the stable T84C1C-2 and HEK293C1C-2 cells for GI drug discovery. These novel assays address the critical needs of cell-based HTS drug discovery and will also broadly impact drug discovery research in ionic signal transduction.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chloride channels and proton transporters are the two predominant drug discovery gastrointestinal (GI) target sites for the treatments of diarrhea, constipation and gastric reflux. Cytoptics Corporation proposes to develop a new generation of chloride ion and pH sensing indicators (Cl-QD and pH-QD, respectively) to simultaneously measure the dynamicsof the intracellular chloride ion concentrations ([Cl-]i) and pH (pHi) in epithelial cells for the first time. These nanosensors will be utilized to interrogate the Cl-channels and H+-transporters as direct physiological and pharmacological assays for GIdrug discovery. Using the quantum dots (QD) with different emission wavelengths for these two nanosensors, Cl-QD and pH-QD emit separate colors with their non-interfering fluorescence intensities varied according to their respective concentrations of Cl- and H+, Cytoptics will produce six assays utilizing these two novel QD-based nanosensors to target the cell-based GI HTS drug discovery market. These novel assays will also provide unparallel insights in the ionic cellular signal transduction mechanisms that heretofore not been possible.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary hyperoxaluria, type 1 (PH1) is a rare, monogenic disorder in which a mutation in the AGXT gene leads to overproduction of oxalate by the liver, resulting in widespread deposition of calcium oxalate in the kidneys and other organs. Unfortunately, PH1 disease progression is not understood. Despite identification of the AGTX mutation, there is little genotype-phenotype correlation in these patients, with kidney stone formation and loss of kidney function proceedingin a seemingly haphazard fashion. Many patients may progress to end- stage kidney disease (ESKD), despite current supportive therapy. An objective diagnostic that accurately detects PH1 and identifies individuals at high risk for rapid progression to ESKDis an unmet clinical need. Clearly, no single molecular marker, or small group of markers, will be able to meet this need. Common proteomic technologies, such as Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), lack the ability to quantify multiple biomarkers simultaneously. One-at-a-time assessment of each putative biomarker incurs considerable time, cost and sample volume. Newer technologies lack sensitivity, precision and automation. The ability to systematically identify protein profiles, predict risk of clinical events, evaluate therapeutic response, and define underlying mechanisms is thereby limited severely. Rules-Based Medicine (RBM) resolved these limitations by developing bead-based, multiplexed immunoassays for identifying disease-specific Multi-Analyte Profiles (MAPs). Exciting preliminary data indicates that MAP technology is well suited for screening large numbers of markers in parallel to identify protein profiles associated with PH1, and may provide insight into the disease course. During Phase I,RBM, and Children&#039;s Memorial Hospital (CMH) propose to utilize this quantitative proteomics approach to compare the protein profiles in urine samples obtained from patients diagnosed with PH1 vs. age- and gender-matched control populations. The level and pattern of expression for 201 proteins will be studied. It is expected that the physiological insight obtained from the proposed study may be used to better define the pathological mechanisms associated with PH1. During Phase II, a prospective validation ofthe MAP identified for PH1 during Phase I efforts will be performed. The sensitivity, specificity,and positive and negative predictive values for each analyte, as well as, the MAP of biomarkers for predicting progression of the disease to ESKD will be determined. In addition, a proposed physiological range of MAP analytes for children and adolescents will be developed based on age, and gender for both the normal and PH1 populations. Such range values, typically used for diagnosis and intervention, can be used as a reference for future studies and for the development of both a diagnostic test and therapeutic algorithms. The identification of novel biomarker patterns of individuals with PH1, as well as, individuals at high risk for rapid progression to ESKD,will allow for improved management of the condition by objective selection of treatment course or dosage, determining treatment effectiveness, and providing a framework for developing and evaluating new treatments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Primary hyperoxaluria, type 1 (PH1) is a rare, genetic disorder that leads to widespread deposition of calcium oxalate stones in the kidneys and other organs. Unfortunately, PH1 disease progression is not understood, and many patients may progress to end-stage kidney disease, despite therapy. The identification of novel biomarker patterns of individuals with PH1 as well as, individuals at high risk for progression to end-stage kidney disease, will allow for improved management of the condition by objective selection of treatment course, aiding the determination of treatment dosage and/or effectiveness, and providing a framework for developing and evaluating new treatments.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DiscoveryBioMed, Inc. (DBM) achieved Phase 1 SBIR milestones and seeks to continue a mature program that has progressed to the hit-to-lead drug validation, prioritization and progression stage. DBM s major over-archinggoal for this program is to identify novel clinical candidate CFTR Corrector Ligands (CFCLs) for the treatment of CF through the completion of a focused Drug Discovery program and accompanying Critical Progression Path, which utilize disease-relevant humancell systems. These compounds have the potential to be disease-modifying with dramatic effects on disease progression as well as CF patients  well-being and quality of life. DBM, academic collaborators, and industry consultants (with gt70 years experiencein Drug Discovery) have refined secondary validation and tertiary prioritization assays and their order in a Critical Path such that the small molecules that are most potent and  druggable  are systematically identified and progressed forward towards selection of the best compound(s) for progression to Preclinical Development. Phase 2 aims will focus on identifying and  progressing  the best lead CFCLs from different chemical scaffolds. This CF Drug Discovery program is part of a larger initiative on CF and other chronic respiratory diseases that represent DBM s most mature drug discovery umbrella to date (see Commercialization Plan). For this revised Phase 2 SBIR-driven program application, DBM proposes three key milestones, which follow a Drug Discovery Critical Path of validation, optimization and, ultimately, the selection of inhaled clinical candidate compounds primarily (with an eye on secondary examination of the oral route of administration): Milestone 1 - Hit to Lead Validation, which will profile emerging hit-to-lead CF corrector ligands in comparison to a potent benchmark lead compound identified in Phase 1, DBM 99H7. Milestone 2 - Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) Development and Lead Optimization, which will profile further and optimize the lead CF corrector compounds. Milestone 3 - Further Profiling of Lead Compounds and Selection of Clinical Candidate(s), which will identify the best compounds for Preclinical Development and Clinical Trials. Specific aims, listed under each key milestone, script key experimental tasks within the Drug Discovery Critical Path; these are defined in more detail elsewhere in Goals and Milestones and Research Strategy sections. They represent key parameters and features of compounds that will assist with the identification of the best CFCLs. Mechanistically, the most desired drug is one that both  corrects  the folding defect in delF508-CFTR within the endoplasmic reticulum as well as  activates or opens  the delF508-CFTR Cl- channel in the secretory pathway and atthe apical plasma membrane. Added benefits may include the correction of other dysregulated epithelial cell functions, such as inhibition of hyperactive epithelial sodium channels (the ENaCs) as well as the opening or up- regulation of other Cl- channels that might amplify mutant CFTR function in the apical cell membrane. DBM believes that its benchmark lead CFCL drug, DBM 99H7, is an example of a delF508-CFTR corrector, a delF508- CFTR opener, and an ENaC inhibitor. Through the study of initial lead and lead classes of CFCLs found in this CF human airway cell-driven drug discovery program during Phase1 of the SBIR grant, we have learned much about the features of lead drugs that are most desired and how to best profile and progress them. DBM is confident that this Phase 2 program will yield a primary CFCL clinical candidate as well as back-up lead CFCLs to progress forward into a therapeutic development spinout company and, ultimately, to out-license with a BioPharma. DBM, Inc.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cystic fibrosis is a progressive and debilitating lung disease that afflicts children and young adults; it causes significant morbidity and premature mortality with an average life-span of 32 years. Loss of salt and fluid secretion together with accelerated salt absorption dehydrates the airways and causes sticky mucus to accumulate. This accumulation eventually obstructs airflow, which leads to pulmonary decline in CF patients, and provides an ideal environment for infectious bacteria to colonize and cause recurrent disease exacerbations. DiscoveryBioMed, Inc., our team of academic partners from two national CF Research Centers, and industry consultant professionals derived from GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca seek to garner continued funding to validate, prioritize and select the best CFTR corrector/opener ligands as new and effective CF drugs. Our program is discovering and &#039;progressing&#039; compounds in CF human lung cell systems that restore normal function of multiple CF cell dysfunctions to attenuate and, ultimately, prevent the development of CF lung disease by attacking its root causes at the cellular and molecular level of the CF airways epithelium and the airway microenvironment. These compounds have the potential to be disease- modifying with dramatic effects on disease progression as well as CF patients&#039; well-being and quality of life. DBM, Inc.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Foot ulcers are a prevalent complication in the diabetic population, and despite that, the exact causation of plantar ulcers is still unknown. Research suggests that vertical pressure and horizontal shear play an integral role, but the pressure and shear distributions must be precisely measured on the entire plantar surface. Unfortunately, only pressure distribution measurement systems are commercially available. Several shear stress distribution measurement systems havebeen developed in universities in the past, but the systems are limited in their resolution, accuracy, and size. To address this need, Bertec Corporation is proposing to collaborate with Innovative Scientific Solutions Inc. and the Cleveland Clinic Foundation to develop a measurement tool where the continuous distributions of pressure and shear over the entire plantar foot can be quantified for approximately the cost of existing commercially available tools that are capable of only measuring pressure. Thistool will be a force plate developed by Bertec with an elastic surface stress sensitive film (S3F) coating the top developed by ISSI. The device will be tested with diabetics and age-matched controls at the Cleveland Clinic in order to better refine the system and its software. It will be capable of measuring the ground reaction forces and the continuous pressure and shear distributions as a subject walks across the plate. The final product will be of great interest to biomechanists, podiatrists, physicaltherapists, and doctors specializing in the treatment of diabetes and diabetic foot complications. But in order to reach that goal, the following specific aims must be accomplished: Aim 1, Phase I) Integrate an elastic polymeric film sensitive to pressureand shear with a 6-component force plate in order to obtain a prototype instrument that will yield ground reaction forces plus a true pressure and shear deformation distribution in the polymeric film, due to plantar loading; Aim 2, Phase II) Capture precise foot landmark positions on the prototype product of Aim 1, so that the measured quantities can be accurately mapped to the physical location on the foot; Aim 3, Phase II) Utilizing the finite element analysis model, as independently established by Innovative Science Solutions Inc., for the surface stress sensitive film, and the synchronously measured shear forces from the force plate, convert the shear deformation distribution of the prototype product to shear stress distribution. Then integrate this analysis module into Bertec&#039;s digital data acquisition software allowing auto-calculation of shear stresses; Aim 4, Phase II) Incorporate the pressure deformation distribution and foot marker position data from Phase I and Aim 2 into the data acquisition software. Using the finite element analysis model and the synchronously measured vertical force by the force plate, calibrate the pressure deformation model to auto-calculate true pressure distribution; and Aim 5, Phase II) Evaluate the clinical utility of theprototype system, including the acquisition software measuring shear stress and pressure distribution acting upon the plantar foot, from a functional as well as a research point of view through clinical trials of patients with and without diabetes. PUBLICHEALTH RELEVANCE:  Nearly 10% of the US population has diabetes, and foot ulcers are one of the most common complications - often resulting in amputation. Pressure and shear stress acting on the sole of the foot may be responsible for ulcer formation, butno tool is commercially available that can measure pressure and shear distributions. Bertec&#039;s S3F-force plate system is capable of measuring and displaying the distributions and forces acting upon sole of the diabetic&#039;s foot.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II SBIR application is responsive to Program Announcement PA-09- 113,  Manufacturing Processes of Medical, Dental and Biological Technologies . This PA solicits work on  technology for the manufacture of implantable devices and materials, prosthetic organs, and artificial tissues . Humacyte has developed a novel vascular graft that has shown excellent function in large animal models. The graft is made by culturing allogeneic human smooth muscle cells in a bioreactor to produce an engineered vascular tissue. This engineered tissue is then carefully decellularized, so as to remove the immunogenic cellular components, while retaining the collagenous extracellular matrix. These grafts have the advantage of being non-living, and hence can be stored on the shelf for periods of up to 9 months. Vascular dialysis grafts that are 6 mm in diameter function well in a baboon model of arterio-venous grafting, and are resistant to two important failure modes of synthetic dialysis grafts: thrombosis and intimal hyperplasia. This SBIR application is directed at scaling the manufacture of this exciting and novel engineered tissue. In our Phase I proposal, our aim was the construction and testing of a prototype, disposable vasculargraft bioreactor. In this Phase II proposal, we will build on our successful Phase I work, and we will refine and build a scaled-up manufacturing system that will enable cost-effective production of our unique, off-the-shelf vascular graft for dialysis access. This pilot scaled system will also be applicable to the manufacture of other types of engineered tissues, and hence will benefit the regenerative medicine field as a whole. We will hone the single-use bioreactor system and in parallel, we will definerapidly consumed components of culture medium and develop a strategy to supplement those limiting factors, thereby reducing overall culture medium usage. Together, these strategies will allow us to produce a scaled, economical manufacturing system. Dialysis grafts produced in the scaled system will be assessed using standard assays for graft biochemical extracellular matrix composition, cell viability, mechanical integrity, as well as graft in vivo function in a primate model. The results of these studieswill contribute to the submission of an IND application to the FDA.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This Phase II SBIR application addresses a critical need in regenerative medicine: the development of scaled manufacturing systems that produce engineeredtissues in a reproducible and economical fashion.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Short bowel syndrome (SBS) represents a large loss of intestinal length, compromising the absorption of nutrients and fluids to sustain life. Although patients may be maintained on parenteral (intravenous) nutrition, the morbidity can be devastating and associated mortality rates exceed 30%. Care for each SBS patient is in excess of  250,000 per year and estimated costs for just the first five years of the care of a child with SBS exceed 1.5 million. Although a number ofstrategies have been used to treat SBS, the results have been disappointing with high complication rates and death. Application of longitudinal distractive forces, as directed with an intraluminally placed device, induces intestinal growth in pig small intestine (1.7-fold) over a 7-day period. The lengthening (enterogenesis) is not merely a stretching of the intestine, but true growth with preservation of intestinal function.  The goal of this proposal is to develop a catheter-based device which could be placed intralumenally for days to weeks in a clinical setting to deliver longitudinal forces to the intestine, allowing for an elongation of the bowel while keeping the continuity of the gastrointestinal tract intact. The catheter enterogenesis device (CED)is envisioned as a simple, effective means of improving survival for SBS sufferers.  Phase 1 resulted in the successful development of a working prototype. Two inflated balloons effectively anchored to the intestinal wall and delivered the forces previously determined to be effective for enterogenesis.  The aims of this proposal is to develop the insertion and removal technique for the device with a preference for endoscopic placement, to assess the safety of the device through blood flow measurements, gross tissue examination and histological assessment and finally to demonstrate the efficacy of the device to lengthen the bowel in a chronic study. Device development will accompany each stage.  The overall impact of this device will provide a low cost, safeand effective device to treat patients with short bowel syndrome in response to a tremendous unmet need for patients and their families. Variations of the CED may treat disease processes in other hollow visceral organs such as esophageal and intestinal atresia, ischemic and infection processes resulting in massive colon resection and congenital exstrophy.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this research proposal is to develop a catheter based device which will deliver linear forces resulting in the growth of the intestine. The catheter enterogenesis device (CED) is envisioned as a simple, minimally invasive and effective means of improving survival for short bowel syndrome sufferers.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes Phase II of the development of a rapid point-of-care test kit for the direct measurement of bacteriuria as a diagnostic for urinary tract infections (UTIs). While bacteriuria at a level of 105 CFU/ml is the gold standard for UTI diagnosis, in practice the required urine culture is unfeasible due to the typical 2-day delay in obtaining results. UTI diagnosis is aided by other in-office urinalysis dipsticks, but studies have shown that there is a high rate of misdiagnosis and consequent overtreatment with antibiotics. The proposed test kit will allow, for the first time, a direct  dipstick  measurement of bacterial concentration in urine within 10 minutes, in time to aid diagnosis of UTI during the initial office visit. The proposed test kit will be a lateral flow immunoassay, similar to a home pregnancy test. In the test design, multiple anti-bacteria monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) will be used to directly bind to bacterial cells in a urine sample, producing a visual +/- result calibrated to ~105 CFU/ml. These MAbs will be selected from the Company&#039;s existing collection of gt80 such antibodies. The test utilizes the Company&#039;s proprietary SandwichPLUS  format, which allows the simultaneous use of multiple antibodies in a single assay and radically shortens development time. In Phase I, the applicant developed a proof-of- concept prototype which was shown to detect six uropathogenic bacteria strains at the target level of 104 - 105 CFU/ml. In Phase II, thetest kit will be further optimized for sensitivity and specificity using a much broader range of uropathogenic isolates, and test procedure will be further improved and simplified. Clinical validation studies will be carried out to determine the real-world performance of the product. At the successful conclusion of Phase II, the test kit will be ready for manufacturing, FDA review, and marketing. The estimated cost of the test to the end user will be  2.00 -  5.00 per test, far less than the cost of urineculture and in line with the cost of current urine dipsticks.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urinary tract infections are some of the most common cause of physicians&#039; office visits, accounting for over 8,000,000 visits per year in the US. The gold-standard diagnostic method for UTI, urine culture to detect bacteria, is not currently feasible as a routine procedure due to the 2-day delay in obtaining results. This proposal continues the development a simple, inexpensive, 10-minute  dipstick  test for bacteria in urine, to give physicians the ability to accurately diagnose UTI during the initial office visit by the patient.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Liver fibrosis, a disease affecting tens of millions of people worldwide, is the liver scarring response to chronic injury from excessive alcohol use, virus infection (hepatitis B and C), iron overload or extrahepatic obstructions and can progress to liver cirrhosis, liver failure and death. In fact, deaths from complications of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis are expected to triple over the next decade as a result of the hepatitis C epidemic and the growing incidence of liverdisease associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Currently available therapies, including antivirals, are largely ineffective in treating the underlying fibrosis, and in the majority of cases, liver transplantation is the only effective cure. Hepaticgrowth factor (HGF), also known as scatter factor (SF), has been shown to be efficacious in reducing liver fibrosis. The feasibility of HGF as gene or protein therapy however is limited by issues relating to immune and inflammatory responses evoked by adenoviral proteins, inherent instability of proteins in solution, their limited tissue half-life, and the exorbitant costs associated with such therapy. Supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) and RapidAccess to Interventional Development (RAID) programs, we have identified and developed BB3, a novel small molecule HGF mimetic. BB3 duplicates the bioactivities of HGF in every assay tested to date. Particularly, BB3 possesses cell protective, anti-fibrotic, and regenerative activities and shows efficacy in reducing liver fibrosis. The overall objective of our program is to advance BB3 to the clinic as a first-in-class antifibrotic for liver fibrosis. From a clinical perspective, a Phase I safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) trial of intravenously administered BB3 has been completed successfully in healthy volunteers and BB3 was found to be well tolerated. In addition, a clinical study of intravenously administered BB3 for safety and PK in renal dialysis patients has been completed. While intravenous BB3 is being developed for acute indications, we are also developing oral BB3 for chronic indications. In this fast-track SBIR grant application, we propose to conduct a Phase 1 clinical study evaluating safety and PK of BB3 administered orally in healthy volunteers.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A small-molecule, hepatically protective and anti-fibrotic agent has significant clinical potential against both liver fibrosis.",

To execute on this objective, it is necessary to first finalize the concentrated non-aqueous glucagon solution developed in the Phase 1 program and thereafter, manufacture cGMP clinical supplies of the glucagon pen for the Phase 1-2 trial. The final phase in this program will be to conduct a Phase 1-2 clinical trial that will study the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of the Glucagon Rescue Pen. If successful, these experiments will demonstrate the safety and initial effectiveness of a simple, portable, glucagon delivery system to support an NDA-enabling Phase 3 (bioequivalency) study. The first Specific Aim of this proposed project is to optimize the non-aqueous glucagon formulation and produce cGMP clinical supplies in a pre-filled auto-injection pen. The second Specific Aim is to file IND documentation and get FDA approval for a Phase 1-2 clinical plan. The Third Specific Aim will be to conduct a Phase 1-2 clinical trial with the Glucagon Rescue Pen. Success Benchmarks will include: 1) rapid identification of non-aqueous glucagon formulation; 2) manufacture of GMP clinical supplies of the autoinjector pen that can proceed into long and accelerated stability testing and release for use in the clinical trial; 3) Fullenrollment of the Phase 1-2 clinical study that demonstrates the product&#039;s safety; pharmacokinetic profile (plasma glucagon levels) and a pharmacodynamic profile (blood glucose levels) that are equivalent to an aqueous-reconstituted glucagon.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The conditions of diabetes and obesity are a growing public health concern affecting more of the population every year. A large segment of the population is pre-diabetic potentially progressing towards diabetes. Food choices impact all of these health problems. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase resistant starch levels in wheat, a principle part of our diet. Resistant starch has many beneficial health properties. It is the portion of starch that escapes digestion in the lower intestine and is instead fermented in the large intestine. Because of this, resistant starch does not cause a rapid rise in glucose after a meal; instead glucose is released more slowly into the bloodstream and leads to an increased feeling of satiety. Fermentation of resistant starch in the lower intestine also leads to short chain fatty acid production that helps promote colon health.  We propose to develop novel wheat cultivars with very high levels of resistant starch. By increasinglevels of amylose, one of the components of starch, resistant starch levels increase. Resistant starch is also correlated with levels of total dietary fiber because it is slowly digested; so increased amylose increases fiber content as well. In preliminarywork, we developed a wheat line with moderate amylose levels due to the alteration of an enzyme in the starch biosynthetic pathway using TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes). TILLING is a novel non-GM (genetic modification) technique thatis a target-selected variation of mutation breeding. In order to develop very high amylose wheat for a product that can be commercialized, we propose to combine mutations in linked starch biosynthetic genes. The feasibility of obtaining the necessary linked mutations will be demonstrated during Phase I. This project has a high likelihood of success given the size and mutation frequency of our wheat TILLING library. The rest of the necessary mutations will be discovered during Phase II and combined through breeding to produce the very high amylose variety. We have applied for the Fast Track SBIR based on the strength of our preliminary data and the high likelihood of commercialization due to the many more foods than currently available sources of resistant starch whose use is limited. Because level of interest from the industry in this product.  High resistant starch wheat can be incorporated into wheat is pervasive in our diets, this product could have a major positive impact on health.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The conditions of diabetes and obesity are a growing public health concern affecting more of the population every year. Food choices impact these health problems, and foods high in resistant starch have beneficial effects that help combat these conditions. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop novel wheat cultivars with very high levels of resistant starch that would positively impact health. )",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The clinical evaluation and management of hemostasis in the 5 million patients affected by chronic liver diseases (CLD) is poorly understood. Data presented at two International Symposia on Coagulation in Liver Diseaseand summarized in a recent edition of Clinics in Liver Disease strongly support the presence of an unmet clinical need for investigation in this field. Improved investigation of hemostasis is needed to assess bleeding risks and guide clinical decisions. Few examples are listed in the table below, showing how clinical practice could be improved for CLD patients. Clinical decision for invasive interventions such as liver biopsy Improved assessment  of hemostasis =gt Don&#039;t perform procedure if hemostatic profile reveals high risk of bleeding Usage of blood products for prophylaxis or therapy purposes Improved assessment  of hemostasis =gt Guide the selection and transfusion of blood products: (i) Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and/or cryoprecipitate to replenish blood coagulation proteins. (ii) Platelet concentrates to replenish platelets level. (iii) Anti-fibrinolytics to slow down clot dissolution. Perioperative management of blood product transfusions such as in the case of liver transplant Improved assessment ofhemostasis =gt Guide transfusion of blood products as above Clinical decisions in the emergency room and intensive care unit Improved assessment of hemostasis =gt Guide transfusion of blood products as above The management of blood products is particularlyimportant for in CLD patients at risk or experiencing bleeding episodes. However, the use of blood products should be carefully optimized in order to save scarce resources, minimize the risks of allergic reactions, viral and bacterial infections, and reduce health-care spending. A recent report indicated that improved management of hemostasis in liver transplant alone could save over  370K/year (assuming an hospital performing 42 transplants/year) while reducing complications related to over transfusion ofblood products by 2.6X. Unfortunately, there is no viable comprehensive test of hemostasis able to provide accurate management of CLD patients. While several studies have shown that current tests are unable to effectively quantify the hemostatic functionsin CLD and do not correlate with bleeding outcomes, clinical decisions are being made daily using these unfounded criteria, leading to erroneous and potentially hazardous treatments. The need for alternatives has been apparent since seminal studies showing the fallacy of current tests in CLD. HemoSonics&#039; Proposed Solution: HemoSonics LLC is developing an instrument, the HemoSonics&#039; Global Hemostasis Analyzer or HS-GHA that can quantify hemostasis function to guide appropriate and evidence based interventions. The HS-GHA is based on sonorheometry (SR), a novel ultrasound-based technology able to assess not only time to clot (dependent upon the plasma coagulation factors) but also clot formation rate (also dependent upon coagulation factors), clot stiffness (dependent upon fibrin assembly and platelet function), and time to lysis (dependent upon fibrinolytic proteins). If proven successful, the HS-GHA will help: (i) physicians provide the correct treatment, (ii) the hospital save costs by reducing unnecessarytransfusions, (iii) the blood bank save blood products, and, most importantly, (iv) improve patient&#039;s care. Proposed SBIR Work: In Phase I we intend to complete demonstration of the feasibility of SR as a diagnostic tool to quantify abnormalities of hemostasis that are common in CLD. In this Phase II we intend to demonstrate the clinical value and thus the commercial potential of our technology. We will design and assemble a stand- alone clinical prototype with disposable cartridges, and perform a small clinical study on cirrhotic patients. A positive conclusion from this study will demonstrate the ability of sonorheometry to recognize specific hemostatic defects that lead to excessive bleeding and the need to transfuse blood products. This research is a collaborative effort between HemoSonics, LLC and the University of Virginia Department of Biomedical Engineering and School of Medicine.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The clinical evaluation and management of hemostasis in the 5 million patients affected bychronic liver diseases (CLD) is poorly understood. While improved management of hemostasis can resolve in improved patients care and substantial cost savings, this task currently remains suboptimal due to the many limitations of available diagnostic tests. The goal of this SBIR proposal is to develop and test the clinical efficacy of a novel diagnostic instrument that will improve the current management of hemostasis in CLD patients, thus improving patients&#039; outcomes and generating significant cost savings.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objective of this proposal is to develop and commercialize a safe and more effective therapy for the treatment of Crohn&#039;s Disease, an inflammatory bowel disease. Crohn&#039;s Disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that affects some 500,000 patients in the US. Selexys Pharmaceuticals is developing a fully human anti-PSGL-1 antibody drug directed against P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), a dimeric mucin on circulating leukocytes that binds selectins and chemokines, for the treatment of Crohn&#039;s Disease. PSGL-1 mediates the first step in the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation by binding to selectins, cell adhesion molecules that are upregulated in Crohn&#039;s Disease patients. PSGL-1 also binds chemokines that amplify the inflammatory response through chemotaxis of inflammatory cells to endothelial cells that line the gut. In preclinical studies in animal models of Crohn&#039;s Disease, anti-PSGL-1 antibodies have been shown to block recruitment of leukocytes resulting in a profound therapeutic effect. Thus anti-PSGL-1 antibodies represent a novel new potential therapeutic approach in the treatment of Crohn&#039;s Disease. In Phase 1 of this Fast Track Proposal, Selexys is proposing to conduct primate safety and toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkey with a human anti-PSGL-1 IgG2 antibody that has been engineered to lack effector function and complement binding. Pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and immunogenicity bioassays in support of this proposal are currently being developed by Selexys. Manufacture of drug substance to support the proposed preclinical studies and clinical trials is underway at Cytovance Biologics in Oklahoma City. Selexys is proposing to conduct aPK pilot dose ranging study in cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) to assess safety and PK of the anti-PSGL-1 antibody. The pilot study will guide dosing plans to conduct an IND enabling 4-week IV repeat dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkey. In Phase 2 of this application Selexys proposes to conduct a Phase I safety study in healthy volunteers leading to a Phase IIa safety and efficacy trial in Crohn&#039;s Disease patients. The primary goal of the proposed study is to characterize the antibody prior tocommencing a Phase IIb six months chronic dosing trial. The overarching goal of the program is to develop and commercialize a humanized antibody to PSGL- 1 to treat Crohn&#039;s Disease patients. In doing so Selexys will address an inflammatory bowel disease with major unmet medical needs with a therapy that may be safer than current approved biologic therapies and that has the potential to sustain remission and/or ameliorate the devastating effects of this disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposalsupports development of a fully human antibody to PSGL-1 to treat Crohn&#039;s Disease patients.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The availability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners is having a significant impact on public health, and greater availability of these units in the US and throughout the world is desired. A primary factor limiting availability is the existing superconductor magnet technology. Presently, commercial MRI magnets require liquid helium (LHe); however, the world&#039;s helium supply is decreasing and the price is increasing. As a result, MRI producers are pushing to develop MRI systems based on LHe-free magnesium diboride (MgB2) superconducting magnets. The goal of this project is to develop doped boron nanopowder made by a plasma synthesis process to be used for producing MgB2.  Phase I of this project was highly successful. The plasma synthesis process was scaled from a 10 gram laboratory method to a greater than 200 gram process that can produce the kilometer length wires needed for preliminary evaluation of MRI magnets. Wires made from carbon-doped boron nanopowder hadcritical current densities, Jc, of greater than 105 A/cm2 out to 8 tesla. These are the world&#039;s highest performing MgB2 superconductor wires reported to date. This significant improvement exceeded the goals of the program and makes 1.5 and 3 Tesla MRIs based on MgB2 magnets viable in the near-term (3-5 years).  The Phase II specific aims are 1) produce multiple kilogram quantities of doped boron nanopowder and use it to fabricate longer lengths of MgB2 wires; 2) scale up the plasma synthesis process for boron nanopowder by increasing the long-term stability and capacity of the plasma synthesis system; and 3) further develop and scale up a vapor-solid synthesis process to make MgB2 nano-sized powder. Specialty Materials, Inc. will complete the work necessaryto develop the plasma synthesis process to produce kilogram-sized batches of boron nanopowder that can be used to fabricate multi-kilometer wires needed for commercial MRI magnets. MgB2 nanopowder development will provide risk mitigation by providing raw material for both in situ and ex situ fabrication of MgB2 wires. This project will be carried out in close collaboration with wire fabricators and MRI end users so that the next generation of MRI scanners based on MgB2 superconducting magnets can be commercialized in a 3-5 year timeframe.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop boron nanopowder, the most critical raw material for the next generation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners based on magnesium diboride (MgB2) magnets. These new MRI scanners will be much less costly, more efficient, more portable, capable of diagnosing medical problems earlier and faster, and will be much more widely available throughout the country and world.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central challenge in biological research is to understand the organization and dynamics of the molecular machines underlying cellular function. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) of samples in liquid environments opens up the possibility of imaging molecular complexes in intact cels with nanometer resolution. Leveraging advances in micro-fluidics systems with electron-transparent windows and specific protein labels of nanoparticles, liquid STEM has the potential to offer much of the functionality of light microscopy with the high resolution of electron microscopy. The contrast mechanism in STEM permits the detection of nanoparticles with high atomic number (Z), such as gold, inside a several micrometer thick layer of low-Z material, such as water or cells. The use of fluorescent nanoparticles, such as quantum dots (QDs) that contain heavy atoms, allows liquid STEM images to be correlated efficiently with fluorescence images. The same technology platform canalso be used for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on thin cellular regions using modified microchips. In Phase I, we developed a prototype liquid STEM system, demonstrated the imaging of specifically labeled proteins on fixed whole cells in liquid with a spatial resolution of 4 nm, correlated fluorescence microscopy images with liquid STEM images, and recorded single-shot images of live yeast cells. In Phase II, we will develop and commercialize a liquid STEM system, refining both the STEM holder andthe microchips for use with biological specimens. We will also optimize the system for use with light microscopes to further enhance its correlative microscopy capabilities. In addition to the effort to improve system hardware and microchips, we will alsostudy the resolution of the liquid STEM technique within limits of radiation damage. The spatial resolution of liquid STEM depends on several factors. The electron dose is determined by the maximal allowed dose within the limit of radiation damage, and wewill determine the STEM resolution achievable on the biological structure of fixed COS7 cells, on live COS7 cells, and on live yeast cells. Finally, with a team of leading collaborators, we have planned a series of experiments to further demonstrate thatliquid STEM can be used to solve critical biological questions. We plan to utilize liquid STEM to examine the characteristic distribution of a representative lipid raft protein, cholera toxin B subunit (CTXB), across the cell surface. We will study cytokinesis in live yeast cells and, aiming to better understand the molecular mechanism of cytokinesis, we wil study the structural differences of a selection of mutants of live S. pombe yeast cells with liquid STEM. We will study the physical and chemical controls that organic matrices such as collagen and amelogenin play in directing the early stages of calcium phosphate nucleation in the context of both bone and tooth formation. Finally, we will, for the first time, characterize a wide variety of functionalized nanostructures intended for in vivo applications in their native environment and at atomic resolution.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Liquid STEM offers the potential to combine the ultra-high resolution of electron microscopy with much of the functionality of light microscopy. If successful, this proposal will develop and commercialize liquid STEM systems capable of imaging individual proteins in whole cells in water that can be used to study the functioning of cells. This novel microscopy technique will be significant for investigations of molecular processes in many fields of biomedical research, including cancer, virology, neuroscience, and cell biology.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This fast track grant titled,  Photon Counting Detectors for Clinical k-edge CT  will enable  DxRay to bring to market a customer-driven improved version of our CdTe-based photon-  counting x-ray computed tomography (CT) detector with energy discrimination. These detectors have enabled significant improvements in CT imaging such as reduced patient dose while maintaining excellent image quality, enhanced tissue contrast, and material decomposition capabilities (tissue type identification). The overall goal is to bring to the CT marketplace a photon-counting energy-dispersive x-ray detector with energy discrimination for use in human x-ray CT imaging. So far we have demonstrated a first generation fast photon-  counting x-ray imaging array which has a higher maximum output count rate (by more than an  order of magnitude) than all others, and the arrays have been used to generate the first patient  images to date. This first-generation system is capable of counting at over 5W 106 counts per  second per mm2 (cps/mm2) and has performed clinical scans at up to 300 mA of tube current,  demonstrating both reduced dose and improved image quality in neck and abdomen studies.  Our x-ray imaging arrays are completely vertically integrated and are compatible with all the existing gantries and x-ray tubes being used clinically.   With feedback from our customers we have determined that there are two more performance enhancements required from our detector for the full commercialization of our technology. In the first year we will produce a fully functioning prototype of the second- generation photon-counting CT detector and demonstrate its performance with all the features our customers require. In the second and third year of the projectwe will, with feedback from our customers, produce the first production runs of the final product, with sufficient numbers of detectors to provide samples to our customers for testing in their clinical systems. This will allow for patient studies to be performed in existing gantries.   We expect large commercial success with this product. This is due to the significant improvements to and advantages over existing detectors that our technology provides together with the widespread and increasing use of CT.The x-ray exposure in CT scanning has been of major concern for radiologists and physicists as the number of CT examinations has increased. Therefore, a method which reduces the patient dose in CT examinations will have a significant impact on public health. Our product addresses the need to reduce dose in CT. At the same time, improved tissue differentiation and material-specific identification is needed for better diagnosis. Our product addresses these needs by improving image quality by making use of theenergy information contained in the individually counted x-rays at high flux, information that is currently not obtainable with the non photon-counting x-ray imaging arrays currently in use in multi-slice CT systems.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a photon counting CT detector with energy  binning and read-out that is capable of producing energy resolved CT scan which can deliver  less radiation dose and differentiate between tissue types. Photon counting detectors with energy binning can improve CT performance by counting and binning each x-ray detected.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low cost high frequency (15, 20 and 25 MHz), and high resolution medical imaging linear array transducers will be designed and constructed for commercial sale under the direction and design of the NIH Resource Center for Ultrasonic Transducer Technology at the University of Southern California. A newly developed high performance ultrasonic scanner, the UltraVision, with the unique feature of having its high speed digital functions entirely within a large Field Programmable Gate Array chip, will be reprogrammed to accommodate the transducers. The UltraVision supports the very advanced features of elastography and optoacoustics and these modes will continue to be functional at these high frequencies. The system will initially be targeted to the morphological and functional imaging of cancer tumors in small animals. The animal studies will be under the direction of the Biomedical Engineering Department of the University of Texas at Austin where Associate Professor Stanislav Emelianov has already guided the UltraVision&#039;s design of optoacoustics and elastography. The initial aim is to provide researchers with an accessible tool for cancer research in small animals that will reduce the cost of the science and animal usage. Bringing the new modalities of functional imaging will also increase the specificity of cancer detection and staging. The long term goal is to develop an instrument that will be capable of supporting the emerging field of molecular specific imaging with antibodyconjugated nano particles. This new field of optoacoustic imaging of nano particles is very compelling due to their sensitivity, the ability to synthesize their optical spectral absorption, and their non-toxicity. The transducers will be constructed on a2-2 piezocomposite design known to the investigators Drs. Cannata and Shung and transferred to WinProbe where they will be set up for construction in volumes to be commercialized. The modification to the UltraVision will be largely performed in Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language, which is not a simple task but it is the only method of accommodating the needs of performing the functions at the required speeds and costs. The acoustic lines will be formed by interlacing and cross-correlation to achieve a very high resolution performance.  As the UltraVision Medical Ultrasound System is being commercialized for Breast cancer discrimination and the ageing of thrombi, its price savings from production volume will be shared into the research environment.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project develops high frequency transducers for a newly developed and uniquely designed medical ultrasonic scanner to image small anatomical structures and to display their functionality. Initiallytargeted for use in the research of cancer with small animals, its future is seen in the emerging field of functional imaging of the human sentinel lymph nodes with contrast of cancer attaching nano particles. The modifications to the system will be designed to preserve the scanners very low equipment cost.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hazard assessment, including evaluation of acute inhalation toxicity potential, is a mandatory international regulatory requirement for chemicals utilized in international commerce. Acute inhalation toxicity or irritation potential is an important consideration in establishing procedures for the safe handling, packaging and labeling and transport of chemicals and chemical mixtures, and in formulating responses to emergency exposure situations. Recently enacted legislation including the European Union (EU) Registration, Labeling and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) program, and the US EPA High production Volume (HPV) Chemical Challenge will dramatically increase the need for inhalation toxicity information. The goal of the present grant proposal is to validate the EpiAirway in vitro human airway model for prediction of in vivo human inhalation toxicity hazard potential following Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) and European Center for Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) guidelines. Phase I experiments produced several prediction models that will be further tested in the current Phase II project. One hundred chemicals that have available in vivo human or animal inhalation toxicity data and established immediately Dangerous to Life or health (IDLH) concentrations established by NIOSH will be utilized in the Phase II validation project. Interlaboratory transferability of the method will also be evaluated in 4 laboratories using a subset of 30 chemicals chosen from the original 100 tested during the Phase II study. The study data will then be submitted for independent statistical analysis and the final results and report will be submitted to regulatory agencies (i.e. ICCVAM) in support of regulatory acceptance. The technology to be validated in the current Phase II proposal will address a critical barrier to implementation of worldwide requirements for inhalation toxicity testing of chemicals, and a technical capacity thatis urgently needed but that does not presently exist.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of Phase II is to develop the world&#039;s first safe, inexpensive, and easy to operate lead detector for consumers that can reliably detect dangerous levels of lead in toys and other products. It will be based on ahigh sensitivity yet inexpensive X-ray fluorescence technology developed by RMD. The proposed program will result in a unique product that offers: (1) high sensitivity, to identify objects containing dangerous amounts of lead, (2) low cost to encourage widespread testing by consumers and other end users and (3) convenient operation requiring no training or licensing.  Lead and its compounds have been rated as top chemicals that pose a great threat to human health. Despite increasingly stringent governmentregulations, lead contaminated components continue to penetrate the supply chain and show up on retailer shelves. Furthermore, testing of second hand items, purchased in resale shops or handed down to younger children, is practically non-existent. The problem is not due to the accuracy or sensitivity of existing lead detection technology, but rather to the high expense, safety and licensing barriers of available test equipment.  We propose to use RMD&#039;s advanced solid-state detectors combined with recently patented lead detection techniques to develop a consumer oriented lead detector that will be widely available and easy and inexpensive to use. We propose a rental/lease model to keep costs low and encourage widespread testing by consumers at home and in schools and daycare centers.  The main impact of Phase II will be households that are safer for children because parents finally have an affordable way to identify potentially hazardous, lead-containing products. In Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility ofdesigning such a device. In Phase II we will perfect the technology, culminating in the fabrication of a highly functional prototype lead detection instrument.  RMD has the personnel, facilities and experience to develop a lead detector for consumer use.Though a small company, RMD now manufactures lead detectors for professionals that detect lead in paint and in solder. With the new sensors and measurement technologies detailed in the Phase II proposal, RMD believes it is now possible to overcome the difficulties associated with developing a lead detector for consumers based on a safe, low intensity, unlicensed source.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In spite of increasingly stringent regulatory limits for lead content in consumer products, toys and household products containing lead continue to find their way into the consumer household. The reason it is so hard to identify and eliminate items containing egregious amounts of lead is that current tests are very expensive to perform and require the involvement of a trained technician or a full service testing laboratory. We propose to develop an inexpensive, simple to operate instrument which can be made widely available to consumers to test items in their own homes. The public health impact is that convenient, widespread testing will remove lead contaminated items from use before children are exposed.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental or occupational exposure to a broad variety of chemical agents can alter normal endocrine function. The effects of these  endocrine disruptors  (ED) can have serious health implications including deleterious effects to reproductive capacity, fetal development, the immune system, and carcinogenesis. Current animal tests are expensive, use a large number of animals, and are not necessarily applicable to humans. Thus, a validated, human in vitro method to identify ED is an area of great importance. This research project will validate an organotypic EpiVaginal tissue model for Tier 1 screening of chemicals with endocrine disrupting potential.  Phase I research will validate MatTek&#039;s organotypic vaginal-ectocervical (EpiVaginalTM) tissue model for use in identifying ED. A battery of 75 model compounds with known ED activity will be selected from the revised ICCVAM list of recommended substances. The production of estrone by the tissue model and changes to tissue morphology and gene expression will be monitored as biomarkers of ED. A prediction model for ED with be finalized and the test method will undergo formal validation in a multi-center, GLP study. In addition, reproducibility of the assay method and adaptation of the method to a high throughput screen format will be investigated. If successful, the proposed method will have high impact in environmental chemical safety programs and ultimately will reduce the effect of these chemicals on human health.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Validation an in vitro organotypic tissue based assay to screen for endocrine disrupting potential is important to minimize hazards to humans and wildlife exposed to chemicals that interfere with normal hormonal regulation. The assaymethod will be adapted to a high throughput format to allow rapid and low- cost screening of chemicals.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time fromwithin a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator.  The ultimate goal of this SBIR project is to provide the DOD, DOE, and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. In Phase I, Seacoast successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a microsensor array with a proprietary trap-and- purge preconcentrator to detect chlorinated solvents, specifically TCE, and TCA, at levels low enough to meet EPA mandated levels for drinking water. In Phase II Seacoast proposes to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of the system to better meet the needs identified by the Phase I consultant. The systems have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor forleaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator traps the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. These sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectricpermittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical.  In Phase II Seacoast will specifically develop new materials to improve the sensor array selectivity, 1) by using impedance spectroscopy to study the mechanisms by which the polymer-based sensors sorb the target chemicals, 2) by implementing pattern recognition algorithms to identify chemicals for the sensor responses, and 3) by designing new preconcentrator materials that can bind these chemicals more strongly.  The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. Potential markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety. Transitioning the developed prototype to other markets where worker and public health, environmental health and regulatory compliance will be investigated to reduce the financial risksand broaden the acceptance of the technology.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal describes a novel technology that specifically addresses the need for detecting groundwater contaminants and long-term monitoring of contaminated sites, by providing an unattended sensor system that tracks contamination in real-time and transmits contaminant concentrations. Such a system would be used in tandem with other methods, to provide comprehensive contamination management at DOE, DOD, and Superfund sites where ground and water clean-up projects are already underway. The proposed work will focus on detection of chlorinated hydrocarbons, which are described as among the most common pollutants in groundwater and soils at DOE sites.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): AquaMost is developing a water treatment device based on a technology called photoelectrocatalytic oxidation (PECO). The focus for this project is using PECO systems to treat groundwater contaminated with organic pollutants released from leaking underground storage tanks. Two chemical classes are of particular concern: (1) aromatic hydrocarbons, particularly the BTEX chemicals benzene, ethyl benzene, toluene, and three isomers of xylene, and (2) fuel oxygenates, particularly methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). These chemicals are a significant risk to human health. Both chemical classes have acute and long-term toxic effects, and may be carcinogenic. For these reasons, considerable federal, state, and private resources are being expended to remove these chemicals from contaminated groundwater sites throughout the country. Several unique chemical characteristics of MTBE (e.g., high water solubility, high polarity, resistance to biodegradation) make it very difficult to remove from water using existing remediation technologies.  The specific objectives of the Phase II project are to: (1) conduct long-term (gt 6 months) field trials with commercial-scale PECO systems at several contaminated sites that differ with respect to contaminant levels, groundwater chemistry, etc. to obtain data on the long-term efficacy and performance of these systems, and (2) enhance the size and/or performance of the systems so that they can treat contaminated groundwater in a single pass at a flow rateof 5 to 10 gal/min (the current embodiment works at ~1 gal/min). Field tests will be performed at two primary sites and several secondary sites in conjunction with two environmental remediation companies that will serve as subcontractors on this project. These tests will help to answer several questions about the effectiveness of these PECO systems, including: (1) how will the technology perform under different field conditions? (2) What is the longevity and durability of the PECO unit electrodes under practical conditions? (3) How well does the technology enhance and complement current groundwater remediation technologies (e.g., activated carbon, air stripping, etc.)? (4) What are the operational and maintenance costs of using PECO to remediate contaminatedgroundwater? The PECO systems will be continually reengineered throughout these trials until an effective, robust, and economical commercial product is available for the market.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The fuel additive methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and other hazardous and carcinogenic petrochemicals (e.g., BTEX) can enter the nation&#039;s drinking water supply from leaking underground storage tanks, fuel spills, precipitation, and runoff. AquaMost has developed a device based on a technology called photoelectrocatalytic oxidation (PECO) and demonstrated in Phase 1 that it can efficiently and economically remove hazardous organic pollutants from water. The Phase 2 project will focus on conducting a series of field trials to evaluate the performance andreliability of a commercial PECO system engineered to remediate contaminated groundwater and alleviate the environmental health risks associated with these chemicals.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutation to DNA is a primary mechanism by which cancers arise. These events have also been implicated in diseases such as atherosclerosis, and processes such as aging. Therefore, there is an important need for sensitiveanalytical methods that facilitate the study of mutagenesis, as well as the identification of chemical or physical agents that can mutate DNA. Methods for measuring in vivo mutation currently exist, each with their own advantages and limitations. While some are based on colony formation and require tissue culture work, others rely on expensive, proprietary trangenic rodents. This laboratory has developed an in vivo mutation assay that is based on the Pig-a locus. The Pig-a gene product is essential for thebiosynthesis of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. Mutations giving rise to nonfunctional GPI anchors prevent certain proteins from being expressed on the cell surface, and this represents a phenotype that can be measured by flow cytometry. Thework proposed herein extends this line of investigation through an extensive inter-laboratory validation effort whereby rats will be treated with known mutagens and non-mutagens using both a short-term as well as a 28-day repeat dosing schedule. This assayvalidation effort will focus on an erythrocyte-based assay, a target cell population that has been studied most intensely to date. Concurrently, other work will be directed at developing means to measure Pig-a mutation in other tissues. Society will benefit from the proposed work as pharmaceutical and chemical companies are provided improved methods for conducting safety assessment work.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is well known that DNA damage is a precursor to the development of cancer and other significant diseases. Therefore, it is in the interest of public health to reduce the occurrence of mutagenic chemicals in the environment, in our drugs, and from our workplaces.

The MLA uses state-of-the-art microfabrication technology to create high density arrays of  micro- liver  tissue populated with primary human hepatocytes. Our unique microfluidic design mimics the liver micro-vasculature, providing a continuous perfusion environment and 3D cellular architecture proven to enhance liver specific functions. The MLA is designed to conform to standard SBS (Society for Biomolecular Sciences) standards, allowing operation by existing screening instrumentation and assays. Moreover, our proprietary manufacturing process and reduction in cell/reagent usage will significantly reduce the overall cost of in vitro hepatocyte toxicity screening.   In  order  to  commercialize  this  technology, it is  necessary to more fully validate the  long  term  biologic functions of human hepatocytes cultured in the MLA, and compare with the best current in vitro  and in vivo data. To facilitate this task, CellASIC has partnered with CellzDirect/Invitrogen Corporation, the global leader in hepatocyte related screening and research.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The kidney is a target of toxicity from drugs, and industrial and environmental chemicals because of its high blood flow, numerous transporters, and reliance on aerobic metabolism. Not surprisingly, mitochondria are acommon intracellular target of chemicals in multiple organs, leading to decreased aerobic metabolism and ATP, and cell death. Current in vitro models of nephrotoxicity and mitochondrial damage are inadequate for many of the same reasons: cultured cells arevery glycolytic with minimal aerobic metabolism, and there are no moderate or high-throughput real-time metabolomic assays. Consequently, new cellular models and metabolomic methodologies are needed to evaluate nephrotoxicity and mitochondrial damage. Wehave developed primary cultures of renal proximal tubular cells (RPTC) that exhibit in vivo levels of aerobic metabolism, are not glycolytic and retain higher levels of differentiated functions. We previously developed primary cultures of renal proximal tubular cells (RPTC) that exhibit in vivo levels of aerobic metabolism, are not glycolytic, and retain higher levels of differentiated functions. The goal of the Phase I proposal was to merge our novel and relevant RPTC model and the Seahorse technology to develop a high-throughput assay to accurately measure nephrotoxicity. In addition to completing the objectives described in the Phase I aims, we also developed a cheminformatic strategy in which chemical similarity is used to cluster molecules that are thenmodeled to define a potential  toxicophore  of similar physicochemical features in 3-dimesional space. These chemical entities/toxicophores that damage mitochondria are predicted to be nephrotoxicants. Our goals for Phase are to validate our integrated metabolic and imaging assay using the TOXNET and Toxcast land to use cheminformatic analyses to develop a toxicophore database. This RPTC/Seahorse platform will identify nephrotoxicants and mitochondrial toxicants and provide public companies and regulatoryagencies with mechanism and chemical-based criteria for assessing and predicting nephrotoxicity and mitochondrial toxicity of new drugs, consumer products, and environmental agents, and shorten the overall time to identify potential problem chemicals. Thecommercialization plan is to offer these screening and cheminformatic services to pharmaceutical and federal agencies.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The final results of the proposed research will be a quantitative high-throughput assay that can assessnew drugs, consumer products, and environmental agents for their potential to cause kidney damage in humans.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this Fast-Track application, PlastiPure (PPi) proposes to rapidly and completely develop for  commercialization an EA-Free baby bottle to address an important public health problem: ingestion by  infants of chemicalshaving estrogenic activity (EA) or anti-EA leaching from multiple components of baby  bottles, including the bottle, anticolic devices, nipple, sealing rings, etc. Many scientific studies have shown that chemicals having EA or anti-EA can have significantadverse health effects on many biological processes such as sperm number and function, prostate size, uterine and ovarian functions, time to puberty, obesity, learning abilities, and some types of cancers. These adverse health effects sometimes occur at very low (pM-nM) concentrations, especially on fetal or developing mammals (including humans).  Many scientific studies have also shown that bisphenol A (BPA) has EA and leaches from hard and clear  polycarbonate (PC) plastics at nM-lt M concentrations thathave adverse health effects on fetal or juvenile  mammals. PPi&#039;s studies show that almost all plastics, including BPA-free plastics and most components of all plastic baby bottles, release other chemicals having EA often at levels higher than PC plastics.PPi will use its unique and patented materials and manufacturing processes to produce baby  bottles whose component parts do not release any chemical having EA or anti-EA, i.e., are EA-Free even  when exposed to common-use stresses (UV light, microwaves, moist heat). In Phase I, PPi will confirm preliminary data that that it is feasible to develop EA-Free silicones to manufacture EA-Free nipples for baby bottles. In Phase II, PPi will confirm that it has EA-Free resins to make all other components of EA-Free baby bottles, including hard and clear resin substitutes for PC bottles, that meet or exceed fit-for-use  tests and remain EA-Free, both as new bottles and after repeated test cycles simulating extended use.  PPi&#039;s EA-Free baby bottles will be unique in the industry and provide significant health benefits to our most vulnerable populations: fetus, infants and juveniles. Because it has already developed most of the materials, PPi is uniquely positioned to begin work immediately and put advanced-technology, safer products on retail shelves within 21/2 years. As breakout products, EA-Free baby bottles will achieve rapid market penetration and raise consumer awareness about the safety of plastic products in general. The success of these baby bottles willallow PPi to introduce safer EA-Free plastics into a broad range of food packaging and consumer goods, greatly increasing overall consumer product safety.   Using PPi&#039;s unique and patented EA-Free plastic materials and processing methods to produce EA-Freebaby bottles directly and decisively fulfill NIEHS&#039; (and PPi&#039;s) mission to  reduce the burden of human illness and disability.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PlastiPure (PPi) is addressing a public health problem [release of chemicals having  estrogenicor anti-estrogenic activity (EA or anti-EA) ingested by infants using plastic  baby bottles] by using its unique and patented materials and methods to produce baby  bottles that do not release chemicals having EA or anti-EA. Chemicals having EA or anti-EA, even at very low dosages on fetal mammals, can have significant adverse effects on  many behavioral and physiological processes such as sperm counts, uterine and ovarian  functions, aggressive behaviors, and some types of cancers. EA-Free baby bottlesdecisively fulfill PPi&#039;s and NIEHS&#039; mission of  reducing the burden of human illness and disability .",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this Phase II project, Intelligent Optical Systems, Inc. (IOS) will prototype a cost-effective handheld chemical detection device that will enable first responders to rapidly and accurately identify multiple contaminants, measure their concentration, and define site boundaries. IOS&#039;s innovative multi-element optical sensor array (MOSA) device will incorporate a disposable optical chip bearing 14 chemically sensitive waveguides, and an optoelectronics and signal processing unit similar in size to a personal digital assistant. With waveguide widths on the order of 100 microns, the chip&#039;s high packing density will allow multiple chemical substances to be detected simultaneously with very low false alarm rates. Each waveguide channel will be fabricated of high-quality chemically permeable optical polymer containing a chemical indicator (sensor dye) designed to undergo a large and rapid optical change (e.g., optical absorbance shift, or fluorescence quenching) in the presence of a target analyte. The handheld unit will use an advanced system of semiconductor light sources and detectors to monitor changes in the light guided through the sensors. Although each waveguide channel will be designed to respond to a single substanceor class of chemicals, false alarms resulting from cross response will be resolved by two distinctive approaches: First, the use of a secondary cladding that contains scrubbing agents against potential cross contaminants; second, sophisticated signal processing that combines the optical intensity at all wavelengths from all waveguide channels (28 signals) to unambiguously detect each analyte of interest. In the final product, disposable chips with different  panels  of indicator waveguides will be designedfor different applications; this will allow the universal handheld MOSA instrument to be used in virtually any chemical detection application, from occupational toxin monitoring to chemical release  first response.  In addition to demonstrating a prototypeMOSA reader, this Phase II project will show how an electronically controlled micro-dispenser can be used to produce multi-waveguide optical chips that are highly reproducible, reliable, and inexpensive. These chips will have a long shelf life when packaged, thus allowing them to be disposable and stored in quantity. MOSA readout units and sensor chips will be easily affordable by industry, compliance monitoring agencies, fire departments, and hazmat response teams. Detailed cost analysis for the final Phase II and Phase III prototype is provided in the commercialization plan.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Public health will benefit from the multichannel optical sensor array (MOSA) in several ways. First, by identifying toxic substances and measuring their level, MOSA can be used in industrial environments to warn of incipient problems. MOSA can also guide first responders to the correct emergency response, including selection of required protective gear, can provide data that will help to determine the correct treatment for exposed individuals, and can aid in the process and verification of decontamination.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Replacement of the Draize rabbit eye test for ocular irritancy testing remains an elusive goal. Many believe a corneal full thickness (CFT) model is necessary to completely model the interaction of exogenous chemicals with human cornea. During Phase 1, human corneal epithelial, stromal, and endothelial cells were isolated from native tissue, expanded in monolayer culture, and cryopreserved. Culture conditions were identified to produce highly differentiated 2-layer (corneal epithelium and keratocyte-containing stroma) and 3- layer (epithelium, stroma, and endothelium) CFT tissues. The CFT tissues exhibited improvements over epithelial tissues in terms of barrier and differentiated phenotype. An assay and prediction model(PM) was developed which allowed the CFT tissue to distinguish between irritants and non-irritants with 100% accuracy. Other functional studies showed that the CFT tissue appears suitable to evaluate time to recovery (TTR) and depth of injury (DOI) following chemical injury. Finally, an analysis of CFT tissue production showed that the economics of CFT are favorable. Phase II will expand upon the Phase 1 result to further develop the CFT tissue model. Initial goals will focus on preparing the CFT tissue model for commercial production - cell stocks will be expanded to insure a stable cell supply and quality control parameters will be developed. The database of materials tested using the CFT will be expanded, the PM for irritant/non-irritant classification will be finalized, and inter-laboratory transferability of the assay will be demonstrated. Finally, the CFT tissues will be used for TTR and DOI measurements and an assay and prediction model for replacement of the Draize test will be developed. Due to theseenhanced capabilities, the CFT will provide toxicologists and scientists with a tool that will dramatically decrease, if not entirely eliminate, the need for animal testing to determine ocular irritancy.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Safety assessment of all new chemicals and products requires evaluation of potential ocular irritancy in case of intentional or unintentional exposure to the eye. Current animal-based test methods are suboptimal because of animal welfare concerns and in vitro methods lack the complexity required to completely model in vivo responses. We will develop a corneal full thickness tissue and in vitro test methods that will dramatically reduce or eliminate the need to use animals to assess ocular irritancy of chemicals and products.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed SBIR program is to develop the powerful Laser Scanning Digital Camera Stimulator (LSDC-S), for fundus imaging and accurate retinal localization during visual function assessment. Low vision, due to retinal disease and other visual pathway damage, is on the increase worldwide. Retinal disease often goes undetected until vision is lost, and rehabilitation with vision aids is more difficult and less successful with increasing vision loss. Localizing the retinal damage, when present, and determining the functional vision of patients, may help optimize the selection of vision aids. Although the stability of gaze affects case management, instrumentation to determine this accurately and in comparison to retinal damage is not widely used. Fixation stability and defects in central vision will be mapped, e.g. in age-related macular degeneration and macular edema. Peripheral vision will be mapped in diseases such as glaucoma. Aeon&#039;s goal is to help provide cost effective eye care by putting instrumentation into the hands of clinicians and researchers that provides detection of pathology that will improve success with aids. The LSDC uses dim, safe near infrared light, an ideal background for viewing andretinal tracking. Aeon will build on the Phase I LSDC imager that uses a novel, hybrid confocal system with a scanning slit for illumination and a two dimensional solid state array for detection. In Phase II, Aeon will 1) Build the Laser Scanning DigitalCamera Stimulator (LSDC-S) so that visual stimuli are presented simultaneously with retinal imaging, and with real-time recording of patient response, 2) Optimize the LSDC-S design for wide and magnified field of view for imaging and display matched to thetask, 3) Provide new methods to assess fixation and target detection in low vision patients, 4) Perform a design review for commercialization. Underlying the high contrast images is a novel, patented core technology and robust architecture. Applications include early detection of choroidal neovascularization, detection of cystoid macular edema, investigating macular sparing, mapping the Preferred Retinal Locus, mapping the peripheral field of view accurately for medical/legal decisions, improved rehabilitation with prisms and magnifiers, and providing sharable digital retinal images. In this Phase II proposal, Aeon will provide significant, novel functionality in two models of their LSDC-S, which perform vision assessment during accurate retinal localization. The LSDC-S will help low vision practitioners determine where a patient is looking and whether gaze is steady, along with mapping out vision defects and assessing visual acuity in age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, macular edema, and other eyeand systemic conditions. The research LSDC-S is aimed at clinician scientists/vision researchers, with both models featuring retinal imaging is comfortable for patients and provides high contrast retinal images for their care providers.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aeon Imaging, LLC, will help provide cost effective eye care by developing a new product, the Laser Scanning Digital Camera Stimulator (LSDC-S), to perform vision assessment with a simultaneous and high contrast retinal image. The LSDC-S willprovide the low vision specialist or researcher a uniquely wide selection of fields of view, allowing for the macula or the visual periphery to be assessed with high precision. The retinal localization of visual targets is provided by comfortable and non-mydriatic imaging using near infrared light and helps the clinician or researcher detect retinal pathology to provide more optimal patient management.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The objective of this proposal is to finalize development of CLT-005, a novel small molecule inhibitor of Stat3, through the performance of studies required for the submission of an investigative new drug application with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Activation of the Stat3 pathway in retinal inflammatory and angiogenic diseases has been observed in both clinical and basic science studies. We have demonstrated that CLT-005 prevents Stat3-induced cellular changes in an animal model of diabetes. Following intravitreal administration, CLT-005 reduces retinal vascular permeability, and the expression of numerous angiogenic and inflammatory genes and proteins. Additionally, both CLT-005 and the PEG-based depot-forming formulation were well tolerated following intravitreal injection, had no effect on visual physiology, and produced a favorable in-vitro safety profile. The goal of this proposal is to: 1) Produce GMP amounts of CLT-005 sufficient for toxicity studies and human clinical trials; 2) Perform formulation of CLT-005 into sterile fill vials and conduct stability studies; 3) Complete preparation of the CMC section for the IND application; 4) Perform pharmacokinetic studies of formulated and unformulated CLT-005; 5) Perform ocular distribution studies of formulated CLT-005; 5) Conduct single and multiple dose GLP toxicology and toxicokinetic studies; 6) Perform genetic toxicology studies; and 7) Perform in-vitro cardiac safety pharmacology studies. These studies are mandated by the FDA in order to receive approval for the initiation of human clinical trials. For ocular drug development, the FDA also requires that toxicology studies be performed in two large eye animal models, such as monkeys and rabbits, which will be utilized for completion of the experiments outlined above. As CLT-005 has a profound effect on reducing retinal vascular leakage we intend to seek an indication for treating Diabetic Macular Edema, a disease that currently has no FDA-approved pharmaceutical therapy. We believe that CLT- 005 will also be efficacious in patients suffering from Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). Following the successful completion of Phase II human clinical studies of CLT-005, we intend to file new IND applications to investigate the use of CLT-005 in treating AMD and DR. CLT-005 could also prove to be an effective combinatorial therapy with existing anti-VEGF treatments to reduce the frequency of clinical dosing.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Retinal vascular leakage, inflammation, or breakdown of the blood-retina barrier are pathogenic features of Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) and cause a subsequent loss of vision. Currently, there are no FDA-approved drug treatments for DME.In this Phase II project, we will finalize studies of CLT-005, a novel small molecule therapeutic, to enable the submission of an investigative new drug application to the FDA. These studies include preparation of sterile materials and formulations, performance of pharmacokinetic studies, and performance of rigorous toxicology/safety studies that are mandated by the FDA and essential for human clinical trials. Although we intend to seek an initial indication for DME, it is likely that CLT-005 will also confer a significant therapeutic benefit to patients suffering from Diabetic Retinopathy and Age-Related Macular Degeneration.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acquiring diagnostic images of the retina in children is necessary to the prevention and treatment of pediatric eye disease, but it is often difficult due to the large range of eye shapes and sizes from preemies to older children and the inability of most children within this range to fixate. Fundus photography only provides a two- dimensional surface picture of the retina, potentially missing information about the disease state. In this Phase II Small Business Innovation Research application, Bioptigen, Inc. proposes to commercialize a handheld spectral domain optical coherence tomography imaging system targeted to meet the specific needs of pediatric patient populations, with additional applications in perioperative imaging and pre-clinical imaging. This Pediatric and Perioperative Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography system (PP-SDOCT) is designed for maximal ease-of use with a non-cooperative patient base with a broad range of physical eye parameters and diseasestates. The aims of the proposal are to: enable rapid image acquisition through cornea range-finding for coarse alignment, range tracking for fine alignment, smooth focus adjustment for + 12D correction without affecting alignment, and improved footpedalcontrol for hands-free image acquisition; capture wide-field of view, high- speed, and high-resolution structural and functional retinal images; and clinically validate the new product in preparation for an FDA 510(k) submission. The PP-SDOCT system will be designed with wide field of view optics (80 degrees), high axial resolution (3.2 um), high lateral resolution (6 um), a deep imaging window (3.2 mm), and high-speed acquisition (34 frames per second acquisition, processing, and display). The FDA requiresclinical data to support 510(k) clearance of a Class II device. To that end, we have arranged collaborations with leading clinicians at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, Boston Children&#039;s Hospital, Los Angeles Children&#039;s Hospital, Duke University Eye Center, and the Medical College of Wisconsin to acquire images on neonates through pre-adolescents, including normals, and patients suffering from or suspected of suffering from ROP or plus disease, retinal degenerative disease, or pediatric glaucoma. Imaging willbe in the NICU, exam-under anesthesia, and on awake children. Our expectation is to exit the Phase II program with a fully developed, multi-modality, portable handheld imaging system that offers a new standard of care for a deserving, and often underserved, population.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acquiring diagnostic images of the retina in children is necessary to the prevention and treatment of pediatric eye disease, but it is often difficult due to the large range of eye shapes and sizes from preemies to older children and the inability of most children within this range to focus on an imaging target during the test. Current imaging methods only provide a two-dimensional surface picture of the retina, potentially missing information about the diseasestate. Bioptigen is proposing the development of a handheld medical device, the Pediatric and Perioperative Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (PP-SDOCT) imaging system, which will enable photographers to rapidly acquire both depth slices and blood flow information non-invasively in pediatric eyes and could greatly aid in the research and treatment outcomes of pediatric eye disease.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     In the past decade, a number of new and effective therapies have been developed for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Such therapies are only effective if administered prior to irreversible retinal damagewhich can occur if diabetics who are at high risk for developing the more advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy fail to get even the annual eye exams recommended by AAO, ADA and AMA.. Vital Art and Science Incorporated (VAS) was founded by a multi-disciplinary group of researchers and business people to specifically address this problem by creating a low cost and easy to use diagnostic tool which enables the patient to conveniently monitor their own DR progression at home and seek medical intervention atthe earliest signs of visual loss. The VAS goals are to clinically validate and then commercialize a sub- 100 home vision function monitor that healthcare providers could prescribe to their diabetic patients for much more frequent screening to help detectcritical changes in the retina so they can be examined and treated at the earliest possible time to maximize the effectiveness of therapeutic intervention and minimize preventable loss of vision. This project is a continuation of our Phase I where a firstgeneration vision function test was developed and successfully tested in a 40 DR/DME patient, 6 month Study verifying that patients could and would effectively use our home vision monitor. This Phase II project is to enable VAS to further enhance the product based upon our Phase I Study feedback, perform a second usability test at the Cleveland Eye Clinic, and collaborate with a major pharmaceutical company to validate clinical sensitivity and specificity in an 80 DR/DME patient, 12 month Study. Successfulcompletion of this Phase II project will directly lead to commercialization of the product for use in ophthalmic drug trials enabling pharmaceutical companies to collect significantly more data on new retinal compounds at a much lower cost than is currently possible. Such close collaboration with pharmaceutical companies is a crucial next step in the realization of our objective to provide a validated home based diagnostic for physicians to prescribe to their diabetic patients for monitoring and early detection of significant vision changes to maximize the effectiveness of therapeutic intervention and minimize preventable loss of vision.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Over 5 million people in the US today suffer from diabetic retinopathy. A large numberof these patients are at high risk for vision loss, even though effective treatments exist, because they fail to receive timely eye exams, and subsequently, do not get medical treatment when it is most effective. This SBIR project seeks to develop a low-cost home vision function monitor which allows physicians to more frequently monitor their diabetic patients by enabling patients to perform their own vision test at home to identify significant vision changes and to get treatment when it can be most effective to prevent vision loss.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dry eye is one of the most frequently diagnosed ocular diseases affecting more than 5 million people in the United States alone. Dry eye is s a multi-factorial disease, resulting from a common etiology of insufficient tear film causing ocular surface damage and symptoms of ocular discomfort. The few current therapies available, which include immunosuppressive agents and over-the-counter tear replacements, are not sufficiently efficacious for many users or only provide transient relief from dry eye symptoms. Therefore, the development of novel agents to treat dry eye would be of tremendous benefit to the therapeutic milieu. The volume of tear film on the ocular surface represents a balance between tear fluid output versusfluid loss via drainage, evaporation, or epithelial absorption. Similar to other epithelial tissues, the epithelium of the conjunctiva and cornea are capable of regulating the hydration status of the mucosal surface through active salt and water transport.The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is a key regulator of sodium (and water) absorption in numerous tissues including the eye. The inhibition of ENaC in the eye is predicted to preserve lacrimal secretions and maintain hydration on the ocular surface. Parion Sciences has developed a novel series of compounds that specifically and potently inhibit ENaC, which are predicted to be good candidate molecules for clinical development for the treatment of dry eye. In a series of pre-clinical studies, Parion has selected a lead compound (P-301) for development as a new therapeutic agent for dry eye. In dry eye animal models, P-301 significantly increases tear output with a long (gt4 hour duration of action) and treats the corneal surface damage associated with dryeye. In preliminary non-clinical safety studies, P-301 has been well tolerated at high concentrations. Additionally, P- 301 is an ideal candidate for ophthalmic formulations as it is highly soluble and stable in solution. Parion is continuing the development of P-301 in IND-enabling studies towards clinical testing in man.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) or chronic dry eye disease (DED) is one of the most frequently diagnosed ocular diseases, resulting in painful irritation,inflammation on the ocular surface, and impaired vision. KCS/DED results from inadequate aqueous tear fluid on the eyes. Parion Sciences is developing a novel therapeutic agent that is predicted to provide long acting relief from dry eye symptoms.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Convergence disorders and refractive amblyopia are among the most common and treatable vision problems seen in general optometric clinical practice. Oce- and home-based vision therapy (OBVT and HBVT, respectively) are standard treatments for such disorders. Recent advances in computerized video therapies that emulate vision therapy exercises performed in the optometrist&#039;s oce provide a lower-cost and more convenient alternative to OBVT. The downside of current commercialHBVT systems is that the recommended eye exercises are highly repetitive, monotonous, and uninteresting, which leads to high levels of patient noncompliance. This presents a problem since consistent performance and proper technique are key to achieving therapeutic benet.  An alternative approach, which oers strong potential to increase the success of HBVT, is to incorporate vision therapy into fun and interactive computer games that patients will nd more engaging. To address this need, Barron Associates proposes to develop a novel computerized virtual reality HBVT system called iCare that will overcome the limitations of present systems by addressing three obstacles to successful home treatment: (1) patient compliance; (2) procedural accuracy; and (3) the ability of the optometrist to monitor training.  The proposed approach takes advantage of advanced human-interface devices (HIDs) (e.g., Wii Remote Controllers) that have been developed for the video gaming market. Due to the popularity of video gaming, HIDtechnology that would have been prohibitively expensive in the recent past is now widely available at low cost (e.g., lt   40). These o-the-shelf HIDs permit the creation of virtual three-dimensional (3-D) environments on computer monitors (for  near-point  vision therapy) or plasma displays (for  distance  vision therapy). Traditional 3-D graphics technology based on  3-D glasses  (i.e., red-blue anaglyphs) is static with respect to the frame of the viewing device; that is, the image is the same regardless of the viewer&#039;s position relative to the monitor. The proposed iCare technology exploits motion parallax via low-cost tracking of the patient&#039;s head position and orientation, creating a dynamic visual 3-D environment. Visually, the technology allows theviewer to perceive objects as if they are coming o of, or receding into, the screen. This enables the creation of virtual xation objects in a nearly innite 3-D space. Users can even see  behind  and manipulate virtual objects.  Under this SBIR Fast Track grant application, the proposing Team will develop and test prototype computer gaming environments for HBVT using the technology outlined above to improve treatment eectiveness. Phase I therapy will be aimed at treating refractive amblyopia in children 8-12years of age; Phase II will focus on treating refractive amblyopia in teens and adults, as well as convergence insuciency in both populations. These disorders are clearly amenable to vision therapy and are common in clinical practice. For both vision problems, clinical studies of the comparative eectiveness of the most popular computerized HBVT programs vs. the iCare system&#039;s games will be conducted in children to assess the ecacy of the iCare system.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Convergence insuciencyis one of the most common binocular vision disorders, and refractive amblyopia a vision disorder for which a very-high percentage of patients seek treatment; both disorders aect millions of U.S. children and adults. Such vision anomalies can cause a variety of chronic symptoms which, left untreated, often degrade academic and work performance; they may even result in learning disabilities in some cases. Computerized home-based vision therapy (HBVT) provides a relatively low-cost and convenient treatment option; however, the available commercial HBVT programs are highly repetitive and dull, leading to poor compliance. The goal of this research is to make HBVT a more eective alternative to oce-based vision therapy by incorporating the eye exercises into fun, interesting, and interactive computer video games that patients will nd more engaging, which should lead to better compliance and improved therapeutic outcomes.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compact Membrane Systems (CMS) proposes to develop a perfluoro membrane reactor technology that will provide a generally applicable tool for removing water and oxygen from pharmaceutical synthesis processes. This innovation aims to improve product quality and reduce manufacturing costs of pharmaceutical end products. Manufacturing cost reductions will be derived from improved product yields, increased reaction rates and reduced energy input requirements of the manufacturing process. Product quality improvements will be derived from the elimination of entrainers, azeotropic distillation, and drying reagents in the process as well as operation at lower temperatures and driving the reactant. The project has been expanded toinclude the removal of both oxygen and water in an effort to reduce side reactions and/or catalyst poisoning which should be of broad use in pharmaceutical synthesis. This membrane system has the capability to withstand process temperatures of 2200C endowing it with universal applicability in almost any organic-water environment for water separation in the synthesis of products such as sildenafil, celecoxib, sertraline, and aprepitant. Given the large water-organic compound separation factors achievable, the inertness of the membrane, and the ability to withstand harsh operating conditions, we believe we have an ideal system for reaction water and oxygen removal. The proposer will develop the membrane system and processes while the subcontractors will demonstrate Pd-catalyzed amination reactions. These reactions have revolutionized drug discovery and process chemistry in the past decade. The efficiency of Pd-catalyzed amination reactions can be negatively affected by impurities such as water. The Fox group atthe University of Delaware and recently hired synthesis chemists at CMS (and consultants) will demonstrate the efficacy of the membrane process in Pd-catalyzed amination reactions in a study that will consist of: synthesis of the aryl bromide intermediatefrom the Astra Zeneca AR-A2 process; synthesis of the Pd-catalyzed amination product from the AR-A2 process; development of GC assays for the reactions; study of a control reaction without water/oxygen removal; and, study of amination with drying of the aryl bromide intermediate using the proprietary membrane. With success in Phase I, numerous industrial partners have either already spent over  150,000 on evaluation or committed to major evaluations in Phase II.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Compact Membrane Systems proposes to develop a process technology that will provide a generally applicable tool for removing water and oxygen from pharmaceutical synthesis of products. This will improve product quality and reduce manufacturing costs of pharmaceuticalend products.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plasmid-directed gene expression is now near the efficacy barrier that to date has prevented commercialization of plasmid-based therapies for human health applications. Previous innovations such as electroporation (EP)increased transgene expression through more effective gene delivery. In Phase I we developed potent minimalized antibiotic-free expression vectors, and demonstrated dramatic improvements in transgene expression may be obtained through vector design innovations. Two platform technologies were developed.    Novel compositions that prevent vector-backbone mediated transgene silencing from  plasmid vectors (Anti-Silencing Elements: ASE platform)    Novel vector backbone functionalities that improve transgene expression from plasmid  vectors after transient transfection (transient expression enhancers: TEE platform) In Phase II we hypothesize that combining ASE and TEE vectors with state of the art plasmid delivery will create enabling vector-delivery platforms for gene therapy. In Specific Aims 1 and 2 optimal ASE/TEE antibiotic-free vector - EP delivery platforms for skeletal muscle and cutaneous gene therapy, respectively, are identified. In Specific Aim 3 the cutaneous gene therapy platform is applied to create a hypoxia-inducible factor 11 (HIF-11) based gene medicine for diabetic foot ulcer treatment. In Specific Aim 4 a dermatological gene therapy to treat skin aging is developed using a keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) vector- microdermabrasion delivery combination. Specific Aims 3 and 4 are performed in collaboration with wound healing gene therapy expert Dr. John Harmon at Johns Hopkins University and dermatology gene therapy expert Dr Aaron Tabor at Gene Facelift, LLC. The vector-delivery platforms developed herein will further improve gene expression to levels that will enable gene medicine licensure for multiple applications for unmet public health needs. In Phase III the gene therapies for diabetic foot ulcers and skin cosmetics will undergo clinical development.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of this proposal is to validate a novel antibiotic-free non-viral gene therapy platform, and as such is responsive to NIGMS SBIR high-priority area of interest in development of improved vectors forgene transfer. The vectors contain transient expression enhancers that improve transgene expression level and duration after gene delivery to skin or muscle. The platform will be applied to create gene therapy products to treat diabetic neuropathic foot ulcers and skin aging.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Regenerative medicine, particularly using autologous adult stem cells, is a rapidly expanding and maturing field with the promise to address diseases in multiple organ systems. Marrow derived stem cells are already in extensive clinical and commercial use in bone marrow transplantation and the orthopedic space. But the clinical potential for regenerative therapies in several huge clinical areas -- CHF, myocardial infarction, and especially critical limb ischemia -- is poised to take off, with unusually compelling clinical data and a growing tailwind. Other expansive markets -- diabetes, stroke and many other major disease states - have promising early findings. There are literally hundreds of planned and ongoing clinicaltrials involving bone marrow derived stem cells. Many clinical indications, and present and future trials will require a rich and reliable source of the patients own marrow-derived stem and progenitor cells.  RegenMed&#039;s Place in the System: Every regenerative medicine product system requires a triad of stem cell collection/harvesting, separation, and delivery. Most of the research and investment dollars to date have been spent on stem cell separation and especially delivery. In that light, our Marrow Harvesting System swims upstream from others in this exciting space. This presents immense opportunity for collaboration and joint commercialization with many trials. We have been approached often for this purpose in recent months.  Our Product-Past, Present, and Future: Unfortunately, the current 40-year-old harvesting technique (utilizing serial small volume needle extractions) is painful, low-volume, and often requires general anesthesia. RegenMed Systems owns an exclusive license from Stanford University forthe core patents around a novel marrow harvesting system designed to obtain significant volumes of rich bone marrow in a minimally invasive manner (one stick under local anesthesia), by using a powered flexible shaft specifically designed to move through the confines of the pelvis. Our core team (Daniel Kraft, Vartan Ghazarossian, and Mike Crocker) obtained a Phase-I SBIR in 2008 with a score of 139. Our core team met and exceeded all our stated objectives, eventually obtaining a 510k and CE mark and bringing the technology into human trials where it showed superior marrow harvesting with surprisingly robust stem-cell yield. We have added two new exciting team members/leaders with deep experience in developing and commercializing medical devices.  RegenMed Systems seeks a Phase-II SBIR to build the next generation product. Specifically, we want to improve the handle (function and features) and improve the flexible shaft. We want to apply lessons learned from the Phase-I, Generation-I device, to bring our marrow harvesting system to scale and into incorporation as the harvesting component of multiple organ-specific clinical trials and regenerative medicine systems (either our own or in cooperation with other stem cell delivery companies) treating tens of millions of patients annually. See TED Video: ://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_kraft_invents_a_better_way_to_harvest_bone_marrow.html        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Phase-II SBIR will allow RegenMed Systems to perfect a marrow harvesting system that will revolutionize the way pelvic bone marrow is collected. Less pain. Less Anesthesia. Instead of dozens, more life-giving cells with one stick. This is particularly important as pelvic marrow is the biggest and richest source of adult stem cells and progenitor cellsin the body. Hundreds of new studies suggest that these special marrow derived cells can potentially re-energize a number of organs, offering new hope to low-hope or no-hope diseases such as advanced CHF (congestive heart failure) or critical limb ischemia - with new treatments for diabetes, heart attack, bone healing, and even stroke potentially around the corner. The commercial version of our Generation-II Marrow Harvesting System, with the improved handle and flexshaft, will allow us to energize the entire field of autologous (using your own cells) stem-cell research as we synergistically provide better marrow for leading clinical studies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein kinases are essential enzymes that function primarily as components of signaling pathways, regulating cellular responses such as division, growth, differentiation, and death. Abnormalities in these signaling pathways can lead to wide- ranging and devastating pathological conditions. For these reasons, protein kinases are important targets for drug development as evidenced by the ~20 kinase inhibitor therapeutics that have been FDA approved or are in late-stage development. Unfortunately, functional analyses of protein kinases are often complicated by poor solubility. Although several approaches have been developed for improving recombinant protein solubility, many kinases remain recalcitrant to these solubilization techniques. Therefore, there is a need for novel kinase-specific solutions for the improvement of solubility. This project is for the development of a novel solubilization approach based on the translational-fusion of protein kinases to highly flexible,non-aggregating polypeptide chains, known as entropic bristles (EBs). The bristles are unique synthetic sequences that have been optimized to improve protein kinase solubility. The Phase I extension period of this project successfully demonstrated that a prototype AquoKin  expression vector facilitated the soluble expression of eight out of eight protein kinases. Moreover, the EBs did not adversely affect the catalytic activity of the kinase toward a substrate. During Phase II of this project, we will develop, optimize, and validate commercial products and applications that are based on the EB-based kinase solubility-enhancing vectors, brand named AquoKin . The potential benefit of this project to the scientific research community and society as a whole is substantial. Kinases are not only vital to maintenance of normal cellular function, but are also pervasively involved with human pathologies and disease. The AquoKin  line of products will make more protein kinases accessible for research applications and do so in the most cost-effective expression system. From a human health standpoint, this project has the potential to facilitate drug discovery efforts that target protein kinases. Moreover, the anticipated AquoKin  products will aid basic research effortson protein kinases from multiple organisms by lowering research costs.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein kinases are important enzymes that regulate cell signaling. Dysregulateion of kinases is often causal for a myriad of pathological conditions andare important drug targets. The purpose of this project is to develop a set of vectors that facilitate the soluble expression of active kinases recalcitrant to other solubilization technologies thereby aiding kinase research efforts.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current pharmaceutical manufacturing technologies and processes are highly regulated and based on decades of experience. The techniques start in a lab, are continued in a pilot campaign, and finally graduate to full-scale manufacturing. To improve drug quality and manufacturing, in 2001, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiated Quality by Design (QbD) and Process Analytical Technology (PAT) Guidance for the pharmaceutical industry. This project will provide the ability to comply with that guidance and continuously monitor pharmaceutical quality during manufacturing.  Crystallization of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) involves achieving a specific crystalline phase, for which there can also be multiple polymorphic forms, a critical factor for drug effectiveness. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) is the &#039;gold standard&#039; analytical tool to determine API crystalline phase composition and polymorphic form. Unfortunately, PXRD is not currently used online real-timebecause of the configuration requirements for conventional PXRD. It is currently applied offline in the laboratory because of constraining sample presentation requirements and the system size, complexity, and operator-skill requirements of conventional PXRD systems. Recent developments at X-Ray Optical Systems (XOS) of collimating optics and detector systems provide an opportunity to overcome these problems and enable a wide range of online PXRD applications.  The objective of the proposed project is development of a reliable, easy-to-use, compact, and safe PXRD system for continuous monitoring of crystalline characteristics of API real-time during drug development and manufacture. This will improve process control and, therefore, assurance of product quality by directly measuring the pharmaceutical critical quality attributes rather than reliance on monitoring process conditions supported by relatively infrequent sampling. The project focuses on online measurements during the API crystallization phase. Thiswill be done with pharmaceutical industry collaborators at Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS). Feasibility for such measurements has been demonstrated on the benchtop during Phase I studies. It will be demonstrated online at a BMS pharmaceutical research and manufacturing facility in Phase II. Phase II will include all of the necessary instrument development steps required to design, assemble, and test the prototype. This includes sample presentation, the fixed detector approach, and integrating the analyzer with an existing reactor at BMS.  XOS has extensive experience with online optic-enabled XRD and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) applications. The proposed project is a match with the NIH Research Objectives for the Manufacturing Processes of Medical, Dental, and Biological Technologies topic as a systems-level technology. Improved drug quality, improved public health, reduced manufacturing costs, and reduced health-care costs are the ultimate goals.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed analyzer will increase control over the quality of pharmaceuticals by providing the ability to measure the actual drug crystalline/molecular form during the process for the first time, compared to current practice of just monitoring the manufacturing parameters. The analyzer willbe compact, inexpensive, and able to be set up and operated by operators and technicians. The ability to measure crystallinity in the drug directly online during development, pilot scale up, and full-scale manufacturing will impact public health by improving the consistency of pharmaceutical quality, reducing time to market by faster manufacturing ramp up, reducing manufacturing costs by increased process control, and improving manufacturing compliance through application of the FDA&#039;s Process Analytical Technology (PAT) drug certification guidelines.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently 30 million Americans with elevated cholesterol receive statin therapy, making statins the most prescribed drug class in the U.S. Statin Induction and Neuro-Myopathy (SINM), the balance of potency and safety, is the main clinical management challenge of these drugs, particularly when treatment targets are aggressive requiring LDL cholesterol levels below 100 mg/dl. In medical practice, Neuro-Myopathy presents as a constellation of neuromuscular side effects, including myalgia (muscle aches, cramps, weakness) and myopathy (muscular injury monitored by serum creatine kinase (CK) elevation). Neuro-myopathy is more frequent at the higher doses required for treating advanced cardiovascular disease and varies in extentbetween individual statins and from patient to patient. Statin usage is ultimately limited by toxicity. Clearly there is an urgent need to simultaneously avert side effects and optimize lipid lowering at the outset of treatment to bolster success in lowering cardiovascular disease risk in literally millions of patients. Recognizing that clinicians balance safety with efficacy when prescribing statins, our research group and others have established genetic markers that are valid candidates for a panel of safety and efficacy markers. The SINM PhyzioType System is the first diagnostic tool to integrate statin safety and efficacy markers for clinical use. The SINM PhyzioType system can predict the safety and efficacy of the pre-eminent statin drugs (namely, atorvastatin [Lipitor(R)], simvastatin [Zocor(R)], and rosuvastatin [Crestor(R)]-which together account for 85% of the U.S. market share8) according to the genome of each patient, enabling selection of the optimal drug for each patient. Alternatively if a patient&#039;s genomic profile proves to be incompatible with statins, the clinician can opt to prescribe another drug class. This Phase II Renewal Program is entitled SYSTEM FOR DNA-GUIDED OPTIMIZATION AND PERSONALIZATION OF STATIN THERAPY. Our previous Fast-Track SBIR Program enabled the discovery of gene markers and configuration of predictive bioclinical algorithms, and it advanced the clinical development of the SINM PhyzioType product closer to commercialization. The proposed Phase II Renewal Program will validate the performance of the SINM PhyzioType product in a prospective study of an independent population of 400 patients naove to statin therapy or who had not received statins for at least 3 months. Allocated funds will be used to validate the product forpersonalized clinical management of statins, to develop a medical informatics interface enabling use of the product by clinicians (Personalized Health Portal) and to prepare the SINM PhyzioType for commercialization. With this project, Genomas will continue to enlist some of the most highly qualified lipid clinical specialists in the world, including Paul D. Thompson, M.D., of Hartford Hospital&#039;s Division of Cardiology, John P. Kane, M.D., of the Cardiovascular Research Institute at University of California at San Francisco, and Bruce Gordon, M.D., of the Rogosin Institute at New York Presbyterian Medical Center for this Program. Theodore Holford, Ph.D., of the Yale School of Medicine will serve as a consultant in biostatistics. The expected outcome is final development of the Genomas product SINM PhyzioTypeTM System, that predicts the variable lipid-altering efficacy and the risk of drug-induced neuromuscular side effects that arise in the substantial segment of patients receiving statins. With data collected Phase II Renewal funding, Genomas will be able to serve confirmatory proof that the PhyzioType product is a reliable, reproducible and cost-effective product enabling physicians to optimize treatment strategies in lipid disorders while avoiding neuromyopathy. The goal is to enable clinicians to deploy a genetic decision support system to manage statins, prescribe these drugs on a DNA-guided, personalized basis and effectively lower the risk of cardiovascular disease for each patient.        PUBLIC HEALTHRELEVANCE: In the proposed Phase II Renewal Program, the SINM PhyzioTypeTM System for optimization and personalization of statin therapy will be validated through a prospective study to finalize the product ahead of commercialization. This validation study will serve confirmatory proof that the SINM PhyzioTypeTM System is a reliable, reproducible and cost-effect product enabling physicians to optimize treatment strategies in lipid disorders and minimize detrimental neuromuscular side effects. This pioneering product, which represents the first tool to integrate statin safety and efficacy markers for clinical use, will advance the practice of personalized medicine and reduce side effects while elevating therapeutic benefits of the country&#039;s most popular drugs that are already on the market.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transporters are a class of more than 1000 membrane proteins that regulate how nutrients and drugs enter and leave biological cells. Transporters have validated clinical significance and affect every aspect of drug ADME(Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination), and they also mediate drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that can lead to serious Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs). Utilizing the full potentials of transporters opens new possibilities of designing safer and more efficacious drugs, through improving drug bioavailability, achieving more targeted tissue distribution and reducing and/or managing ADRs due to DDI. Despite that many transporters are known to influence drug levels, suitable cell lines, specific transporter inhibitors, and predictive computational models are not generally available. In the proposed Phase II studies we will address these unmet needs by developing transporter assays for 27 important drug transporters in humans and rats, using the Opti-Expression technology developed in Phase I. In addition, through comprehensive screening of 1000 prescription drugs against 6 high priority drug uptake transporters, this research will provide a basis for identification of potential transporter-mediated DDIsin the liver and kidney. Importantly, these screens represent the largest and most complete screen of compounds for inhibition of transporters. Compounds identified as potential transporter inhibitors can be tested in follow-up clinical DDI studies. The research will lead to the discovery of specific and general inhibitors that can be used as tools in in vitro and pre-clinical (as well as clinical) in vivo studies to identify transporters involved in drug absorption and disposition, and to determine the mechanisms that underlie clinical DDIs. Currently, there is no database or knowledgebase that houses specific large-scale information on transporter mediated DDIs. This study will facilitate the establishment of a transporter inhibition database, which is based on the data obtained in the proposed screening studies. This database will be an important tool for scientists in academia, industry and at the FDA.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Success of this project will benefit public health by facilitating discovery and development of more efficacious drugs for treating various formidable diseases, particularly CNS diseases and cancer, and by improving drug safety through reducing adverse drug effects due to unwanted tissue distribution and drug-drug interactions.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 518 kinases are encoded by the human genome and serve as critical mediators of signal transduction brought about by a phosphorylation event. Many kinases are known to be involved in diabetes, inflammation,cardiovascular diseases, tumor cell proliferation and metastasis and are therefore validated targets for therapeutic intervention. Currently there are 10 marketed kinase drugs, another 80 inhibitors are in clinical trials and many more are being evaluatedin the preclinical stage. The kinases share a relatively similar architecture at the active-site (ATP-binding domain), making selectivity an issue in drug discovery and development. A promiscuous or &#039;dirty&#039; drug, which binds to many kinases, is expected to give rise to unwanted adverse-effects. At the same time, in some cases, inhibiting multiple targets, like kinases, selectively in a signal transduction pathway might be a desired strategy for treating a disease. Profiling drug candidates against a largepanel of kinases can therefore not only aid in anticipating toxicity profiles, but also help in identifying new targets for old compounds. In this Phase II application, we will develop our split-luciferase based luminescent assays for kinome-wide profiling. Currently due to the high costs of profiling against kinases, selectivity profiles are typically obtained later in drug development to verify the lead compound&#039;s specificity. In addition, many researchers are shut out on a routine basis. Our goal is to make these profiling assays affordable, so that compound profiling can be done earlier leading to early identification of failures and resulting in many more opportunities for success.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Kinases are important mediators of signal transduction pathways and their activity inside cells is tightly regulated. Dysregulation of kinases has been implicated in many diseases, validating them as therapeutic targets. The challenge in designing drugs against kinases comes from their cross-reactivity, which arises due to similar architecture of many kinases at the ATP-binding site. Screening compounds against a large number of kinases can help develop a selectivity fingerprint, which can be used to make important decisions for advancing a compound into the clinic. The purpose of our application is to develop low-cost, sensitive, luminescence based kinase assays for drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many drugs are small molecules that act by binding to a specific protein and thus blocking or altering its actions. For example, the HIV protease inhibitors are important AIDS treatments that work by binding in the active site of the protease enzyme and preventing it from helping to make new viruses. When scientists identify a protein, like HIV protease, as being important in a disease process, a next step often is to determine its three-dimensional structure in great detail. This structure then provides valuable guidance to chemists trying to design a small molecule that will bind the protein tightly. However, even when they know the structure of the protein, there is still a lot of trial and error in designing a drug. Many researchers have worked on computer programs to help predict whether a given molecule will bind a given protein, but without much success. Now, new software that VeraChem has been developing over the last few years is giving very good results for thisproblem. However, the software takes a long time to run and would be far more useful if it were much faster. For example, if chemists had an idea for a new compound to try, they could get the answer in a minutes instead of a few days. They could use the method to quickly and cheaply test thousands of compounds in chemical catalogs. And they could check whether a compound that works against their protein would keep working against mutant forms of the protein and thereby avoid drug-resistance. Thus, a fast version of VM2 would be very useful and would be a valuable commercial product. Speeding up VeraChem&#039;s method, VM2, is not as simple as running it on a faster computer, because individual computers have not been getting much faster in recent years. What is changing, though, is that computers are being made with more and more processors. The goal of this project is to speed up VM2 enormously by spreading its computational work across large numbers of separate processors in a single computer, in a cluster of computers, and even in a video card. This is not a simple task, but researchers have been able to speed up related molecular calculations in this way, and we are confident the same can be done for VM2.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We want to let scientists design new medicines more quickly with a computer program. The problem is that the program takes too long to do its calculations. This project is to speed up the calculations by changing the program so that it can make a large number of computer processors to work together to calculate the answers in a short time.",

Recent developments of automated patch clamp instrumentation are still over an order of magnitude lower throughput than conventional drug screening for soluble proteins and also require expensive instrumentation, specialized cell lines, and consumables. For existing methods of ion channel screening, there is a large gap in information quality, throughput, and cost.Librede Inc. is developing an alternative cell-free technology for ion channel screening using artificial cell membranes.

In the work proposed here, we aim to develop materials and methods for measurement and packaging of the hERG channel inour artificial membrane platform. hERG is an important ion channel to screen, since off-target activity of pharmaceuticals on the hERG channel can lead to cardiac arrhythmia and death; thus all drug candidates, irrespective of target, must be screened against interaction with hERG. For this work, we will collaborate with the Schmidt group at UCLA, who has demonstrated the measurement of hERG in artificial membranes in preliminary work, a first. We aim to determine the compatibility of hERG with Librede&#039;s artificial membrane platform and determine the conditions with optimize the long term storage of hERG packaged with our membrane array plates. Finally, we will perform a demonstration of our technology by screening hERG against known channel blockers over a48 membrane array plate simultaneously. This work is a key step toward our goal of reducing the cost and expertise required for ion channel screening.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have recently developed a novel ion channel measurement platform thatmay be indefinitely stored, commercially shipped, and requires very little input from the end user to operate. We aim to validate this platform with the human cardiac ion channel hERG to demonstrate the utility of this technology for ion channel screening.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Aptamers have emerged as one of the most promising classes of drug leads and diagnostic ligands presently available. Aptamers, nucleic acid ligands derived from large combinatorial libraries, typically have affinitiesand specificities that rival antibodies, yet they have a number of significant advantages for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Unfortunately, the existing process for aptamer development is low-throughput and tedious as DNA or RNA libraries are screened against only a single target. This project focuses on developing the methods and tools to allow large combinatorial to be screened against arrays of thousands of proteins simultaneously. Such protein arrays are increasing available with content of high therapeutic and diagnostic value.  The key to achieving this is developing the necessary steps to decipher which aptamers (once selected) correspond to which target. So-called  next generation  sequencing will greatly enable the proposed process coupledwith the necessary  sequence-tagging  approaches developed in this project. Once our massively parallel aptamer selection process is developed, we will be in a position to create high affinity aptamer ligands to thousands of proteins in roughly 1 week. The developed ligands can then be further characterized as promising drug candidates, diagnostic labels, and other research applications perhaps eventually including personalized medicine.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A recent white paper by the US Federal Drug Administration finds that there exists a critical problem in bringing novel drugs to market, something the FDA describes as the &#039;pipeline problem&#039;. According to this and other reports drug companies spend an average of  0.8-1.7 billion dollars on the discovery, development and approval of any one individual drug. To make matters worse, the time from the initial testing of a drug candidate and to its eventual marketing can take up to 20 years. Thus, the FDA report strongly urges the incorporation ofnovel quantitative predictive tools for the assessment of safety and efficacy of new drug leads and diagnostic ligands early in the drug development process.  This project provides for the parallel development and evaluation of enormous combinatorial libraries of DNA or RNA &#039;aptamers&#039; against of thousands of protein targets of potential &#039;druggable&#039; interest. If successful, the technology could provide for unprecedented throughput of drug leads and diagnostic ligands.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Escherichia coli was the host organism for production of the first approved recombinant protein therapeutic in 1982. We now know that most therapeutic proteins require N-linked protein glycosylation to achieve their full clinical efficacy. Since E. coli has not been capable of protein glycosylation, the majority of approved therapeutic proteins are now expressed in mammalian host cells. While mammalian cells can express N-linked glycoproteins, they can have several drawbacks including: (i) slow growth, (ii) expensive media, (iii) long development timelines, (iv) low volumetric productivity, (v) susceptibility to viral contamination, and (vi) product heterogeneity. This problem has not gone unnoticed by the scientific community, and several eukaryotic organisms have been re-engineered for expression of therapeutic glycoproteins. Unfortunately, all eukaryotic hosts - including Chinese hamster ovary cells, plant cells, insect cells, or even genetically engineered yeast - introduce nonhuman glycoforms that arise from native glycosylation pathways. Glycobia specializes in glycoengineering bacteria as a platform for the stereospecific biosynthesis of therapeutic glycoproteins. The specific hypothesis of these proposed studies isthat glycoengineered E. coli can be used to express therapeutic glycoproteins. In Phase I of this project, we engineered E. coli capable of glycosylating proteins with the eukaryotic core glycan (Man3GlcNAc2) that is the predominant glycan in both plant and insect cells. In Phase II of this project, we propose to further engineer E. coli to enable glycosylation of therapeutic proteins with terminally sialylated human glycans. Specifically, we propose to engineer E. coli to glycosylate therapeutic proteins with eukaryotic N-glycans by screening enzymes to: (i) preferentially glycosylate N-X-S/T glycosylation motifs and (ii) efficiently glycosylate therapeutic target proteins with eukaryotic glycans. Further, we propose to engineer E. coli to synthesize and transfer complex terminally sialylated N-glycans by: (i) extending the Man3GlcNAc2 biosynthetic pathway for the biosynthesis of terminally sialylated glycans and (ii) screening enzymes for their ability to transfer the complex human N-glycan to target proteins. The benchmark of success for this project is expression of a commercial glycoprotein in E. coli. This bacterial expression platform represents a transformative solution to the unanswered biomedical challenge of generating cost-effective glycoproteins for both companies and patients.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most approved therapeutic proteins require posttranslational N-linked protein glycosylation and, as a consequence, are expressed in eukaryotic host cells that can be expensive, susceptible toviral contamination, and prone to product heterogeneity. The outcomes are low profit margins for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and prices that are prohibitive to the healthcare consumer. The proposed studies focus on expressing safe, affordable, and controlled complex human glycoproteins in the simple bacterium Escherichia coli.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of this project is to develop a 384-well cell invasion assay suitable for high throughput screening (HTS) of chemical libraries. The principal barrier to evaluating cancer drugs for cell invasion is the lack of affordable 3-dimensional assays that are robust, reproducible, physiologically relevant, suitable for automation and cost-effective to perform. The further advancement of OrisTM technology, as described in this proposal, will form the basis of an affordable, easy to use cell-based assay capable of rapid and quantitative results that facilitates selection and evaluation of therapeutic candidates for cell invasion. The availability of a 384-well cell invasion assay that requires minimal numbers ofcells and minute volumes of test compounds will accelerate drug development for cancer therapeutics. The proposed assay format will be compatible with automated liquid handling systems and high content analysis (HCA) instruments. The proposed assay will both be useful as a primary screen which can be read quickly by HTS instruments while also efficiently permitting subsequent secondary screens in the same assay wells that can be easily quantitated via HCA platforms. This is an extraordinary economic benefitthat increases the knowledge-generating power of the research dollar; it conserves reagents (compounds, cells, etc) and resources (manpower) that would otherwise be consumed in repetitive testing required by other formats such as trans-membrane assays. The proposed 3D invasion assay is based on the innovative use of a biocompatible gel (BCG) centrally deposited in each well to exclude cells from adhering in the centers of the wells. As demonstrated in phase 1 activities, the BCG is an effective replacementfor the Oris  silicone cell seeding stoppers used in our first generation cell motility assays. After cells are seeded, the BCG dissolves to reveal reproducible Detection Zones in the center of each well. A coating of extracellular matrix is then overlaidin the well and invasion in the x, y and z axes can begin. By eliminating the cell seeding stoppers, which both prevent access by automated liquid handling equipment and require a manual removal step to begin the assay, the BCG-based assay will offer theability for robotic delivery of cells, media and test compounds thereby decreasing hands-on time required by laboratory personnel. In Phase 1 of this proposal, we developed a 96-well based Cell Migration Assay utilizing BCG to create a dissolving barrier that successfully formed Detection Zones in the center of assay wells. We effectively screened over 100 formulations of BCG and selected a suitable formulation that a) was compatible with both tissue culture treated and collagen I coated surfaces, b) had the ability to block cell attachment while completely dissolving in tissue culture media, c) permitted cell migration upon dissolution and d) did not interfere with cell viability or induce cytotoxicity. We developed and optimized robotic dispensing capabilities to achieve uniform and reproducible BCG deposition in a 96- well format and confirmed that BCG does not interfere with the efficacy of 4 different classes of inhibitors in this novel migration assay. The data presented from our Phase 1 studies clearlydemonstrate the feasibility of a HTS-compatible cell motility assay based on accurate and precise deposition of a dissolvable, biocompatible gel that creates a temporary cell exclusion zone in 96-well assay plates. These results justify continued development of this technology for a 384-well, 3D high throughput cell invasion assay. Based on proven success in launching the Oris  cell-based assay product line, Platypus has the skills, knowledge, and infrastructure to develop, validate and manufacture products for cell-based assays. The major goals of this Phase 2 proposal are to 1) miniaturize the 96-well migration assay to a 384-well invasion assay format, 2) optimize conditions for an ECM overlay; and 3) validate the assays in 3-day variability studies anddose-response titrations with well characterized inhibitors. Successful completion of these goals will provide researchers with a cost-effective 384-well 3D invasion assay that will reduce labor and materials needed for assay set-up and offer the ability to efficiently capture additional information per well by using multiplexed staining, thereby maximizing research funds and human resources.",

Small molecules, including peptides, dyes anddrugs can be simply dissolved in fish water. Additional advantages include: their small size, easy maintenance and breeding, and high productivity. Use of zebrafish as an alternative animal model for drug screening can greatly accelerate the drug screeningprocess, decrease costs, and provide more accurate results than cell-based assays. There are currently more than 300 core zebrafish aquaculture facilities (2/3 are in the US), and the number of satellite labs is increasing rapidly due to development of modular breeding racks.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improved supporting technologies for imaging of molecular and supramolecular structures within cells are needed to facilitate cell biology research, and are sought by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (specifically, its Division of Cell Biology and Biophysics).  Multiscale imaging, using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) on supramolecular structures and single molecules, has proven in recent years to be a unique and invaluable method for highthroughputcharacterization of the dynamic 3D architecture of cells. Electron microscopy (EM) grids, used as substrates for supporting the biological and biomolecular specimens being imaged, are a critical component associated with this imaging method. New EM grid technology that decreases sample preparation cost and time, improves sample generation from culturing to freezing for cryo-ET, and increases imaging quality will allow researchers to more efficiently explore cellular architecture, at higher throughput. Synkera proposes a novel class of ceramic EM grids that feature an integrated thin support film that is highly compatible with cell culturing, light microscopy and cryo-ET. The grids will facilitate high-throughput, multiscale imaging of sub-cellular architecture and offer key advantages over state-of-the art products. The grids are also expected to be a competitive alternative in many other EM and culturing applications a 6-month Phase I project successfully demonstrated feasibility of the proposed grids   architecture, as well as their potential in culturing, cryo-ET and multiscale imaging. Phase II aims to build on this success by further developing fabrication processes and ceramic EM grids designs, to fully realize the potential for multiscale imaging in functional prototypes. At least four academic partners will aide in this development process. The ultimate goal of the proposed project is a complete line of ceramic EM grids for a broad range of EM applications, from bioimaging to materials characterization.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project addresses imaging of molecules and cells via cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET).

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II SBIR program aims to further develop Electronic Bio Sciences&#039; (EBS) Nanopatch system for ion channel measurements. The proposed system will allow high sensitivity measurements previously only attainable with the patch clamp method to be performed on a planar lipid bilayer (PLB) system. The system relies on a nanometer scale bilayer on the quartz nanopore membrane platform and EBS designed electronics to reduce the noise typically associated with a traditional PLB system. The aims of this program are to improve the low frequency noise performance to rival that of patch clamping, adapt established protocols and develop new methods to increase the types of ion channels that can be incorporated into the Nanopatch system and demonstrate the capabilities of the system using an intracellular channel with low conductance and fast kinetics. Four prototype Nanopatch systems will also be produced. This improved Nanopatch system will have several distinct advantages overcurrently available ion channel measurement apparatus including a low noise, high bandwidth platform, robust and reproducible bilayer formation, fine temperature and pressure control and automated bilayer formation and ion channel incorporation. The proposed Nanopatch system will enable a large range of low conductance channels and channels with fast kinetics to be evaluated in a PLB at previously unattainable resolution and sensitivity.

In order to exploit this knowledge for new drugs targeting these channels, a complete characterization of the individual channel conductance is needed. The Nanopatch system will provide a means to achieve this characterization as well as increase the number of channels that can be investigated, substantially decrease the difficulty in obtaining these measurements and allow complete dose effect curves to be obtained due to increased measurement times with the robust bilayer platform.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenomics studies represent the next wave of efforts to decode the information embedded in genomes beyond the nucleotide sequences. Dynamic epigenomic changes, such as DNA methylation are key processes in cell differentiation, development and many pathological events. Current methods for mapping epigenetic modifications on DNA, such as bisulfite sequencing or using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, are either technically challenging or provide incomplete information. The proposed research in this grant application is based on a novel family of modification-dependent restriction endonucleases (REs), represented by MspJI, which we have discovered recently. Unlike other existing REs, these enzymes recognize modified cytosines in DNA and cleave at fixed distances away from the recognition sites. One of their unique properties is that they are capable of releasing short DNA fragments containing the methylated cytosines directly from the genomic DNA. Using ultra high-throughput sequencing platforms, one would be able to identify and map epigenetic modification in a reliable and quick manner. Furthermore, a significant portion of the modified cytosines in mammalian cells is in the form of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and current methods cannot determine their presence. MspJI in combination with a 5- hydroxymethylcytosine modifying enzyme, such as beta-glucosyltransferase, can distinguish such changes. Thus, application of these enzymes can provide a foundation for the next-generation of methods for analyzing epigenomic modification. In the Phase I research, we plan to purify the recombinant enzymes and characterize their biochemical properties in detail in vitro. In the Phase II research, we plan to determine the molecular structure of the enzymes both in their apo-forms without DNA and complexed with a methylated DNA substrate. We will establish methodologies whereby these enzymes can be used to decode the DNA methylation patterns in human, mouse and a few other model organisms. We will also examine the dynamics of DNA methylation during mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation. The availability of these enzymes will allow us to answer scientifically pressing questions, such as, the sequence location of 5-hydroxymethycytosinein the human and mouse genomes. Another goal of the Phase II research is that, based on the structures and our previously established enzyme engineering protocols, we plan to isolate mutants that may have improved properties. We believe our proposed research lays out a few unique and exciting opportunities for epigenetics research and we expect the availability of these enzymes as products and as parts of kits to have a major impact for the broader biomedical community interested in studying epigenetic modifications.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Epigenetic DNA modifications in mammalian genomes, especially methylation, play crucial roles in gene regulation during cell differentiation. Commonly used methods, such as bisulfite sequencing, have many inherent drawbacks. The proposed research in this project aims at providing a set of novel enzymatic reagents for mapping the epigenetic landscape based on a family of newly discovered modification-dependent restriction endonucleases. We plan to characterize thebiochemical properties of these enzymes and develop methods for applying them in epigenetics research. Coupled with high-throughput sequencing technologies, they promise a much simplified pipeline from which myriads of revolutionary methodologies and research can build on.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The discovery of new and interesting RNA sequences from genome sequencing projects, and the urgency to unravel their functions, has led to a dramatic push for novel structural determination techniques. Current experimental methods for three dimensional structure determination of nucleic acids such as x-ray crystallography and NMR cannot keep pace with the day to day discovery of sequences that need representative structures to be solved or modeled. Thus, there is a clearneed to develop tools for 3D structure prediction given only the primary sequence and when available, experimental constraint information. Compared to proteins, RNA structure prediction has received limited resources, and only recently has the field gained attention by the scientific community. As such, RNA prediction has largely relied on protein prediction methodologies despite the vast intrinsic differences between proteins and nucleic acids. Although many of these tools have shown significant advancesin the prediction quality, they have also demonstrated low reliability and are often limited to prediction of very small RNAs. In addition, the majority are either manual or semi-automated, which requires an experienced user and a variety of intermediate software packages. To address such concerns, DNA Software, Inc. (DNAS) has developed an RNA homology modeling software, NA-CAD (Nucleic Acid Computer Aided Design) that has a unique force field specifically optimized for RNA. This tool has demonstrated success in homology modeling of large RNA-protein complexes such as the small ribosomal subunit of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We would now like to extend NA-CAD to include a component for de novo structure prediction. The force field in NA-CAD and the free energybased secondary structure prediction algorithm in our flagship software product Visual OMP provide an advantageous starting point for developing a unified tool that can accurately predict de novo the tertiary structure of medium to large RNA targets. Thisproposal addresses the engineering of novel algorithms for handling difficult structural motifs such as multiloops, pseudoknots, and multiple domains and incorporating experimental constraints to improve prediction quality. Additionally, coarse-grained models for representing RNA residues and accelerated classical molecular dynamics simulations will be implemented to increase conformational sampling in a tractable computational time frame.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop an accurate,fast, and unified de novo structure prediction tool optimized for medium to large sized RNAs. This tool will generate valuable structural models that will help elucidate the functions of RNAs that do not have solved crystal or NMR structures. The proposedde novo tool will be incorporated into our homology modeling software, NA-CAD, so that it will be able to generate three-dimensional homology models of pharmaceutically relevant RNA targets and to model potential drug-resistant mutants, which will be beneficial to researchers involved in structure-based drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Due to improvements in obstetrical and neonatal care, and an associated decrease in perinatal mortality, as well as increased risks associated with in vitro fertilization procedures, the number of preterm (lt  37 weekspostmenstrual age) very low birth weight (lt  1,500 g) neonates born is growing [34]. Of the approximately 50,000 neonates born yearly in the United States with a low birth weight, approximately 85% survive. These infants have an increased risk of long-term developmental disabilities, with 5-15% exhibiting major neurodevelopmental disabilities (e.g., cerebral palsy, mental retardation) and an additional 25-50% exhibiting mild to moderate neurodevelopmental disabilities (e.g., school failure) [40, 74]. ThisSBIR Phase II grant application is concerned with the detection of developmental disorders at a very early age. Assessment of the consequences of low birth weight, adverse pregnancies, or complicated births on the structure and function of an infant&#039;s central nervous system (CNS) and its development is important for obtaining valid estimates of behavior and neurological status, documenting recovery from acute eects, predicting subsequent outcome, and suggesting specic intervention strategies for any problems noted. Although brain imaging, such as cranial ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, can document structural brain damage, assessment of infants&#039; endogenously-generated (i.e., spontaneous) movement patterns, known as  general movements  (GMs), provides a method by which to assess CNS function. In the past 25 years, an extensive body of literature has shown that motility, rst of the fetus and subsequently of the neonate, has strong clinical signicance as an indicator of brain function and dysfunction. Presently, assessment of GMs is based on the Gestalt evaluation of video-recorded infant movement patterns. Assessment of GMs is a useful adjunct to the standard neurological examination, primitive reex prole, and assessment of muscle strength and tone. However, the use of video recording is not ideal; it is tedious, subjective, labor intensive, and expensive, requiring specially-trained practitioners to evaluate stored image sequences o line. The proposed GEneral Movements for the Identication of Neurological disorders in Infants (GEMINI) sys- tem, a low-cost tool for objectively and automatically assessing infant GMs in hospital and non-hospital settings, will overcome these limitations. The GEMINI system will exploit Barron Associates&#039; patented six degrees-of- freedom motion monitoring capability and sophisticated signal processing to identify the key qualitative and quantitative attributes of GMs, and thereby automate the assessment of GMs. Based on the proposed multi- phase research program, the requisite knowledge will be obtained to enable realization of a low-cost, low-prole GEMINI product that can reliably perform the required discrimination and serve as a valuable research tool in documenting and better understanding movementsand movement precursors for neurological disorders.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identication of movement dysregulation can lead to early interventions (e.g., developmental physical therapy) and treatment strategies aimed at facilitating normal movementpatterns during an early critical period when CNS plasticity is presumed high. The GEMINI tool will also enable GM assessment of infants in rural areas where access to specially-trained practitioners is rarely available. Furthermore, the tool will be helpful in clinical and research studies for providing objective measures against which to evaluate the eectiveness of subsequent interventions, and may also be useful in identifying the underlying processes that determines normal and abnormal motor outcomes.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Postural deformity is common among wheelchair users due to the tendency of the spine to flex under the influence of gravity. For individuals with paralysis of the trunk muscles, these postural deformities can occur quickly after injury and can reduce function and lead to painful fixed deformities. To delay the onset of these deformities, it is imperative that wheelchair seating be designed and prescribed which provides the necessary support to counteract gravity, but does not overly-restrict the users&#039; ability to move their trunk so they can accomplish their daily activities. While sophisticated seating and position products for electric power wheelchair are on the market, advances for manual wheelchairs seating have focused on pressure relieving cushions. Rigid backrests are being marketed which replace the traditional sling designs are being marketed, and users&#039; report an increased comfort over sling systems, but they have drawbacks which have limited their market penetration. The three primary drawbacks are (1) the increased weight of the rigid backrests over the sling systems, (2) discomfort when the user wants to perform non-mobility tasks, like dressing or relaxing (leaning back) , and (3) the inability to use the rigid shells on a folding-frame wheelchair. If these design shortcomings were mitigated, market penetration would increase substantially. We developed a Light-weight, Durable, Adjustable backrest (LWDAC) which addresses shortcomings (1) and (2) and was verywell received by focus groups subjects. In this Phase II project, we will refine the LWDAC based on subjects&#039; feedback, and introduce a quick-release mechanism to address shortcoming (3), which has already been developed for our other backrest system.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Despite the increased comfort and postural support that rigid wheelchair backrests provide, some users reject them because they restrict function during non-mobility tasks, like dressing or relaxing. To address these shortcomings,we have developed a Lightweight, Durable, Adjustable, Composite backrest system which allows the user to independently and easily adjust their backrest for all tasks.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a trend of increasing modularity within powered mobility devices (PMDs) motivated by clinicians and end-users requesting more customized and appropriate mobility solutions. Unfortunately, PMDs (Scooters and Electric Powered Wheelchairs) provide distinct sets of features and non-overlapping performance, severely restricting the benefits that true modularity could provide. Consequently, and in spite of the clinicians&#039; and users&#039; preference, the prescribed deviceis often inadequate or includes unnecessary and costly features. To address the shortcomings of PMDs, we have developed a Single Motor Propelled Wheelchair (SIMPL-WC) that incorporates a novel drive-train which allows for a true continuum of PMD solutions.The SIMPL-WC allows the clinician and user to select any combination of features, including steering type (manual/power), user interface, seating functions (powered/unpowered) which can be applied to one underlying device which is low-cost and performs well in all terrains and environments. The goal of this project is to finalize the design and testing of the SIMPL-WC. Specifically, we will perform design modifications to the Phase-I prototype suggested by stakeholders and perform a short- production run and conduct standards testing, focus groups, and field-trials with end-users. Additionally, we will design, fabricate and test the powered turning module (SIMPL-PTM) and the powered seating module (SIMPL-PSM). At the completion of the grant, testing, manufacturing and regulatory elements will be in place to facilitate successful commercialization.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The demand for powered mobility devices (PMDs) such as Scooters and Electric Powered Wheelchairs increases yearly due to our aging population, and has put an increasing burden on our healthcare industry to control and cut costs. Rather than innovate, manufacturers have cut costs by reducing quality, which has resulted in safety concerns for PMD users. The goal of this project is to finalize the research, development, and quality testing of a low-cost PMD which provides effective indoor and outdoor mobility, and includes a series of optional modules so the device can be tailored according to the needs of individual users.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infertility affects about 10% of American couples, and there is a very large and rapidly growing market for therapeutics in this field, particularly the primary hormone responsible for ovarian oocyte development, human(h) follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Although available urinary and recombinant hFSH products have been quite successful, there is currently an unmet therapeutic need for improved FSH analogs for all infertile women and particularly for older patients and those relatively unresponsive to current therapies. We have previously described the first superactive analogs of glycoprotein hormones that considerably increase receptor binding affinity as well as both in vitro and in vivo biopotency and maximal efficacy. During our successfully completed phase 2 SBIR study we have achieved or exceeded all the aims including screening additional FSH analog candidates and identifying the optimal FSH analog TR 4401 for clinical trials, using multiple in vitro and in vivo rodent bioassay models including the classic ovarian weight response as well as those of oocytes, blastocysts and newborn pups resulting from embryo transfer. In all these rodent models 4401 greatly outperformed all currently available recombinant FSH preparations both in potency and efficacy related to both quantitative endpoints as well as qualitative endpoints related to oocyte or embryo quality. In addition we have shown such superior efficacy of TR4401 to standard FSH in human cell lines with reducedFSH receptor expression representing two models of human infertility, in two bovine models of infertility and in Rhesus monkeys using methods emulating human assisted reproductive technology. We have also shown that one injection of TR4401 in cows could produce comparable superovulation to the standard 8-injection regimen of porcine FSH with no attenuation of response after repeated administration. These nonhuman primate and bovine studies showed no evidence of ovarian hyperstimulation by TR4401 at neithera presumably maximal dose, nor any evidence of immunogenicity, the only two side effects of concern to FDA for this minimally modified, and thus presumably safe, FSH analog. Using an HPLC-validated immunoassay we have discovered superior pharmacokinetic properties of TR4401 in comparison to standard FSH both in rodents and monkeys, apparently the result of delayed absorption. We have also achieved development of a stable Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line producing high levels of the final TR4401 analog; optimization of large scale bioreactor production methods; development of novel, high capacity purification methods suitable for commercial scale-up; rigorous quantification and characterization of purified analogs by multiple physicochemical methods including carbohydrate analysis. In the current application, following specific directives from FDA obtained in our highly successful Pre-IND Meeting with them, we propose all steps, including specific timelines indicated on a detailed Gantt chart, required by FDA for further commercial development of this novel FSH analog. These include establishment and characterization of a master and working CHO cell bank; manufacturing of two additional large batches of TR4401 (gt200 mg each): the first under GLP and thesecond under GMP compliant conditions; performance all FDA-required efficacy, specificity, stability, metabolic, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and analytic studies; performance of all FDA-required toxicology studies including two-generation reproductivetoxicology assessment in rats and rabbits; and submission of IND to initiate clinical trials. We have licensed TR4401 to the worldwide leading veterinary superovulation company, Bioniche, Inc. for veterinary use, with a possible option to also co-developthe analog for human use.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Infertility affects about 10% of American couples, and there is a very large and rapidly growing market for therapeutics in this field, particularly the primary hormone responsible for ovarian oocyte development, human (h) follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Although available urinary and recombinant hFSH products have been quite successful, there is currently an unmet therapeutic need for improved FSH analogs for all infertile women and particularlyfor older patients and those relatively unresponsive to current therapies. We have shown in previous phase one and phase two SBIR grant studies that our novel FSH superagonist, TR4401, engineered to increase binding affinity to the FSH receptor, shows greatly increased potency and efficacy compared to currently available FSH products, in multiple quantitative and qualitative oocyte endpoints in rodents, monkeys, and bovines, with no apparent side effects. We now propose to commercialize this novel FSH analog by following all the specific FDA guidelines given to us in a pre-IND meeting in order to submit an IND to that agency to initiate clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop new surgical tools and procedures to facilitate a minimally invasive repair for uterine or vaginal vault prolapsed, a disorder of the female pelvic floor. The current gold standard operation for this disorder is the sacral colpopexy, primarily performed via laparotomy in which a relatively large abdominal incision is made to access the area in a manner similar to that performed for a cesarean section or abdominal hysterectomy. This procedure hasa high success rate but entails the pain and morbidity associated with the large abdominal incision. A small but increasing number of surgeons are now performing sacral colpopexy via laparoscopy or robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery, including a novel technique that utilizes a single 2-3 cm umbilical incision. Although feasible, the current laparoscopic equipment has deficiencies that make this procedure difficult, limiting its practice to those with advanced laparoscopic skills who are willing to undergoa steep learning curve. Even when performed by experienced surgeons, sacral colpopexy performed laparoscopically or robotically requires longer operative times and increased operating room (OR) personnel when compared to open sacral colpopexy. This project will transform this gold standard procedure into one that is primarily performed via laparoscopy or robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery, including the single-incision / single-port approach. This will reduce hospital stays, potentially decrease blood loss and operative morbidity, reduce post- operative pain, and support an earlier return to normal activities. It will also allow the procedure to be rendered more efficiently, with a shorter learning curve and a reduction in OR personnel and costs. Beyond the sacral colpopexy, the equipment and tooling being proposed will provide a platform for a range of female pelvic surgery procedures, most notably, the laparoscopic or laparoscopically assisted hysterectomy. This project will be completed in several sequential stages. First, the preliminary surgical tools and procedures will be finalized (based on designs and feasibility testing completed in Phase I). Next, the tools and procedures will be tested in a cadaver model, which is intended to prove the safety andperformance of the tools and procedures. The project will conclude with human subject testing that will demonstrate safety and performance in human subjects, which will include post-operative follow up. An outside panel of medical peers will be formed tofollow the project, to provide feedback on the safety and efficiency of the approach and tooling and to suggest improvements.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Each year, approximately 200,000 women undergo inpatient procedures related to pelvic organ prolapsed in the United States and it is expected that this number will rise with the aging population. A current surgical repair procedure (known as  sacral colpopexy ) is typically performed via laparotomy in which a relatively large abdominal incision is madeto access the pelvic area (similar to that performed for a cesarean section or abdominal hysterectomy). This project will develop an improved laparoscopic approach that will use minimally invasive techniques to perform this procedure using very small patient incisions. This is expected to decrease operative morbidity, reduce patient pain and recovery time, and shorten hospital stays and costs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Successfully delivering intensive yet safe gait therapy to individuals with significant walking deficits presents the greatest challenges to even the most skilled therapists. In the acute stages of many neurological injuries such as stroke, spinal cord injury, or traumatic brain injury, individuals often exhibit highly unstable walking patterns and poor endurance, making it difficult to safely practice gait for both the patient and therapist. Because of this, there hasbeen a big push in rehabilitation centers to move over-ground gait training to the treadmill where body-weight support systems can help minimize falls while at the same time raising the intensity of the training. Numerous studies have investigated the effectiveness of body-weight supported treadmill training and have found that this mode of gait training promotes gains in walking ability similar to or greater than conventional gait training. Unfortunately there is a gap in technologies on the market for transitioning subjects from training on a treadmill to safe, weight-supported over-ground gait training. Practicing walking over-ground is critical, as our recent studies have demonstrated key differences between walking on a treadmill and walking over-ground. Additionally, treadmill walking does not allow individuals to practice Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), such as sit-to-stand, stairs, uneven terrain, or getting up off the floor. Since a primary goal of all individuals with walking impairments is to walk in their homes and in the community, it is imperative that therapeutic interventions involve ADL-based over-ground gait training. Since the summer of 2005, we have been developing an over-ground body-weight support gait training system called ZeroG, which provides individuals with gait impairments dynamic unloading of a percentage of their body-weight as they practice walking over-ground as well as balance and postural activities. The system, which rides along an overhead rail, provides both static and dynamic unloading, and has an active trolley such that the system automatically follows the subject as they walk. Here, a small motor drives the system so that it stays directly above the subject as they walk over-ground, or can be positioned in front of orbehind the subject to resist or facilitate motion. With ZeroG, individuals with the most significant gait impairments can safely practice walking, balance and postural tasks early after their injuries. During our Phase I SBIR, we enhanced the trolley tracking capabilities of ZeroG by reconfiguring the system with a larger motor, developed and tested a more accurate and robust tracking algorithm, and conducted tests with the new system verifying our desired performance criteria were all met. The new systemallows subjects to walk at faster speeds, and the additional force capabilities help to control the forward momentum of the subject during falls and for stabilization when lifting the subject from their wheelchair or off the floor. In addition, the improved performance of the system will now allow us to develop more advanced training activities that simulate ADLs, which may lead to enhanced therapeutic benefits. The goals of this Phase II SBIR are to extend the capabilities of ZeroG in terms of both performance as well as usability. Specifically, we will develop advanced ADL-based training modes such as sit-to-stand, sit-to-stand- to-step, stand-to-sit and an adaptive controller that automatically regulates body-weight support based on the subject&#039;s walkingperformance. We will also develop a wireless interface for ZeroG, allowing therapists to control all aspects of the system without having to be in front of the user-interface. Finally, we will develop training modules that detail various training activities therapists can practice with their patients, ranging from easy activities (e.g. sitting balance, trunk control) to high-level activities (e.g. balance platforms, side-to-side cross-over walking, etc). Adding advanced training activities to ZeroG will allow individuals with lower limb impairments the ability to safely practice over-ground gait, as well as postural and dynamic balance tasks, making it one of the most versatile gait training systems in the world. Additionally, adding a wireless interface aswell as detailed training modules will ensure that therapists fully utilize the capabilities of the system. We believe that individuals who train with ZeroG will experience enhanced gains in over-ground walking ability and balance control when compared toexisting conventional rehabilitation strategies as ZeroG will allow therapists to train patients through a broad spectrum of activities early after neurological injuries in a safe, controlled manner. ZeroG can be used in the functional rehabilitation of various disabling conditions, including stroke and spinal cord injury to amputations and with elderly individuals at risk for falls or following orthopedic injuries. In addition to clinical benefits, a body-weight support system of this nature can also be used to foster new research studies that focus on gait impairments and balance issues.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The fit of a prosthesis determines the function of the user to a great degree. In the extreme, a painful fit will result in non-use of the prosthesis. Diurnal, menstrual and other fluctuations in body weight lead to noticeable changes in comfort and function of a prosthesis. As a consequence, the relative quality of socket fit determined by socket volume is of paramount concern in the daily lives of persons with limb loss The objective of the proposed work is to build on the demonstrably successful Phase I effort to develop an Equilibrium Socket System (ESS) for Lower Limb Prostheses. The Phase I work undertaken by the Orthocare Innovations team has resulted in identification successful demonstration of an approach thatcan be developed into a clinically relevant, commercially viable system for dynamically adjusting prosthesis sockets. While both socket volume, and vacuum suspension systems have been developed previously, the approaches taken often work against each otherand sometimes against normal physiological change. The unique feature of the ESS is that combines both autonomous and user adjustable level of dynamic volume accommodation using a simple mechanism, coupled with a silent, dynamically adjusting vacuum suspension system. The system will allow both the prosthetist and the patient to control socket volume changes and suspension in a way that accommodates normal volume fluctuation. The technology will enable the patient to participate more fully by directly controlling adjustments based on what they feel. In the proposed work, we will design and build the definitive system from the lessons learned in Phase I, evaluate performance and feasibility with human subjects, review the results with the subjects and colleagues in clinical prosthetics, and transition the final design to manufacture.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project will improve the fit and function of prostheses by creating a dynamically and automatically adjusting socket interface with the amputated limb. The technology will allow the prosthesis user to adjust the firmness of the fit of their prosthesis quickly, easily, and in a more precisely controlled manner than is currently possible.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Transcutaneous electrical stimulation applications involving high numbers of stimulated muscles have been an area of growing interest in recent years. customKYnetics has been approached by research groups and stimulation application developers requesting high channel count stimulation devices for use in their spinal cord injury rehabilitation research studies and products. Existing devices do not offer the features and/or number of stimulation channels required for these applications. Such high channel count devices are often cost prohibitive due to the size and complexity of the stimulator and the limited market for any particular configuration. Devices that are available lack the technological capability to coordinatethe activity of the electrode pairs in an application-specific manner. Such applications have also lacked clinical acceptance because managing the large number of wires has been burdensome and impractical. We propose Active Distributed Electrode Array (ADEA) technology, which offers two novel features that address these problems: network architecture and end-user programmability. With these features, the ADEA system will be fully configurable (both in hardware and software) by the application developer (i.e., researcher, specialized clinician, or OEM company) to create application-specific stimulation/sensing networks and stimulation regimens. No end-user programming experience will be required. We successfully completed Phase I work, including feasibility demonstration of the node concept. The goals of this Phase II SBIR project will be to develop clinically viable stimulation and sensing nodes, an ADEA stimulator/controller module, and an end-user programming suite, and to demonstrate efficacy of the technology. The target markets for this device will be specialized clinics, research groups, and OEM companies. The target price for the system will be  3000 in volume for an 8-channel configuration (OEM market).

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the course of a pregnancy, physicians and patients desire as much information as possible regarding the health of the fetus. For both emotional and medical reasons, this information is sought as early in term aspossible, and with the fewest possible risks to both mother and child. Although the widely used first trimester chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and second trimester amniocentesis are relatively safe, both procedures are not without negligible risks. In efforts to avoid these risks altogether, researchers have turned toward isolating circulating fetal nucleated red blood cells (FNRBCs) from maternal blood as an alternative, non- invasive source of fetal tissue. Despite the development of FNRBC enrichment methods,   there has been limited success with their coupling to subsequent aneuploidy screening and several challenges still must be overcome such as ability to test single fetal cells for 24-chromosome aneuploidy, confirm the isolated cell&#039;s origin (fetal versus maternal) and simultaneously screen for diseases caused by single nucleotide variants or micro in/dels. Our innovative Parental SupportTM technology provides a solution to all of these challenges and the development of a first trimester non-invasiveprenatal diagnostic test is the ultimate goal of this grant application. In Phase I, we first plan to optimize single cell lysis and whole genome amplification protocols specifically for antibody-stained FNRBCs.. Protocol optimization for single cell analysis falls within the core competencies of GSN as we have previously successfully commercialized an innovative single cell molecular karyotyping protocol to enable genetic analysis of single blastomeres within 24 hours. We will then systematically evaluatewhich combination of existing FNRBC enrichment methods provides maximum yield and purity suitable for subsequent Parental Support -based genetic analysis using predefined mixtures of fetal and adult blood. The main objective of Phase II will be to transition from the predefined blood mixtures of fetal and adult blood to actual maternal blood samples. We will first conduct a pilot study to determine which of the best FNRBC isolation method(s) identified in Phase I should become the lead method. Using this lead method, we will then conduct a larger study to evaluate concordance between aneuploidy diagnosis by Parental SupportTM and karyotyping by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. If successful, we expect that the completion of these Aims would have amajor impact on the field of prenatal diagnosis, improve the lives of millions of couples and children worldwide, and bring non-invasive diagnosis to the mainstream of prenatal medicine.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the absence of prenatal diagnosis, up to 1 in 50 babies have serious physical or mental handicaps, up to 1 in 30 babies have some form of congenital malformation, and up to 1 in 200 have a phenotypically significant chromosome abnormality Although these abnormalities can be diagnosed withtechniques such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, both procedures carry an increased risk of harm to both the mother and fetus. Our innovative technology has the potential to evaluate the health of an unborn child by simply analyzing the mother&#039;s blood, thereby minimizing the risks of the procedure and expanding prenatal screening to the general population.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Severe hyperbilirubinemia (defined as serum bilirubin levels greater than 99th percentile) can cause a spectrum of neurologic dysfunction, of which kernicterus has the most devastating neurologic consequences. Kernicterus manifests as a life-long movement disorder with occulomotor and auditory dysfunction. In developing countries such as India, 5%-12% of all newborns are reported to develop severe hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn period. Among premature infants, incidence of hyperbilirubinemia warranting treatment has been reported to be as high as 78%. In China, 35% of full term newborns were noted to have significant hyperbilirubinemia. Even in light of incidence that is much higher than noted in the United States andthe detrimental consequences associated, universal screening for hyperbilirubinemia is not currently available to the newborns in these developing nations. In cases of prolonged jaundice, measurement of total bilirubin alone does not suffice. Underlying causes such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and congenital hypothyroidism (CH) should be strongly considered. Infants with jaundice secondary to these conditions may not respond to traditional modes of therapy (such as phototherapy) until the underlying illness is addressed. The challenges of implementing a successful population-based newborn screening program in developing countries such as India and China are very different from countries with established programs. The paradigm of centralized newborn screening that works well in developed countries is quite challenging to implement in highly populated developing countries such as India or China. This is due to larger number of births, lower percentage of hospital births, and lack of logistical infrastructure to transport samples. There is therefore a compelling need for an inexpensive, scalable, and distributable newborn screening platform for use in these countries. Building upon successful results from phase I, we propose to build a laboratory prototype of a highly distributable low cost newborn screening platform suitable for use in India and China (Aim 1). We will design a low cost digital microfluidic cartridge to perform assays for total bilirubin, G6PD and TSH and verify analytical performance (Aim 2) and clinical performance (Aim 3).        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advanced Liquid Logic, Inc. is developing a lab-on-a-chip on its proprietary digital microfluidic platform for newborn screening. The proposed project aims to demonstrate a near-patient platform for screening neonates for hyperbilirubinemia which, if not detected in time, could lead to kernicterus leaving the child developmentally challenged for entire life. This inexpensive device would be greatly useful in rapid identification and to enable early treatment.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Wheelchair Drive System Over half of the wheelchair user population has developed upper extremity (UE) pain and injury. One of the activities that likely contribute to the development of injury is wheelchair propulsion. A number of technologies have been developed to address this issue including ergonomic pushrims, geared hub wheels, lever drives and pushrim-activated power assist wheels. While the non-powered technologies have been shown to incrementally reduce demandon the UE, power assist wheels can practically eliminate the demand. However, it is not reasonable to use power assist wheels when powered off due to their considerable weight. In essence, they are powered wheelchairs with pushrim-mounted joysticks. Thereis a need to develop a light-weight removable power drive system for a manual wheelchair that can be used selectively by the individual to reduce UE demand during the course of everyday propulsion activities. This project will develop a wheelchair drive system to meet this need and evaluate its efficacy through a series of focus group assessments and a long-term use study. As a result of this project, wheelchair users will gain access to technology that will reduce UE demand and hopefully reduce their riskof developing overuse injuries.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Wheelchair Drive System Relevance to Public Health Manual wheelchair users are at considerable risk of developing upper limb overuse injuries. One preventative measure is to reduce demand on theupper extremities during propulsion. This project will develop a lightweight removable drive system that can be used to provide propulsion assistance, thereby reducing physical demand and the likelihood of developing overuse injuries.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective for this project is to validate, commercialize, and further establish the clinical utility of a comprehensive set of genotyping assays to improve screening and diagnosis of conditions associated with fragile X syndrome (FXS). The relevance of testing for interspersed AGG sequences in CGG repeats has been proposed from population studies of fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene expansion. Both the number and sequence context of AGG repeats withinthe repeat CGG element have been proposed to confer stability to generational expansion. Although AGG interspersions are associated with the risk of triplet repeat expansion, these interspersions previously could not be determined in most female samples. We propose to refine the risk estimates for intermediate and premutation alleles by incorporating AGG interspersion information into the analysis of FMR1 allele transmissions from archived DNA samples using the definitive AGG mapping assays that we have developed. Our assay approach, leverages high throughput PCR and promises improved diagnostic and risk assessments for enabling accurate AGG genotyping, and definitive determination of the number of consecutive CGG repeats for each sample allele. We met or exceeded all proposed aims in the phase I grant. This success has resulted in complementary molecular genetic assays for FMR1 with comprehensive AGG genotyping capabilities. Our academic collaborators are involved in large clinical trials that will examine the genetic factors important for FMR1 repeat expansions, and our technology will be the centerpiece to evaluate the clinical utility of the interspersed AGG mapping for a range of FMR1 disorders. The aims for phase II are: Aim 1: Apply the assay technologies developed in Phase I to retrospective clinical samples to  more precisely define the clinical utility of AGG genotyping in CGG repeat  expansions. Aim 2: Develop a set of controls and standards for detection of AGG repeats and integrate  reagents, controls and QC metrics into a comprehensive workflow that supports the  PCR-based detection of AGG genotypes. Aim 3: Develop and test user-friendly software components for mapping AGG positions. Aim 4: Integrate and evaluate comprehensive test features developed in Aims 2 and 3.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are developing a rapid, and cost-effective molecular test to detect genetic mutation associated with Fragile X Syndrome. Fragile X is one of the most commonly inherited forms of mental retardation andcan also cause other disorders and conditions such as ADHD and autism. The diagnostic test is expected to identify people who have a high risk of passing the disorder onto their children.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During adolescence, youth undergo pivotal biological, emotional, and cognitive shifts. Concomitant with immense internal shifts, adolescent peer relations become increasingly complex (e.g., cliques) and challenging (e.g., peer pressure) and, as teens struggle to define their young adult role, relationships within the family can become increasingly strained and conflictual. When youth experience difficulties navigating the transitions of adolescence, they are at heightened risk for developing a variety of mental health disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety), maladaptive behavior patterns (e.g., self-destructive or risk-taking behaviors) and academic failure. Parents are often at a loss for how to communicate with their teento help them through the turmoil of adolescence. The resulting elevated levels of parental stress not only negatively impacts adolescent adjustment, but also places parents at heightened risk for their own mental health problems, particularly depression.This Phase II SBIR project will continue the research and development (RandD) of a unique parent training intervention product, the Parent Guide to Adolescent Social-Behavioral Development (PGA). PGA is specifically designed to help parents learn and practice strategies to effectively help their teen through the interpersonal struggles of adolescence (with peers and family members). PGA will help parents learn how to work collaboratively with their adolescent to achieve social goals, thereby building parental confidence, reducing related parental stress, and enhancing parent-teen communication. The full PGA product will offer manualized, structured scripts for 12 parent group sessions, a wide array of written, video, and web-based intervention materials forparents, and a variety of online professional development and implementation support resources for providers. Once the program is finalized, a scientific evaluation of its efficacy will be conducted. Parents will be randomly assigned to PGA treatment (TX)or attention control (AC) conditions (n=72 each). Efficacy will be evaluated by examining changes in (a) parent understanding of social issues facing adolescents and social problem solving skills; (b) parental self-efficacy for helping their teen; (c) parenting stress; (d) adolescent social and behavioral functioning; and (e) quality of the parent-teen relationship (e.g., communication, conflict) as a function of treatment condition. We expect the TX condition to show significant positive change in each outcome area versus the AC condition which is expected to show little to no change. PGA will be a highly unique, innovative product that will fill a niche in the intervention marketplace not currently filled through any other commercialized product. This SBIRwill yield a valuable resource for providers and parents with the potential to make a significant impact on the lives of adolescents and their families.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High Throughput Microrepository for Genetic Materials Recognizing the urgent need for a safe, rapid and reliable means of preserving and archiving genetic samples and other biological materials, such as synthetic DNA samples, unique isolated samples, plasmids, forensic samples, patient samples, samples to ensure future biodiversity in plants or animals, clones and archeological samples, a study panel recently convened by NIH NCRR identified the areas of most critical need and made several recommendations. The 1st and 5th items on their list of major recommendations were to  encourage the development of high throughput and scalable technologies for Germplasm processing and cryopreservation  and  support novel &#039;high risk/high return&#039; preservation technologies that will break new ground . We have directly and successfully addressed these needs with our Microrepository for Genetic Materials (MGM) technology which affords completely scalable, very high density sample storage with automated retrieval from arrays of optically multiplexed encoded beads by providing sample preparation-identification-archiving-retrieval functions on a single platform. For the Phase I effort, a completely automated prototype MGM platform was successfully built and tested. The MGM contains dense arrays of porous glass or polymer beads, groups of smaller beads or paper swatches, each of which contains a different DNA sample, which have been optically encoded with our rare earth-based Parallume technologywhich allows each bead to be optically identified uniquely. After placement of the DNA onto either single large beads, the beads are loaded into Bead Localization Slides (BLS), which optically isolate the beads into a planar monolayer for imaging, and theoptical code of each bead is read to determine the location of that particular DNA sample. The beads are retrieved and placed in the desired location and the lack of contamination during handling confirmed by qPCR. By performing additional experiments, including incorporation of new improved hardware designs and successfully changing the chemical composition of the Parallume encoding materials to prevent UV damage to the DNA, we have addressed all Reviewers&#039; concerns. We have now built and successfully tested a completely functional prototype MGM instrument and, in response to the insightful Reviewers&#039; comments, we have modified the Parallume materials so as to allow excitation with a longer wavelength of excitation light (365nm) which (a) prevents the photochemical decomposition of the DNA during optically decoding the samples, (b) allows non-UV optics to be used to focus the light and (c) lets much brighter, longer lived and less expensive LED light sources be used. A new surface chemistry, which stronglybinds the DNA to the bead until it is chemically released, will provide yet another level of sample contamination protection. The improved MGM described here represents the first substantial progress since inception of the field in addressing the rapidly expanding storage requirements for DNA and nucleic acids. A new storage paradigm which employs optically encoded bead technology provides a sample density, degree of automation and simplicity not currently possible and with scalability to successfully storeand retrieve any number of DNA samples for the foreseeable future.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In recent years there has been a very large increase in the number of samples of genetic materials such as DNA that have been synthesized or isolated from organisms. Some of these samples, such as an individual&#039;s DNA, forensic samples or genetic material from a new strain of bacteria are one-of-a-kind and cannot be replaced. However, there is currently no means to organize or automatically archive and retrieve DNA samples in an automatic and high throughput manner. Because of the increase in throughput from laboratories, governments, hospitals and universities, the problem is only expected to grow in the future.  We offer here a design of a new instrument platform designated as the Microrepository for Genetic Materials (MGM). The samples will be stored in arrays of porous glass beads with each of the beads displaying an optical code or signature that uniquely identifies that particular sample and the DNA withinthat bead. The DNA samples are each placed into a single highly porous bead with a diameter of 50 microns (0.05mm). The beads are optically encoded with our ParallumeTM technology which allows each bead to be identified by the intensity ratios of the different colors emitted by the bead upon excitation. Thus, thousands of beads can be mixed together, each identified by its unique optical code and removed from the storage array using an optical fiber to pick it up. After checking the optical signature by examining the emitted light when the bead is picked up by the optical fiber, the bead can be placed in the desired destination location. Thus, we are able to design and build a repository that can store hundreds of thousands of DNA samples in a robust and inexpensive manner. This MGM technology is completely scalable and should provide rapid and accurate DNA storage and retrieval capacity for the foreseeable future.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an extremely compact and inexpensive DNA sequence for applications in laboratory and clinical settings. The device will implement pyrosequencing on a disposable droplet based  digital microfluidic  cartridge and will be capable of sequencing 10&#039;s to 100&#039;s of nucleotides at a very low cost per run and at a low initial equipment investment. This platform will also integrate sample preparation, including DNA amplification, with sequencing to provide the integration and ease-of-use demanded of clinicians and other non-specialists who require DNA sequence data. The initial application for this capability will be microbial pathogen identification. In Phase I, a prototype was developed and the microfluidic protocols and biochemical reaction conditions for pyrosequencing were optimized. As a feasibility demonstration 20-40 base pairs within the ITS2 genetic region were sequenced for 13 different molds and yeasts which provided unambiguous identification of each isolate. In Phase II, this success will be built upon by integrating sample preparation steps including DNA concentration, DNA amplification, and template preparation into the system. The integrated system will be evaluated andcompared to other commercially available solutions in terms of speed, cost and accuracy of fungal identification. Further optimization of the pyrosequencing biochemistry will be performed to enable longer read lengths on shorter time scales while retaining high accuracy. Finally, a data analysis tool will be developed to automate base calling and database queries. The final product will represent a streamlined approach to fungal species identification, integrating a number of components of the contemporarypathogen identification workflow.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A compact and inexpensive instrument which can automatically identify fungal isolates by sequencing a small region of their DNA will be developed and tested.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tremendous advances in genomics during the past two decades hold great potential for the development of new health innovations. For this potential to be realized in the form of advances in biomedical research and novelprevention, diagnosis, treatment and disease management strategies, we must overcome one technological barrier, namely the ability to perform reliable molecular profiling analyses of low quantity cells/nucleic acid material. Current technologies are not suitable for most low-quantity nucleic applications, and require multiple nucleic acid manipulation and amplification steps that are known to introduce biases and artifacts that confound downstream analyses and reduce/eliminate quantitative power. This grantapplication proposes various strategies for picogram-level DNA and RNA samples to be profiled in an unbiased and amplification-free, high-throughput manner, and paves the way towards single cell measurements. In Phase I, we will set the groundwork for unprecedented technologies enabling attomole-level, amplification-free high- throughput genomics tools. The Phase I specific aims are: (1) Optimization of DNA tailing and sequencing surface capture steps, (2) Development of DNA fragmentation strategies suitable for low DNA quantities, (3) Specific capture and sequencing of polyA+ mRNA from total RNA, and (4) Development of single-step sequence selection and single molecule sequencing technology. In Phase II, we will expand our work from Phase I to develop mature procedures ready for commercialization. The Phase II specific aims are: (1) High- throughput sequencing of limiting DNA samples, (2) Sequencing minute polyA+ RNA quantities using direct RNA sequencing, (3) Optimization of tailing and surface capture steps for direct RNA sequencing, (4) cDNA- based low-quantity RNA sequencing on surface, and (5) Development of a sequencing strategy for damaged and limited quantity nucleic acid samples. These advancements will enable various long desired and needed studies, open new research frontiers and provide a comprehensive understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying disease states, such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and others, ultimately leading to revolutionary new ways to diagnose, treat and preventhuman disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The sequencing of the first human genome was an unprecedented scientific achievement derived from 13 years of effort by an international coalition of scientists and some  3 billion in funds. The availabilityof a complete human genome sequence has facilitated research by providing a framework for the genome, now being used for further investigation into the biological mechanisms underlying human disease. Technological advancements now enable sequencing of genomes at a fraction of the time and cost, and the widespread application of high-throughput sequencing technologies has transformed the biomedical research field. However, several fundamental technical shortcomings still remain. Among these limitations, arguably the most critical one is the requirement for high-quantities of valuable input material, namely DNA/RNA. Progress in many research areas, such as, but not limited to, stem cell biology, microbiology, cancer, paleoarcheology, forensics, and clinical diagnostics, is severely impeded by our inability to perform comprehensive and reliable molecular profiling analyses on low-quantity cell and nucleic acid samples. If we are to successfully translate this research knowledge of genome biology to better diagnosing and treating human disease, we must reliably use and analyze minute quantities of nucleic acid derived from patient specimens. This grant application proposes various strategies for picogram-level DNA and RNA samples to be profiled in an unbiased andamplification-free, high-throughput manner, and paves the way towards single cell measurements. These advancements will enable various long desired and needed studies, open new research frontiers and provide a comprehensive understanding of the biologicalmechanisms underlying disease states, such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and others, ultimately leading to revolutionary new ways to diagnose, treat and prevent human disease.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Next generation DNA sequencing (NGS) technologies hold great promise as tools for building a new understanding of health and disease. In the case of understanding cancer, deep sequencing provides more sensitive ways todetect the germline and somatic mutations that cause different types of cancer as well as identify new mutations within small subpopulations of tumor cells that can be prognostic indicators of tumor growth or drug resistance. Completing the transition fromproof of principal applications to practical applications, however, requires that many basic and clinical research groups to be able to effectively utilize NGS. Ongoing technical developments and intense vendor competition amongst NGS platform and serviceproviders are commoditizing data collection costs making systems more assessable. However, the single greatest impediment to the adoption of NGS technology is the lack of systems that create easy access to the immense bioinformatics and IT infrastructuresneeded to work with the data. In the case of variant analysis, such systems will need to process very large datasets, and accurately predict common, rare, and de novo levels of variation. Genetic variation must be presented in an annotation-rich, biological context to determine the clinical utility, frequency, and putative biological impact. Software systems used for this work must integrate data from many samples together with resources ranging from core analysis algorithms to application specific datasets to annotations, all woven into computational systems with interactive user interfaces (UIs). Such end-to-end systems currently do not exist. In this project, Geospiza will create integrated methods for robust detection and rich contextualization of genetic variants. Using variation analysis in cancer genomics as a model system, we will conduct research to improve assay sensitivity by deeply characterizing data from existing and emerging NGS platforms, quality value (QV) recalibration tools, and alignmentalgorithms, to understand the systematic artifacts that create errors in the data. To improve how researchers understand a variant&#039;s biological context, function and potential clinical utility, we will develop methods to combine assay results from many samples with de novo NGS datasets for assays like RNA-Seq and existing data such as those in GEO and SRA, and information resources from dbSNP, cancer genome databases, and ENCODE. Finally, we will develop the necessary scalable computing infrastructure and novel UI&#039;s needed to organize and process the data and explore and annotate the results. Through this work, and follow on product development, we will produce integrated sensitive assay systems that harness NGS for identifying very low (1:1000) levels of changes between DNA sequences to detect cancerous mutations and emerging drug resistance. Our tools and infrastructure can be later applied in assays designed to follow viral epidemics, and understand autoimmune disorders.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: TheSBIR project  Software Systems for Detecting Rare Mutations  will deliver new software technologies to further advance the applications for deep DNA sequencing in personalized medicine by improving methods for detecting rare mutations that define cancer types and determine how a cancer cell may grow and respond to, or resist, treatment. In addition to improving cancer research and diagnostics, the software developed will have general use for any application where DNA sequencing is used to understand the genetic basis of human health, disease, and response to drug therapies.",

However the control of these pumps presents some difficulties because of their sensitivity to circulatory load and ability to draw blood under negative pressure.  In a Phase I and Phase II effort, we have developed advanced algorithms to mimic the physiological control of blood flow and pressure by developing algorithms suitable for rotary ventricular assist devices, and specifically testing them on the WorldHeart Levacor  VAD system. At this juncture, additional verification testing and validation is required to meet regulatory requirements so that these control improvements may be provided to patients receiving VAD therapy.

At Discovery Genomics, Inc. (DGI), we are working to develop the SB transposon system for human gene therapy, with hemophilia as our lead project. During initial Phase II SBIR studies, we demonstrated effective delivery of SB transposon DNA to the liver of dogs. Single or double ballooncatheters were used to achieve whole or partial occlusion of the liver followed by rapid, high volume retrograde infusion of DNA containing solution into the hepatic venous circulation. Results from these experiments (reporter gene expression was observedfor six weeks following infusion) place DGI at the forefront of non-viral gene therapy efforts targeting the liver in large animals. Based on these results and recent feedback from the Food and Drug Administration, in this Phase II competing renewal application we propose further preclinical studies to address issues of safety, scale-up to the size of humans, and efficacy in a large animal model of hemophilia. The Specific Aims are; (i) To develop double balloon catheters capable of delivering SB transposonDNA to the liver in humans and to test the safety and effectiveness of these catheters for DNA delivery in pigs as a large animal model of comparable size to human beings; (ii) To extend the duration of transgene expression after delivery of SB transposons to the liver of normal dogs, using DGI&#039;s unique canine secreted alkaline phosphatase (cSEAP) reporter system; (iii) To deliver SB transposons encoding canine clotting factor IX (cFIX) to the liver of cFIX deficient dogs, testing for long-term expressionof cFIX and improved clotting function as a large animal model for SB mediated gene therapy of hemophilia B.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed Phase II Renewal is aimed at finalizing the research and development of a new and greatly improved long term extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO) for patients afflicted with severe respiratory and/orcardiac failure. Results from Phase II work indicate that we have developed a significantly improved ECMO oxygenator that outperforms currently used and outdated membrane technology. In Phase II we demonstrated that our proprietary silicone membrane hollowfiber coupled with our proposed oxygenator design enabled the development of a significantly improved ECMO oxygenator sized for newborn babies, children, and adults. The only oxygenator currently approved and used for this purpose in the US was developedin 1963. MedArray&#039;s new silicone hollow fibers and oxygenator design have enabled the development of a compact device with significantly improved gas transfer, lower priming volume, less surface area to minimize inflammatory response, improved blood flow dynamics, reduced blood resistance, and lower cost.  Since ECMO oxygenators are used for long term (more than 1 day), the membrane cannot be microporous because of plasma leakage and membrane fowling. Therefore these oxygenators must use dense membranes which have no pores for plasma to leak through. Silicone is a dense membrane material with extremely high permeability to oxygen and CO2 and is therefore used in ECMO oxygenators. Silicone membranes have been commercially produced in sheet configuration but,they have not been produced in the more efficient hollow fiber configuration. Thus current ECMO oxygenators use spiral wound silicone sheet membranes which are not as efficient and compact as hollow fiber membranes. MedArray has developed a proprietary (patented) method for fabricating silicone membrane hollow fibers in a cost effective and commercially feasible way that has enabled the development of a long due improved ECMO oxygenator. The proposed Phase II Renewal work includes further device improvements using computational fluid dynamics, modeling of gas exchange, and bench and in vivo testing. Moreover we intend to complete a series of FDA-required pre-clinical and effectiveness studies necessary to seek clearance from the FDA to initiate the clinicalphase.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The relevance of this research project is that it will result in a significantly improved long term extracorporeal oxygenator for newborn babies and older patients afflicted with severe respiratory and/or cardiac failure. The only oxygenator currently used and approved for this purpose in the US was developed in the early 1960s, and is long due for improvements currently available. This research will enable the development of a compact oxygenator with greatly improvedgas transfer, lower priming volume, improved flow dynamics, lower blood resistance, and lower cost.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS involves both procoagulant and inflammatory mechanisms. Extravascular fibrin deposition in the lung is a characteristic pathologic feature of ALI/ARDS and intra-alveolar thrombi develop inthe lungs of patients with ALI/ARDS. Tissue factor (TF), the trigger protein for activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway, has a direct role in promoting these effects as indicated by the elevated levels of TF observed in plasma of ALI/ARDS patientscompared to control patients with hydrostatic pulmonary edema. These higher plasma TF levels correlated with increased mortality, fewer ventilator-free days, the presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation and the progression to sepsis in patientswith ALI/ARDS, suggesting that systemic activation of coagulation may be clinically important in ALI/ARDS. Additionally, TF levels in pulmonary edema fluid from patients with ALI/ARDS were significantly higher than in control patients. In fact, pulmonary TF levels in patients with ALI/ARDS were found to be approximately 100-fold higher than corresponding plasma levels, suggesting an intra-alveolar source of TF. As a result, we have been interested in developing TF antagonists as a therapeutic strategy for treating ALI/ARDS and other inflammatory disorders. In an experimental E. coli sepsis-induced ALI model in non-human primates, we have shown that an anti-TF monoclonal antibody, ALT-836, could attenuate sepsis-induced abnormalities in gas exchange, pulmonary hypertension, and loss of pulmonary system compliance. The results from our pre-clinical studies prompted us to conduct a single-bolus, dose-escalating, Phase 1/2a trial followed by a 120-patient, 1:1 randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial(with the option to adjust the dosing regimen after an interim analysis of the first 60 enrolled ALI/ARDS patients). The results of the 18-patient Phase 1/2a trial and first 60 patients of the Phase 2 trial indicated that ALT-836 exhibits favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and is well tolerated at the dose level of 0.06 mg/kg as a single bonus infusion. Analysis of the Phase 2 interim data also suggests that single-dose ALT-836 treatment provides beneficial effects to patients during the first one-two weeks of the treatment period. Thus, an independent study is warranted to examine whether the clinical and biological effects observed with single dose regimen could be extended with multiple doses. Under this SBIR Phase II Competing Renewal proposal, we intend to conduct a 90-patient, 1:1 randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial to examine the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of multi-dose administration of ALT-836 at the 0.06 mg/kg dose level in patients with sepsis-induced ALI/ARDS. Altor also has an in-licensing agreement in place with Genentech for this product and anticipates that positive clinical results from the proposed study will prompt Genentech to sponsor a large Phase 3 registration trial for regulatory approval of ALT-836 by the US FDA.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this proposal is to evaluate the clinical utility of a novel anti-tissue factor monoclonal antibody, ALT-836, for treatment of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a 90-patient, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center Phase 2 clinical study using a multi-dose regimen. If this trial successfully achieves its clinical efficacy endpoints, ALT-836 will then be tested in a pivotal Phase 3 registration trial needed for regulatory approval in order to become the first effective pharmaceutical treatment approved for ALI/ARDS and address this large unmet medical need.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New therapies are in development for COPD (endobronchial valves/stents/glue) and asthma (endobronchial thermal ablation). Hyperpolarized xenon-129 (HXe) MRI, a noninvasive method to assess regional lung structure and function, may prove critical in the guidance of these regional treatments. In our prior work we developed an innovative approach to xenon polarization that provides the liter quantities of highly polarized xenon-129 as required for medical imaging. Our prototype system was deployed at UVa where we performed 600 experiments in 64 patient and healthy volunteers and made significant advances in MR acquisition strategies and image quality. These promising results enable us to move to the next step in the commercialization of HXe, the performance of a Phase 2 clinical trial. Our goals for Phase 2 are to collect safety endpoints in patients with obstructive lung diseases, finalize the HXe dosing and MRI methods, and validate the HXe results by comparing with the existing clinical methods for assessing lung function and  microstructure. We selected the two most mature and promising HXe techniques for inclusion in the Phase 2 trial: ventilation and diffusion imaging. Obstructive lung diseases such as COPD and asthma have been shown to have regional abnormalities of ventilation and these abnormalities are prime targets for intervention. Thus our first aim is to validate HXe MRI for the intended use of delineating ventilated and unventilated regions of the lung in COPD and asthma patients. For our Phase 2a trial we will compare HXe ventilation MRI and 99Tc DTPA ventilation scintigraphy (a clinical standard for assessing regional lung ventilation) in 10 healthy volunteers and 70 patients with COPD and asthma. In addition tothe patient safety data, we will assess total lung volume and ventilated lung volume on MRI, and the congruence of ventilated volume boundaries between HXe MRI and scintigraphy. Recently completed pilot studies show that hyperpolarized helium diffusion imaging with six b-values can  separately determine diffusion coefficients along and transverse to acinar ducts, which are related to alveolar depth and duct diameter. Our second aim is to validate HXe diffusion MR for the intended use of quantifying alveolar enlargement in emphysema, a fundamental abnormality that currently is assessed only by histology. For our Phase 2b trial we will perform diffusion HXe MRI in vivo in 18 COPD patients scheduled for lung transplant, and repeat the scan in the ex vivo lungafter it is removed, thereby establishing that in vivo and ex vivo HXe measurements are concordant. The final step in the validation of the HXe diffusion measurement is to regionally compare alveolar size with morphometric measurements via histology from the explanted lung. The final portion of the proposed work is to raise quality to Phase 3 level, design a draft Phase 3 trial, meet with the FDA for a pre-Phase 3 meeting, and incorporate the FDA input into the Phase 3 protocol. The completion of the proposed work represents a significant advancement towards commercialization of HXe.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of treatments that cure lung diseases has been slowed by the lack of a method for obtaining regional and quantitative informationabout lung function, especially in obstructive disease. Hyperpolarized xenon MRI is a safe and cost-effective imaging modality that has the potential to meet this need. Once hyperpolarized xenon becomes FDA approved and commercially available, this new MRI contrast agent will improve care and reduce costs in two ways: (1) regional maps of lung function acquired using HXe MRI will guide newly emerging bronchoscopic interventions, and (2) utilization of HXe MRI in drug and medical device clinical trials willimprove their statistics and reduce their time-to- market. We propose two prospective controlled FDA Phase 2 clinical trials that will provide data on safety and efficacy endpoints for these intended uses.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coramed is commercializing next-generation point of care instruments, the TEG 6000 series, for monitoring patient hemostasis on demand. This project includes activities to take the technology from the prototype stage completed in Phase II to FDA-cleared and CLIA-waived commercial products. The planned devices introduce a completely new technology for monitoring coagulation - one well suited for use across the continuum of care from inside the hospital to ambulatory careclinics, physician offices, ambulances, battlefields, and ultimately patient homes. A device that produces timely and equivalent results, regardless of device location or operator, can substantially enhance the standard of care for patients with a tendencyto clot and can improve clinical outcomes at a reduced cost. The TEG 6000 series devices are successors to the widely accepted Thrombelastograph (R) (TEG(R)) TEG5000 Hemostasis System, which is used to measure all phases and states of patient hemostasis,including a prothrombotic state. However, despite the clinical and commercial success of the TEG5000 system, its configuration precludes general use in some point- of-care locations within and outside the hospital. The sample size and testing complexity require personnel who can perform phlebotomy, are able to pipette, and who are trained in QC and other lab procedures. Enabling use of these devices outside the hospital in sites such as physician offices will allow accessible screening for risk of heart attacks and stroke, and monitoring of anticoagulation and anti-platelet therapy. Achieving this goal requires compact and easy to use instruments such as the TEG 6000 series.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes the development of a new TEG 6000 series of the currently marketed Thrombelastograph(R) (TEG(R)) Hemostasis System (TEG 5000). The TEG 6000 series incorporates a novel method for monitoring the viscoelastic properties of clots during formation and breakdown and is suitable for use in environments inside and outside the hospital, ultimately including patient homes. This provides the capability to screen for risk of heart attack or stroke in a physician&#039;s office, clinics, ambulances, battlefields and other point of patient contact locations. Monitoring blood coagulation at a patient&#039;s point of care results in better patient outcomes and fewer complications.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Lung transplants remain the final treatment for many conditions. However, appropriate and available lungs are far fewer than the number of people who need them, leaving many patients to further deterioriate or die while waiting for a transplant. Moreover, there are many patients with insufficient lung function, including those suffering from lung cancer, who are not eligible for a lung transplant. Direct gas exchange between air and blood would provide respiratory support independent of injured lungs and allow the lungs to heal and recover. A device that can oxygenate using room air, rather than compressed air, and has a sufficiently small blood side pressure drop would greatly simplify and improve extracorporeal oxygenation. With the added requirements of long-term safety and efficacy, such a device would realize the final goal of a fully implantable artificial lung. Infoscitex has assembled a team of experts to further develop the technology for a family of vascular gasexchange devices. These devices use available room air and will likely reduce the need for anticoagulation methods compared to other devices currently available or in development. The research program detailed in this proposal will provide the necessary foundation to complete development of the technology for the implantable artificial lung, including initial animal trials. The proposed effort will result in the data necessary to secure the funding and approval for the next stage of device development andeventual market introduction.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of an implantable artificial lung based on direct vascular gas exchange performed directly from room air and requiring low levels of anticoagulation is proposed. Our device utilizes a novel two-stage gas exchange system that oxygenates blood via a liquid-liquid interface. This interface, by eliminating the contact of blood to a membrane, reduces fouling of the gas exchange surface which is the limiting factor in other devices under development.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Extracorporeal support (ECPR) improves survival in resuscitation from cardiac arrest from 5% to 30%. Extracorporeal support facilitates the salvage of donor organs after cardiac death (DCD). The Institute of Medicine report states that innovative methods to salvage DCD organs are the highest priority in organ transplantation. However ECS is rarely used for these applications. The limiting factor is the need for a simple automatic perfusion system which is inherently safe, can be initiated by paramedical personnel, and provides full support without operator intervention. MC3 is uniquely positioned to develop such a device. The research team at the University of Michigan has demonstrated that ECPR is feasible and results in30% healthy survival. The same team has shown that mechanical organ perfusion after death by cardiac arrest (DCD-ECS) restores liver and kidney function to transplantable status. Moreover, after transplantation these DCD-ECS organs are even more successful than organs from heart-beating brain dead donors. The goal of this research project is to design and produce a simple Automatic Perfusion System (APS) for extracorporeal support to facilitate ECPR and organ salvage from donors after cardiac arrest. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of this research project is to design and produce a simple Automatic Perfusion System (APS) for extracorporeal support as an adjunct to CPR in cardiac arrest, and to facilitate organ salvage from donors after cardiac arrest. ECPR can increase healthy survival in arrest from 5% to 30%. Salvaging organs from cardiac arrest donors could increase the availability of organs tenfold.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Within the last seven years, Drosophila melanogaster or common fruit fly has gained an important niche in becoming an invertebrate model organism for exploring genetic and proteomic mechanisms underlying sleep. While agreat deal of progress has been made in the field of Drosophila sleep research using available tools, they are limited for the observation, recording and analysis of sleep (immobility) periods in the fruit fly. Additionally, no existing system is capable of individually sleep-depriving flies on an as- needed basis. This proposal outlines a system explicitly designed to measure small amounts of motion in the Drosophila and, as such, more accurately estimate sleep than any available system. In conjunction with this detection device we also propose the design of a mechanized system capable of automatically sleep depriving individual flies through a fully-programmable computerized interface. The system will also provide a flexible behavioral platform for the controlled introduction of modalities based on light, temperature, scent, sound, etc. Phase I of this proposal successfully demonstrated a device to record and analyze motion patterns and sleep as well as enforce wakefulness in individually housed flies. Phase II will build this prototype device into an automated, scalable, modular system capable of monitoring and sleep depriving 160+ flies housed within a commercial incubator. Accomplishment of this project will involve a collaborative effort between PinnacleTechnology and the world-renowned Drosophila research team at The University of Pennsylvania. Prototyping and design will continue to be undertaken by Pinnacle Technology while testing and refinement of the system will be accomplished by the University ofPennsylvania team. The combination of these two features specifically designed to record and automatically analyzes sleep in the fly, will provide a new and powerful tool for Drosophila researchers to explore the basic genetics underlying sleep. Technological innovations of this system will include enhanced video recognition software, mechanisms to observe multiple flies with a single video camera and the technology to selectively deprive individual flies of sleep. Control of individual fly sleep deprivation and real-time visualization of data will be available though a web-based control system. After completion, the system will be validated by testing with known sleep mutations and validated by a trained human observer. Commercial applications of such a device are already being sought by major pharmaceutical companies as they explore new potential gene products for targeted therapy.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that at least 40 million Americans suffer each year from chronic, long-term sleep disorders while an additional 20 million experience occasional sleeping problems. Economically, poor sleep accounts for an estimated  16 billion in medical costs each year and the indirect costs of lost productivity and other factors are known to be much higher. While the links between inadequate sleep and poor health and productivity are becoming clearer, there is a dire need to understand the basic causes and biological need for sleep.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Valvular heart diseases are conventionally overshadowed by the very high prevalence of coronary disease. However, moderate to severe valvular heart disease is present in more than 12% of patients over the age of 70 andpresent in 80% or more of patients admitted with congestive heart failure [1]. The proper cardiac evaluation must therefore include an accurate evaluation of valvular structure and function. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has been shown to be one of the best technologies for the evaluation of valvular pathologies. The broad application of this promising technology is expected to significantly improve the treatment of patients with heart diseases. However, widespread adoption of this beneficial technology has been held back by the lack of both software infrastructure and specific software sequences that take advantage of this infrastructure to provide a complete cardiac examination that can be performed rapidly in the clinical environment. The aim of thisapplication is to develop a commercial robust cardiovascular subsystem that will enable the broad application of this technology to the clinical realm.  Under previous NIH grant support through Stanford University, we have established real-time rapid imaging se- quences for the assessment of wall motion, valvular morphology, color flow mapping and quantitation of valvular steno- sis. We have also established the feasibility of rapidly quantitating each of these parameters. Our goal in this proposal is to integrate these methods into a robust valvular heart disease system to realize the clinical potential of cardiac MRI in the complete evaluation of heart disease.  During Phase I of this proposal, HeartVista developed and tested the alpha version of the cardiovascular software infrastructure that provides an integrated environment for rapid valvular imaging. This package includes real-time evaluation of ventricular function, real-time quantitative flow mapping, interrogation of high-velocity jets, and detailed assessment of valvular morphology. We installed the system at selected alpha sites and collected patient data.  Generally, our methods concern 7 obtaining adequate temporal resolution, spatial coverage, and contrast production for valvular imaging usingcustomized pulse sequences and hardware to reduce data acquisition time, 7 developing a underlying real-time imaging platform that allows the seamless real-time integration of receiver coil functions, pulse sequences, and post-processing and display that optimizes the workflow for studying patients with valvular disease. This proposal focuses on developing and validating this combined examination to provide the clinician a robust and intuitive complete cardiac evaluation package that can be performed comfortably in less than 1 hour.  During Phase II of this proposal, we will continue the development of our product based on the feedback obtained during Phase I and we will conduct a clinical study to demonstrate the non-inferiority of our product compared withconventional cardiovascular MRI examinations in robustness and diagnostic accuracy.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Valvular heart disease is increasingly common in our aging population in the United States. Valvular disease com- plicates as many as 80% of patients admitted for heart failure [2], and moderate to severe valvular heart disease is present in more than 12% of patients over the age of 70 [1]. The evaluation of common cardiac complaints such as shortness of breath must always include an assessment of valvular heart disease. Conventional echocardiography provides excellent qualitative data but does not provide quantitative information on all the important parameters relating to valvular disease. Current MRI techniques are quantitative but have significant shortcomings related to usability and prolonged examination times. A comprehensive valvular examination is therefore not normally part of a cardiac MRI examination. However, ad hoc or  incidental  examination is important given the prevalence of valvular disease that is co-morbid in other heart conditions. Given the enormous number of these patients, even a modest improvement in diagnostic accuracy will have a large public-health impact.  Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has been shown to be oneof the best technologies for the evaluation of cardiovascular pathologies. It is the only imaging modality that could qualitatively and quantitatively measure all of the important valvular parameters including ventricular function, cardiac output, valvularregurgitation and valvular stenosis in a single examination. The broad application of this promising technology is expected to significantly improve the treatment of patients with heart disease. However, the adoption of this beneficial technology has beenheld back by the lack of both a software infrastructure and specific software sequences that take advantage of this infrastructure to provide a complete cardiovascular examination that can be performed rapidly in the clinical environment.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minimally invasive treatments using catheters to correct a serious cardiovascular problem has revolutionized cardiovascular care. Almost a million such procedures take place each year in the United States. These procedures are guided by X-ray visualization of the vessels, angiography. After several decades of research, it has been established that adding functional measurements, i.e. measures of blood pressure and flow, to guidance by angiography significantly improves patients&#039; outcomes and reduces costs. However, most procedures today still use only angiography; currently, functional measurement requires expensive specialized devices and equipment and certain specialized skills. DVX has invented a new kind of blood flowmeasuring Doppler ultrasound sensor that is inexpensive and can be mounted directly on a catheter. In the Phase I proof-of-concept portion of the research program, this sensor, mounted on a dummy catheter, was shown to work well in animal trials. DVX alsodetermined how a tiny chip pressure sensor could be mounted alongside of the flow sensor so that full functional measurement of blood pressure and flow could be accomplished by a device mounted on a catheter. Bench tests proved the device&#039;s high accuracywas not affected by the angle of the catheter to the blood flow, in contrast to previous Doppler ultrasound devices that suffered from orientation sensitivity. In the proposed Phase II, the pressure and flow sensors will be integrated onto procedural catheters, such as for balloon angioplasty or stent placement, and the safety and usefulness of the device in guiding procedures demonstrated in animal studies. It is the goal of Phase II to advance the development of the catheter-mounted device to where clinical trials on humans will be appropriate and desirable. These studies should lead to widespread application of functional measurement in catheter-based procedures, improving patient outcome and reducing costs for millions of patients per year.        PUBLICHEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this program is to improve the performance of catheter-based procedures in the circulatory system. By adding an innovative ultrasound device to catheters, the catheters will provide more accurate treatment, leading to betterpatient care at reduced cost.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It was recently discovered that the adult human heart contains small numbers of resident cardiac stem cells. These stem cells are incapable of mounting a full-scale repair of the heart following a heart attack (or myocardial infarction). However, when cultivated in the lab and delivered to animals after a myocardial infarction, these cells can initiate repair processes, form new heart muscle and new vessels. Capricor, Inc. has a method to cultivate resident cardiac stemcells which is known as the cardiosphere method. Cardiospheres can be generated starting with only a small cardiac biopsy that can be obtained during an outpatient procedure. The cardiosphere method is being developed for commercialization as an autologoustreatment for cardiovascular disease in general. This project aims to make the cardiosphere method faster, cheaper, and simpler. Cell culture techniques will be modified and product equivalence demonstrated by flow cytometry.es will be applied to determine the efficacy of each cell product. This project will also explore the feasibility of product banking, such that a patient could preserve stem cells for a future application. Cells will be subjected to a controlled-rate freeze followed by a thaw process after a period of banking in liquid nitrogen. Measures of viability and potency will be made to identify any detrimental effects. Finally, with a focus on future clinical trials, we will develop assays that will allow us to predict the potency, or efficacy,of a particular patient&#039;s sample. Another series of animal studies will be conducted to measure potency in the setting of myocardial infarction, while a series of simple lab potency assays will be developed in parallel as candidate predictors. Cardiosphere-derived stem cells are already being moved toward a Phase I/II clinical safety trial.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately a third (31%) of adult Americans are prehypertensive (SBP 120-139 and/or DBP 80-89). Health care providers struggle to provide effective support for blood-pressure-lowering behavior changes, while patientscontinue to progress to full hypertension and the use of antihypertensive medications. Insurers and providers with access to electronic medical records and other medical data are in a unique position to identify prehypertensive adults and target them witha blood pressure self-management program. Preventing or delaying hypertension should reduce mid-term costs of antihypertensive medications and, more importantly, long-term costs of care for heart disease and stroke. This project will develop and evaluatea coach-guided, interactive blood pressure self-management program for adults with prehypertension. The program will target blood pressure self-monitoring and the five proven lifestyle modifications recommended by JNC-7: weight reduction, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, sodium reduction, physical activity, and alcohol consumption. The multi-modal program uses a combination of brief motivational health coaching, periodic engagement emails, and a robust interactive website to motivatepeople to take charge of their blood pressure management before they require medication. All program components were designed to conform to the underlying principles of motivational interviewing. Key program components include the use of email and Web-based social networking, personal stories, and brief motivational coaching sessions to engage participants and encourage intrinsically motivated behavior changes. Self-assessment and tracking tools are combined with educational content to help participants align their daily lifestyle choices with their personal goals. The Phase I prototype program promoted moderate physical activity and eating fruits and vegetables as part of the DASH diet. Results from the within-group (n = 39) evaluation showed moderate-to-large effect sizes for pre-to-post change in motivation, preparation behavior, self-efficacy, attitudes, and knowledge, and a small significant increase in physical activity. Participants gave the online program high ratings on satisfaction and usability, and reported improvements in confidence, readiness, clarity, change strategies, and interest in visiting the Website as a result of the coaching session. The fully developed Phase II product will be evaluated in a large randomized trial (N = 450) with a 3-month intensive period, a 3-month maintenance period, and a 3-month follow-up period. The Phase II trial is expected to show improvements in JNC-recommended BP-lowering health behaviors. These changes in the outcome measures are expected to be mediated by changes in knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, behavioral intention, motivation, and patient activation.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is focused on the development of a bioabsorbable polymeric scaffold intended to provide both time-release delivery of therapeutic agents as well as structural support in the treatment of aortic aneurysms.An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a condition in which the aorta, the main blood vessel in the abdomen, expands like a balloon. The aneurysm weakens the wall of the aorta and can result in rupture. Because the volume of blood flowing through the aortais under relatively high pressure, a rupture can be catastrophic, resulting in death. Up to 75% of patients are asymptomatic prior rupture. In the United States, approximately one in every 250 people over the age of 50 will die of a ruptured aortic aneurysm. Aortic aneurysms affect as many as eight percent of people over the age of 65 and remains the 13th leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 15,000 deaths each year.  Research has shown that in the setting of AAA formation, the smooth muscle component of the arterial wall undergoes apoptosis and ceases to be mechanically relevant. The adventitia becomes thickened and assumes the role as the major load bearing component of the vessel wall. Overall, these results have lead us tosuggest that since the adventitia is the vulnerable component of the arterial wall in advanced AAA, that an  outside-in  therapy to mechanically and biologically stabilize the vessel wall may represent a more efficacious approach to aneurysm repair than those currently offered.  MedShape Solutions has developed a series of bioabsorbable polymers capable of carrying various therapeutic agents. The proposed bioabsorbable polymeric scaffold will be developed to provide for the delivery of an agent to treat the aneurysmal tissue as well as provide structural support for the diseased portion of the aorta to prevent further expansion and/or rupture. In addition, the polymer chemistries under development are capable of in-situ polymerization which would allow theplacement of the scaffold around aortic segments that would normally be classified as having unfavorable anatomy and that might go untreated otherwise. Finally, the delivery system to be developed will be compatible with laparoscopic techniques which wouldmake it significantly less invasive than surgical repair.  The aims of the Phase II proposal are to fundamentally investigate the polymeric scaffolding chemistry as it relates to mechanical characteristics as well as biodegradation and drug elution. In addition, the prototype delivery system for the drug/device combination will be finalized and evaluated in vivo in a 12 week large animal efficacy study. The primary research team will consist of Jack Griffis (PI), who is an expert in cardiovascular device development; Ken Gall PhD, a professor from Georgia Tech who specializes in polymers; and W. Robert Taylor, MD, a cardiologist from Emory University that specializes in AAA, as well as two other prominent vascular and cardiothoracic surgeons that will provide input into the surgical approach.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) affect as many as eight percent of people over the age of 65 and remains the 13th leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 14,000 deaths each year. In addition, for those who receive treatment, surgical revision rates are as high as 26% and up to 50% of those diagnosed are not eligible for the latest, minimally invasive techniques. This project will provide an approach that is both compatible with minimally invasive techniques as well as provide a means to reduce post-operative complications while delivering therapeutic agents directly into the aneurysmal tissue.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The prevalence of insomnia ranges from 10-40% of the population in the United States (30 to 120 million people) with similar rates reported worldwide. Hypnotics are the primary medical treatment for insomnia, yet significant adverse events limit their use. Behavioral treatments for insomnia are effective, but the labor force and expense required to deliver this treatment are difficult to scale to the broad population of insomnia sufferers. A large market need existsfor a safe, effective, non-invasive, home-based, non-pharmaceutical treatment for insomnia. Frontal cerebral hypothermia, a patent-pending intervention designed to reverse the hyperarousal in the central nervous system found in insomnia patients, is proposed to meet this need. Cerjve was founded by Eric Nofzinger MD, a thought leader in the neurobiology of insomnia at the University of Pittsburgh, to commercialize such a device. A brain imaging study, funded by the Respironics Research Foundation, confirmedthat the device reduced frontal hypermetabolism during sleep with associated increases in slow wave sleep in insomnia patients. A Phase I SBIR study demonstrated that the device produced dose- dependent improvements in EEG sleep measures of sleep latencyand sleep efficiency in insomnia patients. Now, this Phase II SBIR renewal aims to perform industrial design and mechanical engineering research to develop a commercializable home-based device, then to perform a confirmatory analysis of the effects of thedevice on sleep latency and sleep efficiency in insomnia patients. In collaboration with Cerjve, industrial design will be performed by Smart Design and mechanical engineering by Acorn Product Development, leaders in their fields. Cerjve, under the direction of Dr. Nofzinger, will supervise the multi-center clinical trial. Individual sites will include Neurotrials in Atlanta (Russell Rosenberg, Director) and Pacific Sleep Medicine in San Diego (Milton Erman, Director). Centralized EEG sleep scoring will beperformed under the supervision of Tom Roth, PhD. 100 insomnia patients will enter the randomized, cross-over, device-control, multi-center clinical trial. All patients will receive 2 baseline nights of EEG sleep studies, then 2 nights at both a neutral and active device condition, with order of presentation randomized across patients. The long-term goal of this SBIR Project, if confirmatory analyses are positive, is to commercialize this device for the treatment of insomnia. The commercialization plan developed by Cerjve&#039;s CEO, Erica Rogers, an experienced medical device executive, suggests a large commercial opportunity for the company driven by the large unmet need in the insomnia market. Funds from this Phase II SBIR will supplement and leverage significant financial commitments for this work from private investors and the venture capital community.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The prevalence of insomnia ranges from 10-40% of the United States population. Available treatments have significant adverse events or are not widely available. The availability of a safe, effective home-based medical device for the treatment of insomnia such as that proposed in this Phase II SBIR application would be expected to have a significant public health impact.",

Activated cells release inflammatory mediators that are responsible for pathological trauma that leads to cardiac, lung, liver, and braininjuries during surgical procedures that require cardiac devices. Our findings provide convincing support for developing YalcixiMab as a treatment to prevent biomaterial-induced inflammation that occurs during surgical procedures. CPB circuits are used during various procedures for heart transplant, and valve replacements. Treatment of blood with YalcioMab prior to the extracorporeal circulation prevents complement activation, neutrophil activation, monocyte activation, platelet activation and the formation of leukocyte-platelet aggregates. The drug also prevents the release of potent inflammatory mediators such as TNF-1. .        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: NovelMed is developing treatments that will reduce/prevent complications that arise when blood is exposed to biomaterial surfaces of the cardiac devices.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this proposed program is the commercialization of the Pediatric Impella system, a minimally invasive ventricular assist device (VAD) for treatment of acute heart failure in pediatric patients. The device will be a less traumatic alternative to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), the current standard of care for these patients. The target patient population is in the age and weight range of 3 mos - 3 yrs and 5-15 kg. The Pediatric Impellasystem will be designed to unload the left ventricle and promote cardiac recovery, providing blood flow in the range of 0.5-2 lpm for up to 2 wks of support. Reviewers pointed out in discussion that the device is not as minimally invasive as claimed and will require more anticoagulation than is suggested in the application. Since there are only a few devices in the field for this problem, this proposal addresses a great unmet clinical need and has high significance.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that approximately 9,000 infants born with congenital heart defects each year in the U.S. require some form of invasive intervention during the first years of life. Many of these children require mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to recovery or to transplant. Shorter duration of support (for days to at most a few weeks) for acute, generally recoverable heart failure is mostly provided by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). ECMO is highly invasive and is associated with a host of complications including blood clots, bleeding, ongoing heart failure, and strokes. Therefore, a strong unmet clinical need exists for a minimally invasive ventricular assist device (VAD) that can supplant ECMO for treatment of acute heart failure in pediatricpatients.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Artificial surfaces of cardiac devices induce cellular activation and platelet dysfunction in patients undergoing bypass procedure. While other pathways may be activated during this process, alternative pathway (AP) activation appears to be one of the important mechanisms for cellular activation and platelet dysfunction in the whole blood model of biomaterial surface-induced activation. Our hypothesis is based on the ex vivo whole blood circulation model demonstrating near complete inhibition of cellular activation, platelet dysfunction, and release of inflammatory mediators by a target-specific mAb. We would like to extend these novel findings utilizing a pig model of cardiopulmonary bypass with an induced occlusion of the descending coronary artery to mimic the clinical setting. During and following circulation through the CPB, high circulating levels of anaphylatoxins, C3a and C5a, and activated neutrophils, monocytes, and platelets are expected. As a result, activatedneutrophils and monocytes release inflammatory mediators that cause organ damage and activated platelets become dysfunctional. These events can cause thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and severe bleeding complications. NovelMed intends to test a target-specific and highly selective monoclonal antibody that blocks AP activation, cellular activation, platelet dysfunction, and blood loss in a pig model of cardiopulmonary bypass. Collective effects of these inflammatory events on multiple organ failure will be evaluated in this proposal using the proposed pig cardiopulmonary bypass model. Proof of concept in a well-accepted pig model of occlusion with CPB is a critical step for furthering the development of NovelMed&#039;s lead biologic and moving it towards clinical use.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Billions of dollars are spent annually to prevent systemic inflammatory response in cardiac patients undergoing cardiac procedures with cardiopulmonary bypass to correct partial or complete occlusion of the coronary artery. Cardiac failure can occur if the coronary descending artery is completely occluded. There is currently no approved prophylactic therapeutic for CPB-associated inflammatory responses. When the blood flow in the occluded, ischemia reperfusion injury can exacerbate the response. There is no approved therapeutic for IRI or for CPB associated inflammatory response. NovelMed intends to develop YalcioMab as a treatment to prevent complications that occur as a result of AP activation in the pig model of ischemiawith cardiopulmonary bypass.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of cardiovascular disease, which is the most common cause of death in the United States. Atherosclerosis is characterized by the accumulation of lipids, cholesterol, calcium deposits, and cellular debris in vessel walls, and results in plaque formation, arterial obstruction, and diminished blood flow to organs. These plaques often rupture, causing myocardial infarction, stroke, or death. The main risk factors include elevated lipid levels, hypertension, and diabetes. Current treatment strategies are directed at changing patient lifestyle/diet and decreasing cholesterol via pharmacological methods. Surgical interventions with medical devices such as stents are used for advanced cases. While these therapeutic approaches have benefited many patients with this disease, they are far from ideal. One reason is that no drug or device is actually developed and tested in a model system that accurately recreates the disease being treated. Thus, there is a significant gap between early phase preclinical studies and human drug trials. The lack of an animal model that accurately replicates all of the manifestations of human atherosclerosis has been a major barrier to the development of effective therapies and interventions for this deadly disease. Several mouse models have been generated with mutations in genes important for lipoprotein metabolism, and while these models have been informative, they fail to develop the complex atherosclerotic lesions that are typical of the human disease. In contrast to mice, the physiology and anatomy of the porcine cardiovascular system closely resembles that of humans. In fact, pigs have long been used as models of cardiovascular disease, and pigs with naturally occurring mutations in their LDL receptor (LDLR) gene, and therefore possessing elevated LDL, have been reported. Although the hypercholesterolemic pig is an attractive model, the mild nature of the mutation, the high variability of the disease, the limited access by other researchers, and the expense prevent its wide use in the research community. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this project is to develop and commercialize a gene- targeted porcine model of atherosclerosis. LDLR fetal fibroblasts that we developed in Phase I will be used as nuclear donors for somatic cell nuclear transfer. Nuclear transfer embryos will be transferred to recipient females for gestation. Resulting piglets will have one targeted LDLR gene. We will characterize the LDLR- targeted pigs at the molecular and biochemical level. We will determine the lipid and lipoprotein profile in LDLR-targeted pigs and perform morphometric analysis to determine the presence and extent of atherosclerosis. Finally, we will establish breeding herds to generate LDLR-/- pigs and to expand and propagate the colony. This project will produce a porcine model of atherosclerosis that will provide academic and industry researchers with an opportunity to better understand the disease and to develop and test new therapeutics and preventative strategies. Thus, this work will accelerate the discovery of novel therapies for this costly and deadly disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal specifically outlines the development, characterization and propagation of a genetically engineered porcine model of atherosclerosis. This project is relevant to the NIH&#039;s mission because it will provide a resource to stimulate discovery, therapeutic application, and the development of new diagnostic tools.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The frequent inability of in vitro assays and animal models to accurately predict human response to a new drug candidate results in costly drug development failures. HemoShear has developed a platform technology for biodiscovery and drug pharmacology screening that replicates human biological function in healthy and diseased organ systems by applying human-derived hemodynamic shear stress forces to primary human cells in co-culture. Our initial system replicates the human vascular system and enables the creation of disease conditions including vascular inflammation, early atherogenesis and diabetic complications. Our novel technology is being deployed for customers to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of human vascular inflammation and the identification of novel biomarkers and transcriptional pathways for development of drug therapies. Completed Phase I: The objective of our completed Phase I proposal was to develop a more advanced pro-inflammatory systemthat profiles the human vascular response (EC/SMC) to oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL), which has a widely recognized role in vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis. We are already using the Phase I advanced inflammatory system for functional assays, target validation and knock-down experiments for our customers. The Problem: There does not exist an in vitro human vascular pharmacology system that can guide pharma and biotech in making key go-/no-go decisions in drug discovery and development. Furthermore, the FDA now requires that vascular risk must be more  thoroughly addressed during drug development, especially for Type 2 anti-diabetic therapies,  and the need for a predictive vascular pharmacology system has been confirmed by pharma industryexecutives and customers (see Letters of Support). Proposed Phase II: The purpose of this Phase II SBIR proposal is to develop a predictive vascular pharmacology system for late-stage drug discovery and preclinical drug development. The HemoShear vascularsystem, developed in Phase I above, will be used to evaluate known drug compounds across a broad range of drug classes that have the following effects on the vasculature: 1) direct/intended effect (e.g. Ca channel blockers), 2) positive pleiotropic effect(e.g. statins) and 3) negative pleiotropic effect (e.g. rosiglitazone, Vioxx), in order to create a robust database of drug-related vascular effect profiles. We will use proprietary bioinformatics methods to develop a vascular signature predictor panel (~30 genes) from whole genome data sets that can be used for screening and scoring candidate compounds for vascular pharmacology response and potential safety risk. Value: Success of this Phase II SBIR will provide a predictive set of tools with which to assess human vascular response of customers&#039; novel drug compounds, prior to human studies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 90% of drugs that enter Phase I clinical trials ultimately fail because of lack of efficacy or adverse effects. It is estimated that65bln is spent annually in discovery, pre-clinical and clinical drug development. Much of that expenditure is wasted on failure, largely because of the inability of in vitro assays and animal models to accurately predict human response to a new drug candidate. HemoShear has developed a platform technology for biodiscovery and drug screening that replicates human biological function in healthy and diseased organ systems by applying human-derived hemodynamic shear stress forces to primary human cells in co-culture. HemoShear&#039;s patented system has been shown to validate efficacy, safety and off-target effects of known, FDA-approved drug compounds. The purpose of this Phase II SBIR proposal is to develop a predictive vascular pharmacology system to assess newdrug compounds in late-stage drug discovery and preclinical drug development.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart valve regurgitation is a serious condition related to heart disease. The most common and effective surgical method for treating this disease is with the use of an annuloplasty ring, which reduces the size of a dilated valve annulus to restore normal function. Many patients do not receive this procedure, however, either because they are too sick to undergo open heart surgery, or their condition has not yet progressed to the point at which surgery is justified. To address this large untreated patient population, many efforts have been undertaken to develop technology to repair leaky valves via catheter. Of these, the Millipede concept is the only device which can perform a true ring annuloplasty. This concept uses a ring that can both expand and contract under a radial force and has many small barbed anchors around its perimeter. After implant, a novel locking mechanism holds the ring at the desired diameter. The implantation process is performed by first inserting thedelivery tool, an oversized wire  basket , into the annulus. This wire basket is larger than the annulus in diameter, but flexible enough to conform to the annular dimensions, which allows the user to  find  the annular tissue regardless of the size or shape of the annulus. Once placed in the annulus, the wires provide a series of rails, or delivery paths, over which the ring is delivered. The result is an automatic alignment of the ring and the annulus. Once aligned, a simple forward push of the ring drives the barbed anchors into the tissue and secures the ring in place. The basket is then contracted down and removed. In Phase II of this project we will surgically implant the prototypes developed in Phase I in animals. After developing a fully functionaldelivery system and conducting in vitro durability testing on the ring, we will perform percutaneous implants in animals.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a sutureless annuloplasty ring for the treatment of dilated, leaking heart valves. This will lead to an annuloplasty ring that can be implanted without surgery, which will benefit a significant number of patients who have valve disease but are not candidates for surgery.",

This assay willguide clinical management, particularly the use of long-term anticoagulant therapy for patients. The utility of this assay will be the identification of patients at risk for developing venous thromboembolism who should be anticoagulated, and conversely, identification of patients at low risk of developing venous thromboembolism who should not be subjected to the possible dangers of anticoagulant therapy. The specific aim of Phase I of this Fast-Track application is to: 1) Develop a rapid, high-throughput assay for 3&#039; fibrinogen. This will be accomplished using our proprietary monoclonal antibody, 2.G2.H9, and the Luminex xMAP(R) technology platform. The milestones for the successful completion of Phase I and transition to Phase II are to develop a 3&#039; fibrinogen assay that measures the normal range of 3&#039; fibrinogen in plasma from 0-1.5 mg/ml, and achieves a standard curve fit with an R2 accuracy of gt0.95. In Phase II, the Specific Aims are to: 2) Validate the 3&#039; fibrinogen assay. The assay will be evaluatedfor linearity, interference testing, method comparison, bias estimation, and comparison to the previous plate-based ELISA in test samples using guidelines published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) for precision performance of quantitative measurement methods. This information will be essential for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) evaluation of the assay; 3) Quantitate the intra-individual variability of 3&#039; fibrinogen levels over time. This will be accomplished by measuring 3&#039; fibrinogen levels in individuals at weekly time points over a 3-month period and monthly time points over a one-year period to determine the within-subject variability. This information will be critical for widespread acceptance of the assay by clinical laboratories; 4) Scale up production of the assay kit components. This will be accomplished with assistance from the Office of Technology Transfer and Business Development at OHSU, which has forged ties withthe entrepreneurial and local business community to create a framework of support for the development of companies utilizing OHSU research. Their Springboard Program is designed to catalyze the development of new ventures based on OHSU technologies.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in industrialized nations. While interventional techniques  such as angioplasty and/or stenting can often delay the need for coronary arterial bypass surgery (CABG),long-term efficacy still favors revascularization. Still today, 450,000 coronary bypasses are performed  annually in the U.S. alone. Moreover, the number of revascularization procedures for peripheral arterial  disease or hemodialysis access is increasingdramatically. Today, 400,000 hemodialysis patients in the U.S.  need a patent vascular graft to survive. Creation and maintenance of hemodialysis access grafts takes  up nearly 2% of Medicare&#039;s entire budget. In addition, population aging and increasing incidence of  diabetes and obesity indicate that this is a major public health concern.  A patient&#039;s own blood vessels clearly remain the best conduits for both coronary and peripheral bypass, as  well as for hemodialysis access. Unfortunately, native veinor artery may not be available due to previous  harvest or systemic disease progression. Indeed, the primary limitation to arterial revascularization is  the availability of suitable native graft material. While synthetic blood vessels made from materialssuch  as Dacron or expanded polytetraflouroethylene (ePTFE) perform well in large diameter applications, these  synthetic conduits show unacceptably high failure rates in small diameter applications. We have recently  reported excellent clinical trials results with a completely biological human vascular graft built in vitro  using a self-assembly approach termed  Sheet-Based Tissue Engineering  (SBTE). However, a significant  drawback of this self-assembly approach is the long production time. Here, we propose the development of a  novel assembly strategy, called  Thread-Based Tissue Engineering  (TBTE). This novel approach offers  the same advantages of a completely biological human product but will dramatically reduce the  production time and cost. Combined with an allogeneic and/or devitalization approach, TBTE could  finally make completely biological human vascular grafts available  off-the-shelf  and commercially  much more competitive.  In Phase I of this project, we demonstrated our ability to createthreads of various strengths and sizes from  both clinically relevant human cells and from canine cells. These threads were then woven into tubes on a  custom circular loom to create human and canine vascular grafts. These grafts displayed promising  mechanical properties in vitro. Phase I culminated in a short-term in vivo study that demonstrated the very  promising clinical potential of human and canine grafts. These results met and exceeded all milestones  set forth in the Phase I proposal.  In SpecificAim 1 of Phase II, we will finalize the graft design based on promising data obtained in Phase I.  These efforts will lead to six designs that will be tested in vivo in Specific Aim 2. Groups of four canines will  receive H7 cm x 4.2 mm unendothelialized,devitalized grafts as arteriovenous shunts (femoral-to-femoral).  The six designs will be: 1) Autologous, 2) Allogeneic, 3) Allogeneic decellularized, 4) Allogeneic gamma-  sterilized, 5) Allogeneic seeded with autologous bone marrow in the operating room,6) Allogeneic, punctured  3 times weekly with a 16Ga hemodialysis needle after a 3 month post-implantation maturation period. These  groups cover the following cost-effectiveness range: 1lt lt 5lt lt 3lt 2lt 4. By comparing the performance of these  groups, we can determine which design offers the best combination of efficacy and cost. Group 6 will give a  first glimpse at the potential of this new type of graft to serve as a hemodialysis access graft. Finally, In  Specific Aim 3, we will explore importantparameters for the long-term commercialization of these grafts. We  will study the use of serum-free medium to produce threads, which would improve reproducibility, reduce cost  and simplify regulatory acceptance of the grafts (compared to bovine serum-containing medium). We will also  study the use of  molecular crowding  additives to the culture medium. These large molecules have the  potential to double or triple collagen assembly and hence, reduce production time and cost. Finally, we will  determine if we can seed an endothelium on the woven grafts. While endothelium is not critical in high-flow  applications like hemodialysis access grafts, it will be for other important markets/indications like coronary or  lower limb bypass. However, establishing anautologous endothelium (allogeneic endothelium are highly  immunogenic) introduces significant additional costs. As a cost-effective alternative, we will explore the  possibility of replacing it by a new type of heparin coating.  This Phase II project will provide: 1) the most cost-effective yet efficacious graft design; 2) initial in vivo  efficacy data to justify a more extensive in vivo study to support and IND-submission; 3) additional data to  further improve the grafts commercial and regulatory prospects.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over the last 10 years we have developed a completely biological tissue engineered vascular graft comprised  exclusively of human cells, without the need for exogenous biomaterials or synthetic scaffolds. While initialclinical use of this engineered graft represented a landmark achievement in the field, the manufacturing  process is time consuming and expensive and thus, we have developed and performed initial optimization  work on a much faster manufacturing process,termed Thread-based Tissue Engineering (TBTE), in which cell-  synthesized, biological threads are woven into robust tissues. In this grant, we propose to expand our initial  work into developing a clinically relevant graft, investigate the in vivo performance of the grafts in a canine  model, and research key parameters to facilitate the transition to commercialization.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently the detection of fetal magnetocardiogram (fMCG) is not possible at gestational ages earlier than 15 weeks, is unreliable at gestations less than 20-24 weeks, and is often difficult in obese patients even in the last trimester. This presents a series problem in the assessment of fetal heart conditions in patients with high- risk cardiac conditions in specific, and in prenatal care management in general. Transvaginal approach for fetal echocardiography has enhanced fetal imaging by allowing better resolution of extremely small fetal anatomy at close range down to about 13 weeks, but cannot precisely measure fetal heart rhythm and conduction disorders. To answer this challenge, pioneering work on fMCG has demonstrated the unique capabilities of SQUID-based fetal MCG system, including QRS and QT interval measurements, accurate beat- to-beat analysis, precise arrhythmia recording, and detailed fetal heart rate trend analysis.  The objective of proposal is to develop atransvaginal SQUID fMCG system for direct recording of fetal cardiac activities at gestational ages younger 15 weeks, and in addition fetal brain electromagnetic activity. This will facilitate early detections of intrauterine clinical condition of fetuseswith life-threatening arrhythmias, acquired heart failure, and structural congenital heart disease. Unlike the conventional fetal MCG system, which is bulky and requires to be installed in a heavy and costly magnetic shielded room, the new system will bedesigned to be compact and light, suitable for use in clinical settings.  In this Phase II work we have identified major technical challenges, and will address them systematically to pave way for smooth transition to human testing in Phase III and to future clinical operations. The Phase I instrument will be modified to incorporate vector measurement and noise cancellation channels. The animal tests will be conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the improved Phase I instrument in live objects. In dataanalysis new noise reduction algorithm will be integrated and tested. Results of these studies will guide the design and construction of light weight magnetic shielding that is easily adaptive to OBGYN clinics; vector sensor probe with reference array thatcan accommodate development of fetus at different pregnancy stages; safe and comfortable patient chair and probe gantry to streamline test procedures. A series of tests will be carried out to access risk level in simulated mechanical and cryogenic failures of the probe.  Successful completion of this program will lead to the first-ever diagnostic tool for fetal cardiology that is capable of providing accurate recording from early pregnancy stages. It offers the significant ability to identify fetal arrhythmias and other cardiac disorders. In addition, it will greatly advance scientific knowledge on both fetal heart and brain development, which can lead to better prenatal care and potential treatments for genetic disorders. 1        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:This proposal aims to develop a compact, noninvasive transvaginal SQUID-based magnetocardiography (fMCG) system for unique early monitoring of fetal heart rhythm conditions. The transvaginal placement is the most effective minimally invasive method for optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio in obese patients and in early pregnancy, as has been demonstrated with transvaginal ultrasound. The new instrument will be a world&#039;s first in its capability to reliably characterize the conduction patterns and intrauterine clinical condition of fetuses with life-threatening arrhythmias, acquired heart failure, and structural congenital heart disease. In addition, its impact on the field of fetal Magnetoencephalography (fMEG) could be even greater since intrauterine evaluation of human fetal brain function has so far been impossible. 1",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this FAST TRACK SBIR is to develop and evaluate a culturally relevant health literacy- training program for Latinos to improve the knowledge and skills to protect health and prevent disease. This programis tentatively entitled Entre Nuestra Familias/Among Our Latino Families (ENF). Drawing from traditional Hispanic values, the ENF Program provides an intergenerational approach to health education, offering multiple members of the family simultaneous training in key health literacy skills and information on cross-cutting health topics to reinforce healthy behaviors within families and communities. This training program will be offered through community-based organizations to reduce institutional barriers tocare that are often experienced by Latinos.  The U.S. Census reported in 2007 that there are45.5 million Hispanics living in the U.S. Not only do Latinos constitute the fastest growing minority group in the country, but they also face significant health challenges. Indeed, Hispanics bear a higher burden of disease than non-Hispanic whites in almost every category of risk, and there is evidence that the health disparities experienced by Latinos may be linked to significant barriers to health care, includinglow rates of health insurance, low English proficiency, lack of accurate and culturally relevant health information, a dearth of culturally competent health facilities and information, fear and mistrust of the U.S. Medical system. Because of these disparities and their resulting impact on health, there have been strong calls to develop culturally appropriate public health initiatives to improve the health of Latinos in the U.S. To that end, KDH Research and Communication will develop the ENF Program.  In Phase I, KDHRC will develop the print portions of the training program, and conduct a pilot evaluation of the product&#039;s effectiveness, in collaboration with Dia de la Mujer Latino, a health advocacy group that serves Latinos. In Phase II, we will expand thetraining program to include video elements for the participants and multimedia aspects for the facilitator. Then, we will implement and evaluate the training program at multiple sites to examine the program&#039;s effectiveness and the extent to which different social factors (poverty, education, country of origin, geographic location) best predict efficacy of the program, using a quasi- experimental pre-test, post-test evaluation design.  Following product completion and evaluation, the ENF program will be disseminated to community-based organizations nationwide. The results of the evaluation will be disseminated through the academic literature and practice and policy briefs to add to scientific knowledge about best practices for reducing health disparities inLatino communities. Further, we will conduct town hall meetings in our target communities to disseminate results of the evaluation to those most affected by the research.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanics bear a higher burden of disease than non-Hispanic whites in almost every category of risk, and as a result, there have been strong calls for the public health community to develop culturally appropriate interventions to reduce health disparities. This proposal is to develop an intergenerational health literacy training program that incorporates key aspects of Latino culture to engage and retain participants. The program will be delivered through community based nonprofit and faith-based organizations to reduce barriers to care. After the developmentand evaluation of this product, the training program will be disseminated nationwide to provide the public health field with an effective and innovative tool to reduce health disparities among Latinos.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a health communication, multimedia and graphic design firm, we, like many others, are consumers of high quality royalty-free stock photography for health education materials. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of readily-available images depicting health conditions and behaviors that match characteristics of target audiences defined by race, socio-economic status, age, weight, medical conditions, and physical disabilities. This shortcoming is a theoretic and practical problem for health education, as several common theories guiding successful health interventions predict that communication is more effective when sources and models are attractive and similar to target audiences, producing identification and perceived relevance. In Phase I, our team demonstrated the feasibility of developing a collection of photographs depicting diverse settings, health behaviors, health conditions and demographics, called Real Health, which can be used by health and media professionals toincrease effectiveness of health communication by incorporating similar image referents. In this Phase II project, our team proposes to fully-develop the Real Health enterprise, an online image library for use in health communication. First, we will produce Real Health and populate it with photographs taken in Phase I and additional photographs of 240 individuals (African American, Hispanic, Native American, Asian, non-Hispanic white, and GLBT; children/teens, adults, and seniors; overweight and with mobility challenges) taken in Phase II. Potential end users (photographers and public health practitioners) will evaluate the Real Health e-commerce site and business model for efficiency, utility, user participation, and satisfaction. The Real Health website will be subjected to beta and usability testing prior to launch. Next, we will evaluate the ability of photos from Real Health to improve health education message effectiveness in a randomized pretest-posttest 3-group design. Three experimental conditions will be created, i.e., a health education message with  1) all Real Health photos that match the target audience, 2) half Real Health photos, and 3) all mismatched  photos (obtained from existing commercial stock photo libraries). The health education message will advocate increased physical activity and improved diet to reduce chronic disease. Photos will be selected based on careful pretesting with target audiences. A sample of individuals who are African Americans, Hispanics, Native  Americans, overweight/obese, 65 years of age or older, and with mobility challenges (n=510 per subgroup;  n=3060 total) will be recruited from an Internet panel maintained by Knowledge Networks, Inc. Participants will  be pretested, assigned to read a health education message in one of the conditions, and post-tested. Analyses will evaluate the effect of Real Health photos on primary (intention) and secondary (positive outcome and self-efficacy expectations) outcomes, test potential effect moderators, and explore theoretical mediators of perceived relevance, appropriateness, similarity and identification in the health education messages. KB is uniquely qualified to create and commercialize the Real Health stock photography enterprise.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sources and models depicted as attractive and similar to recipients can increase the impact of health messages by capturing attention, improving comprehension, engendering feelings of personalism and cultural appropriateness, and causing recipients to identify with them. Producing health communication that changes health behavior requires access to a much wider variety of photographs than currently available from commercial stock art companies in order to capitalize on the power of physically active and similar sources/models. The purpose of this Phase II SBIR project is to fully develop and test the effectiveness of a collection of photographs depicting diverse settings, activities, health conditions, and demographics called  Real Health  that can be used to increase the effectiveness of health communication.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II study will utilize a multi-trait/multi-method research design. Our research design will include data collection tasks in 4 research sites that represent the diversity of the national Hispanic adult population: Los Angeles, Miami, El Paso, and Boston. The total research sample will consist of 2,400 Hispanics, ages 18 and older. A cross sectional, quota based sampling design will be used in 3 distinct developmentally distinct target samples, including a) college aged adults, b) parents, and c) seniors over 60. A cross-sectional survey will be implemented in the 4 research sites. This research responds to the growth in the Hispanic population along with a large market of mental health clinicians, primary healthcare providers and researchers as well as educators, counselors and criminal justice professionals who are demanding culturally relevant assessment tools for the screening and early diagnosing of stress in the Hispanic population. Recent trends in healthreform and emphasis on prevention of health and behavioral health problems will necessitate the use of better screening and diagnostic tools, particularly for minority groups who previously have had low access to such preventive services. High stress levels put Hispanic adults at-risk for a wide range of behavioral health problems. Our research will improve the technology of stress assessment in this vulnerable population in several ways. The Hispanic Stress Inventory (Version 2) will provide evidence thatwill convince the mental health and other health care professional customers that the product is scientifically proven and culturally relevant and an instrument they can depend on. Our research brings an important, and under researched perspective to the development of assessment technologies that will stimulate the development of similar screening inventories in other populations characterized by high immigration and high health disparities.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed project is to develop, implement, and evaluate the use of an Internet-based eLearning multimedia program that will allow foster care social workers, educators, and other youth workers to planone-day real world simulations that would allow adolescent foster youths, ages 13-21, to learn and practice independent living skills. Research on foster care reveals that the foster care system does not prepare foster teens adequately to transition frombeing dependent youths to independent self-sufficient adults. As a result, many former foster youths struggle to achieve self-sufficiency and often end up living marginally after leaving foster care. The proposed program, Adolescent Real World Simulation (ARWS) eLearning program, focuses on those who work with adolescent foster youths. It is also intended to assist any professional that works with adolescents to develop the skills necessary to plan and implement an independent living simulation in a real-world environment. In Phase I, the ARWS Introduction to an Adolescent Real World Simulation module Internet-based program was developed to brief adult users on how three distinct components, preparation, management, and follow-up, are used to develop a comprehensive daylong real world youth simulation (Griffin and Carter 2004). The Phase I introductory segment also outlines programming benefits for youths, how to involve community businesses and coordinate aspects of a real world simulation. A Real World Interactive Timeline and the learning modules, Preparation, Management, and Follow-up will be fully developed in Phase II. The educational design of the eLearning process includes use of video, graphics, intermediate learning milestones, customizable documents, and interactive activities to illustrate the three core planning components while teaching users how to use/access the Interactive Timeline. All the parts of this program comprise the Real World Toolkit which becomes an ongoing resource for current and future planning of Real World Simulation events. A project evaluation will be incorporated to measure increases in user&#039;s knowledge to plan, coordinate, and complete a real world simulation, and their overall satisfaction with the eLearning program including subsequent motivation to plan an event.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project has the potential to have a dramatic exponential effect on the number of youths involved in real world simulations and ultimately impact their readiness for self- sufficiency. This potential is significantly higher and more inclusive than many other forms of life skills instruction. This type of training can effectively influence the training approaches of professionals and paraprofessionals who provide life skills programming and who would then conduct one-day events that would touch hundreds of adolescents who are in need of active involvement in their own life skills development and supportive transitions from foster care to the community.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Direct care workers form the core of the long-term care system, acting as a safety net to prevent hospitalizations and nursing home admissions. After informal caregivers, these frontline workers provide the majority ofsupervision, hands-on care, and emotional support to millions with chronic illnesses and disabilities living in their own homes or other community-based settings. Nationwide, a shortage of nursing and home health aides coupled with a rapid increase in demand for their services has led to a significant deficit in healthcare delivery. In recent years, a significant number of foreign-born individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP) have joined the direct care workforce. As the number of LEP paraprofessionals increases, improving their communicative competence becomes of critical importance to the proper functioning of our healthcare system. The objective of this Fast Track proposal is to develop an interactive DVD-Video system to improve the English language skills and communicative competence of foreign-born paraprofessionals. Phase I research will evaluate the feasibility of the instructional DVD using a three-lesson prototype. During Phase II, a fully-functional prototype of the DVD system will be developed and tested with a larger cohort of representative direct care workers. Criteria for evaluation will include quantitative data based on participants&#039; acquisition of target communication skills, as well as their qualitative feedback throughout the course of their studies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite the unique importance of direct care workers in preventing hospitalization and nursing home admissions, they are frequently undervalued, and opportunities for professional training and advancement are scarce-particularly for those with limited English abilities. As foreign-born nursing aides and homecare workers become an increasingly integral component of our nation&#039;s healthcare system, it is important that efforts be undertaken to help them attain and maintain adequate proficiency in the English language. This project will develop an interactive DVD-Video Program aimed at enhancing the communicative competence of the growing number of paraprofessionals with limited English proficiency (LEP), enabling them to acquire the skill sets for career advancement and improving the quality of care for their patients.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The disproportionately high rate of HIV/AIDS in African American (AA) communities is a continuing public health crisis in the US. Over the last two decades, several evidence-based programs (EBPs), including Focus on Youth (FOY), were produced. FOY is a nationally recognized evidence-based program for AA youth in community settings; it increases condom use among sexually active youth and intentions to use condoms in abstinent youth. Community youth workers and agencies need training and support to replicate EBPs effectively. An important aspect of effectively leading EBPs is implementation fidelity, of which a primary focus is adherence to core program elements. FOY is more likely to be taught with fidelity and replicate positive student outcomes if youth workers are prepared and have the knowledge, skill, motivation and support to implement the curricula with fidelity. Despite the positive effects of skills-based training on implementation effectiveness, community youth workers frequently do not or cannot attend face-to-face training because of limited availability, cost, travel and time constraints. Face-to-face trainings often do not provide ongoing support and opportunities for reinforcement of past learning - which is crucial. The proposed Phase II SBIR will develop and rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of an online training and support system, the  24/7 FOY Training . The training will be consistent with the EBP replication literature and will include: 1) orientation to the curriculum and core components; 2) activity modeling, hands on practice, adaptation guidance, implementation tips, and 3) technical assistance on implementation challenges. The training will reflect adult learning theory and incorporate innovations in online learning, such as highly interactive, media-rich simulations for skill practice and feedback, personalized learning strands for quick and efficient training use, user generated content (including podcasting), and online flash cards accessible on mobile devices, or for printing. To test the effectiveness of the 24/7 FOY Training, we will conduct a pre-test/post-test randomized controlled trial, randomizing at the youth worker (facilitator) pair level to one of two arms: 1) the online training intervention arm; or 2) the community standard (self preparation) control arm. Because FOY is lead by two facilitators, we will recruit approximately 230 pairs of community youth workers to participate, with approximately 115 pairs in each arm. The proposed research will contribute a model for training community youth workers to effectively implement activities integral to the core content elements of FOY.  If this model proves to be effective, the online skills-based training developed under this grant will provide an accessible, low-cost,  always-on  training and implementation support service.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV infection in African American communities is a continuing public health crisis in the US. Over the last two decades, several evidence-based programs (EBPs), including Focus on Youth (FOY), were produced. Given the recent failure of other promising prevention initiatives (e.g., vaccine trials and microbicides) the importance of effective dissemination and implementation of these evidence-based programs becomes even more critical. However, despite the known positive effects of skills-based training on implementation effectiveness, community youth workers frequently do not or cannot acquire the training they need on these programs due to time, monetary or other barriers. The proposed online training program and support system, the  24/7 FOY Training  will prepare community youth workers to effectively implement activities integral to the core content elements of FOY, a key aspect of fidelity. If this model proves to be effective, the online skills-based training developed under this grant will provide an accessible, low-cost,  always-on  training and implementation support service which will help prevent the spread of HIV in African American communities.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Inactivity and loss of productive function commonly accompany severe psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders, mood disorders, PTSD). Yet, surveys (Becker, 2002) indicate that more than 75%of people with these disorders wish to return to some kind of productive activity. However, when they attempt to return to work, they often have no access to appropriate employment. Presently, there are vocational programs for adults but none that allow these individuals to continually practice interviews in order to gain the skills necessary to perform well, determine when and if they should disclose their disability, and how to answer difficult questions regarding their personal histories. SIMmersion LLC, in cooperation with Dr. Morris Bell, proposes to address this issue by expanding the Phase I prototype of a computer-based, interactive, role-play training simulation to improve interviewing skills in individuals with psychiatric disabilities. Performingwell in job interviews is the first step to obtaining paid employment. Allowing individuals to practice interviews in a simulated environment is a low-cost, easily accessible way for individuals to prepare for interviews by reducing anxiety, emphasizing their employment strengths, and negotiating appropriate working conditions, thereby increasing the likelihood that they will be able to obtain jobs they can keep. To evaluate the efficacy of the system and to measure skill increases, Dr. Bell and Applied Behavioral Research LLC will conduct a single-blind Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) with experimental and active control conditions, including eighty participants with psychiatric disorders. Measures will include a baseline and two post-measure videotaped job interview role-plays. Simulated Job Interview Training for People with Psychiatric Disorders is expected to significantly improve the training and the depth of programs available to adults with psychiatric disorders hoping to reenter the workforce. We fully expect the outcome of this SBIR grant to include enhanced interview skills among adults with psychiatric disorders and increased rates of employment among that population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving access to employment for people withpsychiatric disabilities is of great societal benefit. It provides clients with monetary and psychological benefits and reintegrates them into mainstream society. Society benefits from regaining the productive potential of people who may otherwise be marginalized and from increasing the diversity of our nation&#039;s workforce.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The disparities in disaster-related mental health problems highlight the highlighted the need for local pre-disaster planning in black communities living in high stress areas. Training in Post Disaster Mental Health inBlack Communities is a train the trainer, group-level intervention designed to improve the local disaster mental health readiness. HERMES&#039; Phase I study developed a training package based on needs assessment. The results indicate that the training of bothclinical providers and community leaders is a promising model for integrating culturally appropriate mental health in local response strategies. Aims: Our Phase II field study will further refine the curriculum components and field test the acceptability,adaptability, effectiveness, and sustainability of our model in high stress black communities of coastal and rural eastern North Carolina and downtown Charleston and Low Country areas in South Carolina. Method: We will recruit and train a core team of mental health providers to deliver clinical provider- and community leader-tailored training workshops to 240 participants in eight target communities. Local collaborative planning teams will be supported by web-based exercise and group training components. Participants will complete evaluations follow each training component and pre, post and 3, 6, and 12 month follow- up tests on knowledge and self-rated competency skills. We will measure benchmarks of increased capacity and performance-based skills using qualitative interviews and site profiles. Expected Results: The triangulation of process and outcome data will determine the effectiveness of this model for increasing knowledge and skills in providing culturally competent mental health support for survivorsin the immediate aftermath of disasters. We also will identify best training and local planning practices for promoting and sustaining resilience and document case studies that illustrate the mitigation of disaster-related mental health consequences.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HERMES proposes to field test a training model and materials designed to build an  integrated local capacity in black communities to respond to mental in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. The training is will prepare clinical providers and community- based organization leaders who have the relational advantage of insiders to mitigate the risk of longer term mental health consequences that result from disasters. HERMES, will further develop the model according to feasible results and collaborate with partners in implementing a train the trainer model. Follow up sessions will cover clinical treatment and planning skills building with a web-based Community of Practice containing multi- media exercises and information resources tosupport site clinical and community planning teams. This blended learning product will fill a growing market demand among response agencies and has promise for spinoffs in complementary areas. The resulting product is marketable as social capital buildingstrategy that will increase the coordination and efficiency of mental services in low-resource disaster affected communities.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a grouping of developmental disorders that cause impairments in the functioning of children and can have devastating long-term effects on individuals and their families. Early diagnosis is a critical factor in ameliorating the affects of ASD on children&#039;s social and communicative functioning. The recent discovery of the relatively high prevalence of this disorder, 1 in 110 children, has accentuated the demand for diagnostic services andconsequently the need for increased access to quality training on this topic for school professionals working with children. Innovations in multimedia computer technology and improvements in the ease of access to computer-based programs and videos via theInternet hold great promise for enhancing current clinical training methods and increasing access to current research- based information. DiagnoseFirst will help professionals learn to better identify the markers for ASD in children ages three to ten years. It will combine visuals of real world practicum experience with web based delivery for broad distribution. To improve the quality of diagnosis, a weighted measurement for agreement of behavior interpretation between experts will be expanded to permit atransparent understanding of complex behaviors used in diagnosis and provide a consensus for diagnostic interpretation between experts that does not exist presently. DiagnoseFirst offers a more efficient, lower cost, consistent methodology for training university students, professionals and clinicians to accurately diagnose ASD in school aged children. This program meets the NIH goal of improving diagnostic services for children with disorders.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will improve diagnostic services for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Using a combination of multimedia videos and content guidance, a product called DiagnoseFirst will combine effective internship training programs with Internet delivery technology to teach university psychology graduate students and clinicians to better recognize ASD behaviors in school-aged children.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      SBIR Phase 1 preclinical studies demonstrate the efficacy of our proprietary compound, PD2005, for treating Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). PD2005 is a selective dopamine (DA) transport inhibitor that P2D is developing for the treatment of ADHD. The American Academy of Pediatrics identifies the non-selective DA transport inhibitors methylphenidate and amphetamine as the only approved first-line treatments for ADHD. These first-line treatments are Schedule II drugs of abuse administered primarily to children. In contrast, PD2005 demonstrates no abuse potential in studies conducted at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). The long term goal of the proposed studies is to develop a safe and effective ADHD treatment with limited abuse potential (non-Scheduled or Schedule IV).  PD2005 is a benztropine analog. Benztropine is a high affinity DA transport inhibitor found safe and effective by the FDA and in clinical use for over 30 years. Benztropine demonstrates no significant abuse potential and is a non-Scheduled drug. Unfortunately, benztropine&#039;s clinically significant anti- cholinergic side effects preclude its use as an ADHD treatment. Extensive lead optimization studies have been performed with our proprietary library of benztropine analogs. Preliminary studies indicate that our lead compound, PD2005, demonstrates no anti-cholinergic side effects including the anti- cholinergic cardiovascular side effect (tachycardia) characteristi of benztropine.Additionally, a PD2005 safety and toxicology study was commissioned and performed by the US Food and Drug Administration&#039;s (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation (CDER). No PD2005 carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, mutagenicity or toxicology in major organ systemswas found in these FDA computational studies. These data highlight the improved safety profile of PD2005  SBIR Phase 1 studies demonstrate that PD2005 is as effective as current first-line ADHD treatments. First, PD2005 is as effective as first-line ADHDtreatments at improving working memory, a core ADHD symptom, in a well accepted preclinical ADHD model. Second, PD2005 is as effective as first-line ADHD treatments at improving sustained attention, also a core symptom of ADHD, in another well accepted preclinical ADHD model. Additional Preliminary Studies indicate that PD2005 is effective after oral administration.  The proposed studies are the FDA safety and toxicology studies required for submission of a PD2005 Investigational New Drug (IND) applicationwhich would allow PD2005 use in humans when approved. All proposed studies will be compiled in Study Reports, submitted to the FDA and discussed with the FDA in a face-to-face Pre-IND meeting to assess PD2005 compliance with FDA ICH M3 IND guidelines.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The American Academy of Pediatrics identifies methylphenidate and amphetamine as the only approved first-line treatments for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). These first-line treatments are Schedule II drugs ofabuse administered primarily to children. The goal of the proposed studies is to develop a new ADHD treatment as effective as current first-line treatments but with reduced side effects including no abuse potential.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this application is to expand upon our Phase I work and further develop a fully-interactive multimedia (IMM) computer-based HIV/AIDS prevention curricula for adult women with mild intellectual disabilities (ID) (I.Q. approximately 55 through 75). In this Phase II application, we will expand the work completed in Phase I of the  Reducing HIV Risk in Women with Intellectual Disabilities  program. Phase II development will result in a suite of three 30-minuteIMM programs. The three programs will focus on 1) Sex and Sexuality education program based on input from Phase I professional interviews that addresses sex and sexuality, birth control, pregnancy, menopause, and HIV/AIDS, 2) using content developed in Phase I, we will revise our prototype using high-definition (HD) video and create a program focused on HIV/AIDS Facts, Knowledge, Testing and Condom Use, and 3) we will develop a program on Relationship Negotiations around sexual behavior. Program 1 on sex and sexuality, and program 3 on relationship negotiations will include messages tailored for women who are both pre- and postmenopausal as they seldom use condoms due to lack of pregnancy risk. End users of the three Phase II programs will be adult women with mild intellectual disabilities (ID) (age 18 +). Using elements of Mastery-based learning (ML), Direct Instruction (DI), and Universal Design for Learning (UDL), the three IMM programs will be highly effective at teaching adult women with ID. Each of thethree Phase II programs will have a companion video DVD and instructor guide developed as part of the Phase II program series.  Formative procedures (i.e., advisor groups and telephone interviews) will be used to inform the expanded programs in terms of content, scriptwriting, and framing. We will evaluate the program with 80 women with mild ID using a randomized treatment-control design, and with 30 service providers, and 30 parents for usability, appeal, functional value, and likelihood of purchase. Thisevaluative approach will allow us to establish that the program is useable by women with mild ID, effective at teaching them about the transmission and avoidance of HIV, HIV testing, and condom use, and that they rate it highly on essential consumer satisfaction factors. In addition, we will confirm that the program is seen by service providers as appropriate for their clients, that it provides vital information and that they would use it and recommend it to their colleagues, and that parents view the program and content as helpful and important for their daughters.  This application supports the Division of AIDS and Health Behavior Research, National Institute of Mental Health, as its purpose is to develop and disseminate a behavioral intervention that prevents HIV transmission, especially among populations at high risk for HIV infection. Additionally it supports the development of curricula and computer software that provides communication skills and training for HIV risk reduction, and the development ofmethods to reduce or change HIV-associated risk behaviors.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While there continues to be little research on the prevalence of HIV/AIDS among people with intellectual disabilities (ID), there is reason to believe that the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in women with ID is similar to, if not greater than, that of the non-ID population. The CDC has identified unique challenges facing women in the fight against HIV/AIDS, and some of these challenges are amplified in women with mild ID, dueto limited knowledge, limited communication skills, difficulty communicating with health care professionals, and the desire to be involved in intimate relationships while lacking some of the social judgment and decision-making skills that could help themidentify and avoid high-risk fluids and high-risk sexual encounters.",

Prolonged or intense stress has a negative impact on an individual&#039;s physical andmental health. Of the 155.1 million Americans in the labor force, 36% to 55% report moderate to high levels of stress at work. Although stress management programs have become popular in the workplace over the last two decades, these efforts have done little to reduce occupational stress. Recent evidence suggests that the current stress management paradigm be shifted to an emotion management approach. Emotion management provides a strong theoretical and practical base for direct intervention in worksites. Inaddition, Emotion Intelligence (EI) research offers five constructs (i.e., self awareness, social awareness, emotional management and regulation, change management, and general mood and self-motivation) that directly relate to the appraisal and coping constructs of the revised Lazarus1 model of stress, coping and emotion. This project will develop an intervention program based on behavior change theory (i.e., social cognitive theory) that will modify Dysfunctional Emotional Responses through change in thefive EI constructs. The proposed research project will shift the focus from the traditional  lifestyle stress and coping  strategies to an approach which makes emotional self-management a key element of the stress and coping process. An 8-session interactive multimedia, training program will be produced to teach employees emotion management and interpersonal skills to help minimize the impact of occupational stress. The project will integrate proven adult education and e-Learning instructional design strategies with behavioral change theory to help employees: (a) develop a problem-solving approach when encountering stressful situations; (b) learn to identify moods, negative thinking, out of control behaviors and dysfunctional emotional responses which interfere with working relationships and job performance; and (c) develop skills to manage their emotional reactions, both externally and internally. In Phase II, the full-scope training program will be developed and evaluated in a large-scale randomized trial.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Occupational stress causes significant problems for business and industry including absenteeism, turnover, decreased job performance, lowered productivity, compensation claims, and health insurance costs.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) are potential new therapeutics for many brain diseases, including Alzheimer&#039;s disease (AD), Parkinson&#039;s disease, mad cow disease, West Nile encephalitis, neuro- AIDS, brain injury, brain cancer, or multiple sclerosis. In almost all cases, it is necessary that the MAb therapeutic that is administered into the blood be able to access target sites within the brain. However, MAb&#039;s are large molecule drugs that do not cross the blood-brain barrier(BBB). The BBB problem prevents the brain drug development of antibody drugs. The proposed research will develop a new technology for antibody drug delivery to brain, which could also be used for other organs, and the new technology will be applied to AD.This work is based on the genetic engineering of a fusion protein comprised of 2 antibodies. One antibody is the therapeutic antibody against the Abeta amyloid peptide of AD, and the other antibody is a drug delivery system, which is directed at an endogenous transporter on the human BBB. The Phase I studies accomplished the following: (1) genetic engineering of a tandem vector expressing the hetero-tetrameric fusion protein, (2) cloning of a permanently transfected host cell line that expresses high levelsof the fusion antibody in serum free medium, (3) biochemical and functional characterizion of the fusion antibody, and (4) determination of the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) and brain uptake of the fusion protein in the adult Rhesus monkey. The phase II studies will accomplish the following: (1) growth of the host cell line in a 50L bioreactor, followed by 3-column downstream processing that can be replicated in a GMP lab; (2) biochemical analysis of the fusion protein with over 15 analytical tests; (3) dose finding PK and toxicity study in Rhesus monkeys. These studies will enable future submission of an IND for human testing of this new fusion protein for AD.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     We propose the Radial Scanning Objective (RSO), an innovative microscope objective that permits simultaneous automated neuron reconstruction using guided image collection, cell electrophysiological recording, and cell loading in live tissue. The RSO device will allow precise, accurate imaging by moving the objective lens relative to the tissue under study, without the need to move the electrodes, the tissue chamber, or the microscope itself. The RSO device and accompanying software technology will be the first commercially available product to a) enable direct recording of single distal synaptic connections formed between different areas, b) facilitate repeated monitoring of potential alterations in neuronal morphology during or as a result of stimulation, and c) permit simultaneous recording of one or more neurons formed between different areas in brain slices identified based on neuronal structure. This system will allow significant advancements in integrated studiesof neural function and structure in basic neuroscience as well as in neurotoxicology and pharmacological research and development, representing clear progress beyond the state-of-the-art.

Unfortunately, they are typically unaware of when to try to help, or how best to help their children. This Phase II project aims to design, develop, evaluate and eventually provide to the public an affordable web-based parent training (WPT) program that willbe user-friendly and inform parents about evidence-based strategies they can use to help their children manage excessive and distressing anxiety and anxiety-related symptoms/disorders. The WPT will be (a) a stand-alone self-guided program as well as (b) an adjunctive component for parents of youth who receive treatment (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy; CBT) for anxiety. In Phase I, we developed and piloted a sample of one chapter of the 10-module WPT program. We worked with parents of anxious youth (inboth clinical and non-clinical samples) and with CBT experts. The preliminary data indicated that the web-based modality is acceptable and feasible for use in this population, and the data support the further development and evaluation of such a program ina large-scale randomized controlled trial. This Phase II proposed project will involve (a) the development of the full 10-module WPT program and (b) the evaluation of the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of the program compared to Bibliotherapy (BPT) and a Waitlist Control (WLC) in (a) parents concerned about their child (ages 7-14) suffering subclinical anxiety (non clinic sample) and (b) in parents of youth (ages 7-14) who are concurrently receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for youth anxiety (clinic sample), in producing improvement in parent understanding of anxiety, strategies to support their child in managing anxiety, and evidence-based practice.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schools are the primary setting within which children receive mental health (MH) services. The effectiveness of MH programs has been repeatedly demonstrated for a wide array of MH problems, including behavioral and emotional disorders, substance abuse, ADHD, and suicidality. However, despite their availability, as well as recent education and federal financial incentives for use of programs supported by empirical evidence, MH evidence-based interventions (EBIs) are rarely used in everyday practice by schools. Further, school MH EBIs that have proven effective under strict research conditions often fail to achieve their intended outcomes when delivered in the  real world . A wealth of research indicates the quality of EBIimplementation is directly related to 1) the likelihood the intervention will be integrated and sustained within the school setting and 2) the strength of its treatment effects. The goal of this Phase II SBIR is to continue the research and development ofCenterVention, a web-based technology infrastructure designed to promote broad-scale quality implementation of school MH EBIs. CenterVention will provide cost-effective high quality training, on-going implementation assistance, intervention resources, andadherence monitoring to support EBI implementation and sustainability within schools. Phase I prototype development and feasibility testing with key stakeholders were successfully completed, providing substantial support for the CenterVention product as well as specific recommendations for Phase II development. The first aim of Phase II is to revise each CenterVention component to enhance its usability and value. Once the full technology infrastructure is complete, we will integrate a third, independent school MH EBI and examine the usability of this new CenterVention application with school MH providers, teachers, administrators, and intervention developers. The second aim of Phase II is to conduct a rigorous, longitudinal test of the CenterVention productcomparing two randomized conditions: Implementation-As-Usual (IAU; i.e., traditional EBI implementation with no CenterVention support) and Enhanced Implementation (EI; i.e., CenterVention-supported implementation). Five implementation outcomes will be examined: (1) readiness for EBI implementation, (2) adherence to EBI protocol, (3) satisfaction with the EBI and its implementation support, (4) sustainability of the EBI over time, and (5) treatment benefits for students. The third aim of Phase II is to finalize all product components based on Phase II findings and evaluations and prepare CenterVention for Phase III commercialization. This SBIR project will yield a flexible, scalable technology infrastructure that can be applied to any school MH EBI to effectively decrease costs (time, financial, personnel) to both schools and intervention developers, enhance the integrity with which EBIs are implemented in the school setting, and increase dissemination of EBIs into real world everyday practice. The proposed WDT not only offers the potential for significant societal benefits, but also addresses a large, currently untapped market.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As the mental health research-practice gap has become increasingly evident, numerous federal reports have called for action to better connect research findings to clinical practice (e.g., The President&#039;s New Freedom Commission Report [1]; Reports of the Surgeon General on Mental Health [2], Youth Violence [3], and Culture, Race, and Ethnicity [4]; and theNational Children&#039;s Call to Action [5]). Building on the recommendations of clinical and research community members during the  Enhancing the Discipline of Clinical and Translational Sciences  meeting (May, 2005), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) identified research efforts to bridge science and practice as the primary objective of NIH&#039;s roadmap. The proposed research directly addresses this NIH Roadmap priority as well as these federal calls for action. Each year, about 6% of America&#039;s children andadolescents receive some form of mental health (MH) care, at an annual cost of more than  11 billion. In addition, each year NIMH and other foundations fund more than  300 million for youth MH research, much of it devoted to treatment studies. The findingsfrom the proposed research will advance our understanding of how to successfully integrate MH EBIs into everyday practice within the primary MH service setting for youth, i.e., schools. Increasing the likelihood that EBIs will be adopted, used as intended, and sustained in everyday practice in schools, in turn, will increase the likelihood that youth and society at large will benefit from evidence-based practices.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II SBIR application proposes continued development of an Information Technology Enabled Disease Management System for Treatment of Adolescent Depression (ITEMS-TAD) following a highly successful Phase I awardin which all Specific Aims were met. The need for this system innovation arises from the substantial costs that inadequately treated adolescent Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) has on the course of adolescent development and society as a whole. Effective treatments involving the combined use of a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) and the administration of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is considered the  modal treatment  for adolescent MM. Yet, multiple barriers interfere with the implementation and dissemination of this  gold standard&#039; of care. These barriers include: under recognition of depressive symptoms by parents and pediatricians, inability to assess adolescent depression accurately and reliably in primary care settings, safety concerns related to pharmacologic treatment, monitoring of symptom changes and adverse treatment effects, such as irritability and suicidal behavior, treatment non-compliance, lack of access to an integrated medical and treatment history; and an alarming shortage of properly trained child and adolescent psychiatrists capable of implementing optimal treatment safely, reliably, and effectively. With an emphasis on making tailored forms of CBT broadly and easily accessible to the community, the ITEMS-TAD is intendedto address these problems. Development of the system will continue by building onto the existing prototype created with funding from federal sources. The technological infrastructure of the prototype includes a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI)platform, a database consisting of patients&#039; real time medical and treatment history, and an underlying set of intelligent algorithms that tailors the intensity of the treatment resources and approaches administered in individual cases. When interacting with patients over the telephone, primary care nurses use the CATI to facilitate the reliable assessment of patient status and administer manualized, empirically informed interventions. Phase I focused on the development and testing of a demo system that embodies critical features of this approach. The following specific aims will be achieved in Phase II: (1) content for the remaining ITEMS-TAD program will be developed; (2) a Rapid Iterative Evaluation and Testing (RITE) study will be undertaken to refine the content of the application and assess the usability of the technology involved in its delivery; (3) a field trial will be run to evaluate empirically indicators of efficacy and patient acceptance related to the ITEMS-TAD approach.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The lifetime prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) among adolescents is extremely high, with substantial costs for individual adolescents, their families, and society. Effective  gold standard  treatments have been developed for MDD, yetmultiple barriers interfere with its availability and delivery on a wide scale basis. This request for Phase II funding continues a highly successful Phase I project that will continue to develop an innovative IT-based administration and management systemoptimizing adolescent depression care for large segments of the population.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Repetitive exposures to psychosocial stress are associated with several human diseases (e.g., cancer, drug addiction, heart disease, depression) of noteworthy public health burden. However, our progress is limited by the lack of a portable device that can enable rapid, dependable, non-invasive and continuous measurement of personal exposure to psychosocial stress in real-time, as experienced by individuals in their natural environments. Although reliable methods to assess exposure to psychosocial stress in clinical settings exist, these intermittent assessments do not accurately portray timing, duration, frequency, or intensity of exposure. Currently there are more than 3600 registered endocrinologists in the US and on anaverage they refer five patients per day for cortisol tests. This test is ordered by sending patient&#039;s samples to the lab. Therefore, there is a grave need to develop a rapid test for cortisol so a  No-Stress Stress Measuring Device  can be developed. Inthis interdisciplinary Phase II project, we propose to develop a new device called  StressSmartTM , which will house a rapid test for cortisol developed during Phase I, namely InstaCortisolTM. Cortisol is the primary steroid produced and secreted by the adrenal cortex and is used as a reliable indicator of stress. Our rapid test is based on immunoelectrochemical method where the reaction signal is measured by using dithiobissuccinimidyl propionate (DTSP) self assembled monolayer (SAM) based immunosensor forcortisol. Detection is being facilitated using impedance measuring technique. There are six specific aims of this project. First is further refining and optimizing the cortisol sensor fabrication and sensor evaluation, including sensitivity, specificity,detection limit, linearity, accuracy, dynamic range, repeatability, precision, accuracy, interference, cross-reactivity, drift, and sensor calibration. Second is the development of microfluidic architecture system. The third aim would be the design, fabrication, integration and development of a microfluidic valves. Several such valves will be needed as parts of the three disposable cartridges. Fourth and fifth aim being the development of a reliable vacuum microfluidics pump, followed by cortisol sensor housing development as part of the device. Throughout the program, some other efforts will also include cortisol sensor clotting mitigation, cortisol sensor electronic Interface board development, cortisol sensor miniaturization efforts, clinical validation and the design integration feasibility. A virtual evaluation of cortisol sensor chip and its integration into a compact easy to use design will be carried out in parallel. A virtual evaluation of cortisol sensor chip and its integration into a compact easyto use design will also be carried out throughout the Year 2 budget period. Relevance: The InstaCortisolTM test (developed during Phase I), which will be part of StressSmartTM device during Phase II, will enable researchers to quantify personal exposure topsychosocial stress, as experienced by individuals in real-life situations. Cortisol production follows a circadian rhythm, and moreover it is affected by stimulatory events or nutrient intake, so it important to measure the trend of cortisol in a personversus taking a single measurement in one day as is done traditionally. Recent research surveys have revealed that the minimal number of samples needed in a day for an accurate assessment of cortisol is five. Our current disposable cartridge is designed tocollect four measurements over 24 hours for the proof of concept. However, this device can be easily re-designed to include any other clinically relevant requirements. Availability of such a non-invasive and rapid cortisol measuring device will allow patients to be able to monitor their cortisol levels over 24 hours and professionals to be able to modify dosing regiments at multiple points throughout the day.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are proposing to make a tool for rapid detection of cortisol, called StressSmartTM.  InstaCortisolTM  (a rapid cortisol test developed during Phase I), will be integrated in StressSmart device to develop a portable test for real-time measurement of personal exposure to psychosocial stress via detecting cortisol in interstitial fluid (ISF). The new minimally invasive tool will enable researchers to quantify personal exposure to psychosocial stress, as experienced by individuals in real-life situations. This device will be capable of measuring cortisol quantitatively, selectively, objectively, reliably, and securely.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social reciprocity, verbal and nonverbal communication, and behavior. It is among the most prevalent of all developmental disabilities, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 110. Early detection and intervention has been shown to improve long-term outcomes, including language functioning, cognitive/developmental skills, and social and adaptive behavior, preventing a cascade of effects that result from early deficits impacting later functioning. From a public health perspective, early intervention may also ultimately reduce the considerable lifetime cost and service system demands. Unfortunately, there is a gap between our knowledge of effective intervention strategies and the availability of these resources, due in part to a critical shortage of professionals trained in these interventions. One way to bridge this gap is to teach parents how to utilize these techniques in their daily interactions with theirchildren. Learning effective ways of interacting with a child with autism is critical both for improving long term outcomes for the child in terms of remediation of the core deficits associated with the disorder, as well as reducing the stress on the caregiver. One such program recently developed ( Enhancing Interactions ) provides individualized instruction to caregivers with children under 3 years old with autism. The program consists of 12 sessions and has the dual goals of improving interactions and parenting effectiveness while at the same time improving the core deficits and long term outcomes in the child. Based on empirically validated techniques, the sessions are unique in that the clinicians go the child&#039;s home to observe problematic behaviors inreal time, and model in vivo different teaching strategies with the child and coach the parents as they implement the strategies themselves. While the program has been highly successful, its ability to provide help to those needing it is limited due to thelack of trained clinicians to provide such services. One way to increase the accessibility to this program is through the use of web-based technologies. In phase I we developed a prototype of a web-based interactive tutorial for caregivers of young children with autism designed to a) teach parents how to promote their child&#039;s development in the core deficit areas, b) help parents understand and improve challenging behaviors their child may demonstrate, and c) reduce caregiver stress through more effectiveinteractions. It emphasizes everyday situations as opportunities for learning, including common home routines and community activities and contains videotaped illustrations (modeling) of the techniques taught in research-based intervention settings. Both feasibility and user satisfaction was demonstrated with the Phase I prototype. Phase II will develop the complete tutorial and evaluate its efficacy in a diverse sample of 100 parents recruited from early intervention and school based intervention programs,U.S. Military Family Intervention programs, autism clinics, and direct to parent recruitment.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Early intervention in autism improves long-term outcomes, however few clinicians are trained in these interventions. This study will utilize a web-based tutorial to empower parents to administer these interventions directly to their children during their daily interactions. Web access makes this training more widely accessible, and if effective, will improve the long-term outcomes for the child, reduce caregiver stress, and from a public health perspective, may ultimately reduce the considerable lifetime cost and service system demands associated with providing autism care to individuals with autism and their families.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by APPLICANT): The need for evidence-based mental health treatments i.e., &#039;treatment based on the best available science or research evidence&#039; 1, has been stressed from scientific, ethical, and marketing perspectives3. While empiricalevidence supports both the efficacy and effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders4-8, the demand for clinicians trained in these approaches far exceeds the supply. For example, in spite of empirical data supporting the efficacy of these approaches for anxiety disorders, only 11 percent of treated anxiety disorder patients received behavior therapy as their treatment, and only 16 percent of treated patients received cognitive therapy 9. This compares with 40 percent of treatedpatients receiving dynamic therapy, which has less empirical support for its efficacy in anxiety disorders. A major reason for this is the lack of trained cognitive behavior therapists 10. New technologies provide the opportunity to both facilitate accessibility to this specialized training by mental health professionals and to improve the quality of this training. Recent research has found that training clinicians using these new web-based technologies is highly effective, can significantly improve skills,and has significant advantages over traditional training programs11,12. These tools could be integrated into an applied academic practicum, as well as utilized by clinicians in the field through continuing education. The long term goal of this project isto increase the number of available mental health professionals trained in cognitive behavior therapy for anxiety disorders by developing a set of web-based training tools enabling the widespread dissemination of this training. In Phase I we developed a prototype on- line tutorial covering some core CBT principles and a Social Anxiety Disorder module. We also tested the feasibility of live remote training through videoconferencing. User satisfaction with both the on-line tutorial and the videoconference training was extremely high. Trainees&#039; knowledge of CBT concepts improved significantly pre-to-post tutorial. No technical difficulties were reported with either the tutorial or the videoconference training. In Phase II we will expand the tutorial prototype to include a comprehensive review of CBT principles and techniques and expand modules to include the full spectrum of anxiety disorders (i.e., Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Panic Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder). We will also evaluate the efficacy of live remote training in improving clinical skills. A cohort of 5 clinicians from diverse educational and professional backgrounds will be recruited. Improvement in trainees&#039; conceptual knowledgewill be evaluated pre and post tutorial, and improvement in trainees&#039; clinical skills in applying the CBT concepts will be evaluated by blind ratings of clinicl adherence and competence before and after videoconference training. User satisfaction with boththe on-line tutorial and the videoconference training will also be evaluated.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Anxiety disorders are a major public health concern, having a profound impact on functioning, causing significant disability, loss of productivity and suffering.  Effective treatments exist for these disorders, but few clinicians are trained in these methods. This project attempts to remedy this shortcoming by using web-based tools to facilitate access to this training, thus increasing the numberof available therapists in order to help meet this unmet need.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vasopressin (AVP) antagonists represent a novel therapeutic class for the treatment of depression. The potential utility of these compounds has emerged from observations in depressed individuals, findings in animal models, and an understanding of changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation under chronic stress. This Fast Track proposal seeks support for the identification of novel mixed vasopressin 1a/1b (V1a/V1b) receptor antagonists and the preclinical development of recently discovered molecules in this class that already demonstrate excellent biological activity in vitro. The scientific basis for mixed V1a/V1b antagonists as a pharmacotherapy for depression includes: 1) the neuroadaptation and dysregulation of HPA function that accompanies chronic stress in affected humans and in animal models of depression, 2) recognition that AVP, not CRF, drives HPA function associated with chronic psychological stress, and 3) the localization of V1a and V1b receptors in regions involved in the control of social behaviors and HPA axis regulation (V1a in limbic system; V1b in limbic system and anterior pituitary). The initial development of these mixed antagonists to date has been supported by private sector venture funding. SBIR Fast Track support will enable essential preclinical development work that will advance candidate molecules to the stage where bulk synthesis and IND-enabling toxicology can be undertaken. Bringing candidates to this status will acceleratecommercialization opportunities by significantly enhancing the likelihood of additional private financial investment or a co-development partnership structure with a major pharmaceutical house.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health need for newpharmaceutical treatments for depression is well documented. Depression affects some 20 million Americans each year and carries a conservatively estimated annual total economic burden of  125 billion. Existing drugs for depression are not uniformly effective, frequently have undesirable side effects, and do not help some 50% of individuals suffering from the disorder according to recent estimates. These limitations demonstrate that a new treatment approach through mixed V1a/V1b receptor antagonism may offer a significant opportunity for improved outcomes with substantial societal benefit.",

Our group has demonstrated that rtfMRI-based training enables subjects to learn control over activation of anatomically-localized brain regions, leading to reductions in disease symptoms, including pain and depressive symptoms. These investigations further the NIH mission by advancing understanding of distributed brain mechanisms of depression and by definitively testing a novel therapeutic modality for alleviating a condition which is responsible for substantial human suffering and healthcare cost. This research program will develop novel high-throughput analysis tools that directly enable new methods for cognitive interventions based on rtfMRI-based training. This research will conduct a randomized, controlled, clinical trial of this novel investigative therapeutic technology and methods for treating depression in patients refractory to prior treatment modalities. Decreasing depressive symptoms, and improving control over mood are the initial clinical targets.     Phase I: 1) Demonstratefeasibility and efficacy of tasks for cognitive control over mood in depressive patients; 2) Identify brain regions with activations associated with cognitive control over mood in depressive patients.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electrochemical Home Monitoring System for Lithium Blood Level Lithium in the form of lithium carbonate is an important pharmacological treatment option in bipolar disorder (BD) and other conditions. However, lithium has a narrow therapeutic treatment range and its use requires careful monitoring of a patient&#039;s lithium blood level, particularly during the initiation of treatment. Current monitoring techniques are inconvenient and costly, requiring a clinical analytical laboratory. There is no commercially-available system for home measurement of blood lithium. The goal of this program is the development of an electrochemically-based detection method packaged into a portable, self-contained, easy-to-use instrument/system for the analysis of lithium. It will be appropriate for use in a home setting for the monitoring of lithium level for BD patients or other patients utilizing lithium treatment. It could also be used in the clinician&#039;s office for real-time readings during office visits. A major advantage of the proposed technology is that electrochemical techniques can be packaged into instruments for automated operation in the home which makes them very inexpensive and convenient compared to other laboratory-based analyticaltechniques. The final home lithium monitor product will have the same ease-of-use of a home glucose monitor and provide the clinician with real- time lithium measurements needed for optimal and cost-effective treatment of the patient. This instrument willreliably and accurately determine the lithium concentration within several minutes after the patient supplies a blood sample by finger prick and the results will be reported in real time to the clinician. Frequent home monitoring could be used both to regulate dosage and to confirm patient is taking the prescribed medication. This will improve patient care as well as decrease medical costs. During Phase I, Giner, Inc. developed sensor design configurations, with high performance electrode material, and operating conditions which demonstrated feasibility of electrochemical detection of the relevant range (0.2-3 mM) of lithium ion (Li+) in an aqueous medium, including a physiological fluid stimulant. The ability to measure lithium ion concentration in the presence of physiological concentrations of sodium and potassium ions was demonstrated and is key to the success of the proposed electroanalytical technique. The ability to measure directly in an aqueous system is an extremely valuable Phase l finding, as itkeeps the detection of lithium in blood as simple as possible. The Phase II Specific Aims encompass optimization of the detection method, development of the microanalysis system, design and fabrication of an integrated Instrument, and laboratory sample evaluation in collaboration with The Massachusetts General Hospital Bipolar Clinic and Research Program.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this SBIR research and development program is the development of a home-based monitoring system for blood lithium for patient&#039;s use. The lithium blood level is very critical; therefore, bipolar disorder patients are now required to have frequent laboratory blood tests. A home-based system would provide convenience for patients while improving treatment anddecreasing health care costs.",

Technology innovationsto reduce infection brought about by cross-contamination of patients staying in healthcare facilities can have major impact to the medical community in terms of both dollars and human lives. Approximately 5% to 10% of all patients entering a hospital willcontact some form of infection during their stay at the healthcare facility. It is estimated that hospitals spend over  30 billion annually and over 100,000 lives can be lost as a result of nosocomial infections. Statistics show that personal hygiene consisting mainly of hand washing with antimicrobial soaps does not occur frequently enough to prevent the  30 billion dollar expenditure that healthcare facilities endure on an annual basis. Unfortunately, medical products containing only 0.1-1.0% of leachable antimicrobial additives only provide temporary antimicrobial action because the biocidal agent can be easily removed by washing or wiping the surface of the medical product. Brighton Development has developed with NIH support a 100% permanent antimicrobial plastic that can be used in numerous medical products found in the healthcare community. In Phase II, we would like to focus on exploiting the feasibility of this discovery as a permanent 100% antimicrobial material and demonstrate its advantages in combating infection in the healthcare environment. Brighton Development will generate the required data to obtain registration of the 100% antimicrobial products with the EPA and subsequently provide these products to the healthcare community. The goals of this project are in alignment with one of NIH top priorities of HAI elimination (Healthcare-associated Infections) that has dramatic impact in terms of both dollars and human lives.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     An implantable wireless flow sensor system has been under development that would enable measurement of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, currently used to treat hydrocephalus patients. CSF flow is a key indicator of shunt function, and there is currently no way to measure it in situ, resulting in the absence of clinical methods to directly assess shunt function or to predict its failure. Using MEMS microfabrication methods, the proposed flow sensor will be manufactured at a size small enough to be integrable with implanted VP shunts. The key elements in the flow meter are capacitive structures that change properties with change in CSF flow. Electromagnetic coupling between the internal passive circuitry and an external handheld circuit allows implantation of the flow sensor without the need for implanted batteries or transcutaneous wires. The proposed Phase II project will build on the encouraging results of Phase I, which demonstrated the wireless interrogation of proof-of-concept MEMS sensors and the presence of a readily measurable relationship of flow to the resonance of the sensor. In Phase II, fully-function flow-sensing MEMS chips will be manufactured, as well as arevised handheld unit that will display and output flow, based on the known relationship between flow rate and resonance. In vitro testing will establish calibration for the sensor implants, and will demonstrate measurement accuracy over the full physiological range of CSF flow, over long periods of time, and with appropriate phantom models. In parallel, a chronic sheep hydrocephalus model will be in preparation, along with implementation of appropriate packaging, biocompatibility, and sterilizability intothe sensor implant prototypes, as well as consideration of MR compatibility. Performance of an animal test protocol shall evaluate the sensor in regard to (1) sensitivity and specificity with regard to detection of flow obstruction, (2) CSF flow measurement accuracy, and (3) effect on shunt patency.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Every year there are approximately 23,000 shunt revisions performed in the U.S., in order to correct the relatively common failure of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts used totreat hydrocephalus patients. However, children are still dying from shunt failure, and studies indicate that earlier detection would save a large fraction of these children. An implantable, wireless CSF flow meter would enable the clinician to monitor shunt function during routine office visits (rather than waiting for the re-appearance of hydrocephalus symptoms), allowing detection of impending shunt failure, avoidance of lifesaving treatment on an emergency basis, and reduction of mortality associated with VP shunt failure.",

DBS therapy uses controllable electrical stimulation delivered to specific deep brain structures through an implantable lead having multiple electrode contacts. DBS is currently the treatment of choice for late-stage Parkinson&#039;s Disease and is approved for essential tremor, dystonia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. It isunder investigation for depression, chronic vegetative state, obesity, and dementia. There is a clinical need-and significant commercial opportunity-for innovative DBS leads and next-generation DBS systems that provide enhanced targeting, stimulation selectivity and tuning, and MR- safety. NeuroNexus has previously developed and demonstrated feasibility of an innovative MR-safe DBS lead (the Deep Brain Stimulation Array, or DBSA) for precise, selective, and tunable therapeutic electrical stimulation of deepbrain targets. The proposed Phase II SBIR project is directed at further development of the DBSA to a fully validated, clinical-grade DBS lead that, at the end of this project, will be positioned for clinical evaluation and then commercialization. This project will be directed by NeuroNexus with pre-clinical testing conducted at MPI Research, Inc. and the University of Michigan. The project structure follows a standard product development process for clinical products to comply with regulatory requirementsfor design controls and testing. The explicit goal of this project is to complete all development, verification, and validation stages that are required to prepare an IDE submission to gain FDA permission to commence the initial clinical trial for the DBSA. The technical innovation of the project centers on the use of advanced microfabricated electrode technology to create an advanced clinical DBS lead that has increased capabilities for delivering therapeutic stimulation patterns to deep brain targets ina safe and efficacious manner. This project will result in an innovative, clinical-grade DBS lead that will be positioned for commercialization as part of a next-generation DBS system, as well as an innovative research product for neuroscience research. Inso doing, this project will increase the impact of leading-edge neurotechnology on improving and advancing treatments of significant neurological disorders in the US and global markets.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices- &#039;brain pacemakers&#039; - have recently emerged as an exciting novel neurotechnology for treating severe movement disorders, such as Parkinson&#039;s disease and Essential Tremor.

However, conventional silicone encapsulation technologies are unfit for many miniature medical devices including implantable, chronic microelectrode arrays used in some neuroprosheses.

The goal of this work is to produce electrically insulating, biostable iCVD coatings for chronic neural prosthetic devices. In Phase I, we have demonstrated that iCVD silicone coatings exhibit prolonged stability in simulated in-vivo environments under constant sweeping voltage bias (6+ years under soak without any loss in resistivity), show excellent adhesion and flexibility, are bioinert, and meet USP Plastic Class VI requirements. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a three folds increase in deposition rate via the codeposition of a linear siloxane spacer molecule, making the process even more economically viable for commercialization. In Phase II, GVD will qualify promising deposition conditions andde-insulation methods for neural probe coatings. A serives of in-vitro tests will allow us to downselect the most promising conditions. GVD will partner with Dr. William Shain (Seattle Children&#039;s Research Institute) to confirm the suitability of selected probe coating methods through staggered in vivo studies. Upon successful performance demonstrated during the in vivo studies, GVD will design an upgraded coating system optimized for cost-effective commercial production of successful coatings. The ultimategoal of this work is to achieve single step encapsulation of three-dimensional neural probe arrays and of neural prosthetic assemblies. The development of a stable, durable, biocompatible insulating coating under this Phase II will enable that goal to be achieved.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The success of this Phase II will allow GVD to offer to researchers and manufacturers a proven, effective tool for the biocompatible insulation and encapsulation of neuroprosthetic devices capable of augmentingimpaired function of the nervous system. The coating developed under this work will overcome shortfalls of other encapsulants and provide greater flexibility in the design of devices, the choice of materials used, and the minimum dimensions which can be achieved in neuroprosthetic devices. Therapeutically, the coating will provide safe and effective protection and enhanced reliability of devices in chronic applications. The long-term impact will be to de-bottleneck the development of devices and acceleratetheir proliferation as treatments for neurological disorders.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of an organ as complex as the brain depends on an intricate interplay of thousands of signaling proteins, orchestrated by an interacting web of regulatory factors. Recent ENCODE data reveal that the large tracts of so-called &#039;junk&#039; DNA in introns and between genes is, in fact, actively transcribed. The functions of these non-coding transcripts, which number in the millions, are virtually unknown, although one small sib-class - the microRNAs - is receiving close attention as regulatory RNAs. One process that may be controlled by the non-coding transcripts is alternate exon use - a mechanism that adds significantly to the diversity of cellular proteins (particularly in the CNS), the regulation of which is littleunderstood at this time. Recent advances that generate whole-transcriptome data have provided the means to systematically explore both these factors. However, the bioinformatic challenges are substantial, and the lack of comprehensive, well designed, andeasily used software to manage, visualize, analyze and interpret the data will likely be the limiting factor in this field of research. We propose to develop a bioinformatics toolkit specifically to integrate whole-transcriptome data from two different technologies, the Affymetrix All Exon microarray which 1.4 million distinct transcript measurements, and RNASeq, which provides for &#039;digital&#039; expression analysis of the whole transcriptome. The toolkit will also integrate epigenomic data that will be essential in the understanding of regulation of transcription. The design and development of the software will be guided by prominent scientists engaged in the study of the brain, and will be applied to sample datasets derived from neurological tissues, to ensurethat the program incorporates functions and annotations relevant to this field.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While the large-scale array technologies have provided an unprecedented capability to model cellular processes in the brain, both in normal functioning and disease states, this capability is utterly dependent on the availability of complex data management, computational, statistical and informatics software tools. The utility of the next generation of arrays and sequencing technologies- which focus on critical regulation and control functions of the cell - will be stymied by an initial lack of suitable bioinformatic tools. This proposal initiates an accelerated development of an integrated software package intended to empower biologists in the application and analysis of these powerful new technologies, with broadly reaching impact at all levels of biological and clinical research, and across every discipline.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients are frequently hospitalized for management of uncontrolled seizures due to epilepsy or acute neurological insults such as trauma, stroke, infections, and a number of toxic and metabolic disorders. However, inpatient management of seizures is complicated by the fact that they occur intermittently and unpredictably, and thus it is not infrequent that patients&#039; seizures go unrecognized. This can result in unnecessarily prolonged hospital stays, or worse, delay of treatment and irreversible brain injury. Therefore, there is a great need to develop an accurate bed-side seizure monitroing and alert (SMA) system.  The overall goal of this SBIR project is to commercialize an accurate, reliable, and user-friendly EEG-based seizure monitoring and alert (EEGSMA) system for use in clinical settings where patients require close neurological monitoring. Intended clinical settings include but are not limited to, epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs), intensive care units (ICUs), emergency departments (EDs), and general care units for neurology and neurosurgical patients. Researchers at Optima Neuroscience have developed an automated algorithm to accurately detect seizures by analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns of scalp EEG signals.The algorithm was incorporated in our IdentEvent  seizure detection software, which received FDA approval on October 16, 2009. During the Phase I of this SBIR project, we have further completed bed-side hardware design of the SMA system and transformed IdentEvent for real-time application. The SMA system was successfully tested in simulation real-time mode, and initial clinical feasibility testing has been completed.  In this Phase II application, we propose to continue the clinical testing for the SMA system as well as expand the functions of the EEGSMA system for use in acute care environments, e.g., ICUs and EDs. To accomplish this, we not only have to develop a reliable, portable, and user-friendly EEG acquisition module that can be set up quickly, but also we need to expand IdentEvent for use in children and for ICU patients. Therefore, the specific aims of this application are: (1) to complete the clinical performance evaluation of the SMA module in an EMU setting, (2) to design and test front end hardware and software components of the EEG head-box and integrate them with the SMA system, (3) to complete pre-clinical testing and pilot outpatient study of the integrated EEGSMA system, (4) to conduct inpatient testing of the integrated EEGSMA system in EMUs, (5) to test the detection algorithm (IdentEvent) on pediatric patients (age 3 ~ 17) in EMUs, and (6) to further develop a seizure detection algorithm for ICU patients.  Successful commercialization of this EEGSMA device will improve inpatient managementof seizures by allowing for detection of intermittent and previously misdiagnosed events.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although automated monitoring for critical heart and lung function is the standard of care in all hospitals, monitoring the functionof the brain currently relies almost exclusively upon bedside clinical observations. As a result, a large number of subclinical seizures (only subtle observable changes) go undiagnosed every day. The primary goal of this project is to build and test a prototype for a greatly needed automated system to alert staff untrained in neurology to the presence of seizure activities. The overall goal is to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients suffering from seizure disorders, particularly in community hospitals where EEG trained neurologists may not be available.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Epoch Telemetry System for Long-Term Monitoring of Biopotentials ABSTRACT Neonatal and childhood seizures can increase an individual&#039;s susceptibility for developing epilepsy later in life. Obtaining long-term continuous recordings of electrical events, such as the electroencephalogram (EEG), from animal models of neurological disease is a critical component of translational research aimed at developing new therapies for debilitating disorders, such as epilepsy. Manyimmature- and adult-rodent models have recently been developed that are surrogates for human manifestations of seizures in the pediatric and adult populations. While tethered (i.e.,  wired ) recordings of the EEG can be obtained periodically (i.e., for minutes to a few hours per session in rodent pups) these recordings have problems associated with the small size of rodent pups and their reliance upon the dam early in life up to weaning at postnatal day 21 (P21) in rats. Likewise, EEG recordings can be obtained for weeks or months at a time from adult rats with either tethered or telemetric (i.e.,  wireless ) recording systems; however, both of these systems have problems. The younger the animal, the more difficult it is to obtain adequate recordings, and itis nearly impossible to obtain continuous, uninterrupted recordings. The fundamental principle of the Epoch recording system is that the capacitive-coupled technology combined with the small shape and low profile of the telemetry unit will allow multiplerats or mice to be recorded simultaneously, enabling continuous EEG, cranial temperature, and video recordings. In the Phase I program, Epitel, Inc., developed a small (lt 1 cc, lt 1 g) wireless device that enables uninterrupted, EEG recordings from up tofour EEG channels in rats age P7 and mice age P12 through weaning and adulthood (i.e., continuously for many months at a time) that is the basis of the Epoch recording system. The long-term goal is for researchers to be able to use the Epoch system in translational research to develop new therapies for different types of animal models of acquired and genetic pediatric epilepsy and ultimately, other neonatal- and adult-rodent models of human disease. The ability to obtain long-term continuous recordings should facilitate answering the question of how and when to treat seizures in neonates, children, and adults, potentially blocking the development of chronic epilepsy after brain injury.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This grant application aims to commercialize a new miniature telemetry system for rat and mouse pups and adults that should facilitate translational research on animal models of neonatal, childhood, and adult seizures. The device will enable uninterrupted EEG recordings from at least postnatal day 7 (rats) and postnatal day 12 (mice) through weaning and into adulthood, providing a complete record of the animal&#039;s seizures. The long- term goal is to develop a pre-clinical tool to develop therapies against human seizures and ultimately, other rodent models of human disease.",

Positron Emission Tomography (PET) offers high sensitivity to a range of biological processes through the use of targeted radio labeled probes. Unfortunately, precise signal localization can be extremely difficult dueto low spatial resolution and the lack of anatomical information. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can provide high spatial resolution and excellent soft tissue contrast, but suffers from poor signal strength leading to low sensitivity. The overall goal of the proposed effort is to combine the best features of PET and MR modalities for small animal studies into a single, very high performance imaging instrument that will record data in both imaging modalities simultaneously. The most obvious benefit of theintegrated system will be to provide high-resolution anatomical context for small-animal PET studies. This will lead to better overall understanding of the origin of the PET signals. The &#039;in-register&#039; MR images can be used to estimate partial volume errors in the lower-resolution PET scans, thus aiding quantification of the PET signal. To achieve these objectives, a high resolution, high sensitivity PET system will be designed and built and will be tested first on a bench, followed by detailed evaluation inside a commercial small animal MR imaging system.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This Phase 2 SBIR will provide and clinically validate the first portable, non-invasive diagnostic test for differentiating intermittently flowing patent shunts from occluded or partially occluded shunts - ShuntCheck- Micro-Pumper. This device will result in improved clinical management of hydrocephalus by providing a rapid and non-invasive method for detecting CSF shunt obstruction in symptomatic patients, and, potentially for identifying oncoming occlusion before symptoms emerge. Hydrocephalus, a common condition in which CSF accumulates in the brain ventricles, is corrected by placing a VP shunt that drains excess CSF to the abdomen. Shunts frequently malfunction, usually by obstruction, but the symptoms of shunt failure are unspecific - headache, nausea. Diagnosis of shunt malfunction is expensive and presents risks (exposure to radiation from CT Scans, risk of infection from radionuclide testing) and no tools exist for predicting shunt malfunction. There are currently no non-invasive, non-radiologic technologies for assessing shunt function and malfunction. NeuroDx has developed a non-invasive device called ShuntCheck which uses thermal dilution to detect CSF flow in subcutaneous shunts. While clinical studies of ShuntCheck demonstrated the accuracy of flow/no-flow measurements, they showed that  no-flow  does not indicate an occluded shunt (since shunt flow can be intermittent) and  flow  does not indicate a patent shunt (since a partially occluded shunt can causeelevated ICP while allowing CSF flow). To address this problem, NeuroDx developed the Micro-Pumper, a small, handheld device which generates a temporary increase in CSF flow through patent but not occluded shunts. This  micro-pumped  flow can be detected by ShuntCheck as an indication of shunt flow capacity. In our Phase 1 studies, we developed operating parameters and a laboratory prototype Micro-Pumper that reliably generates increased CSF flow in a wide variety of patent, but not partially-obstructed, shunt valves. Repeated micro-pumping did not result in any adverse effects on shunt valve function. A pilot clinical study of the ShuntCheck-Micro-Pumper, currently underway at Children&#039;s Hospital Boston, indicates that the procedure is acceptable to pediatric patients and generates detectable flows in patent shunts. In Phase 2, we plan to develop a production ready version of the Micro-Pumper, optimize the ShuntCheck design for use with the Micro-Pumper and validate the accuracy of the combined procedure inhuman clinical studies. Pediatric shunt malfunction and management testing constitute approximately 310,000 shunt flow tests annually in the United States alone. NeuroDx&#039;s business model for this product involves the generation of revenue primarily from the ongoing sale of single-use, disposable sensors for these tests. The need for new diagnostic tools for managing hydrocephalus patients is highlighted by the NIH announcement  Advanced Tools and Technologies for Cerebrospinal Fluid Shunts  (PA-09-206), towhich this proposal is responding. Our proposal directly responds to the request for Diagnostic tools for use in a hospital or outpatient setting that work in real-time to quantitatively determine shunt function.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This proposal addresses the need for diagnostic tools for use in a hospital or outpatient setting that work in real-time to quantitatively determine shunt function by providing the first portable, non-invasive diagnostic procedure for differentiating intermittently flowing patent shunts from occluded or partially occluded shunts. Obstruction of CSF shunts, a common complication in hydrocephalus, is currently diagnosed by radiation imaging techniques, such as CT Scan, or by invasive procedures, such as shunt tapping. This new tool will help neurosurgeons differentiate between intermittently flowing and obstructed shunts and potentially for identifying oncoming occlusion before symptoms emerge.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Essential Tremor (ET) is the single most common motion disorder, affecting 10 million people in the US alone. Due to the debilitating muscle movements associated with this disease, people with ET have difficulty in performing daily functions such as eating and drinking. As a result, many people become socially isolated and are also forced to retire from occupations held before the disease onset. Unfortunately, current pharmacological treatments have limited effectiveness in abating tremor, and surgical procedures can be expensive and invasive. To solve this problem, Lynx Design is investigating a cost-effective, lightweight, hand- held stabilization device called the ACT (Active Cancellation of Tremor) system. During Phase I work, a state- of-the-art hand-held prototype was developed and tested, demonstrating a reduction of tremor disturbances by up to 80% (for 1-2 cm). This result exceeded Phase I goals for technical feasibility and showed promise for future applications. Proposed Phase II work will focus on developing the ACT system further through a combination of clinical research and RandD. Key developments will focus on: 1) demonstrating/characterizing the technology&#039;s efficacy 2) improving control and long-term reliability and 3) designing the system for general use in daily activities (based on patient feedback). Detailed plans to commercialize the ACT system in the growing assistive device market are in place and will be executed after the Phase II work. The resulting distribution of the ACT technology will impact the growing population of ET sufferers, positively impacting their quality of life.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Lynx Design proposes to develop and commercialize an active tremor cancellation technology that will assist individuals affected by motion disorders such as Essential Tremor. Preliminary studies have demonstrated both feasibility of the technology and a strong unmet demand among suffering patients.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Summary  The studies proposed in this application are aimed at progressing an innovative approach to treating  mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) toward clinical trials.  MPS is a family of lysosomal storage diseases caused by mutations  in the enzymes that normally degrade glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).  Because of deficiencies in the mutated enzymes,  GAGs build up to toxic levels causing a wide range of symptoms including severe mental retardation, cardiac  dysfunction, and early death.  Current therapies attempt to compensate for the deficiencies by IV infusion of specific  recombinant enzymes, Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT).  Patients, especially those only mildly affected, do receive  some benefit from ERT, however the benefit is limited primary because of minimal penetration of infused enzymes in  tissues with restricted blood flow such as joints (synovial capsule), heart valve (cartilage), and brain (blood brain barrier).   Further, many patients rapidly developblocking antibody responses to ERT, an effect that is most pronounced in those  patients that are most severely affected.  Our therapeutic approach (Substrate Optimization Therapy, SOT) is novel  because it uses the first ever small molecule GAG biosynthesis inhibitors to subtlety shape the fine structural  composition of GAGs in patients, enabling the GAGs to be degraded despite the pathogenic enzyme deficiency.  The  small molecule approach is superior because it can penetrate the relevant tissues including the central nervous system,  heart valve, bone, and joints plus it avoids issues of antibody inhibition in those patients most in need of treatment.   Also, due to the underlying biology and disease pathogenesis, this approach will treat MPS I, II, andIII with a single  therapeutic agent.  Through the studies proposed in this application, we will complete the preclinical and IND enabling  studies required to initiate a Phase I clinical trial.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Relevance  The goal of this proposal is to develop a new therapy for treating mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS).

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nano-liquid chromatography is a desirable technique because when coupled with mass spectrometry it can identify many of the components of a very complex proteomic or glycomic sample including subtle chemical variationswithin the sample, and can also obtain quantitative information. The technique is renowned for its high chromatographic resolution, high sensitivity, and small sample size requirement. But the technique remains cumbersome as it suffers from several limitations including system reproducibility issues created by user inabilities in column and/or spray emitter set-up, difficulty making nanofluidic connections, and difficulty troubleshooting system malfunctions. Others have tried to simplify this underutilizedtechnique through primarily chip-based approaches, but have unfortunately compromised the technique&#039;s resolution and sensitivity. However, in a Phase I project, CorSolutions developed a robust, reliable, user-friendly nanoLC/ESI device that addresses theselimitations of conventional nanoLC/ESI systems while still maintaining state-of- the-art performance, and is able to operate at elevated UHPLC pressures. These Phase I prototypes are the first plug-and-play nanoLC/ESI devices which do not compromise the high chromatographic resolution and sensitivity for which nanoLC is renowned. But although the technology developed in Phase I offers great improvements over conventional approaches, further developments are required for the technology to reach its large commercialization potential.  The goals of the Phase II are to build upon the compression connection, plug-and-play technology developed in Phase I, in order to ready the technology for commercialization. This includes development of a cartridge-based insertfor the column, allowing a column of any length to be wound in a small footprint. This enhancement will allow the overall device dimension to be substantially reduced. Additionally an emitter changer will be added, permitting the device to quickly exchange an emitter, in less than 1 sec, without need for user intervention. A spray sensor and leak sensors will be incorporated into the device with  smart  software to continuously monitor the sensor read back. The software will be capable of diagnosing systemmalfunctions and attempting automated repair such as an emitter change, greatly simplifying the troubleshooting process. Furthermore the ability to deliver nebulization gas will be incorporated into the device. These enhancements will allow for product commercialization.  We see this simple, intuitive product becoming an integral part of biological laboratories, allowing standardization of proteomic and glycomic analyses. And most importantly the product will allow biologists to benefit from the highly informative nanoLC/MS data, enabling scientific breakthroughs and greater understanding of complex biological systems. This significant reduction in complexity of nanoLC will also allow for the technique to infiltrate deeper into the life sciences.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Nano-liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (nanoLC/MS) is a powerful technique for proteomic and glycomic studies which is able to not only identify proteins and glycans from very complex mixtures, but is also able to structurally characterize differences between the components, which is particularly important for post-translational modifications. However, conventional nanoLC/MS is a very difficult technique to perform, requiring a highly skilled user. Therefore this powerful technique, which could enable scientific discoveries and greater understanding of complex biological systems, is alarmingly underutilized. CorSolutions proposes to develop an intuitive, robust, reliable, user-friendly,  plug-and-play  device, which will address the challenges of conventional nanoLC/MS, dramatically reducing the complexity of the technique and thereby allowing its pervasive use in biological laboratories.",

The Virtual Cell is a multiuser, fully immersive 3D virtual environment for learning cell biology. While exploring the simulation, students are able to identify organelles, perform experiments, diagnose faulty cell mechanisms, and collaborate with other users on their work. This virtual world is coupled with the Virtual Cell Animation Project, an award-winning series of animationsof biological processes that occur in plant and animal cells. These efforts have been shown to improve student understanding of cell biology in a number of controlled studies (McClean et al., 2001; Slator et al., 2005; McClean et al., 2005). WoWiWe Instruction Co is in partnership with the One-To-One Institute through the Kauffman Foundation in a project to distribute the Virtual Cell to secondary school students in Michigan. Approximately 3,000 students will be included in a pilot study starting in Fall 2009. Following a successful pilot project, full deployment to 150,000 students will occur in 2010. One of the goals of the NIH is to  develop, maintain, and renew scientific human and physical resources that will assure the Nation&#039;s capability to prevent disease . The development of human resources as health professionals remains a high priority for the NIH and the nation as a whole. To further this mission, WoWiWe Instruction Co proposes to engage in a commercial endeavor to expand the content of the Virtual Cell virtual world and sell it to interested parties, primarily secondary school students, ranging from casual adopters to schools and others who will use it in a more structured fashion. Five objectives have been identified to maximize the technical and commercial effectiveness of the Virtual Cell: Objective 1: Convert six animations to fully immersive, interactive learning modules Objective 2: Build server infrastructure to handle anticipated users of the Virtual Cell learning environment and measure the throughput of the infrastructure prototype to determine efficacy for Phase III efforts. Objective 3: Implement appropriate educational levels for the new modules using reproducible methods. Objective 4: Beta test deployment methods by adding implementedmodules through a hosted website and measuring student feedback with anonymous survey instruments Objective 5: Implement innovative automated agent based software testing. This Phase II project will position WoWiWe Instruction Co to open revenue streams through both collection of Virtual Cell modules and other IVE technologies in other content areas. This in turn will support marketing to different demographics (across the K-grey continuum). These revenue streams will allow us to continue to research moreeffective methodologies for educating the future health scientists and professionals of tomorrow.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The relevance of this project to public health is three-fold. First, the research is aimed at developing and distributing newmodels for science education, thus providing new methods of learning in the classroom and leading to a more scientifically literate public. Second, through test results, this project lays the groundwork for other topics to be developed for science education in the same media. Third, the project promotes learning of the sciences in a virtual modality, like the online games that currently absorb our youth: for example, World of Warcraft and Second Life, among many others.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to further develop a breakthrough detector technology for Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The detector, the Direct Detection Device (DDD) is vastly superior to Charge Coupled Device (CCD) detectors currently in use. In particular, the DDD delivers improved resolution, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and speed. As an enabling technology, many fields in which the TEM is a critical tool stand to benefit, but the DDD advantages will be of particular value in the field of biological cryo-EM where current detector performance severely limits the information that can be gleaned from specimens because of their extreme sensitivity to dose. Improved detector performance will translate directly to better 3-dimensional structures of macromolecules, viruses, and organelles. New problems that were previously intractable, will become solvable, and the goal of achieving near atomic resolution 3-D TEM structures will be attainable in many more cases. Ultimately, the utility of cryo-EM as a tool for elucidating structure-function relationships will take a leap forward, accelerating progress in understanding disease and designing cures. This project will advance the highly promising results from the earlier phase to ultimately deliver a commercially practical camera system that offers all of the benefits of the DDD and digital image capture plus the resolution and field of view of photographic film. The project has a sensor development component including extending lifetime to well beyond 1 year, further improving sensitivity as measured by the Detective Quantum Efficiency (DQE) figure of merit, and increasing the format (number of pixels) to equal that of photographic film. The project also has equally important system engineering and software components. Deliverables include a compact and modular design that is integrated with instruments commonly used in the field, as well as integration with the most important and widely used automation and data collection software packages.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Upon successful completion, this project will deliver an enabling technology for users of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) that will provide significantly higher quality imaging of biologically significant materials. The project will provide important benefits to academic, government, institutional, and private sector biotechnology researchers as they strive to use 3-Dimensional structures of organelles, viruses and macro- molecules to elucidate structure-functionrelationships and mechanisms of action to understand and cure disease.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to introduce drugs, genes, nucleic acids, and/or imaging agents into living cells is critical to drug design and delivery, as well as many cell biology and genetic modification protocols; however, currentlyavailable physical and reagent-based techniques are inadequate for applications requiring transfection of difficult-to-transfect cells (e.g., primary and stem cells). For this reason, transfection of nucleic acids into cells has become a significant challenge in the development of RNAi therapies and stem cell clinical applications. The technology that is the subject of this project proposal has demonstrated the potential to significantly impact these areas by enabling investigations of difficult-to-transfect cells, which are not currently feasible. The proposed work addresses this challenge through development of a microfabricated technology that enables treatment of arbitrarily sized cell populations on a cell-by-cell basis. STEAM (Single-sample Treatment via Electrosonic Actuation Microarray) ejects biological cells through microscopic nozzles with incorporated electroporation electrodes, thereby opening pores by concurrent mechanical and electrical disruption of the cell membrane. The parallel microarray format is scalable to accommodate discrete sample volumes from ~100 nl to tens of ml; however, in continuous-flow mode, the same device can rapidly process cells at 1 to 100 million cells per second. The critical advantage of STEAM is the uniformity of treatment experienced by each cell in a population, which is the key to achieving high transfection efficiency. During the SBIR Phase I project a prototype STEAM device demonstrated successful treatment of laboratory established cell lines. Device operating parameters were optimized using a small fluorescent molecule to evaluate uptake and cell viability. In addition, STEAM achieved trasfection efficiencies of 80% (mechanical poration) and gt90% (mechanical + electroporation) for GFP-encoding plasmid into HEK293 cells with cell viability gt70%, which is on par with lipofection and the best commercially available electroporation systems. The primary objectives of this SBIR Phase II project are further device refinement and optimization towards development of a production prototype and direct comparison with available physical and reagent-based techniques for transfection of difficult cells. To achieve these objectives, (1) a stand-alone STEAM system with disposable cartridge-based sample handling and on-board electronic control of both mechanical and electroporation parameters will be developed, and (2) a direct comparison of STEAM, commercial electroporation systems, lipofectamine-mediated transfection, and lentiviral gene transfer in difficult cells (including primary cancer stem cells from glioblastoma multiforme) will be performed.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Development of the STEAM (Single-sample Treatment via Electrosonic Actuation Microarray) platform will address the current need for alternative gene transfer solutions for use with difficult-to-transfect cells (e.g., primary and stem cells). The lack of successful commercial gene transfer solutions limits research in the life sciences and biomedical fields. STEAM addresses the need for effective, high-throughput, and scalable techniques to achieve transfection of difficult cells.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The use of research animals in research has been essential to development of vaccines and study of most human diseases. Modern rodent research is increasingly powerful with the ability to manipulate the genomes of miceand rats such that they closely mimic complex human diseases such as Alzheimer&#039;s and artherosclerosis. Generating transgenic mice and rats, requires that embryos that are manipulated by researchers be transferred into recipient female mice where they can complete their development. Up to this point, these transfers have required surgical procedures in which the embryo is implanted into the uterus. Recently, a device has been developed that enables these embryo transfers to be performed without surgery whicheliminates the post-operative recovery period thereby reducing pain of the animals. This proposal investigates and expands upon the utility of this embryo transfer device by establishing the optimal ages and mouse strains for embryo transfer (Aim 1), determining whether embryonic stem cells can be effectively and efficiently transferred with this device (Aim 2), determining whether the device is useful for artificial inseminations (Aim 3), directly visualizing the device in the uterus which may enable design improvements (Aim 4) and quantifying measures of stress relative to surgical procedures to support widespread adoption of this procedure in the research community (Aim 5). The primary project objective is to produce data that will prove the efficacy ofthis embryo transfer device and thereby enable researchers to replace surgical procedures with a non-surgical method that is equally effective. Proving that this non-surgical transfer method is effective under a range of conditions will expand its use overthis range of applications and thereby maximize its impact in enabling researchers to refine and reduce the number of surgical procedures performed in mice.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal use in research is essential for biomedical research and with the developing abilities to genetically engineer mice for research; these animals are becoming even more important as they can be modified to mimic most human diseases. Genetic engineering of mice requires, as one of many other things, the ability to transfer embryos into mice where they complete their development. This project supports further development of a device that enables these embryo transfers to be performed without surgery and therefore greatly reduces the pain category that these research animals experience and thereby supports progress in biomedicine.",

These innovative science kits do not require teacher preparation, and they do not require laboratory equipment. Science Take-Out kits provide teachers with a convenient and cost-effective way for using hands-on activities to engage students in understanding science content, applications, and careers. The goals of this SBIR Phase II project are: to provide evidence that Science Take-Out kits have a positive impact on high school students&#039; understanding of biology concepts and processes; to increase teachers&#039; awareness of Science Take-Out kits through workshopsled by  educator-presenters , and; to investigate methods for scaling up Science Take-Out&#039;s kit development and manufacturing capacity.

Create a method for integrating the kit development process with the assessment development process.  Develop and evaluate workshop materials that will be used by 30  educator-presenters  to lead Science Take-Out workshops at science conferences throughout the United States in order to increase teacher awareness of and adoption of Science Take-Out kits.  Develop and evaluate operating systems to scaleup the manufacturing process while maintaining kit quality and cost effectiveness. This proposed project is significant because Science Take-Out kits increase teachers&#039; use of hands-on activities to engage diverse student populations in understanding science content, applications, and careers. This project will also provide teachers with quality professional development programs led by peers in order to make them aware of Science Take-Out kits and comfortable with introducing this new content into their existing curriculum. This proposed project is innovative because Science Take-Out kits allow teachers to easily integrate hands- on science experiences and biomedical science concepts into various topic areas of their existing curriculum. In addition, the innovative characteristics of Science Take-Out kits will increase the likelihood of adoption of these new curricular materials by busy teachers, which will further expand the impact of this project on student learning.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The relevance of this project to public health is that the Science Take-Out laboratory activity kits will provide teachers with access to hands-on biology laboratory experiences to help their students&#039; master scientific subject matter and develop their scientificreasoning skills as well as increase their interest in science and scientific careers. This project will create and field test educational materials to promote student understanding of biological concepts.

The most basic enzymological tool for characterizing proteins is the protease. Proteases are alreadyan essential part of proteomic analysis but more sophisticated tools are needed to identify low abundance proteins in highly complex samples. We have engineered prototype  restriction  proteases which are active in denaturing conditions and which cut specifically at well-defined cognate sequence motifs. Our basic innovation would be the ability to parse a proteome into sequence-edited slices and to detect these edited portions with high resolution and high sensitivity. In Phase I we tested the prototype restriction protease for suitability in proteomic analysis and implemented a novel directed evolution methodology for the selection of proteases that cut new sequence motifs. The Phase II objective is to develop a sophisticated set of protease tools to facilitate proteomic analysis in the way restriction endonucleases have facilitated genomic analysis.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The complex and dynamic nature of proteomes make them rich with useful information but difficult to characterize. Our long-rangeobjective is to develop a sophisticated set of protease tools to facilitate proteomic analysis in the way restriction endonucleases have facilitated genomic analysis.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) is utilized by thousands of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) researchers in fields such as macromolecule structure determination, membrane proteins, catalysis, and organo-metallo-complexes. For over three decades, High-Resolution (HR) NMR has been a leading analytical technique for structure and function elucidation of molecules of all types, large and small, in homogeneous systems. More recently, HR-MAS has been used to extend the technique toinhomogeneous systems, such as human and animal tissues. The 1H HR-MAS spectrum of malignant breast cancer tissue shows dramatically increased levels of phosphocholine compared to nonmalignant breast tissue, and it appears likely that many other unambiguous markers can be identified for other pathologies if the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the HR-MAS probe can be increased sufficiently.  HR NMR probes for liquids have become available with cryogenically cooled sample coils that are revolutionizing the field of NMR owing to their factor-of-four improvement in SNR. Even greater improvements in SNR can be achieved with CryoMAS probes of several common types, including 1H/13C/15N and 1H/X. Our work thus far demonstrated about a factor-of-five improvement in SNR in MAS experiments in probes of both of the above types by cryogenically cooling the coils and circuit elements to 25 K while the sample was maintained at room temperature. A substantial additional increase in SNR is expected from a combination of further advances during the Phase II. These advances will include (1) novel coil technology enabling more than a 50% increase in resonator quality factor Q at 25 K in high magnetic fields, (2) refinements in a hermetically sealed spinner design enabling a 25% improvement in magnetic filling factor of the cryocoils, (3) a factor of two increase in the Q of HV ceramic capacitors in the 400-1000 MHz range, and (4) ability to achieve over 75 kHz 1H decoupling field strength in a triple-resonance CryoMAS probe to atleast 11.7 T. Substantial improvements in spinning at sample temperatures down to 30 K will also be developed, and provisions for millimeter-wave irradiation will be added to enable Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) to be easily added. Reducing the sampletemperature from 90 K to 40 K in MAS DNP is expected to often in- crease S/N in DNP experiments by an order of magnitude. Additional improvements in S/N will come from further progress in reduction of noise figure (NF) of cryogenically cooled preamps based on the Enhancement mode Pseudomorphic High Electron Mobility Transistors (E-PHEMT).

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Me, A Doc  is a serious medical diagnosis role-playing simulator program in a video game interface that aims to improve high school and college student learning about the biology of disease in a way that fosters critical thinking and reduces the achievement gap often seen with minority or disadvantaged students - goals of the NIH. Players assume the role of a doctor who takes histories, makes diagnoses, and, ultimately, recommends treatments. In each case, players ask questions to learn symptoms, do exams to obtain signs, and order laboratory tests. Using evidence-based inquiry in a virtual library, the player reaches a diagnosis, answers a series of Socratic feedback learning questions that clarify and stimulate thinking, and then, during an epilogue, learns the outcome for each case. The approach, which partners library inquiry, evidence-based reasoning, literacy scaffolding, and feedback learning, is designed to educate high school students, undergraduate students, andothers contemplating a health professions career about the diagnosis of disease and medically related biology. A prototype of Me, A Doc  was developed during Phase I and evaluation showed that students warmly welcomed the program, used evidence-based reasoning to sort through complex information and arrive at a diagnosis, and learned about medical science during the process. Aims for Phase II are: (1) improve the program infrastructure, expand program capabilities, and manage new extensions; (2) develop a prioritized list of chief complaints associated with common diseases, and create supporting library files and definitions; (3) develop new cases from these disease-related files; (4) monitor development of the resulting cases with focus groups and conduct acontrolled evaluation; and (5) evaluate commercialization strategies, identify and develop partnership arrangements for marketing and distribution to schools and colleges, and design a marketing and dissemination campaign for licensing individual use. Evaluation with 600 students (high school and college) in class and working individually outside of class will involve two pre-tests to assess the effect of test-taking on knowledge gain and a post test to assess the effect of the program on knowledge gain, attitude, interest, and motivation. Prior results with a similar approach suggest that Me, A Doc  will result in knowledge gain, promote critical thinking, and reduce the achievement gap seen too often in the performance of students differing in race/ethnicity, educational background, and socioeconomics - all while generating strong student appreciation and support.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Consistent with the goals of the Funding Opportunity Announcement, Me, A Doc  is a new, discovery-oriented educational software program that will provide technology and tools for high school and undergraduate students to learn about human disease and related biology in an engaging and motivating way. Designed for use in classrooms or by individuals with computers ortablets, this interactive learning tool can be disseminated widely and will lead to enhanced health science literacy of students and the public.",

The series will be marketed to healthcare websites and general interest African American-targeted websites. Using innovative new media approaches to reach a large African American demographic, the goal of this project is to improve health information seeking, along with increasing overall health awareness and knowledge in this targeted population. By combining media that is simultaneously entertaining, educational and culturally tailored to African Americans, we offer an innovative health education tool to reach a high health disparities population. The Webisodeproject is the next logical step based on our successful serial soap opera radio product, Keeping Up with the Walkers (KUWW), which educates people about health and disease that disproportionately affects African Americans. KUWW was recently licensed to SupeRadio for distribution in 50 black radio stations nationwide demonstrating BTC&#039;s track record bringing health communication products to market. In this Fast-Track application, Phase I will take 6 months to develop a ten-minute animated prototype based on a single health topic, obesity, and assess feasibility and appeal of this approach with an African American audience using focus group qualitative research. In Phase II, we will produce a 120-minute animated series covering six health topics that have high levels of disproportionate impact on the Black community. This newly animated Walkers series, which will be webcast on the Internet, will reach a more diverse audience including the younger at risk African American demographic, who have quickly adoptedInternet-based communication. Using a web panel of African Americans we will conduct an outcome study of the efficacy of the Webisodes on participants&#039; health seeking behavior, health knowledge, and perceived risk. The impact of the KUWW Webisodes on realworld Internet users&#039; health information seeking behavior will be tested to determine if our product can be used to drive viewers to seek more health information on the web. Our long-term goal for commercialization is to position the KUWW Webisode series at African American oriented websites to encourage viewers to seek more extensive health information and to adopt the positive health behaviors modeled by the KUWW characters. Currently, BTC hosts the website Journey To Wellness (www.journeytowellness.com);the additional reach of our partner organizations which have high impact websites, will serve to expand our potential audience and create future commercial partners for BTC&#039;s appealing and culturally tailored health communications products.

The primary use of this microscope is to study the structure and mechanics of cells, cellular processes and tissues. This interference microscope will enable looking at cellular morphology, cellular development and structures within cells and tissues over periods of time. It is intended to have a flexible design that enables options of different magnifications, resolutions, and wavelengths. The Phase II project focuses on developing a production prototype for a commercial dynamic phase imaging interference microscope system using interchangeable interference objectives and low coherence sources with fiber delivery. Polarization states will be used to differentiate object and reference beams. Technology originally developed for dynamically measuring the seeing quality of large telescopes in situ will be utilized for imaging on the microscopic level. This technology utilizes a pixilated single-shot phase-measurement camera to enable instantaneous quantitative determination of optical phase and refractive index variations in real time to create movies of dynamic motions. Goals for Phase II include 1) designing, building and testing a production prototype microscope system with multiple magnifications, 2) development of software and algorithms to display optical thickness data in real time relative to a background surface and capture bursts of data to quantify cellular motion, morphology and volume, 3) demonstrating quantitative measurements on dynamic living cells at multiple beta sites with research partners, and to obtain written user feedback for implementation in Phase III.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a Fast-Track application to develop a web-based, patient-centered software product that accurately assesses a patient&#039;s perioperative risk as a means of improving quality of care and reducing costs.         Approximately 40 million surgical procedures are performed annually in the United States [1]. To ensure the safety of patients undergoing these procedures, it is imperative to identify and mitigate perioperative risk. Unfortunately, the process used by most hospitals and surgical centers to evaluate pre-surgical patients falls short on two fronts. One is a failure to identify risk factors in a timely fashion, as most preoperative evaluations occur the day before or day of surgery. The second is a failure to properly identify risk factors due to incomplete or inaccurate preoperative evaluations. These shortcomings increase morbidity and mortality, increase healthcare cost, and lower patient satisfaction. Therefore, a standardized preoperative assessment delivered in a timely fashion is needed.         To address this need, we (MedSleuth, Inc.) have developed web-based software that utilizes a patent- pending algorithm to generate a customized patient survey, based on the patient&#039;s medication profile and successive responses to the survey. The survey output takes the form of a comprehensive medical history, triages patients based on health status, and provides the patient-specific information required by healthcare providers to identify and mitigate perioperative risk. Conservatively, it is estimated  10 billion could be saved annually (~25% of total spend) through our approach, with similarly sizable improvements in quality and satisfaction.         Our Phase I study will evaluate proof of concept for the first-generation software with one collaborating hospital system (Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School) over the course of a six- month period. Phase I will seek to prove (1) patients can successfully complete the web-based survey; (2) the outputgenerated by the survey is accurate, comprehensive and relevant for making informed clinical decisions; (3) our assessment algorithm is equivalent or superior to the status quo in identifying perioperative risk; (4) patients and healthcare providers reporthigh levels of satisfaction; and (5) preoperative evaluation costs can be substantially reduced.         In Phase II we will incorporate patient and healthcare provider feedback from Phase I to develop the more robust second-generation version of the web-based software. We will in turn test this second- generation software on a much larger patient population across multiple surgical sites to verify clinical accuracy and completeness, cost savings, and increased satisfaction. At the conclusion of Phase II,we expect to have a market ready product with documented outcomes.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A need exists for a system that can efficiently and effectively triage patients based on perioperative risk, thereby focusing resources on those patients with complex medical problems while improving quality and satisfaction for all. We (MedSleuth, Inc.) have developed a first-generation web-based patient- centric software product that standardizes and streamlines the way a patient&#039;s medical history is elicited and recorded. This is accomplished by applying patent-pending machine learning technology to tailor a real-time survey based on each patient&#039;s medication profile and successive responses during the survey. We hypothesize that (1) patients can successfully complete the web-based survey on their own; (2) clinicians find the output of the survey relevant, accurate, and superior to current methods for making informed clinical decisions related to the surgical procedure; (3) patients and healthcare providers report high levels of satisfaction with the survey; (4) quality of care is improved; and (5) costs are reduced.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to develop a quantitative in-vivo small animal imaging system for fluorescent reporter probes that fuses fluorescence light emitting computed tomography (FLECT) with X- ray computed tomography (CT). The proposed dual-modality imaging system will not only provide a research tool for better understanding of biological function and processes on a cellular or molecular level in-vivo, but will also aid the development of new drug therapies and accelerate their translation into the clinic. Conventional imaging methods only provide two-dimensional (2D) fluorescence surface images and, hence, do not reveal the actual spatial location and concentration of the targeted reporter system. Furthermore, current fluorescence tomography (FT) systems are still in a developing stage and suffer from several limitations. First, these FT systems assume optically uniform tissue models that, consequently, prohibit the accurate quantification of the reporterprobe&#039;s location and concentration. Second, neither planar fluorescence imaging nor FT provides any anatomical information. Hence, the reconstructed reporter probe location cannot be localized relative to the animal&#039;s anatomy. The proposed FLECT/CT systemwill overcome these limitations in two ways. First, we will leverage the anatomical information gained from CT with its high spatial resolution and assign optical properties to various segmented organs. These non-uniform optical property maps will in turnimprove quantitative fluorescence image reconstruction leading to accurate images about the reporter probe&#039;s actual spatial location and concentration. Second, structural images from CT will provide the anatomical information that is necessary for co-locating the fluorescent reporter probe to the animal&#039;s anatomy. In Phase 1, we will perform numerical simulations and tissue phantom experiments that will provide a proof of principle for the proposed FLECT/CT system. We will demonstrate that (1) applying non-uniform optical property maps to FLECT reconstructions makes quantitative tomographic imaging of reporter probes feasible and (2) spatial maps of organs with largely varying optical properties can be segmented from CT images. In Phase 2, a commercial grade FLECT/CT system will be developed where the optical and X-ray components share the same rotating gantry. We will develop fully automated image segmentation methods and different techniques for assigning optical parameters to segmented organs. The opticalparameters will be determined by (1) optical tomography in a reduced parameter space, (2) from known (oxy-)hemoglobin concentrations in different tissue types, or from (3) optical parameter databases of prior experiments. Last, the performance of the FLECT/CT system will be evaluated in small animal imaging experiments. Once completed, our FLECT/CT system will provide a powerful tool for research of cancer, neurological pathologies, and cardiovascular disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed development of a combined fluorescence tomography and X-ray CT imaging system for small animals will reconstruct and display the three-dimensional in-vivo distribution of fluorescent reporter probes for studying molecular processes in a living biological system. The combination of fluorescence tomography with X-ray CT will significantly improve the image quality of fluorescence tomographic images and will co-register them to structural CT images showing the animal&#039;s anatomy. Therefore, the proposed imaging system would not only be of great significance for better understanding biological processes and pathological function in living small animals on a cellular and molecular level, but would also aid the development of new drug therapies and accelerate their translation into the clinic.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is considerable interest in new and innovative manufacturing methods for medical imaging technologies to enhance performance while reducing cost. The precision and low-force signature of lasers makes them very attractive alternatives to traditional machining methods for brittle materials, particularly scintillators such as lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO), gadolinium oxyorthosilciate (GSO), lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO), etc. used in high-resolution diagnostic imaging and nuclear medicine. However, material damage, especially micro-scale cracking, during laser machining is a frequently encountered problem that results in added costs, needless scrap, and reduced performance/reliability. These issues have prevented the tremendous commercial potential of laser machining from being fully utilized to manufacture large and finely pixelated scintillator arrays. The goal of the Phase I research was to demonstrate the feasibility of defect free laser machining of brittle scintillators using a novel multibeam approach. We are pleased to report that the Phase I research has not only clearly demonstrated the feasibility of our approach but has also led to a major discovery that has the potential to dramatically reduce the cost and duration of pixelation. Thus our Phase I effort has laid a firm foundation for achieving our ultimate goal of defect-free manufacturing of scintillator arrays using laser machining. With these exceptional results, the technique of laser pixelation and multibeam healing is now poised for exploitation in rapid and cost effective systems for micro-machining arrays of various sizes, shapes, and orientations in scintillators of critical importance to medical and non-medical applications. The proposedresearch is designed to address manufacturing issues through detailed simulation studies of the material&#039;s behavior during laser ablation, and by implementing a new laser beam delivery system based on experimental findings that confirm the simulation results. Developing such a system and a body of knowledge in scintillator micro-machining will allow fabricating large arrays of various scintillators at significantly reduced manufacturing cost, while greatly improving detector performance with reduced pixelsizes and inter-pixel gaps. Therefore, the proposed research has great commercial relevance, especially for modalities as PET where higher resolution and lower cost is critically important.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a fast-track proposal to develop a GMP biocompatible microstimulator for implantation into humans for treating chronic pain. The feasibility of using an implanted wireless microstimulator for the treatment of chronic pain will be tested in Phase I. In Phase II we will develop a more sophisticated GMP quality microstimulator for use in humans. The footprint and platform of the microstimulator will be the same in both Phase I and Phase II. The internal circuitry and device integration will be fully developed in Phase II. The conditions of neuropathic pain and chronic inflammatory pain create a large medical and societal burden that affects over 50 million people in the US. Current treatments include pharmacologicalagents and electrical stimulation techniques. Existing pharmaceutical treatments lack long-term efficacy or have dose limiting side effects. Neurostimulation techniques such as transcutaneous and percutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS and PENS) lack such side effects and have therefore become popular alternative therapies. While TENS is mildly efficacious, PENS treatments seem to be far more efficacious. However, PENS is highly inconvenient and invasive, often leaving the patient unable to receive treatment when needed most. To address these weaknesses of current electro-stimulation therapy, MicroTransponder has developed a tiny implantable wireless microstimulator device (1mm diameter and less than 250 um thick) that may have the efficacy of PENS without any of the inconveniences. This device is powered and controlled by near field radio frequency (RF). The device is capable of directly stimulating peripheral nerves and can be controlled by the patient to deliver therapeutic stimulation as needed. This device should be an inexpensive, safe, and convenient solution to patients with chronic pain of different origins. In Phase I, we will test efficacy of the device for complete suppression of mechanical hyperalgesia in animal models of inflammatory pain (Freund&#039;s adjuvant, CFA) and neuropathic pain (Bennett model). In Phase II we will improve the circuitry, integration, and encapsulation of our device so that it is more appropriate for human use and then manufacture the device under GMP controls. We will thenvalidate the newly manufactured device in conjunction with FDA guidance. At the end of Phase II, we will be prepared to file an investigational device exemption (IDE) for human clinical testing of our device. In follow-on Phase III studies we will test for efficacy in humans. Once efficacy in humans is proven, we will develop the device for full commercialization.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  MicroTransponder aims to develop a novel, wireless, minimally-invasive microstimulator to treat neuropathic andinflammatory pain using subcutaneous electrical stimulation methods. The innovation holds promise for heightened efficacy while reducing the majority of safety risks and side-effects compared to existing pain management solutions.",

WHEN THE UPLOADED ABSTRACT IS NOT IN THE EXPECTED FORMAT, THE EXTRACTED TEXT MAY BE INCORRECT OR INCOMPLETE.**** PROJECT SUMMARY Traffic accidents are the leading cause of teenage injury and death. This Phase II proposal describes a project to translate and disseminate a computer based instructional system developed for driver education that has been shown to reduce theteenage accident rate. The computer based instructional system includes: 1) tradi- tional driver education material to form and shape the student&#039;s attitude about driving safety; 2) a desk top driving simulation to teach critical perceptual, psychomotor and cognitive driving skills; 3) a user interface that allows selection of lesson plans, presents quizzes on multimedia educational material and stores and displays simulator driving performance. The driving simulation component has already been shown to improve driving skills and reduce accidents in a project sponsored by the CDC with California novice drivers. The implementa- tion of this computer based driver education instructional system includes a software platform designed to simplify the presentationof multimedia course materials. The software platform can launch various multime- dia materials (e.g. Power Point, video) and also launch the driving simulation with specific contextually based scenarios that will address particular instructional issues (e.g. speed control, hazard perception, situation awareness, decision making and action). The platform will also present knowledge quizzes, and provide suffi- cient instruction for the student to achieve an acceptable score for graduation. The driving simulation scena- rios include a range of typical elements (roadway geometry, roadside elements, traffic control devices, traffic and pedestrians), and hazards that are controlled in time and space to require acceptable driver response times for successful completion. The objective of this Phase II SBIR project is to integrate the computer based in- structional system driving simulation in current high school and community college driver education pro- grams. This is a longitudinal study design that will comparethe accident experience of simulator trained driv- ers with a closely matched control group of teenagers not receiving simulator training. The computer simula- tion has been used by an instructor in the preceding Phase I study who has had success in its application with good acceptance by the students. Driving skills and attitudes will be assessed at the beginning and end of the computer based driver education instructional course.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Teen driver accident rates are significantly higher thanthose of mature drivers. This project proposes to integrate traditional driver education material with a desktop driving simulation intended to produce teen drivers with high-quality skills and attitudes consistent with safe driving behavior. This is a longitudinal study design that proposes to follow the accident rates of simulator trained drivers and a closely matched control group. If effective, this approach could reduce teen driver accidents, and produce a low cost computer based driver education system capable of training teen drivers with minimal supervision.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The combination of high toxicity and widespread occurrence has created a pressing need for effective monitoring of arsenic in groundwater. Through this program Agiltron will develop a field deployable monitoring tool based on surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) for rapid on-site detection and quantification of arsenic in groundwater. During operation in the field, the SERS sensor module can be inserted directly into samples of groundwater brought up to the surfaceor lowered directly into the water well with the use of long fiber length for on-site arsenic detection and quantification. The proposed system will be able to detect arsenic in groundwater at 1 ppb concentration level, in situ, on-site, with little or nosample preparation, and with no interferences. During Phase I we have successfully demonstrated the detection of 1 ppb level arsenic in water samples using the proposed portable SERS system. In Phase II the performance of the proposed SERS system will beoptimized for highest throughput at the wavelength of interest by using suitable excitation wavelength and SERS substrates with optimized localized surface plasmon resonance properties. On-site measurement of arsenic in groundwater in local water wells will be conducted. The feedback from these field studies will be used to further develop/improve the performance of individual components so that an optimized monitoring system suitable for practical site operation can be developed and are ready for manufacture.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As one of the most common contaminants in groundwater worldwide, Arsenic is a well-known toxic chemical that the Environmental Protection Agency and the World Health Organization list as a known carcinogen. The World Health Organization and US guidelines recommend the arsenic values in drinking water to be no more than 10 mg/L (ppb). The proposed portable arsenic detection system can enable the detection of arsenic in groundwater at 1 ppb concentration level, in situ, on-site, with little or no sample preparation, and with no interferences.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The underground use of diesel equipment introduces high concentrations of toxic gases such as CO, NO and NO2 into a confined atmosphere. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has determined that diesel exhaust is a potential human carcinogen, based on a combination of chemical, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity data. This is due to the particulate matter in the diesel exhaust. In addition, acute exposures to diesel exhaust have been linked to health problems such as eye and nose irritation, headaches, nausea, and asthma. Many of these symptoms can be associated with the gaseous components of diesel exhaust. Currently, underground miners can be exposed to over 100 times the typical environmentalconcentration of diesel exhaust and over 10 times that measured in other workplaces. In addition, miner exposure to diesel emissions promises to become more widespread as diesel equipment becomes more prevalent within the mining industry. In a Phase I SBIRprogram Giner, Inc. demonstrated the feasibility of developing a lightweight, compact low cost instrument that can simultaneously monitor CO, NO, and NO2 in diesel exhaust underground. In addition, since diesel engines require O2 for the combustion process, the instrument will also monitor O2 levels. Unlike other multigas sensors that require separate sensor cells for each gas, the novel feature of this instrument is the use of a single sensor cell to detect all 4 gases, resulting in a considerable cost savings, compared to commercially available instruments. Additional instrument development is proposed for Phase II. The final instrument can either be a battery-powered, handheld, portable instrument, or can be designed to be mounted in a fixed location ona wall or suspended from the mine ceiling. The aims of the Phase II program are: 1: To conduct additional advanced sensor cell assembly development, 2: To conduct sensor cell testing, 3: To fabricate complete prototype instruments, 4: To conduct complete instrument parametric and life testing, 5: To compare the prototype instrument response to that of a commercial instrument, and 6: To conduct an economic analysis. To satisfy these aims, we propose to fabricate complete instruments that incorporate the advanced sensor cell that contains multiple sensing electrodes. In this Phase II program we will conduct additional multigas sensor cell development and incorporate the sensor cell into a complete instrument. The response of the advanced sensor will be compared to that of a commercially available, MSHA and UL-approved instrument. Finally, an economic analysis will be conducted to predict the manufacturing price of both the multigas sensor cell and the complete sensing instrument. All technical work will be conducted at Giner, Inc. with specialized fabrication being performed at select vendors.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Underground miners can be exposed to over 100 times the typical environmental concentration of gaseous diesel exhaust components and over 10 times that measured in other workplaces. The development of a compact, low-cost, lightweight instrument is proposed to monitor these levels; the instrument can be used underground, as well as above ground to measure toxic gas concentrations in the workplace.",

        "abstract": "This project optimizes haptic system design parameters and more thoroughly evaluates the impact of a vibratory haptic system for prosthetics. Objectives include: (1) building a hardware and software test bed for non-invasive voluntary control of a prosthetic hand with vibratory haptic feedback, (2) optimizing the tactor application, (3) assessing the effectiveness of tactor vibratory feedback on cognitive loading interpretations, and (4) assessing perceptions of subjects regarding the actual use of haptic feedback. Specifically, Objective One involves the construction of a controlled box. Fingertip sensors on the thumb and index finger of a myoelectric arm convey pressure data to a microprocessor. Using a mapping algorithm, the processor generates a corresponding waveform that is sent to feedback devices (tactors) placed on the skin of the upper arm. Objectives Two through Four test the vibratory feedback on seven below-elbow amputees. Objective Two determines the best tactor location, vibration waveform, and time duration until deterioration in skin sensitivity occurs by measuring how well the subjects can sense a change in vibration frequency (as identified in previous work as a spectrum of interest). This information assists in determining when a resting period from vibrotactile stimulation is required to avoid over-stimulation of the skin. Objective Three tests the ability of the vibrotactile feedback to provide information on grasping force with the myoelectric hand. The myoelectric hand is controlled by the contraction intensity of the wrist extensor and flexor muscles as detected by electromyography electrodes. Trials use the myoelectric hand to grasp a plush ball at forty percent, sixty percent, and eighty percent of the subject\u2019s maximum grasping force. Trials using vibrotactile feedback, visual feedback, and no feedback are compared. Objective Four requires the subjects to rate the system in terms of level of comfort, accuracy, user friendliness, level of discomfort, and overall usefulness in grasping activities.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Within the volume of a single cell, lines an extensive amount of information. The current scope of molecular imaging using mass spectrometry typically swamps the cell volume with organic acid matrix just to get observable signals. Herein lies the problem. Putting more matrix that there is analyte (i.e. cellular volume) inherently makes intracellular imaging via organic acids improbable. Therefore, Ionwerks has developed a comprehensive set of instrumentation, and nanoparticulate preparation techniques which combine two dimensional ion-mobility mass spectrometry and nanoparticulate tissue preparation which provide a means to analysis of tissues while preserving their histological attributes. Our research has demonstrated that sub-monolayers of nanoparticulates implanted into various depths within a tissue, provide agreeable signal levels. This means, the particulate to analyte ratio is much less that typical preparations: the chemical information is preserved and observable. The nanoparticulates will also be microfocused to allow for unique molecular secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Furthermore, we are developing small format oTOF MS detectors which can be combined with leading edge surface imaging techniques to create a one of a kind imaging platform from which surfaces / tissues can be morphologically imaged, and mass spectra of ejected ions can be recorded. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is implant histological prepared tissues with gold nanoparticulates, then to measure the ejected ions using a low profile oTOF-MS system from a microfocused nanoparticulate beam. This project will lay the groundwork for utilizing the helium ion-beam microprobe systems as a combined topographical imaging system, as well as molecular imaging systems.",

Even for totally implantable total artificial hearts, infection control is necessary because patients still need percutaneous lines for collecting post-implant hemodynamic data. During the Phase I contract with NIH/NHLBI, ND Life and University of Pittsburgh developed a highly effective anti-infection coating system based on nanotechnology that can be easily applied to the treatment of drivelines for ventricular assist devices (VADs). A novel green processing technique has been explored to immobilize silver nanoparticles on Dacron in Phase I. Irreversibly immobilized silver nanoparticles on Dacron showed significant reduction of bacterial challenges in Phase I. In the Phase II, ND Life and University of Pittsburgh will optimize the nanotechnology-based antimicrobial coating systems by a novel green processing technique through in vitro and in vivo studies. The system we propose here will provide a simple and highly effective anti-infection coating technology for VAD drivelines, with relevance to a broad range of other implantable medical devices. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The technology to be developed in Phase II will result in a simple and highly effective anti- infection coating technology for a broad range of implantable medical devices in addition to drivelines for VADs.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Field: The most effective treatment for metastatic melanoma is Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocyte (TIL) therapy, in which TILs are obtained from a patient's tumor fragments, grown to an immense quantity in vitro, and infused back into the patient (1-4). The Problem: Despite its ability to provide complete remission, the process of growing a therapeutic cell dose is so inefficient and complicated that TIL therapy cannot escape the Valley of Death. The Proposed Solution: Under prior Phase II SBIR GM058978, we created a paradigm shift in cell culture device technology that has been extensively studied for TIL production. The results demonstrate a greatly simplified process can be created that will allow TIL therapy to move beyond the Valley of Death and onto a commercial path. The key is to allow TILs to reside on a highly gas permeable, liquid impermeable membrane submerged under an unconventionally high level of medium. We call this approach G-Rex . With TILs in this position, they have access to oxygen and nutrients on demand without need of expensive and complicated ancillary equipment. Using this device configuration, we intend to reduce the TIL production process from up to 60 conventional devices and 30L of medium to just 2 G-Rex devices and as little as 4L to 5L of medium. Many other production advantages are inherent to this level of process simplification. As a result of this program, the potential for profit by applying TIL therapy will exist and commercial entities will be spurred to capitalize on the powerful outcomes of TIL therapy. The Investigation: Our investigation will provide the most efficient TIL production possible by optimizing G- Rex Protocols and devices: Aim 1: Determine the optimal TIL surface density that minimizes the duration of TIL Rapid Expansion Process Aim 2: Determine the optimal height of the G-Rex that will minimize the feeding frequency during the TIL Rapid Expansion Process (REP). Aim 3: Define the variance of gas permeable membrane thickness allowed in full scale G-Rex devices. Aim 4: Full scale validation of optimized G-Rex TIL culture S.O.P.s and G-Rex device specifications. The status of TIL therapy upon completion of this program: Separate from this optimization program, clinical application of G-Rex in the non-optimized state is already occurring. Upon completion of this investigation, the optimized G-Rex will transition into a multi-center comparability study followed by a randomized study, FDA approval, and commercially available TIL therapy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The most effective treatment for metastatic melanoma is Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocyte Therapy (TIL therapy), in which a patient's TILs are obtained from tumor fragments, grown to an immense quantity in vitro, and infused back into the patient.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this phase II application, we propose to test the efficacy of our platform technology derived product, ContraPest(R), a chemosterilant rat bait containing 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD), in reduction of the brown rat population in a model urban setting, the subway stations of New York City (NYC). Our phase II application is comprised of 3 aims. Aim 1 is focused on establishing the safety parameters of our technology, including exclusion of non-target species and impact on the environment. Aim 2 is focused on establishing the feasibility of performing pilot studies in NYC using wild caught brown rat populations both from Arizona and from NYC. Aim 3 is focused on performing a series of pilot studies in NYC to test the efficacy of ContraPest(R) bait in reducing the brown rat population in defined areas of the subway stations in NYC. In phase I we successfully demonstrated the efficacy of orally administered VCD in reducing primordial follicle number and litter size in R. norvegicus laboratory rats (the same species as the brown rat of NYC). We also determined that our current agricultural bait formulation (a pellet bait) is highly palatable to laboratory ras and consumption of our bait results in reduction in fertility in females. Current rat control practices in NYC are focused on rodenticide use. Poison packs are thrown off the back of subway trains onto the tracks. This is largely ineffective primarily due to the abundance of more palatable food choices (i.e. trash) and because poison application frequently results in population rebound effects. While there is no magic bullet to reducing rat pest populations, we believe that our technology can be used as an adjunct to current rodent pest management practices to have a sustainable significant impact on the reduction of the urban brown rat population. PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 06/09) Page Continuation Format Page PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Management of urban rats is critical to decrease the incidences of human-rat interactions and thus lower the spread of rodent borne infectious diseases and reduce infrastructure damage. Current control methods such as rodenticides introduce poisons into the environment and are largely ineffective. The goal of this project is two-fold: identify safety issues associated with a chemosterilant bait containing the ovotoxicant chemical, 4- vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD), and to establish baiting requirements necessary to induce subterranean urban rat population reduction in a model setting (the NYC subway).

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular interactions form the basis of healthy metabolism as well as the manifestation of disease, and comprise the very foundation of drug treatment. Tools available to study molecular interactions in their nascent environment and physiological concentrations without chemical modification, such as surface immobilization or labeling, are limited. Current label-free technologies cannot perform homogeneous (free solution) measurements of membrane protein target interactions. Membrane proteins, which make up about 1/3 of the human proteome, interact with a wide range of biologically relevant species. A specific class of membrane proteins known as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) is of particular interest, as they represent the principle drug target for about 40% of all prescription pharmaceuticals and over half of the top one hundred best selling drugs. Currently, there does not exist a practical label-free means to study GPCR - lead interactions as they proceed in their native environment. Consequently, label-free approaches significantly under-serve a major drug discovery need, and as such, there exists a profound requirement for a label-free technique to support research demands in the all important GPCR and membrane protein fields. Molecular Sensing Inc.'s (MSI) Phase II SBIR proposal entitled, High Throughput, Label-free Molecular Interaction Platform for Membrane Protein Targets, leverages the achievements of our Phase I program and is directed towards producing a robust Back-Scattering Interferometry (BSI) instrument for use in drug research. In addition to refining the platform, under Phase II we will demonstrate the unique strengths and capabilities of BSI to significantly advance progress in the all important area of membrane protein drug research by capitalizing on collaborations with three world-class research environments: The Groves Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, the Finn Laboratory of Scripps Research Institute, and the Bornhop Laboratory at Vanderbilt University. The culmination of our Phase II program will result in the creation of a prototype research product, which the company will sell to its early access customers in translational and pharmaceutical research markets. Phase III activities will complete the product development process, making this powerful new tool accessible to laboratories worldwide. As our initial market experience of Phase I technology has taught, our commercial product will create a sustained impact to basic, translational, and drug discovery research that will positively influence healthcare through the accelerated release and development of new and powerful therapeutics and diagnostics, consistent with the mission of the National Institutes of Health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: High Throughput, Label-Fee Molecular Interaction Platform for Membrane Protein Targets Drugs directed against cell membrane targets comprise one of the most important classes of therapeutics and focused pharmaceutical research. Tools available to support this research lack enabling capabilities, and are a barrier to progress. Our program will result in the creation of a novel research platform that will exert a substantial and powerful impact to advance progress in membrane target drug research, yielding new and improved therapeutics that will positively impact the treatment of disease, improving healthcare while reducing its cost.",

The Air Barrier System, shown during SBIR Phase I study to reduce the presence of colony forming units at an incision site by approximately 84%, shields surgical wounds with a localized high-purity air field. Multiple studies have shown that the primary source of surgical site bacterial colonization is Staphylococci shed from the skin of people present in the surgical theatre. The ability to prevent airborne precipitation of bacteria into the surgical site is an important factor in reducing postoperative infection, particularly in procedures incorporating prostheses. To execute this project, Nimbic Systems has formed a consortium with researchers and surgeons at Baylor College of Medicine / DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Houston, TX. The VAMC is an ideal institution in which to conduct this research since it performs a broad range of surgical services, the incidence of surgical site infection in the targeted procedures exceeds 6%, and patient follow-up compliance is high. The primary objective of the Phase II research is to evaluate the ABS performance in a prospective randomized, double-blind pilot trial expanded to 300 surgical cases. Prosthesis implantation procedures, presenting high infection risk, in orthopedics (total hip arthroplasty), neurosurgery (lumbar laminectomy with instrumented fusion), and vascular surgery (femoral-popliteal bypass grafting) have been selected for study. The project's aims are to: (1) determine ABS effectiveness at reducing CFU contamination in a range of surgical specialties conducted by multiple surgical staff, (2) compare ABS performance against laminar airflow surgical environments, and (3) detect clinically relevant trends in SSI incidence between the control and experiment groups. Affirmative Phase II results will provide crucial data needed to begin commercialization of the Air Barrier System and to construct a pivotal prospective, randomized, multi-center clinical trial. The broader impact of this research is the potential reduction of surgical site infections after many types of procedures. Patients contracting an infection during high-risk procedures face considerable hardships, and evidence shows that elderly, less affluent, and non-urban populations are more likely to succumb to an SSI. The cost of treating surgical site infections developing after high-risk surgeries is greater than 2.6 billion annually and is projected to grow rapidly through the year 2030. The technology under development can potentially reduce cost to the healthcare system and prevent human suffering caused by such infections.

        "abstract": "Well over 50 % of US land area constitutes low wind-speed sites, yet wind turbines are either not effective or only marginally effective in such low winds. To extract significantly more energy from such DOE Class 1 or Class 2 winds requires substantially increasing turbine blade rotor diameter (wind power is proportional to the square of the blade diameter). However, due to limitations on turbine blade tip speed, this cannot be done without significantly decreasing blade rotor rpm (blade tip speed is directly proportional to rotor rpm), which in turn, due to limitations on generator output at low rpm, would normally require considerably more massive and costly wind turbines. What is being proposed is a novel low rpm, low mass, and low cost 12 kW permanent magnet wind turbine generator that will be built, bench tested, and then field tested within a commercially available 10 kW horizontal axis wind turbine. Numerical simulations show that, with the greatly extended area rotor facilitated by the low rpm generator, we get: 1. Effective turbine operation in Class 1 and Class 2 low wind speed sites where other wind turbines are impractical, 2. Substantially shorter payback periods (due to lower price and greater power in low winds), 3. Quieter turbines as result of the lower rpm (turbine noise is proportional to the fifth power of the blade tip speed).",

        "abstract": "Mandates for biofuels have resulted in the significant increase of biodiesel production in rural communities. Hawaii&#039;s Jatropha biodiesel production will produce nearly 650-700 kg of residues, consisting of Jatropha seedcake and fruit hulls for every metric ton of seeds harvested for oil production. In addition, the biodiesel conversion process will produce another 30-50 kg of crude glycerin, as a co-product for every metric ton of oilseed processed. In Hawaii, nearly 270 million gallons of petroleum diesel is consumed annually. As the local production of just one million gallons of Jatropha biodiesel will result in more than 20 metric tons of processed residuals each day. This substantial production of biofuels leaves a tremendous amount of low-value residues needing to be properly disposed of, on an island setting that is environmentally fragile. Thus, the onsite anaerobic digestion (AD) of these organic residues, into a methane gas, will not only generate energy - through the use of a combined heat and power (CHP) micro turbine - but will also resolve the issues of wastes disposal. The system will supply enough power and heat to efficiently operate a biodiesel production facility, as well as an adjacent solar dehydration plant, with all of its surplus power, sold to the utility grid. This integrated biogas-solar dehydration system is a natural progression, as Hawaii lays abundant in solar radiation, throughout the year. The project will build a scalable pilot system producing up to 50kW of electricity. Thermal recovery is integrated through the CHP for drying food and co-products. Design benefits will facilitate rural replication, to where the AD system will utilize a broad range of locally-available low-value residues and waste materials that relies on a simple technology, which can be developed and supported locally, while being designed to minimize operational costs. The plan is to set-up and utilizes an integrated biogas facility that will fully utilize and appropriately capitalize on all the synergies provided by a biogas plant. The system biologically converts organic waste and residues into energy-rich biogas that also provides nutrient-rich digested solids that is utilized as an organic fertilizer. Thus, local food production, processing and preservation are realized benefits from this biogas facility&#039;s electrical and thermal generation. Hence, food and energy security can now be achieved for our geographically isolated rural communities. Therefore, commercialization plans will focus on the main Hawaiian Islands, first. And thereafter, pursue the market potential that exists throughout the American Pacific Protectorates of Micronesia and American Samoa. Wherever imports of nutrients, food and energy have outpaced rural production, there is a similar biogas development opportunity that exists. While incentives are substantial for renewable energy projects and realizing the financial benefits of tax credits, environmental credits and loan programs can be complex. Hawaii&#039;s generous feed-in-tariff will ultimately provide the needed financial support for smaller projects that cannot benefit from the economies of scale principal.",

The research timeline will design, build and validate a web-based Early Math and Science Preparation and Intervention Program that that trains and develops the underlying facilities required for future math learning. Working in tandem with national leaders in cognitive neuroscience and rural math and science education, Learnimation will translate existing research-based techniques into a highly motivating software platform that will be easily distributable to libraries, schools, and individual home settings in any rural community across the country. Nearly a decade of research has established procedures for training specific areas of early function that serve as the basis for learning mathematics, however, this material is only available through expensive programs at a handful of research institutions or under the tutelage of a limited number of certified specialists. For high need rural communities in particular, where the declining tax base limits resources and the geographic isolation limits exposure to research centers, waiting for the typically slow and laborious distribution of new techniques is a risky proposition.

        "abstract": "The problem: Nutrient concentration has a direct effect on the yield and quality of plants. However, despite their importance, they are frequently over applied and, if their concentration is thought to be incorrect, they are discarded into the environment and replaced with a new solution. This leads to nutrient waste and widespread environmental contamination of aquatic, ground and drinking water that causes blooms of harmful algae that, in turn, produce highly potent toxins. The opportunity: Instrumentation capable of determining the concentration of nutrients in water is either costly, unreliable, inconvenient to use or does not have the capability to determine the concentration of specific nutrients. Project Objectives: It is the objective of this project to develop a rugged, compact, inexpensive and yet easy to use optical fiber sensor that uses lab-on-a-fiber concept and microfluidic volumes of water samples. This is a unique multi point/multi parameter optical fiber sensor that can pack at least 20 sensing points for every 10 cm of optical fiber. Due to its multi point capability, it is highly accurate and specific as it is capable of making multiple independent measurements of same or different nutrients, respectively. Description of the effort: During this grant, the optical fiber sensor demonstrated in Phase I will further improved. Using S &amp; ST&#039;s unique side illumination technique of an optical fiber, a multi pronged approach will be used to achieve the desired device. Fluorescent, absorption, colorimetric and scattering based techniques will be tested. Both active and passive optical fiber sensors will be used: the first requires a sensitive coating for the targeted parameter, the second requires no sensitive coating at all but can use spectroscopic techniques that will be adapted to the proposed device.

        "abstract": "Typical agrochemical sprayers use nozzles to atomize a liquid stream into droplets; these droplets then travel to the target. Nozzles may be selected to provide a range of droplet sizes, spray distribution patterns, and flow rates for a desired liquid material application. Spray distribution, droplet size, and flow rate are important considerations in achieving a high quality agrochemical application. The size of the droplets and application conditions can influence the target coverage and the occurrence of spray drift, where droplets are displaced by ambient wind and subsequently land outside of the designated spray area. It has been shown that uniform deposition of small droplets can result in superior pest control efficacy. However, large droplets are less likely to drift than small droplets. Spray droplet size is the most important factor affecting the likelihood of spray drift and target coverage from conventional spray nozzles. The capability of pulse width modulated (PWM) flow control at individual nozzles can result in fewer application rate errors due to adjustment to the rate at the highest possible spatial resolution. However, the quality of an application is dependent on many other factors than only the quantity of material applied. Spray droplet size remains a critical ingredient in maximizing efficacy and minimizing drift. But, even with modern PWM flow control systems, droplet size on existing systems is controlled in per-machine width resolution, that is, every nozzle across the entire boom must produce the same droplet size spectrum. There are many situations where adjusting the droplet size on an individual nozzle is desirable, including use in narrow buffer zones where a larger droplet size is mandated for mitigating spray drift. With current technology, a spray machine with a 40 m boom would be required to maintain large droplets on a 40 m swath, even if the mandated buffer zone was only 3 m. This application would reduce the efficacy of the application in areas not at risk of drift. Modern global positioning systems with centimeter-scale accuracy and high-speed computers are capable of implementing very precise applications for diverse crops in close proximity. To gain full use of these sensor and processing technologies, the need for high treatable spatial resolution is increasing. However, one of the primary limitations to precision agricultural technology is the lack of good actuation systems to match the precision of today&#039;s advanced sensing systems. The basic premise of this project is a PWM-based valve in which the electromechanics of the valve and the driver electronics are designed to allow the valve to be partially opened, in a precisely and reliably controllable manner during each pulse of emitted spray. In this manner, the liquid pressure drop across the valve can be controlled, this controlling the inlet pressure to a spray nozzle and therefore, the spray droplet size. This control, when coupled with the existing PWM-based control of the flow rate of liquid, allows complete control, on a nozzle-by-nozzle basis, of spray application rate and droplet size of agricultural spray",

        "abstract": "Plant-eating insect pests cause significant economic loss in commercial greenhouse growing operations, sometimes amounting to tens of thousands of dollars per hectare. Insects as a vector of plant pathogens also rank very high on the problem list for greenhouse/hothouse growers. Efficiently managing pests requires an array of complementary methods including traps and other physical methods, biological controls, and plant culture management to prevent economic losses and reduce the use of pesticides. Although host utilization by insects is broadly dictated by factors such as host species, season, plant nutrition, and water status, many insects that are significant economic pests in greenhouses, including thrips, aphids, and whiteflies use vision as a primary cue to orient to their hosts. Orbital Technology Corporation has devised a strategy to enhance or disrupt these visual cues. Modification of visual cues can be used in two ways to protect crop plants, either as a mechanism to attract insects to traps or &quot;decoy&quot; plants, or to repel insects by interrupting the sequence that begins with their orientation to the plant from a distance and ends with establishment on the plant. Modification of insect visual cue recognition can be used as a new tool in a grower&#039;s IPM program. The objectives of the proposed project is to identify visual cue modifiers that: (1) reduce predation of protected agriculture crops; (2) increase attraction to decoy crops; (3) enhance the attraction to physical traps (i.e., sticky cards); or (4) any combination of the above, while not disrupting beneficial insects or plant growth. If these methods can be configured to help reduce insect damage and insect-related vectored diseases in greenhouses, these systems may become an important component of the grower&#039;s IPM program, and could help to reduce the annual per hectare costs of greenhouse pest control.",

Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a potent adjuvant of cell-mediated immunity that has been shown to enhance protection from influenza pathogens. The use of IL-12 adjuvant could improve vaccines for several serious porcine diseases including flu but the high cost of current production methods cannot sustain the scaled up product availability necessary for large scale vaccination strategies. Plant-based production offers several potential benefits over conventional production systems including lower startup costs and increased flexibility in terms of scale-up, storage, safety, and cost containment. Our Phase I research demonstrated that plants can produce fully functional Porcine IL-12 adjuvant in a transient tobacco expression system. This Phase II SBIR proposes to further develop this plant-produced immune stimulator adjuvant product (PoIL-12) by addressing the following specific objectives: I. Demonstrate CMI-inducing efficacy or porcine IL-12 in vivo. II. Enhance yields of recombinant porcine IL-12 in plants. III. Assess protection and vaccine dose-sparing potential of pIL-12 in SIV vaccination trials. IV. Test the potential of orally administered pIL-12 to provide protective immune stimulation. This Phase II R &amp; D, in addition to developing in vivo vaccine adjuvancy protocols of plant-produced porcine IL-12 in pigs, will focus on enhancing plant-based IL-12 product yields in support of Phase III commercial development.",

        "abstract": "The emerging cellulosic-based biofuels industry will benefit national security, lower Green House Gases (GHG) emissions, and bolster the American farmer through a reliable cash crop without necessarily stressing the American food supply. For the biomass industry to become sustainable, it is believed that production of ethanol must drop to $1.60/gallon in order to compete with foreign oil. Therefore technologies that contribute to greater production cost efficiencies would, not just allow for a cheaper gallon of ethanol, but more importantly, contribute to the sustainability of an entire burgeoning industry. Of notable importance is the need for fast, accurate, and easy to acquire measurements of simple carbohydrates, aka sugars, in processing. Sugars are the fundamental intermediary in most biomass conversion, as plant material is broken down into sugars before being fermented into ethanol and monitoring them throughout the process is critical to efficient biomass conversion. The problem lies in the fact that raw material and production variations result in variability in the net conversion of the final product. Any facility operating below its optimal conversion is leaving potential product fallow. Accurate measurement of biomass sugar content is of prime importance because it is directly proportional to ethanol yield. If an online sugar measurement solution was available, biomass facilities could make production adjustments during the process to maximize yields, flag problem variations at an early stage, and quickly pursue corrective actions. Our market research suggests an average facility will save nearly $1 Million annually. Our unique patent-pending microchip technology combines capillary electrophoresis (CE) with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD). CE is a proven means for separation of sugars in complex matrices. PAD is the gold standard carbohydrate detection scheme. Because we hold the only demonstrated technology for combining CE and PAD onto a microchip format, we can uniquely offer fast, simple, and reliable sugar analysis. Based on Phase I progress and the significant market potential, a core team of researchers have come together to form Carbo Analytics, LLC (CARBO) with the sole mission of adding value to carbohydrate-based commodities through reliable process monitors. In this Phase II proposal, CARBO will transform a proof-of-concept prototype into demonstration units (breadboard and production instruments) meeting end-user specifications and addressing performance, reliability, longevity, and manufacturability. Both instruments will be field tested with three key industry leaders. Phase II activities our purposely structured to reach development milestones that will place CARBO in a position to receive industry product development contracts that will pull development through Phase III and into the commercial marketplace.",

        "abstract": "Vapors produced during the process of refueling cars are a significant source of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) emissions. Uncontrolled emissions cause economic losses and pollute the environment. This problem is exacerbated when the gasoline contains bioethanol because its presence increases the vapor pressure and volatility of the fuel. These increased fuel emissions from ethanol-gasoline blends may lead to limitations on the use of E10 or E15 or higher ethanol blends. If a successful technology is developed and applied to all U.S. fuel stations for solving the VOC emissions problem, 200 million gallons per year of E10 or E15 fuel (containing 10 or 15% ethanol) can be recovered. This is both an energy savings and an emissions reduction of equal magnitude. Working with industrial partners a novel membrane system has been developed for venting biofuel storage tanks. This system reduces ethanol-gasoline VOC emissions by more than 95% and recovers more than 95% of fuel vapors. Therefore, the technical and economic feasibility of the novel membrane system for venting ethanol-gasoline storage tanks during car refueling was demonstrated. Preliminary analyses show that such a system pays for itself in 2 to 2.4 years when installed in a typical fuel station that dispenses 213,000 gal/month. The proposed work plan for Phase II consists of scaling-up the membrane venting system, optimizing it and running a pilot and long-term tests. While the initial focus of this program is VOC abatement associated with biofuel storage tanks, we believe there are many other applications as well. A market research study by BCC (Business Communications Company) has identified potential VOC reduction opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry, cement industry, the power industry, surface coating industry, waste water industry, and semiconductor industry.",

With a rising demand in industrialized nations and an even faster increasing demand from developing countries (e.g. India, China, etc.), the pressure on these oil reserves increases and could serve as a basis for future conflicts between nations aiming to secure the remaining reserves for themselves. A strategy to mitigate this risk is to develop alternative energy sources such as biofuels. This Phase II SBIR proposal describes the development of a heterogeneous transesterification catalyst for the conversion of oil to biodiesel. The immediate commercial application of the proposed technology is the oil-to-biodiesel transesterification reaction that currently takes place at biorefineries. Biorefineries currently use a single-use, homogeneous catalyst in a batch reaction process that requires considerable post-reaction processing.

        "abstract": "The USDA Forest Service indicates that nearly 80% of the entire United States population lives in urban areas and depends on the essential ecological, economic and social benefits provided by the urban forest. Some of these benefits include: - Trees improve air quality by lowering air temperatures, altering emissions from building energy use and other sources, and removing air pollutants through their leaves. - By storing carbon and reducing carbon emissions from power plants through lowered energy use, urban trees have a far-reaching impact on global climate change. - The preponderance of asphalt and concrete in urban settings causes a &quot;heat island&quot; effect that increases urban air temperatures by several degrees. A shaded urban neighborhood provides heat island mitigation that reduces business and household energy use. - The reduction in expansion/contraction of asphalt caused by the shade from urban street trees can increase pavement life and reduce road maintenance costs, thus providing a synergistic reduction in the use of petroleum products that are found in roadway overlays. - Trees intercept rain on their leaf, branch and stem surfaces and by absorbing water through their roots. For every 5% increase in tree cover in urban communities, there is a 2% reduction in stormwater runoff and its corresponding contaminants that would otherwise enter local waterways as well as burden treatment plants. An important first step in the urban forest management process is the completion of a comprehensive tree inventory that documents the location and condition of existing trees and tree planting sites in a community. Despite the proven importance of the urban forest, the agencies responsible for tree management in the United States are frequently under-funded, short-staffed and their priorities are necessarily driven by weather damage, impact on electrical lines and other reactive activities. In many communities, citizens, students and non-profit organizations that are passionate about greening their communities could potentially supplement the government activities by planting and caring for trees. However, they lack the necessary tools they need to work together effectively, share critical information, and document ongoing progress. OpenTreeMap is a wiki-inspired tree inventory system that will address these issues by enabling both government and non-government stakeholder groups to collaborate in a more effective and consistent manner, thus making tree inventories widely available and more affordable for interested communities nationwide. A mobile version of the application will leverage a smart phone&#039;s GPS for tree location data and provide the ability to capture and upload digital photographs of each tree for posting on the website or for species identification purposes. OpenTreeMap calculates the benefits of each tree on the surrounding air and water quality. In addition to using this data to maintain existing trees, communities can also evaluate cost benefits by species that will guide future tree planting efforts and potentially address environmental issues specific to a street or neighborhood.",

        "abstract": "Coal-fired electric power generating plants are under increasing pressure to reduce CO2 and other toxic emissions. However, using alternative fuels, such as solid biomass as a greenhouse gas neutral fuel, requires substantial plant modifications. In addition, burning biomass contributes to slagging and fouling of the plants&#039; furnaces. Soil mixed in with the forest waste is the primary cause. HM3 Energy has developed an innovative process (trademarked &quot;TorrB&quot;) to convert forest waste into fuel briquettes with low soil content. Unlike most pellets and briquettes produced from wood chips, these briquettes behave just like coal; i.e., they can be stored outdoors, are easily pulverized, and their heating value is similar to that of coal. The TorrB process uses torrefaction where the biomass is heated to a high temperature (200-300 degrees C) for a specified time duration in the absence of oxygen. The final product is a solid with a high energy value for use as combustion fuel in coal-fired power plants. This Phase II grant research will focus on developing commercial scale torrefaction equipment and process. HM3 Energy&#039;s TorrB torrefaction process and product have demonstrated clear viability as shown in the results of our NIFA-USDA-SBIR Phase I study using a small batch process. By taking the current proven torrefaction process and applying it to a scalable design which utilizes a continuously operating torrefaction system, we will be able to economically produce the large quantities of torrefied biomass required to operate coal-fired power plants. Our approach will be to develop, test and optimize the new torrefier equipment of our own design. When combined with the (waterless) contamination removal methodology developed in Phase I, we will then be ready to apply this knowledge to construction of a full commercial production facility. The potential impacts and benefits of large scale commercial use of torrefied biomass in place of coal are numerous. The forest waste feedstock is renewable and sustainable, and can be obtained from undesirable species (such as western Juniper) present in semiarid regions and through forest thinning and removal of accumulated forest debris - even bug-infested dying trees. By removing the undesired forest waste, the forest ecosystem will be less susceptible to insect and pathogens. There will also be a reduction in the potential for catastrophic forest fires. Overall, the nation&#039;s health and environment will be improved by a reduction in coal-fired power plant emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury and other toxic metals present in the coal and coal ash. In fact, America&#039;s supply of clean water is threatened by mercury pollution, much of which comes from coal-fired power plant emissions that get into water resources. Replacing coal, the greatest source of CO2, with carbon-neutral biomass fuel in the current installed base of coal-fired power plants could have the greatest impact on green house gases of any mitigation measure. Air quality, as well as the environmental health of water resources and ecosystems in forest, rangeland and farms, could be greatly enhanced.",

There is a strong need and opportunity to develop simple and inexpensive analytical methods for rapid field detection of perchlorate. The focus of this project is on development of an simple, inexpensive and highly sensitive nano-biosensor for rapid detection of perchlorate down to 1 ppb. This biosensor will suit field use, laboratory applications, and on-line monitoring; it facilitates cost-effective and convenient monitoring of perchlorate in groundwater, soil, drinking water, food and beverages. It will make important contributions towards improvement of public health. Three primary market segments have been identified for the technology: water quality testing, food safety evaluation, and remediation. In addition, the nano materials developed and investigated in the project for perchlorate biosensor would serve as a protocol for other species-selective bio-interfaces suiting detection of other environmental contaminates (e.g., nitrate).",

        "abstract": "Agricultural row crops occupy hundreds of million acres of land in the United States. Decisions regarding the implementation of tillage practices in these agricultural areas have a significant effect on other environmental outcomes including soil erosion, water quality, and carbon sequestration. In addition, the effects of tillage practices can vary due to soil type and topographic conditions. There is currently no systematic and cost-effective method for documenting tillage practices, or the resulting effects, over a large region. Currently, agricultural tillage practices are typically mapped at the regional level using a drive-by survey method, which is time consuming, expensive, and limited in spatial extent and temporal sampling. The high cost, in time and resources, of identifying tillage practices across a large region using this traditional drive-by survey is prohibitive. The use of remote sensing data for mapping tillage practices across large regions represents a cost efficient solution. With funding from the USDA, we will build a prototype operational tillage practice monitoring platform (OpTIS) that will systematically provide information about the spatial and temporal dynamics of tillage practices through a web-GIS environment.",

        "abstract": "Nutrient management is a touchy subject: there has to be a balance between regulatory concerns and adequate crop nutrition. Phosphate is an essential nutrient for plant productivity but also a major pollutant when applied in excess. On-the-spot testing for phosphate as orthophosphate (available, soluble, or reactive P) is an appropriate solution to give producers and their technical service providers (Extension agents, crop consultants, and farm managers) better control of the use of phosphate fertilizer in the field. NECi, The Nitrate Elimination Company, Inc., has developed a series of enzyme-based, environmentally benign, and reliable nitrate test kits with the assistance of USDA SBIR funding. NECi Ag-NTKs (Nitrate Test Kits for Agriculture) and lab reagents are being adopted by producers, consultants, and agribusiness. We now propose to develop a similar line of test kits for detection of Phosphate. Compliance with nutrient management regulations will be less burdensome when practical, affordable tools are readily available. The photometer (color reader) being perfected in Phase II is designed to work with both nitrate and phosphate test kits. The photometer will provide data on the N and P status of soils, runoff, feed, and crops. This information can be used for making timely, knowledge-based nutrient application decisions with an eye to maximizing profit and yield while staying in compliance. NECi&#039;s develops products that enable and encourage testing as an aid to conservation of rural quality of life. In a different context, NECi is deeply committed to Green Chemistry. Many of the methods routinely used by analytical chemists in the lab or out in the field require the use of hazardous or toxic reagents. Simplified methods designed for non-skilled operators tend to lack the accuracy, sensitivity, and selectivity required in order for the information gathered to be relevant and useful. Enzyme-based methods can satisfy both sets of users as the variability and instability characteristics of enzymes are solved though the use of recombinant protein expression and state of the art stabilization techniques.",

        "abstract": "Currently there are no truly effective interventions or therapeutic treatments for White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) in farmed shrimp. Current production practices focus on pathogen exclusion by stocking specific pathogen free (SPF) larvae, decontamination and filtration of water to prevent pathogen introduction, and strict biosecurity at hatcheries and grow out pond sites. This is extremely challenging due to the prevalence of WSSV in estuarine waters in shrimp producing areas, resulting in devastating financial losses, even in SPF populations. WSSV was first discovered in 1992 after several outbreaks of a high mortality disease occurred in shrimp farms in Taiwan. Within a decade it has spread throughout the world and is now endemic in most shrimp producing areas. WSSV has a wide host range of over 50 separate species including all penaeids and crayfish. In the United States, a 2007 APHIS study showed that 66% of tested samples were positive and it has been declared endemic by the state veterinarian and OIE in the Louisiana freshwater crayfish population. The combined economic impact of WSSV in farmed shrimp is tremendous. It is estimated that Asia alone has lost over $6 billion since 1992, and the Americas about $1-2 billion since WSSV introduction in 1999 with countries such as Ecuador showing the greatest economic impact. In addition to the tremendous economic effect on shrimp production, there is a rising concern for an introduction of WSSV into native crustacean species. Avenues exist for the introduction of WSSV into naive species such as reprocessing of frozen emergency harvested product or animal movement. In addition, the United States possesses over 350 of the estimated 500 species worldwide of crayfish species. In North America, 65 out of the estimated 400 resident species are endangered and half of these are listed as needing protection. The outcome of the proposed project would be the first effective commercially available vaccines that protect against disease caused by WSSV in shrimp. Harrisvaccines intends to market vaccine to be used in two different shrimp production settings. First, an injectable vaccine for adult breeding females will be targeted to SPF production companies and larger integrated intensive shrimp producers abroad who possess their own hatcheries for the purpose of restocking their ponds. The second would be an orally administered vaccine for post larvae (PL) shrimp that would aid in protection of the shrimp prior to entry into the ponds. This accomplishes disease prevention in the hatcheries as well as the ponds. The goal is to prevent disease that can cause increases in the variable costs of raising shrimp. In addition to the observable clinical signs of disease, WSSV is directly responsible for a reduction of feed conversion rates which result in increased feed costs and a reduction in harvest weight combined with 70-100% mortality. The costs associated with restocking ponds lost to disease add to this devastation. A vaccine against WSSV is undoubtedly a valuable insurance for the investment of shrimp rearing.",

Aside from the purchase of feed, energy costs are the highest source of continuous investment in the aquaculture industry. A high-efficiency pump that is specifically designed for use in recirculating aquaculture systems will reduce energy costs associated with water movement and aeration. To this end, MDM applied for, and received, Phase I funding from the USDA SBIR program to determine the feasibility of an integrated impeller and rotor in conjunction with an external stator that is capable of delivering 3,200 m3 day-1 (600 gal min-1) of water at 3.0 m (10 ft) of total dynamic head with a wire-to-water efficiency in excess of 75 While the Phase I research answered the question of the pump&#039;s technical feasibility, it yielded little guidance on the practical aspects of building such a pump. Much research is still necessary to construct a working prototype including material selection, the impacts that various component materials will have on overall pump performance, and the likelihood that CFD modeled results can be duplicated in a working prototype. Technical objectives necessary to create a marketable product include: i) determine the mechanical and electrical limits of the stator; ii) construction material selection; iii) prototype and test loop construction; iv) prototype evaluation; and v) beta testing: MDM is pursuing two alternative design tracks to develop a working prototype: One with conventional permanent magnets and the other with a new technology that creates higher flux densities than currently achievable with standard technology.

One study showed that due to its voracious appetite, present value damage from the snail could cost Philippine rice production as much as 2.3 billion dollars annually. In Hawai`i, the apple snail invasion has reduced taro harvests for the small and mid-sized farms that comprise the local taro industry by 18% to 25% annually. This project will research a unique control for apple snail on Hawai`i&#039;s wetland taro production using the unrefined glycerin co-product (UCP) from biodiesel production as a soil conditioner. The research will identify a uniform product, test the product on non-target species and conduct field trials on wetland taro to determine efficacy in controlling apple snail and impacts on soil and plant health. The end goal will be to develop a marketable product that provides environmentally safe control of apple snail on taro and enhances the efficiency and profitability of small taro farms. Locally manufacturing an agricultural amendment, Aina Mo, for use in Hawaiian taro production saves energy through import substitution. Developing value-added co-products from biodiesel refining will improve profitability for the renewable fuels industry. Sustaining and increasing wetland taro production will revitalize rural areas and preserve wetland habitat.

        "abstract": "Sheep ranching and wool production have been a part of our country &amp; #8223;s rural heritage for more than a hundred years, with small and mid-sized ranches serving as the backbone of our country &amp; #8223;s sheep operations. Presently, small operators account for more total ewes than larger operations. This means that small ranches offer the best potential for growth of sheep operations in the future. The American Sheep Industry states that success depends on small operations increasing their production level of sheep and that &quot;small operations are our most important asset for rebuilding sheep inventory.&quot;(American Sheep Industry Weekly, Feb 18, 2011). In the last decade, U.S. wool output has been cut in half, and the country has gone from utilizing about 75% of its domestic wool production 10-15 years ago to exporting 75% .The United States is in danger of losing its market infrastructure for sheep because of rapidly declining numbers. The American sheep industry is estimated to have a total economic impact on society worth approximately 4.5 billion dollars and it employs both directly and indirectly approximately 100,000 people. It is important to ensure that this significant portion of American society and culture is preserved. The mills that serve as a part of the infrastructure in the sheep industry continue to search for ways in which to reduce their costs. Regional mills located in rural areas are impacted by scarce water resources and high energy costs, which directly affect the wool scouring process. Additionally, the high contaminant loadings (high chemical oxygen demand-COD, total suspended solids-TSS, and grease content) make these facilities very susceptible to non-compliance with stricter discharge regulations. This situation creates a new opportunity for the expansion and sustainability of regional domestic mill operations as long as they can overcome environmental challenges in a sustainable way. Mountain Meadow Wool intends to open the door for these regionally located mills to take advantage of this opportunity through the proposal of a new wool processing system. This system will use water and energy more efficiently, and will address the end use of all waste created during the scouring process. MMW will accomplish this through the prototyping of aerobic treatment, composting, and constructed wetlands as final treatment processes for a wool processing system. Regional mills as well as a variety of mini-mills operating in the 20-300lb/day range will be able to use this new process to wash wool sustainably and profitably while meeting stringent U.S. environmental regulations. The underlying goal of this research is to enable these mills to improve both their profitability and their environmental sustainability, so that the small- and mid-sized ranching operations utilizing these mills were able to diversify their operations and increase their income.",

        "abstract": "Non-technical Summary: The profitability of small and mid-sized dairy farms is strongly affected by increases in feed costs and energy costs. Unfortunately, farm operators have limited control of these factors, especially in the long term. New technology is needed to allow farmers to manage energy costs on their farms. One excellent solution is to use existing organic farm waste material to create energy via anaerobic digestion. Dairy operations (as well as other feeding sites) create copious amount of manure each day. By collecting this waste into an anaerobic digester, valuable biogas can be created and used by the farmer for pasteurization or hot water generation. Other organic materials can be used as feedstocks to enhance biogas production. The Biogas Heat Engine from Quantalux is an energy solution that generates valuable biogas from agricultural waste. Biogas has a large fraction of methane, and with suitable cleaning of the gas, can be used as a drop-in replacement for fossil fuels such as propane and natural gas. Our system includes a novel method for stabilizing biogas production using a thermal energy storage (TES). Renewable thermal sources are coupled to the Heat Engine via thermal storage cache, allowing the system to produce biogas more consistently. In order to show the viability of this technology for smaller farming operations, Quantalux will prototype and demonstrate that a simplified, thermally stable anaerobic digester system, We will show that the smaller farmer can self-generate biogas for use on his/her farm (decreasing energy costs), and that same farmer can also earn additional revenue (from selling enhanced digestate.) We also will show enhanced biogas production via the use of thermally stabilized digestion vessels, and by the addition of different farm-based feedstocks to the base manure feedstock. The Biogas Heat Engine will be marketed directly to small to mid-sized dairy farmers who seek decreased costs and a diversified revenue source. Revenues come from avoided cost of energy, the sale of compost, or from tipping fees from co-digestion materials. The Biogas Heat Engine is a way for the small farmer their energy costs while improving the health management of their farm and of the surrounding ecosystem.",

        "abstract": "Red alder is the predominant commercial hardwood species of the Pacific Northwest. It is an early successional species that rapidly regenerates following fire or clearcutting and normally precedes the establishment of the historically preferred Douglas-fir. As such, past conifer forestry management practices were designed to speed the transition to Douglas-fir through alder eradication efforts. Consequently, today there is a critical shortage of quality alder logs at the same time the species has become highly prized in domestic and international hardwood furniture, cabinetry, and specialty product markets. Accordingly, red alder plantations are now the leading strategy to forestall the supply shortage of quality saw logs because of favorable rates of financial return in addition to their unique contribution to overall ecosystem function. The success of an alder plantation industry is contingent upon elite, well-adapted planting stock, capable of improved yields and wood quality. GreenWood Resources proposes an alder genetic improvement program that replicates its highly successful and integrated hybrid poplar genetic improvement and plantation management programs. Phase II results will lead to improved alder varieties capable of high yields, reduced risk of spring frost injury, increased site adaptability and improved wood quality. Our work will lead directly to development of GreenWood Resources&#039; red alder nursery business.

        "abstract": "Soybean is the major source for production of edible oils worldwide and in United States. Pressing of the soybean into flakes followed by the solvent extraction with hexane (solvent) is most widely practiced for extraction of oil. Separation of solvent from oil-solvent mixture for solvent recovery and reuse is usually carried out by solvent evaporation. Evaporation (or distillation) demands considerable amount of energy and associated costs since it involves an energy and capital intensive phase change of the solvent. Solvent used for oil extraction (i.e. hexane) from oil seeds is highly volatile, flammable, and is also explosive; therefore, solvent recovery by distillation is also a physical hazard. Hexane is also categorized by the EPA as hazardous air pollutant and the inevitable loss of hexane vapors into the environment during the solvent recovery by distillation is a severe environmental issue. Based on our experience with chemically resistant membranes, Compact Membrane Systems (CMS) has proposed and demonstrated the feasibility of superior membrane filtration technology for separation of solvent from vegetable oil-solvent mixture. Benefits of developing this superior membrane filtration technology are associated with (i) energy and capital savings by replacing the conventional technologies such as evaporation, (ii) increased process safety, and (iii) reduced solvent emissions into the environment from vegetable oil processing plants. The proposed membrane filtration technology will have a significant impact in many of the industrial processes using distillation/evaporation. For example, solvent recovery by the superior membrane filtration technology will be of great value in processing other oil seeds such as corn, cotton seed and canola. Other applications of the proposed membrane filtration technology include solvent recovery from algae oil extraction process in biofuel production and solvent recovery from solvent-deasphalting process in petroleum refining.",

        "abstract": "Internal parasites are the greatest health and production challenge for sheep and goats in southeastern states and others during warm, humid conditions (including Northeastern, Midwestern and irrigated pastures in Western US). Haemonchus contortus, or barber pole, worm thrives in warm, humid climates and is a voracious blood feeder that can cause anemia and death to the animal if left untreated. It is the most crucial health problem of small ruminants in this environment. Dewormer resistance has left many producers without any chemical control of worms, which was heavily relied on in the past, and some have gone out of business due to poor parasite control options. Published studies reported that consumption of sericea lespedeza, a condensed tannin rich forage, has offered control of parasites in sheep and goats. Results from the Phase I project indicated that a 75% sericea lespedeza leaf meal pellet was highly palatable and offered good control of barber pole worm. There was evidence that coccidiosis (a condition that causes diarrhea) was reduced in lambs and goat kids that consumed the pellets. Free range poultry suffer from Ascaridia galli, a round worm, which can not be easily prevented or controlled in outdoor poultry operations. Chickens will readily consume sericea lespedeza and the pelleted leaf meal could offer control of their gastrointestinal worms and gut pathogens. The objectives of this project are to optimize control of gastrointestinal worms of sheep and goats by supplementation with pelleted sericea lespedeza leaf meal, determine the effect of the pellets on coccidiosis, and determine the impact of the pellets on gastrointestinal worm infection of free range poultry. In addition, the impact of harvesting sericea lespedeza at different times during the summer and under various conditions on leaf meal quality will be determined. Results of the proposed approach may extend the use of 75% sericea lespedeza leaf meal pellets for control of coccidia in sheep and goats, control of gastrointestinal worms or gut pathogens in poultry, and aid in management recommendations on use of the pellets in a feeding program for sheep and goats. In addition, understanding how harvesting at different times throughout the growing season and under different management schemes will assist in processing the harvested sericea lespedeza for optimal quality and refine management recommendations for harvest by contract growers. There is a strong demand by small ruminant producers for the pellet to aid in the control of internal parasites and meeting the demand could be a challenge. Commercialization of sericea lespedeza leaf meal pellets for gastrointestinal worm control and as a nutrition supplement has the potential to increase sustainability and profitability of sheep and goat producers that have no effective chemical dewormers.",

        "abstract": "An increasing proportion of eggs produced world-wide are brown or brown-speckled eggs. In addition, egg production methods, such as free-range and organic poultry cultivation methods, increase the variety of contaminants that can be deposited on eggs. Old technology that inspects white eggs has great difficulty in distinguishing contaminants from the brown surfaces and speckles on brown and brown-speckled eggs. Contaminants can pose a serious health hazard to te consuming public if the contaminants are not reliably detected and removed. The recent advent of low-cost advanced multispectral component technology enables an advanced automation solution to be devised that will reduce processing costs and increase egg quality delivered to the consuming public. The project will provide a major advance in the ability to detect and classify contaminants and enable their removal by increased washing cycles without falsely rejecting eggs due to their harmless speckles. The resulting system will enable United States egg processing equipment makers to complete in the rapidly-growing world-wide egg processing machinery marketplace and thereby also contribute to the U.S. manufacturing job base.",

        "abstract": "The national demand for energy and need for economic development has been driving efforts to create a domestic biofuels industry. Significant investment by both the public and private sectors have resulted in progress but recent government rule making has set ambitious requirements for renewable fuel supplies that can not be met with existing technologies or feedstocks. This significant unmet market for biofuels created by Federal regulation is the business opportunity identified by ATI to be met by producing Field Pennycress as a non-food energy crop. Pennycress has seeds with 36% oil and is grown as a winter annual on unused land following the corn harvest and prior to the spring planting of soybeans. This means that farmers can continue to grow corn and soybeans in the traditional way but add our new crop in the winter allowing them to earn additional income. Approximately 40 million acres of land are available each year for Pennycress under this strategy with no impact to the food supply or critical wildlife habitats. When fully deployed, Pennycress could supply eight billion gallons of biofuels and generate $4 billion in new farm income. In addition, approximately 23,000 new non-farm jobs could be created in rural communities enhancing local economic development. Our Phase I research has confirmed that Pennycress can be grown commercially as an energy crop and the logistics of harvest, transportation and storage were proven. Our SBIR Phase II project is designed to enhance Pennycress profitability through higher yields, gain acceptance from the farmers while reducing risk and uncertainty so that the crop is adopted and production acres can grow. In addition, a complete Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) for Pennycress biofuel production will be undertaken. ATI and its research partners will conduct agronomic research to address planting strategies, fertilizer regimes to enhance yields and evaluate new genetic lines of Pennycress. We will assess the impact of growing Pennycress on soil nutrition as well as its impact on the following soybean crop. ATI will gather data necessary to support the LCA of Pennycress required for EPA and USDA rule making on advanced biofuels and conclusion of this project will allow ATI to deploy a Pennycress supply chain from the farm to the pump as an innovative bioenergy business. The ATI commercialization plan is to contract with farmers to produce Pennycress from seed provided by us, take delivery of the crop and then process the seed by crushing and sell the resulting oil and remaining high-energy presscake. Our five-year goal is to have 100,000 acres under cultivation. ATI expects to grow geographically to more than one million acres as the crop proves itself to farmers. With substantial revenues from our production business, we will ultimately build our own biofuel manufacturing facilities and function as an integrated bioenergy company.",

        "abstract": "This proposal sets forth a precise and rapid methodology for identifying the interaction sites between monoclonal antibodies and proteins. The basis of the system is a high-throughput mass spectrometry-based analysis of epitope determinants to identify theinteracting protein sequences using immunoaffinity capture combined with enzymatic digestion of the target protein; either pre- or post-capture. This combination will be used to rapidly determine the approximate location of each binding epitope. The precise location of the binding epitope will then be determined by immunoaffinity capture and mass spectrometric readout of sets of synthetic ladder peptides that span the approximate epitope established from the initial analysis. The project will develop reproducible methods to demonstrate epitope mapping for monoclonal antibodies of interest to NCI tested by multiple sampling and quantifiable results. Mapped epitopes will be functionally characterized by amino acid substitutions in the epitope sequence using high-throughput spotted array surface plasmon resonance imaging and SPR-Biomolecular Interaction Analysis to identify the key amino acids that are critically involved in binding the antibody to the antigenic epitope. Thus, this approach will provide an efficient and cost effective platform from which to accomplish high-throughput epitope mapping of monoclonal antibodies for use in diagnosis of cancer.",

        "abstract": "In response to this NCI solicitation, Rockland proposes to develop a novel method to assay the pharmacodynamic (PO) properties of anti-cancer small molecules targeting the PI3K/mTOR/AKT signaling pathway by quantitatively and independently measuring the phosphorylation of each unique AKT isoform in a validated multiplex immunoassay. The developed PD-AKT-ELISA would offer improved personalized medicine, whereby physicians would prescribe a dosage according to the pharmacodynamic effects of anti-cancer drugson individual patients, or modify therapeutic modality based on the feedback for each individual Akt isoform. We plan to use a number of anti-cancer drug candidates in this study and to produce reagents, including monoclonal antibodies to measure inactiveand active AKT isoforms suitable for a fit-for-use theranostic quantitative biomarker ELISA for AKT.    The PO-AKT-ELISA and associated reagents will be produced, optimized, validated and applied to both solid tumor and soft tumor xenograft tissue. The reagents and validated assay will measure all AKT isoforms in its active and inactive states to fill a need not currently addressed by products or technologies commercially available to researchers and clinicians. The end result will be a multiplex assay thatcan be used by most existing immunoassay readers in both a research and high through-put clinical environment. Assay results will allow physicians to more precisely target dosages or types of drugs that modulate the PI3K/mTOR/AKT pathway, and will ultimately lower treatment costs by more accurately prescribing effective doses of anticancer  drugs and potentially shortening the duration of drug treatment regimens.",

Another mode of operation allows for the use of either fluorescent, nanoparticle or elemental tags (e.g. lanthanides), to provide a highly multi-plexed labeling method using the single cell mass spectrometer as the detector. The SCMS will also have the capability to be coupled to a cytometer which can be used to isolate cell populations of interest prior to mass spectrometry analysis.

Minibodies (~8-10 nm) are significantly smaller than antibodies, yet exhibit dramatically improved properties for in vivo delivery and imaging: full bindingcombined with rapid in vivo kinetics. Following radiolabeling with I-124 or Cu-64, PSMA-specific minibodies demonstrated excellent biodistribution and microPET imaging properties in a preclinical model of prostate cancer. In Phase II we propose to (1) Optimize labeling conditions for the huJ591 minibody using both residualizing and non-residualizing radiolabels and formally compare biodistribution and imaging performance, in order to finalize the radiolabeling strategy for huJ591 minibody use clinically.

        "abstract": "Alcohol abuse and its related health effects are estimated to have an economic cost in the US that approaches $200 Billion per year. However, current tests for alcohol use/abuse are not reliable except when administered within several hours of intoxication. Moreover, current clinical tests for alcohol-related organ damage only provide reasonable diagnostic and prognostic value after the damage has occurred. This study is designed to examine the effect of alcohol on micro RNAs (miRNAs), a newly discovered class of gene expression regulators that are believed to play important roles in vital cellular functions, development and disease. Genome Explorations Inc. (GenEx) proposes to use a well-validated mouse model system to identify alcohol-induced changes in miRNA expression in blood, liver and cerebellum and assess their ability to act as sensitive and specific indicators of acute alcohol use and alcohol-induced liver damage. Identification of such biomarkers may lead to the development of more sensitive and specific tests that can detect alcohol consumption well after the fact, and the early onset (or pre-onset indicators) of alcohol induced liver damage.",

Phase II will involve collaboration to develop and commercialize the MobileMedMinder. This product will allow users to enroll and verify medication intake using the existing mobile devices, and link seemlessly to web through wireless.    MobileMedMinder will provide the following: 1) automatic or simi-automatic entryof medication information through Medscanning, electronic pick lists, voice recognition. 2) Real-time communication with an on-line server where medication can be monitored and recommendations made from automated systems, caregivers or physicians directlyor through social networking solutions. 3) If successful, MobileMedMinder can be extended as a mobile platform for chronic disease management system, such as diabetes, depression, hypertension, etc.    A user-centered usability testing and subject study atthe Ohio State University Medical Center managed by collaborator, Robert M. Guthrie, M.D., is planned to provide a comprehensive, non-intrusive, portable solution in support of medication compliance. The ultimate goal is to develop a product for use by patients on a mobile/web platform to promote medication compliance and behavior change that can be subsequently commercialized.",

        "abstract": "Cardiotoxicity is a major concern to pharmaceutical industry and regulatory agencies. Drugs are continuously removed from the market because of their toxic effects. To avoid cardiovascular side effects, regulatory agencies generated guidelines describing preclinical investigations to be performed before initiating clinical trials. These tests are often labor intensive and are conducted during the late stage of drug discovery, causing severe financial losses in case of safety issues. Thus, the development ofa High-Throughput assay to be conducted during the early phase of drug development will reduce the overall cost and risk of new drugs development. Vala Sciences Inc. proposes to develop a human iPS cell line with a selectable marker for cardiac lineage differentiation and luciferase expression. Human cardiomyocytes, derived by the engineered iPS cells, will be used in combination with an automatic Calcium Transient Image Cytometer (CTIC), to analyze calcium transients and ATP concentration in 384 well format plates. These parameters are altered when cardiomyocytes are exposed to compounds that are either arrhythmogenic or toxic. The assay will identify compounds potentially compromised by cardiac safety concerns, allowing screening in human rather than animal cells, and thus decreasing the risk of adverse events when the drugs are eventually used clinically .",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This project is for the development of software with research and clinical applications in the hearing sciences. In the research area, the software will allow investigators to work at a higher level of abstraction,providing monitoring and control applications for the design of complex sound processing strategies for hearing devices. The clinical applications are designed to improve communications between audiologists, speech-language therapists, and hearing- impaired individuals through the use of auditory training and assessment activities that are accessible from any web-connected device. Our approach for completing this work is to frame development on two formative studies of research and clinical applications. These studies will be conducted in collaboration with the University of Texas at Dallas and with the House Ear Institute. The purpose of these formative evaluations is to receive essential user feedback from scientists, clinicians, and hearing- impaired individuals. The study of the research version of the software will examine the benefits of a specified method for synchronizing bilateral hearing devices (with emphasis on cochlear implants). The study of the clinical version of the software will examine thebenefits of using online auditory training and assessment activities with hearing-impaired children. Successful completion of this project will yield two software packages designed for research and clinical applications. The research version will be used by a relatively small group of academic and industrial scientists, while the clinical version will be used by a larger group of audiologists, speech-language therapists, and hearing-impaired individuals. Providing a single architecture to implement all of these activities will consolidate efforts towards optimizing hearing for the impaired.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This project is for the development of software with research and clinical applications in the hearing sciences.
