The cost of this advantage is managing the complex information technology.  Functional breakdowns in the system are quickly noticed. however a breakdown in the security policy may never be noticed. So the solution must ensure the security policy is verified as it is changed in the day-to-day struggle to meet the mission needs.  ESPANOLA addresses this rising complexity by applying proven software engineering techniques to security policy engineering. ESPANOLA builds on existing object-oriented design tools for creating the verification constraints and the bulk of the security enforcement policy. The remaining much smaller, portion is built by administrators using a simple interface. Each policy change is checked for consistency based on the security and mission constraints defined by the security policy designers. The administrator does not have to use yet another tool to specify and check policy.  The policy is checked, changed and pushed out to all the effected systems with one action.",

The overall goal is to determine how to leverage advanced technologies in order to create an augmented performance environment, thereby enhancing interagency interaction in all phases of SSTR operations. In Phase I, the research necessary to design the augmented performance environment was conducted. Common cultural clashes arising during interagency SSTR planning were identified and linked to collective performance deficits. General expert strategies for handling cultural dissonance also were identified. A distributed planning environment augmented by artificial intelligence was designed in order to enable interagency players to adopt expert strategies for success and reduce incidents of collective performance deficits. A prototype version of this augmented performance environment was developed and its feasibility evaluated. Phase II effort will be devoted to extending the prototype capability to fully enable the adoption of expert strategies for success. Extended capabilities will better enable system users to set the conditions for successful interagency SSTR planning and to solve cross-cultural communication problems in real time. Phase II also will include a comprehensive test and evaluation.",

The sys\u00actem design will use GPS, a modified-mobile adhoc network MANET, local ranging signals, mesh network and geometric pairing (GP) that will provide sub-meter position information, velocity, time (PVT) as well as ID. The sub-meter position is obtained using DFC\u2019s innovative positioning algorithms that uniquely combine (in a weighted least squares sense) lower accuracy absolute positions with highly accurate relative positions. Furthermore, DFC takes advantage of the mesh rigidity where appropriate. The minimal configuration can be a mixed network of dynamic nodes with or without GPS. GPS receivers only need be single carrier (L1) receivers processing the lower accuracy CA signal. This can be accomplished without any infrastructure. Should L1L2 P(Y) code receivers, and infrastructure be available additional accuracy and robustness can be gained. DFC will leverage its legacy GPS signal generator software and GPS software receiver (Kober, W., 2004), implemented on a Field Programable Gate Array (FPGA), to develop this CID system.",

Our approach to meeting the need and associated opportunity for warfighter benefit is to provide a complete engineering support environment for algorithm migration.  The Blackstone Toolset for Semantic Algorithm Harvesting will tackle the challenges of algorithm migration by reducing them to an implementation independent form, capturing both semantic context (Migration Model stored as reusable Metadata) and key validation information in a machine processable form. Blackstone capabilities directly support the mission of POR sustainment.  During Phase II we will transition the technology to the PM Signals Warfare GRCS program to support capability migration to DCGS-A.

Correlating data from multiple sensors with different detection modes will be required for target detection.

Current counter-measure systems consist of many transmitters, with each responsible for only a narrow section of the total bandwidth. The development of an ultra-wideband high-power amplifier is needed to simplify the design of the transmitter, to reduce the system cost and to enhance system performance and reliability.   The power amplifier is the heart of a transmitter and is the reason for the narrow-band response because power and bandwidth are two contradicting requirements.  Trex proposes a novel amplifier topology that will enable the construction of a kW-class solid-state power amplifier which operates from 500MHz to 4000MHz in the near future.  Specifically, in Phase II, Trex will design, construct, test and deliver a 300W solid-state amplifier, from 500MHz to 3000MHz.  This amplifier will be constructed by combining four 75W basic power modules (BPMs).

By the conclusion of this proposed SBIR Phase II project, AEREON will have demonstrated that the phenomenon is well understood, and that initial engineering tools have been developed that will allow DynASTOL\u00ae technology to be applied to landing aircraft. This will allow significant reductions of takeoff and landing ground rolls, and/or the energy/power requirements for catapult and/or arresting gear. Such a new capability can also be used to reduce or eliminate the weight and cost of high-lift devices. AEREON envisions transition of DynASTOL\u00ae technology to military and commercial aircraft design engineers.",

This loss could lead to higher costs in the shipbuilding process. A method of capturing and transferring this experience and knowledge to junior workers would reduce the impact of the departure of the expert workers. KEEL (Knowledge and Experiences of Expert Labor), the envisioned product of this SBIR, is a unique tool that will accelerate the training of junior workers by facilitating the transfer of knowledge from experienced workers even years after their retirement. The core of this innovative knowledge management tool is a framework based on topic areas (and their competencies and KSAs) within shipbuilding that are known to affect productivity. Two interfaces will touch the framework: a knowledge capture interface, which will systematically elicit the experiences and lessons of the retiring workforce, and a knowledge playback interface, which will allow the junior employee to access these lessons when in need of guidance. In phase II, we will develop and validate a beta prototype. This will prepare us for Phase III, when we will build a working system.",

In Phase II, we will fully implement the prototype in order to perform target identification, call for effects, weapon target pairing, shooter assignment, and establishment of the sensor to shooter communications link in less than 5 seconds.  The current prototype performs this action in 20 seconds.  This component will be portable for use in multiple future force targeting architectures.",

The creation of duplicative data and redundant capabilities often results from consumers\u2019 inability to locate and understand data assets that meet their needs.   Without semantic alignment of the Common Cryptologic Data Model, the DCGS-A Metadata Catalog and POR descriptive metadata, information discovery and exploitation will not be fully realized by Defense and Intelligence Communities of Interest (COIs).  Semantic metadata harmonization at design time and mediation at runtime can provide significant improvements to current approaches to arguably the most difficult net-centric objectives: visibility and understandability.   Modus Operandi proposes Harmony, an innovative tool to harmonize disparate metadata models (ontologies) through analysis of the lexical and semantic elements of each metadata model.  Harmony will solve the visibility and understandability challenges and will empower analysts with the ability to leverage semantic discovery, search and retrieval across the net-centric Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) domain.  The overall result will be to improve production, analysis and dissemination of ISR products.",

Previous efforts, which have focused on the use of passive, multi-spectral imaging (MSI) methods to detect, classify, and localize submerged submarines, have been hampered by scene clutter and false alarms due to sea foam.  Including polarization will enhance the multi-spectral techniques by splitting the signal content into polarized and unpolarized bands.  This has the potential to increase detection performance by helping to isolate the surface clutter due to surface reflection of skylight from the scattering of sunlight by white water and the upwelling light from below the surface.  Aret\u00e9 proposes to develop a non real-time algorithm for a robust detection-processing stream suitable for polarimetric MSI.  In its Phase I effort, Aret\u00e9 demonstrated optimal operational geometries and filter selection for Jerlov water-type IB.  This work will be extended to other water types as part of the algorithm development effort in Phase II.  Aret\u00e9\u2019s simulator, a state-of-the-art tool that was demonstrated in Phase I to be consistent with existing data, will be used for algorithm development during Phase II.

Fretting fatigue is seen as one of the controlling factors in the life of aircraft engine components where cyclic loading leads to contact and slip between mating parts.  For instance, the disk/blade assemblies in turbine engines suffer fretting at the dovetail contacts.  In the proposed analysis methodology, an analytical model of fretting fatigue crack nucleation based on the uncracked stresses in the contact region provides the component life up to the point of a measurable crack.  A finite-element-based approach to model the discrete, arbitrary, 3D crack growth from the measurable, initial crack to the point of failure provides a stress intensity factor history and remaining life estimate.  The marriage of the two approaches provides a cradle-to-grave analysis capability for modeling fretting fatigue.  Fracture Analysis Consultants Inc. (FAC) along with Research Applications Inc.

EPAS currently uses 12 spectral filters, one per visible channel, each having separate lenses for collection of visible spectra.  These distinct optics and optical mounts for each channel result in a large and unnecessarily complex system.  By optimizing beamsplitting using a single volume holographic element with spatially or volumetrically multiplexed gratings, the size and weight of collection optics can be greatly reduced.  The advantage of using holographic gratings to optimize beamsplitting lies in the ability to tailor the bandpass, diffraction angle, and output beam characteristics to the specific system.  The ability to multiplex several gratings in one substrate is an added advantage when looking for a multi-spectral beamsplitting solution.  We propose to continue design and testing of a 12-channel optical beamsplitter composed of a series of multiplexed volume holographic gratings which can be tailored to the desired acceptance angle and spectral range of a particular multi-spectral system.",

        "abstract": "In response to OSD/AF SBIR Topic No. OSD06-EP7, we propose to develop a novel and simple approach to packaging high-temperature and high-power SiC modules. The approach, simple to implement and suitable for auto-processing, is proposed to address the problems of (i) the mechanical stress induced degradations such as peeling, cracking, voiding and fracturing due to mismatch of material coefficients of thermal expansion(CTE), (ii) the package material degradation due to operation under high and wide temperature and oxidizing conditions, (iii) the metallurgical incompatibility and interconnect thermal cycling degradation, (iv) the high thermal impedance between device junction and module baseplate, and (v) the parasitic impedance for high frequency operation targeting ultimately up to 250kHz. Double-sided cooling along with hermetical sealing is proposed to achieve the ultimate performance capability of SiC power modules under high and wide temperature conditions. Based on the demonstration of the feasibility of the proposed concept through computer modeling and simulations and through experiments in Phase I,  Phase II will carry out the major R&D work b to develop high power half-bridge phase legs and thin co-packs modules up to 300A for 300C operations. Privately funded Phase III will address auto-processing issues for wide-spread commercialization of the SiC power modules.",

        "abstract": "Intelligence analysts gather and synthesize information from multiple sources in response to both high priority requests and standing topics. Their expertise enables them to evaluate and process information effectively. However, the time they spend searching for relevant information inevitably subtracts from the time available to develop analyses, especially predictions, from those data. As ops tempo accelerates, information overload will only increase; the time spent searching will grow while the time spent analyzing intelligence will decline. The STAR (Semantic Temporal Association Retrieval) system is designed to reverse this trend. STAR will support information triage, analysis, and discovery. It will enable analysts to allocate more of their time to analysis, and directly support them individually and collectively in defining trends and making predictions. STAR combines (1) the latest techniques in latent variable methods for digesting masses of textual data with (2) temporal analysis techniques for making predictions. It uses these methods to automatically compare recent and historical patterns, and support analysts as they judge the probability of future events.  STAR will also provide components of a software infrastructure that will support richer and more effective collaboration among analysts by enabling them to query and build upon each other\u2019s results.",

This C-scan device can be made to investigate undisplaced fractures of the facial bones and extremities and the potential contamination of soft tissue wounds with foreign matter.  Injury with pain and tenderness without fracture could often be treated locally while a facial fracture would require evacuation. Foreign matter in superficial wounds needs to be identified and removed.  Conventional B-mode ultrasound is difficult for the novice to interpret and is incapable of finding fine bone fractures due to the inherent \u201cslice\u201d nature of the scan. X-ray facilities are often limited in forward combat environments.  In addition, x-ray is not sensitive to low Z objects such as aluminum, glass, or plastic foreign objects inside the body. A small, lightweight portable ultrasound system for the identification of undisplaced fractures and foreign matter in soft tissue wounds would aid in the decision for or against medical evacuation.",

        "abstract": "The topology of a network is the set of links between nodes. Topology control is the selection and adjustment of controllable parameters in response to uncontrollable factors such as noise and interference to create and maintain a topology with user-desired characteristics.  For a typical Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET), the set of parameters that are candidates for control include the transmit power, antenna direction and the use of multiple transceivers. Desired characteristics include covertness (minimal power signature) and connectivity/bi-connectivity. These characteristics are generally in conflict with each other, motivating (adaptive) topology control (TC). This Phase II effort will leverage SSCI's Phase I work on power-based topology control for mobile networks to design and evaluate topology control technologies (TCTs) for general MANETs over acoustic channels. Besides improving stealthiness, TC also improves overall network throughput, due to the reduction of channel contention. The following topics will be covered: (1) investigating appropriate metrics for stealthiness; (2) developing TC schemes based on power control, directional antennas and multiple transceivers per node; (3) integrating TC with MANET routing; (4) minimizing power for topology discovery; (5) examining stability issues related to the rates of neighbor discovery update and power control update; (6) designing hybrid schemes combining local and global topology control; (7) implementing and testing of the TCT suite on a high-fidelity acoustic communication environment of interest to DARPA.  BBN Technologies will be a part of the team, providing support in MANET technologies and Phase III commercialization.",

Lack of such calibration systems compromises the quality of the testing, and leads to wasted time and manpower resources used to resolve the ensuing uncertainties. We are developing a compact, reliable, cost-effective soft x-ray and neutron source that can be used to calibrate x-ray and neutron-sensitive detectors and their associated filters for scientific and homeland security applications in both government and commercial laboratories. In Phase I we built a breadboard pulsed x-ray source, optimized its output, and demonstrated its utility for calibrating x-ray detectors. In Phase II we will build a prototype x-ray and neutron source, demonstrating long life and reliability in a system that can be replicated at a reasonable cost.  Outside users will be able to use the system to calibrate their detectors.",

Spatially and/or temporally averaged data found in climatological products is not suitable for ATD modeling. The proposed solution for providing \"typical day\" meteorological data couples innovative search techniques applied to long-range historical archives and standard Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) mesoscale models to recreate a selected historical event identified as representative of typical for a region and season. The search technique demonstrated during Phase 1 focuses on the application of frequency distribution analysis of parameters of relevance to ATD modeling, and can be applied for not only the search for \"typical\" days, but also significant \"atypical\" days that may be of relevance to ATD planners. AER proposes a Phase 2 program in which the search technique is implemented in a production environment to identify typical days for all seasons and locations over the entire globe.  Deliverables will include a complete \"typical day\" dataset suitable for ATD modeling for a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, and an extensible software system for generating similar datasets using alternate input data sources and/or search algorithms.",

Unfortunately, closed head injuries are difficult to detect, and early detection is necessary to improve the treatment and therapy of injured personnel. To address this important and urgent health problem, Intelligent Optical Systems, in collaboration with Prof. Edward Dixon of the University of Pittsburgh, proposes to develop a field test kit to diagnose TBI. Lateral flow assay test strips were designed and developed to measure the concentrations of S100\u0192\u00d2 and NSE. Phase I results show that the concentrations of the biomarkers S100\u0192\u00d2 and NSE correlate negatively with the Glasgow Coma Scale and the Glasgow Outcome Scale. This new assay format provides an easy-to-use format suitable for field-use. In Phase II, we will include additional biomarkers, optimize the test strips fabrication, develop a portable reader, and conduct clinical studies to characterize and validate the test strip performance. The successful completion of this project will result in a device that can be used by military personnel to rapidly diagnose TBI, even in battlefield conditions.",

For the Phase I effort, Mainstream performed a detailed assessment of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) high power amplifiers in Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC), module, and rack form.  The ultimate conclusion is COTS systems meeting the solicitation guidelines for the wideband transmitter (WBT) are not available for direct use or repackaging requiring continued development of MMIC technology.  Additionally, innovative technologies are required to integrate advanced cooling systems with the high power RF technologies and to enable repackaging of the requisite hardware components to fit a standard RF transmitter form factor of the EA-6B/EA-18G aircraft.  Active cooling systems are being developed as a means of lowering junction temperatures, increasing reliability, improving performance, and increasing power density.   In Phase I, Mainstream demonstrated the feasibility of microchannel-based thermal managements systems for removing the waste heat produced by the high powered amplifiers using thermal and hydraulic performance.  In Phase II, Mainstream will work with Navy personnel and systems integrators (e.g. ITT) to develop and demonstrate a full-scale prototype WBT thermal management system and prototype high-power amplifier module.",

The current Phase I SBIR program demonstrated the usefulness of plasma sprayed damping coatings to produce significant damping on Hastelloy X at temperatures between 1000 and 1500 \u00b0F.  Concentrations of as little as 1% high temperature viscoelastic  additives exhibited significant damping. The metal oxide powder blends were successfully plasma sprayed on Hastelloy X test specimens. The coating bond strength and microstructure were essentially unaffected by the incorporation of high temperature viscoelastic materials (VEM's) in the ceramic feed stock.

In particular, the effect of high \u201cg\u201d loads on the mechanical and damping properties of candidate ceramic/VEM blends will be investigated. The Phase II studies will also include damping, fatigue, erosion, and impact testing. Candidate VEM's will be selected to achieve maximum damping over a range of temperatures between 800 \u00b0F and 2000 \u00b0F. The plasma spray process is an accepted method of applying high temperature erosion, corrosion, and heat resistant coatings to jet engine components.

Silicon microfabrication technology developed for the manufacture of electronic integrated circuits can produce these microchips in high volume at low unit cost.  In conjunction with the fabrication of the BioMEMS disposable detection chip, a prototype hand-held portable instrument will be constructed during the Phase II program.

The binder material, such as paraffin wax and Viton-like rubber, are expected to ignite and burn within the expanding fireball while the reactive filler remains at the relatively low temperature at which the binder boils, and thus remains protected from ignition.  Once the binder is consumed, the reactive filler is expected to ignite and burn rapidly.  To ensure rapid reaction, the reactive filler is proposed to comprise nanocomposite powders capable of highly exothermic reaction occurring volumetrically, such as Ti+2B powders recently produced using arrested reactive milling.  The timing of the initiation of the filler can be tailored to specific applications by adjusting the filler/binder ratio.  The sizes or the hybrid powder particles will be relatively large, on the order of 100 \u2013 1000 \u00b5m to ensure complete consumption of the binder and ignition of the reactive filler when the particles emerge from the fireball and mix with surrounding air.

        "abstract": "Impact Technologies LLC, with Honeywell Aerospace as an industry partner, proposes to develop and demonstrate innovative enhancements to existing power assurance methods for the T55-714A engine. The development team will build off the proven success of the Phase I SBIR and Aviation Diagnostic and Engine Prognostic (ADEPT) programs with the goal of prototyping automated and accurate continuous engine power assessment technologies that promise to reduce the incidence of unplanned engine removals due to low power, eliminate pilot burden and human error, and significantly reduce the threat to aircraft and crew for Power Assurance Check (PAC) when new engines or major engine repair has been performed. Specifically, parametric filtering, regime recognition and extrapolation routines enabling automated power assurance tests will be improved and evaluated against data acquired in dedicated T-55 engine tests and through additional Honeywell provided service data. Results will be utilized to significantly mature a Continuous Power Assurance Test (CPAT) module. Software development best practices will be employed to capture and help implement requirements needed to fully realize a practical CPAT system for the Chinooks T-55, and will evaluate limitations or modifications required for a future embedded CPAT solution on the T-55 and other relevant engine platforms. Finally, a ground-based performance prognostic module will be developed to forecast the remaining engine performance life and support condition based maintenance decisions, given the CPAT module results. A demonstration test flight near the program completion is proposed to prove out TRL 7 maturity of the CPAT module installed on a MSD laptop with a serial port connection to the T55 engine controller.",

        "abstract": "Phase I established the initial technical feasibility and economic viability of Dynamet Technology\u2019s Low Cost Feedstock Process (LCFP) for producing casting billet from titanium machine turnings.  Dynamet demonstrated that castings produced from LCFP billet met AMS and ASTM specifications for Grade 5 Ti-6Al-4V castings.  Properties comparable to wrought material were achieved and cost analyses showed significant potential savings in the cost of military and commercial castings over the use of conventional ingot. The Phase II work will involve the scale-up of the process for the production of the full-sized LCFP billets needed to produce selected cast and forged EFV components.  These cast and forged EFV component prototypes will then be manufactured and evaluated.  The evaluation will include nondestructive tests, (e.g. dye penetrant and X-ray), chemical analyses, mechanical tests, metallographic analyses and ballistic tests.  In-depth cost analyses will be performed to verify the cost benefits of the LCFP and to demonstrate that these are benefits are sustainable.  The recycling of titanium machine turning in the United States will be analyzed to demonstrate that there are sufficient sources of supply to support the requirements of the EFV over the long term.",

This study consists of three major components. The first component is to produce a basic 20-year fine-scale ensemble reforecast dataset over the CONUS domain using the WRF-ARW modeling system. The second component is to further develop and examine various MOS-based statistical models that apply to more variables and multiple classes and to refine the Phase I KNN calibration techniques, using the large reforecast sample base, and to compare the two techniques.

New manufacturing and assembly approaches are required to mitigate the excess thermal energy and meet the size, weight, and power (SWAP) design requirements. Current JTRS radio designs problems are not driven by circuit design capabilities but by an inability to package these circuits within the space constraints.  STI Electronics proposes the use of its innovative packaging technology, Imbedded Component/Die Technology (IC/DT), in order to meet the critical design requirements of these size and power constrained radios.

        "abstract": "Materials and Manufacturing Systems, Inc. (MATSYS) proposes to develop a novel manufacturing technique for greatly increasing fine powder yield and improving particle size control by significantly increasing the supersonic gas jet length downstream of the nozzle tip to increase the length of the breakup region and maximize the breakup of the powder.  This objective can be achieved by control of the atomizer chamber pressure.  Typical controlled-atmosphere atomizers operate with chambers at or slightly above atmospheric pressure.  However, if one drops the chamber pressure below atmospheric, one can effectively increase the expansion ratio of the atomizing gas, which produces slightly higher gas velocities and significantly longer supersonic gas jet lengths.  The elongated jet lengths will improve atomization performance in the region well downstream of the nozzle, leading to the sought after high yields of fine particles.  The ability to control the chamber pressure is the key factor that enables us to examine this previously unexplored processing space.  During this program, we will atomize metallic glass compositions, characterize the interaction between chamber pressure and other key atomization parameters, develop the control system to control fine powder yield and particle size, and scale-up the process for cost-effective, high volume production.",

Upon completion of these measurements, we will down select to one antenna for each type, conduct a detailed mechanical design of the selected options, and fabricate and deliver several of each.

The system will provide input to the Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS) as well as to the pilot and the autopilot systems enabling safer, more accurate flight control.

To meet these demanding specifications while overcoming the size, weight, and thermal management problems inherent to slab-based laser technology, we will demonstrate a spectrally beam combined (SBC) fiber laser system that combines the highly efficient power scaling capabilities for fiber SBC with the power-independent beam quality, high electro-optical efficiency, simple thermal management requirements, compact, modular, and flexible packaging, and fully integrated, automatic spectral control of fiber ring oscillators. To scale the power per fiber to the multi-kW level, we will also explore using polarized photonic crystal fibers (PCF), which have enhanced power handling and significantly lower nonlinear effects than standard large-mode-area (LMA) fibers. This approach dramatically reduces the number of fiber lasers, enables power scaling to the 100+ kW level, and improves system robustness.",

        "abstract": "The Department of Defense (DOD) has many requirements for support structures that possess sufficient strength and rigidity for general purpose communications and radar applications. Steel support structures are generally used, but are subject to corrosion and require frequent maintenance. The goal of the topic is to design and develop a composite structure to functionally replace the current steel structures. The design must meet the necessary strength, rigidity, and fatigue requirements while providing superior corrosion resistance and durability. During the Phase I effort, Ebert validated the concept designing a 20 foot tall structure capable of supporting a 20,000 lb. mass and with a natural frequency greater than 5 Hz. In addition, a top equipment support platform was designed to interface the tower with communication or radar antennas. This platform design uses a grid of girders constructed of composite sandwich panel. This results in a rigid platform that effectively transmits the load to the tower legs and maintains the overall 5 Hz. requirement with the load mass centered on the platform. The Phase II effort will produce a demonstration tower constructed of composite pultruded components and assembled and erected on an Air Force designated test site.",

        "abstract": "The Phase I investigation demonstrated the ability to dial the total energy output from a new class on nanoenergetic compositions by altering the shock strength of the initiating charge. The Phase I study laid the groundwork for developing a practical dial- a-yield (DAY) warhead that can deliver a variable total energy output using multiple initiating charges. The technology advance relies upon a unique class of nanoenergetic compositions developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory and further advanced during the Phase I program. These compositions have a high intrinsic energy density, e.g. 28 MJ/cc and release their energy by a very fast (> 2km/s) combustion wave. During the course of the Phase I program, we demonstrated that this class of nanoenergetic compositions outperformed conventional organic explosives in sustained pressure and impulse, i.e. enhanced blast effects.  Furthermore, the Phase II program addresses the dual objectives of developing a DAY technology while assuring that the final product will meet the DoD requirements for insensitive munitions. The objective will be demonstrated with small-scale (10 to 30 g) explosive devices in year-one and will culminate with large-scale (1 to 2 kg), arena-tests in year-two. This prototype warhead will be developed in concert with personnel at AFRL/MN.",

        "abstract": "Electronic component failure occurs at three distinct levels: chip or device level, circuit board, and the interconnection between device and circuit board. Current non-invasive techniques for circuit board testing provide prognostic capabilities and replace the functional stimulus tests employed in electronic component performance evaluation. However, large variations in location, size and elemental composition of printed circuit board components present significant obstacles to comprehensive non-invasive testing of PCBs for failure. To address this problem, in Phase I we investigate and design a suite of multi-resolution, laser-based, non-invasive imaging techniques that utilizes a range of the frequency spectrum consistent with the requirements for probing at the resolutions indicated by the scale of component features. Each technique identifies and characterizes the material faults at a specific level (device, board, or junction) that contribute to failures. These techniques are complementary as they are laser based imaging techniques that expose various levels of resolution and failure modes that are not identifiable with any single technique. Phase II research involves the development of a prototype system containing these test technologies and is suitable for field-use.",

This requires an ultrafast ultra-linear analog-to-digital Converter (ADC) followed by ultrafast digital signal processing, both of which need high-speed clocks. For best performance, the ADC clock must have extremely low short-term jitter. Building on the Phase I development of a family of 30-80 GHz on-chip low-jitter lock sources, we propose to develop X-band and Ka-band digital-RF satellite communication (SATCOM) receivers with on-chip clock. These clock sources, employing resonant long Josephson junction oscillators, exhibit extremely low short-term jitter, estimated to be less than 10 fs (0.01 ps), and therefore, are ideally suited for integration with superconductor ADCs and rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ) digital technology. An integrated on-chip clock source is indispensable for the commercial viability of HYPRES\u2019 envisioned digital-RF receiver and transceiver products. The on-chip clock eliminates the most expensive part of the receiver system, an external high-frequency clock source, and significantly reduces its size, weight, and power consumption.",

The improved interlaminar properties must be obtained with minimal impact on the in-plane properties of the C-C composites.  The most important technical objective that must be achieved to satisfy the primary objective of the proposed program is the successful further development of the concept of the discontinuous carbon fiber reinforcement interleaf material manufactured by Energy Sciences Laboratories, Inc. (ESLI) on San Diego, CA.  The focus of the ESLI reinforcement interleaf material development is to achieve high interlaminar properties, low impact on in-plane properties, manufacturing scale-up to reasonable sizes, and cost affordability.  A measure of success is the magnitude of interlaminar reinforcement properties improvement for similar impact on in-plane properties relative to competing technology such as stretch-broken fabric and needled fabric preforms. To provide the best assessment of the reinforcement interleaf technique to enhanced interlaminar properties, the proposed Phase II effort will procure stretch-broken and needled fabric reinforcement, along with continuous 2D carbon fabrics.  C-C composites will be fabricated using no interlaminar reinforcement, two different types of reinforcement interleaf materials developed and fabricated by ESLI, stretch-broken fabric and needle-punched fabric.  Mechanical property measurements, including both in-plane and interlaminar properties, will be performed to enable an assessment of the improved interlaminar properties and the reductions in in-plane properties associated with all of these composites.  Finally, C-C exit cone designs will be developed for all of these reinforcement methods and their associated composite properties, to determine an analytical assessment of the minimum weight design achieved by the various reinforcement methods.",

Phase-I research indicated through simulation and mathematical analysis, that the FSW will provide a highly secure protocol, encryption and information transparent waveform facilitating secure radio transmission for dynamic, wideband, high speed, self configuring networks.  The technology also provides increased signal orthogonality, permitting multiple FSW and other signals to coexist in the same spectral and physical locations.

        "abstract": "Today, large amounts of critical information, scattered around the battlespace, cannot be located and processed fast enough for timely decision making. The result is poor situational awareness because commanders lack the facts they need. Intelligent software agents are being developed to collect, appraise, and deliver pertinent information to the right component at the right time. Yet these agents lack a common framework to interoperate in battlefield applications. The challenge is to research a common framework that permits legacy, current, and future agents to function together at the tactical battle command level, communicating across a variety of networks, to provide information to decision makers in real time. To address the problem of interoperability in the battle command environment, we will conduct research into and development of an Agent Development Toolkit. This toolkit will consist of an Agent Factory, an agent framework interface, an interface for modifying the functionality of deployed agents, and interoperability tools. This toolkit will allow non-engineers to modify agents that will interoperate with each other, other agent frameworks, and legacy systems. This will allow tactical personnel to tailor agents to react quickly to changing situations such as hostile threats, movement of coalition forces, or modified operation plans.",

        "abstract": "A high-performance cooling system for gimbal-mounted infrared sensors is a critical need for future space-based target acquisition and tracking systems.  A candidate approach uses a high performance cryocooler remotely located on the spacecraft platform combined with a high conductance, cryogenic heat transport system to exchange heat from the sensors to the cryocooler.  The heat transport system must have high conductance, produce minimal parasitic heat loads, and impose minimal torque on the gimbal, in addition to the typical space requirements of light weight, compactness, and reliability.  To meet these challenging requirements, we propose to develop a single-phase gaseous heat transport loop consisting of a miniature cryogenic circulator, ultra-flexible transfer lines, and compact heat exchangers.  The circulator design has heritage in the unit developed by Creare for the Hubble Space Telescope, which has operated at 70 K for over 4.5 years with no change in performance.  During Phase I, we proved feasibility of the concept by (1) producing preliminary designs of candidate heat transport systems for the Space Tracking and Surveillance System, and (2) successfully executing flexibility and life tests on the transfer lines at cryogenic temperatures.  During Phase II, we will build and test the heat transport system at cryogenic temperatures.",

The goal of the Phase I program was to develop separate body wearable antennas for the dual-band (L1/L2) GPS system and the Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS) radio system (420-450 MHz). FIRST RF took an aggressive development approach, and has delivered successful prototype hardware of innovative antenna designs to ARL and PM-Soldier.  Extensive modeling, prototyping, and testing was performed to demonstrate the viability of the proposed candidates, resulting in several prototypes that are pragmatic and can be fielded, tested, and produced very quickly.

These include a frequency response much lower than traditional arrays could ever hope to achieve, a huge bandwidth in excess of 9:1 and potentially even greater, complete elimination of grating lobes throughout the band, and steering of high power RF input into the antenna.  This is all achieved with low loss so that when combined with the high gain, much higher ERP on target is achieved.  The new electronic steering enables new EW capabilities for the Warfighter, such as 360 degree hemispherical coverage, simultaneous servicing of multiple independent targets, and redundancy for reliable mission accomplishment, all while requiring as little as only one EW pod.

The proposed Phase II SBIR builds on a successful feasibility demonstration of the noise-resistance capability of the speech recognition system carried out during the Phase I SBIR project.  The Phase I SBIR project has demonstrated the feasibility of using integrated acoustic/bone-conductive microphones for enhancing the performance of the speech recognizer under noisy environments. We have developed noise-robust speech recognition front-end processing schemes which combine the integrated acoustic/bone-conductive microphones with state-of-art noise-compensation algorithms such as missing-feature reconstruction and direct filtering. Experimental results show that these front-end processing schemes work well for both stationary and non-stationary noises that cannot be compensated by most existing de-noising methods. Extending from the Phase I feasibility study, Phase II work will develop a prototype system that is adapted to the carrier air traffic control application. Basic performance of the prototype system will be determined.

This technology will enable data storage that can be discreetly sanitized by a system operator under duress.  In a manner analogous to burning paper documents and pulverizing their ashes, the technology resulting from this program will use materials and processes whose physics of erasure preempt any possible reconstruction of the original data. These new technology concepts include substitute materials for CD/DVD and hard drives.  Each concept offers a data sanitization mechanism that poses no danger to the operator, can be easily and discreetly actuated, and will render the data irrecoverable.  Phase II development will yield significant advancement in the data protection vital for maintaining the current U.S. leadership in warfare technology.  Data sanitization of magnetic and optical disk has potential to eliminate the loss of governmental, commercial and consumer critical data. The proposed solution would allow untrained people to completely destroy any remnants of data with minimal effort. This would allow for the disposal and recycling of storage components without the fear of stored data being left on the device and compromised by unknown individuals or countries.",

        "abstract": "As defined by SBIR Topic A06-204, Miniature Explosive Pulsed Power for Missiles and Munitions, the objective of this effort is to develop miniature explosive driven pulsed power technologies to power a variety of missile and gun launched payloads. Explosive pulsed power systems consist of those devices that convert the chemical energy of high explosives or propellants into electrical power and condition this power to drive a variety of loads. To achieve the objective of this effort we must develop very compact explosive pulsed power devices capable of generating sufficient power to drive multiple types of payloads. Based on decades of R&D, the best candidate for this power supply is the Helical Magnetocumulative Generator (MCG), or a Helical Flux Compression Generator (FCG). However, recent research has established that when the diameter of these generators decreases below 50.8 mm (2 inches), they produce no current or energy gain. Therefore, the focus of our research effort is to develop alternative FCG designs and their associated power conditioning technologies that will produce current and energy gains when their diameters are as small as 25.4 mm (1 inch) (Fig. 1 is a  diagram of a conceptual application of such a power supply). During our Phase I effort, Loki has been examining alternative geometrical designs and power conditioning technologies in order to determine the best means of developing these miniature, high current generators in later phases of the project.",

        "abstract": "This proposal is for a program that will develop a fully-functional multibiometric sensor based on multispectral imaging of the hand. Four distinct biometric signals will be collected for each hand insertion: fingerprints (4 + partial thumbprint), palmprints, skin textural characteristics, and hand shape. The multispectral aspect of the sensor provides a very robust and reliable means to collect each of the biometric sources of signal. Algorithms for biometric feature extraction and matching will be developed for each of the individual biometric sources. Score-level multibiometric fusion will be used to combine these four different biometric information sources to provide an overall matching score. One method of multibiometric fusion that will be tested is based on the quality of the individual biometric images. Therefore a component of this program will be focused on establishing suitable quality measures for each of the four biometrics contained in the whole-hand data.  Based upon the excellent results generated by a proof-of-concept device generated in the first phase of this effort, it is anticipated that the multibiometric whole-hand sensor will achieve extremely high levels of biometric performance. A relatively large multi-person study will be conducted to estimate the performance characteristics of the full system.",

The CBP design is a special configuration of our existing COMLNK Hardware Platform(CHP), an FPGA-based rapid prototyping system used to develop strategic military transceivers.  Both the CBP and the CHP exploit \"software modem\" concepts formulated over two decades of high-fidelity digital transceiver emulation work funded by the Defense Nuclear Agency, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and the Missile Defense Agency.  The CHP has an FPGA-based direct IF signal converter with ADCs and DACs running at 500 Msps rate.  This firmware will be reused and adapted for the CBP to synthesize (and capture) the digital signal streams passing into (and out of) the cryogenic direct RF converter currently being developed under CERDEC sponsorship.  The CBP firmware will also implement all pertinent digital transceiver signal and data processing: waveform generation functions (e.g., error correction encoding, modulation); and receiver baseband signal processing functions (e.g., carrier acquisition, frequency tracking , bit  synchronization, demodulation) and post-detection receiver functions (e.g., frame synchronization, error correction decoding). The CBP design will also include a specialized digital interface to the direct RF converter subsystem.",

        "abstract": "Global Technology Connection, Inc., in collaboration with University of Michigan-Dearborn (Vetronics Institute), Auburn University (GPS and Vehicle Dynamics Laboratory), and industrial partner, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control Systems, proposes to develop a prototype hierarchical fault tolerant control architecture for UGVs experiencing mobility failures. The architecture includes modules such as world and UGV modeling through an object-oriented framework, health assessment through novel diagnostic and prognostic algorithms, decision support through goal modification, vehicle path planning, and low-level control reconfiguration.  At the top level of the architecture, the UGV mobility health state is assessed through diagnostic and prognostic failure detection, identification, and prediction system; an object-based world model is constructed describing terrain, obstacles, etc.; and a goal modification module determines appropriate control actions due to UGV mobility failures.  A path planner is then used at the mid-level to generate appropriate UGV mobility trajectories based on the world model and UGV health state.  At the low-level, an adaptive controller continually estimates UGV model parameters to provide robust tracking of the generated path.  The proposed system will provide the remote UGV user with selectable path planning and operating mode options when mobility failures are present allowing for improved situational awareness, prolonged vehicle life, and greater mission success rates.  During Phase II, we will develop a working prototype by first testing the system off-line with data collected from the facilities provided by Auburn University and data provided by our industrial partners for a wheel/hub/motor mobility subsystem.  After sufficient performance has been achieved, Beta testing will commence with on-line integration with the experimental facilities. Technology will be transitioned to commercial applications in Phase III to military Future Combat Systems, NASA future space vehicles, automotive manufacturers, UAV, Emergency Medical Systems, automated farming equipment, etc.",

        "abstract": "A key challenge for future immersive mission rehearsal and training systems is the control of computer-generated opposing and supporting friendly forces. Currently, large numbers of personnel (or pucksters) are required to control computer-generated forces (CGFs), especially in simulated urban environments.  In deployed settings, particularly for rehearsals at the platoon or squad level, pucksters are not generally available nor are the control mechanisms intuitive to use. In this phase II effort we propose to develop a game-like interface that will allow intuitive, real-time control of small groups of synthetic forces.  Driving this interface will be a lightweight Group Behavior Engine (GBE) based on subject matter expert descriptions of coordinated group behaviors and informed by group research.  Virtual Puckster will reduce the cognitive demands placed on pucksters who need to control the behaviors of small groups of CGFs, freeing them up to focus on higher-level training or mission rehearsal goals. Our approach combines gaming insights for easy-to-control entities with unique technology to embed training objectives in simulation scenarios.  In Phase II Virtual Puckster will be implemented to work in DARPA\u2019s RealWorld but will be architected to be easily adaptable to other environments.",

The simulation will be based on special effects technologies and will realistically simulate visual, auditory, haptic and olfactory aspects such that the medic can be desensitized to traumatic injuries in order to perform more effectively and efficiently. In Phase II, a prototype of the TraumaSKINS product will be constructed, evaluated and refined through testing that will involve both developmental testing by our panel of medical experts in military and civilian medical training. Phase II will also involve human factors analysis of the prototype construction process in order to identify specific areas for Phase III manufacturing research and development.

To further avoid position degradation due to latency and satellite blockage and for continuous reliable position estimate we integrate GPS position data with INS. In phase II, after developing a hardware prototype of integrated INS/GPS we will build a small network of INS/GPS nodes to evaluate our algorithm in a live test.

Currently, the behavior models that control Ground Soldiers in most M&S efforts are fairly simple, relying predominantly on behavior scripting and simple rules. As a result, many critical perception, inference, and association (PIA) skills are not modeled. This limitation degrades the realism of the models and any conclusions drawn from the simulation-based studies. We propose a three-part approach to addressing this challenge. First, we will develop a PIA runtime technology for simulating PIA skills in constructive simulation systems. Second, we will work with subject matter experts to build a library of common PIA models. Third, we will develop an authoring tool for creating PIA models beyond those included in the initial library. During our Phase I effort, we identified inference/production rules as being well-suited to Ground Soldier PIA skill modeling. We will develop the Graphical Authoring Tool for Inference Rules (GATIR), which will extend existing modeling and simulation tools to better support the modeling of Ground Soldier PIA skills.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have seen an increase in the use of model-based languages and associated tools for the development of embedded and distributed systems. The same period has also seen the development of a number of analysis tools for embedded systems. Each of these tools has its own modeling language, often with complicated and subtle semantics. In addition many are proprietary. As a consequence, there are only a handful of vendors that provide tools capable of importing and analyzing models in those languages. This situation gives rise to technical challenges: how to integrate these tools, and how to generate high-quality code from models to reduce hand-transformation. From a commercial perspective the challenge is to transform the market from proprietary tool chains with little interoperability to an open standard architecture. The Kestrel Technology SW Metro project will address both the technical and the commercial challenges. The former will be handled by an architecture and a language that supports semantic integration of models.

The predicted improvements in velocity resolution come from increased well depths of state-of-the-art CCD cameras, which enable a greater range of photonic signal levels with an associated increase in signal-to-noise ratio, and from the use of continuous-wave (cw) lasers that allow signal averaging to eliminate speckle noise. PDV is ideally suited to large flow fields, since the technique does not require individual seed particles to be resolved, so the observation ranges are limited only by the signal levels obtained. Commercially available high-power, single-mode cw lasers now provide large enough signals for the extended ranges needed to cover large flow fields.

In Phase I, we achieved our key objectives to develop sensor configurations and processing algorithms to enable the system to reliably detect obstacles through foliage and through rain and snow.  A unique feature of our approach is the use of polarimetric radar to distinguish foliage from solid objects.  Common types of foliage (tall grass, open fields, crop fields) provide strong radar returns for vertically-polarized radar pulses and weak radar returns for horizontally-polarized radar pulses.  In contrast, objects such as rocks reflect radar roughly equally regardless of pulse orientation.   By computing the differential reflectivity of the target object, we expect to reliably distinguish vertically-oriented vegetation from other solid objects.  During Phase II, we will build two fully-integrated Daredevil PackBot prototypes with multisensor payloads (UWB radar sensors, LIDAR, stereo vision, and INS/GPS).

Currently fielded small robots are typically suited for only a few mission profiles.  Our High-Speed Inspection Robot (HSIR) design, validated in Phase I though feasibility simulations, fuses high-speed (40 KPH) reconnaissance capability of a MARCbot, the hands-on inspection capability of a TALON, and the maneuverability of an ODIS.  The JAUS-based, modular design supports various payloads, including our low-cost Small Robot Toolkit (SRT) manipulator with plug-n-play end-effectors, our more agile Dexterous Manipulation System (DMS) manipulator, various sensors, and auxiliary power sources such as micro-diesel engines.  A JAUS-based OCU with COTS game controller serves as the interface for the HSIR.  The modular design allows the vehicle to be utilized for various missions including Military EOD, Reconnaissance, and HazMat.  The Phase II effort will prove the manufacturability and practicality of the HSIR through system prototypes, and validates the usability through end-user testing in experimental and/or operational settings.",

However, tele-operated and pre-FCS legacy systems will need to be upgraded to be sophisticated and \u201cintelligent\u201d enough to interact within FCS. A practical pathway to achieve such upgrades is to add the required functionality into Operator Control Units (OCUs), leaving the vehicles themselves unchanged while providing operators with high level commands that better match desired tasking. In Phase I, the Soar Technology team designed, implemented, and demonstrated an initial version of the Task Examination, Aggregation and, Learning (TEAL) concept to develop higher-level commands from observed sequences of existing unmanned vehicle commands, incorporating user command validation to ensure that newly added commands are useful. For Phase II, we will transform the TEAL approach demonstrated in Phase I into a robust, independent reasoning software module with a well-defined application programming interface (API) that can be usefully and easily integrated into a wide variety of OCUs, produced by multiple OCU vendors, and will demonstrate the TEAL functionality used in the control of physical robots.",

A primary goal of this project is to establish that; when all technical capabilities of the proposed TD-THz gauge system and all aspects of total life-cycle costs are considered, customers will realize a significant return on investment by replacing existing nuclear source gauges with the proposed TD-THz instruments. Nuclear source gauges (such as beta and gamma) are used in industrial process monitoring and control, often to measure thickness or mass in paper, plastics, rubber, and food stuffs in manufacturing and packaging. A system based on low power non-ionizing TD-THz measurements will be developed which can replace multiple types of nuclear source gauges in all of these applications. A time of flight THz measurement system will have similar or superior capabilities, with micron thickness resolution, less than 1 mm lateral resolution and measurement times as fast as 250 microseconds.

Reactive materials can be used against Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), chemical and biological agents, rockets, artillery and mortar (RAM) threats, land and naval mines, missiles, armor, underground facilities, and more.  The results of the Phase I program were very encouraging in terms of demonstrating enhanced penetration and creation of larger holes in steel plates of 3/8\u201d and \u00bd\u201d thickness by reactive projectiles. Comparisons were made between inert steel projectiles and projectiles carrying reactive materials of several compositions. Penetration was possible with both of these projectiles at velocities of ~ 1 km/sec and 3 km/sec. The interesting difference was that the reactive(s) produced larger holes and thermal effects useful in combusting explosive payloads. Modeling performed under the same conditions predicted similar results. General Sciences, Inc. (GSI) will demonstrate the benefits of reactive material technology to the U.S. Army and will demonstrate the potential methods of incorporation of reactive materials into current and next generation Army munitions systems. GSI has developed a casting method to incorporate suitable reactive materials within a support matrix, creating strong, reactive structures that can replace inert mass non-parasitically and lead to an increase in lethality. GSI formulations have been incorporated into thermobaric devices, agent defeat warheads, reactive fragments, reactive projectiles, anti-land mine systems, shaped charge liners, and several other areas of interest to the DoD. GSI will supply devices and technical knowledge to the U.S. Army to increase the database of reactive materials and provide the U.S. Army with next generation munitions payloads capable of enhanced lethality effects.

        "abstract": "The accumulation of ethylene in the transport and storage of fresh produce is an important problem for the US Army and for commercial agriculture. Certain fruits and vegetables generate ethylene as a natural part of their ripening cycle. Other fruits and vegetables are highly sensitive to the presence of ethylene, but may or may not produce the ethylene themselves. Small amounts of ethylene can induce fruit ripening, produce undesirable changes to flavors (bitterness), color (yellowing or browning), and texture (softening), and increase susceptibility to disease.  The amount of ethylene that produces undesired characteristics varies, but concentrations in the range of 0.1-10 ppm can produce a significant effect.   This proposal presents an opportunity to support the Army in its efforts to enhance the quality of fresh produce delivered to its troops around the world. Specifically, this proposal aims to control ethylene produced by fresh fruits and vegetables (FF&V) in refrigerated containers with the use of a novel Ethylene Elimination Unit (EEU). The Phase II objectives are to: refine the technology developed during Phase I; fabricate and demonstrate an advanced prototype; verify that desired performance is met; deliver a report;  and provide a prototype to support Army technical and field testing.",

        "abstract": "Present sonobuoys require manual selection and verification of functions such as RF Channel, Depth, etc. with selection and verification impossible while the sonobuoys are loaded in the launcher or in the storage racks onboard.  The capability to select and verify functions while the sonobuoys are loaded in the launcher or in onboard storage racks would save time and permit more operational flexibility permitting in-situ adjustments in a constantly-changing tactical environment.  This could be accomplished using a direct operator interface to the multi-mission maritime aircraft (MMA) mission computer for all on-board launchers as well as storage racks. A wireless, battery-operated, handheld device useable in low light conditions that can interface to a standard personal computer (PC) could be used to facilitate individual buoy interrogation and set up.  SEA CORP investigated and evaluated the potential of several wireless technological alternatives that would permit wireless programming via a handheld or rack-mounted device and concluded that infrared would prove the optimum data transfer method.  Evaluation criteria included cost-effectiveness, PC interface, adaptability to the MMA, reliability and the ability to operate in various environments while minimizing interference with organic aircraft systems.",

We will build out the results of our Phase I algorithm development efforts and integrate them into a fully transportable HMI mockup. The mockup will provide an open architecture that can interoperate with advanced BMDS algorithms being developed under this and other efforts.  This mockup will provide four key benefits. First, it will be used to develop and refine HMI screens to support operator functions and capabilities.  Secondly, it will be used for HMI developers to collaborate and test their interfaces in an open environment. Thirdly, it will provide algorithm developers a forum for evaluating operator interactions with the algorithms (for understanding the human component of the data fusion process) and for refining the format in which their algorithms provide information to the HMI components. Finally, it will provide heavyweight and lightweight simulation capabilities for testing algorithms in an integrated environment. This effort, with advanced fusion algorithms and a strong prime contractor partner, provides the opportunity to develop and deploy an HMI mockup for advanced algorithm evaluation from the entire MDA research community.",

AT technology is used to protect critical technology from being reverse engineered.  Tamper detection mechanisms consist of switches or sensors.  An innovative power source is needed to provide latent power to these systems, which require a constant low amount of power over the life of the fielded system and short-term high power to activate a response when tampering is detected.  The power source needs to last >10 years, be radiation hard and operate in extreme temperature conditions of -55 to +95\u00baC. Utilizing semiconductor devices called betavoltaics, Qynergy has developed a unique technology that converts energy from beta-emitting radioisotopes into usable power.  This QynCell\u2122 is capable of delivering small amounts of power (micro to milliwatts) for long periods of time.  The QynCell is a solid state device and is hence capable of operating under the extreme temperature conditions necessary for anti-tamper applications.  The QynCell would be integrated with a battery or a capacitor to create a hybrid power source called a QynPack\u2122, which would provide both the constant low amount of power for the AT sensor and the short high burst power for the response system.",

At the same time, the issues of antenna coupling and avoidance of EMI must be addressed. Given the lack of space, the most viable solution is to reduce the number of antennas by increasing their functionality. Increasing functionality, however, requires extending the bandwidth and incorporating complex radiating structures that meet a longer list of requirements. Ideally multi-band operation will be accomplished with a concomitant reduction in size, weight, and profile without sacrificing optimum performance. For this program, the Spectra team will apply new and advanced antenna design technologies toward solving the challenge of designing small, multi-function antennas that reduce the space, weight, and drag, while addressing the issues of intra-antenna interference.

The Testbed evolution will consist of development spirals, the first of which will address issues relevant to near term needs of emerging advanced Navy radars, such as those which are faced with the significant challenge to detect very low observable threats across a wide range of stressing clutter, jamming, and interference environments. Future spirals will allow for insertion of advanced radar concepts and/or technologies, especially in areas such as state-of-the-art array architectures and advanced signal processing. During Phase I, the feasibility of the Testbed concept was successfully demonstrated via the creation of an initial version of the Testbed capable of generating simulated clutter returns for site specific environments, the results of which were shown to coincide with vector shoreline data and terrain features.",

        "abstract": "TIAX, in partnership with Cascade Designs Inc. (CDI), propose to develop and deliver to the Army up to 100 high efficiency Heat Exchanger Cups (HEXC).  The HEXC will achieve over 60% thermal efficiency when used with the Capillary Force Vaporizer (CFV) stove, which CDI has developed and is producing.  The HEXC, in combination with the CFV stove, provides the warfighter unmatched efficiency and compactness in a JP-8 fueled stove to heat water for beverages, dehydrated rations, and hygiene.  The high efficiency of the HEXC with the CFV stove gives the warfighter at least 50% more heating capacity for the same space and weight than with current cold-weather canteen cups.  This means the warfighter can stay on mission 50% longer without refueling.  In addition to the high performance of the HEXC with the CFV stove, the HEXC significantly improves water heating efficiency with current squad stoves.  The HEXC offers this performance in a durable design that stows compactly with the CFV stove. Phase I of this project developed and demonstrated a preliminary design for the HEXC that achieved 55% thermal efficiency while maintaining low emissions.  Phase II this project, proposed here, will further increase the thermal efficiency of the HEXC by optimizing its heat transfer area with a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model validated to predict the HEXC performance on the CFV stove.  Through CDI up to 100 \u201cworks-like, looks-like\u201d HEXC prototypes will be built.  These HEXC prototypes will allow the Army to field test and evaluate the HEXC.",

        "abstract": "While the need for effective millimeter wave (mmW) imaging systems is clear, there remains a significant gap in the technology needed to realize it, namely the ability to process and enhance mmW imagery in a real-time manner. This is particularly important because raw mmW images appear very fuzzy, are color mapped, and have regions of intensity that are not normally associated with visible and IR images (such as metals being brighter than thermal objects). For this reason, significant processing is necessary in order to (1) improve the resolution of the captured image, (2) reconstruct the image in the case of a sparse aperture system, (3) compensate for motion during imaging (since most mmW imaging systems have relatively long integration times), and (4) provide adequate region screening and visual mapping.  To overcome these limitations, we will develop a novel hardware accelerated processor specific for mmW imaging systems.  In the Phase I effort we will survey possible techniques and analyze their suitability for being mapped onto a hardware accelerator.  Initial implementations will be performed and preliminary results will be obtained on the mmW system currently being built at the University of Delaware.",

Mainstream demonstrated that pressure generated by the chemical heating reaction could drive nano-filtration, as well as heat the water to over 150\u00b0F, with a clean water flux equivalent to 12 fluid ounces in 15 minutes.  Biocide formulations, if needed, were also developed to augment the disinfection of the non-potable water.  A flexible pouch proof-of-concept device was also demonstrated, and various food rations were hydrated with water heated by the chemical reaction.

Current gyroscopes that meet these constraints have ARW performance that is orders of magnitude worse than what high-resolution LOS stabilization requires, while gyros that meet the ARW performance targets are large and have poor environmental sensitivity. IFOS team-members are pioneers in the development of Fiber-Optic Gyroscopes (FOGs), and propose to develop new FOGs that can meet the needs of LOS stabilization.

        "abstract": "21st Century Technologies presents this Phase II SBIR effort, entitled: Security Policy Enforcement and Compliance System (SPECS).  SPECS is a framework for managing security policy on super-sized, diverse and dynamic networks.  SPECS automates policy management by encoding policies in an ontology to facilitate automated enforcement given operational requirements.  By linking policies to the controls that enforce them, SPECS can rapidly deploy existing policies into new or changing operational environments, and it can update existing environments in response to changes in the policies themselves.  This end-to-end modeling also enables SPECS to quickly assess compliance for assured levels of network security. Building on the foundation of the Phase I effort, the SPECS Phase II effort will focus on the domain of information security policy management.  Through discussion with subject matter experts, 21CT has recognized that a technology to provide automated information security policy management has extraordinary marketability not only within the DoD, but commercially to companies of all levels, from small business to multi-national corporations.  Despite this focus, the SPECS solution is designed to cover many aspects of computer security.",

Current equipment operates on JP8 and employs separate heat and electric power generation devices. The intent of this program is to screen concepts and complete a preliminary design of an innovative Combined Heat and Power System (CHPS) that employs a microturbine generator with exhaust heat recovery, afterburning, and a thermal fluid heat exchanger, and that can operate on alternative fuel sources, from waste-gasifier process gas to JP8. This design has the potential for achieving significantly improved overall efficiency, fuel flexibility and compact packaging. The recuperated microturbine generator on which this system is based is market-competitive in electric power efficiency and much more compact than other available generation devices rated below 25 KWe. The resultant design is expected to be a compact CHPS module that can operate on a wide range of fuels and that will help standardize the delivery of power to military field units.",

This system reliably detected anomalies throughout composite thickness from one side.  Both simulated and actual retired radomes were tested. Other Phase I experiments show that correctly applied radome paints, as well as previous repairs that passed FFR testing, do not cause false positives. Phase II work includes further refinements of the prototype, ruggedization, field trials at radome repair facilities (both commercial and military) and a complete commercialization strategy.

The complexities of aircraft structure and uniqueness of damage creates a formidable challenge to develop a comprehensive tool that standardizes the repair design process.  However, rapid advances in computer aided engineering (CAE) technology in the last decade make it possible to achieve substantial improvements in reliability and efficiency.  For standardized stress analysis procedures, closed-form solutions can be replaced by FEA-based solutions providing a more accurate solution of the real problem.

        "abstract": "In today\u2019s Urban-Warfare C2ISR environment, all UAS platforms have an operationally-limited sensor capability with power consumption and recharge times that are a major problem making them unsuitable for many battlefield environments.  Much of the research done to date has concentrated on minimizing the size of the UAS to minimize the battery power required to complete a mission.  There is now another possible solution, the development of unique and innovative unmanned sensor system capable of long-endurance, and non-traditional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (NTISR).  DRA is developing a power harvesting enabled UAS capable of carrying a variety of payloads and fulfilling a variety of layered sensing mission requirements. By providing a UAS platform with a self-refueling capability that utilizes available power sources (overhead power lines) for recharging this new class of UAS will present a unique technical solution for persistent ISR vehicles.  DRA\u2019s UAS will perform C2ISR-type missions providing virtually unlimited persistence.  These new UAS platforms could operate in any environment for a nearly indefinite amount of time with little to no \u201creturn-to-base\u201d cycles required and would provide \u201cAn Unblinking Eye all of the Way to the Ground!\u201d  BENEFIT: Persistent ISR has been identified numerous times as an area of critical importance to the DoD and other organizations.  Development of a UAS sensor platform that can supply extreme endurance through an autonomous recharging capability would be marketable to both the DoD and to various commercial sectors.  These UAS platforms could be used in law enforcement, immigration control, geographical surveying, remote/environmental studies, power line/pipeline maintenance, security in remote areas, as well as for many other applications.   The development of the Phase II prototype will provide an opportunity to demonstrate a representative power harvesting UAS sensor platform that is capable of performing non-traditional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (NTISR) for a nearly indefinite period of time in the field.  The engineering aspects and results will be transferable to a future phase of UAS sensor system development to provide a fully autonomous power line sensing and landing capability. After developing a self-refueling UAS, another feature that a future development effort could achieve is to develop a morphing technique that would camouflage the UAS.  Autonomous operation of a UAS sensor platform could be transitioned into many possible commercial sectors and military programs. A few of the commercial applications that would benefit from a sustained airborne surveillance presence include border patrol, Agriculture, Merchant Marine & Shipping, Entertainment/News/Media applications, Railway/Pipeline/Power line monitoring, Commercial/business security, Aerial Surveying, and Search and Rescue Support.",

First responders and emergency health workers would require a biological dosimetric test for radiation exposure that is rapid, accurate, and non-invasive. The opportunity: a mobile breathalyzer could potentially provide a non-invasive radiation bio-dosimeter by measuring volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the breath that are biomarkers of oxidative stress. The rationale: Radiation exposure results in increased oxidative stress. Hydroxyl radicals are generated by ionizing radiation either directly by oxidation of water, or indirectly by the formation of secondary partially reactive oxygen species (ROS). These compounds cause lipid peroxidation of cell membranes, liberating volatile n-alkanes and their metabolites that are excreted in the breath. Results of the Phase I research provided proof of principle that irradiation in humans resulted in significant changes in breath VOCs consistent with increased oxidative stress The proposed research: In Phase II, we will establish the dose-effect relationships between irradiation and changes in the breath test, and to determine the time relationships of these changes.",

This proficiency requires extensive training in the use of active sonar.  At the same time, our Navy is under tremendous pressure to minimize the impact of active sonar transmissions on marine mammals. There has been a significant amount of negative press in the last few years purportedly linking the use of active sonar to incidents of marine mammal strandings. Although there has been no causal links established, the perception is negative and the Navy has had to take steps to counter the perception.  Training opportunities are infrequent and costly. The effectiveness of these opportunities must be maximized. In the recent past, attention has been focused on protection of marine mammals with little regard for the impact on ASW effectiveness. A balance must be restored.

In the mature MAELSTROM, solid fuel regression rate sensors will provide feedback to the closed-loop oxidizer controller.  In addition to high mass fraction and high combustion efficiency, MAELSTROM will provide safe, highly-flexible boost propulsion with deep throttling capability for large thrust turndown ratios and efficient energy management.",

Typical vehicle climate control systems are large refrigerant-based systems that are not man portable.  SOCOM expressed a desire for cooling equipment that is man portable for short periods of time (~3 hours) during dismounted operations. Phase I of this effort focused primarily on developing and integrating technologies to document a baseline, personnel and electronics cooling system design that addressed the environmental and physiological challenges of extremely hot conditions. This system had to be be lightweight, low volume, man-portable, free of compressed gas, low power, and capable of cooling on-board communications equipment during mounted operations.

        "abstract": "Solar production of hydrogen from water, photoelectrolysis, offers a renewable route to clean, high quality hydrogen for portable field devices, ground support vehicles, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Photoelectrochemical production of hydrogen can eliminate a logistics stream needed to produce and transport hydrogen, lessen the amount of diesel fuel (JP-8) needed for generators, reduce noise and emissions, and limit heat signatures. Despite the benefits of photoelectrolysis, the efficiencies of current state-of-the-art systems (12-18%) are not adequate to meet Air Force needs. During the Phase I project, Lynntech developed an innovative high efficiency hybrid photoelectrolysis system that overcomes the low efficiencies of metal oxide-based photoanodes and avoids photocorrosion problems of high efficiency semiconductors. This technology has the potential to yield photoelectrolysis systems with major breakthroughs in performance compared with existing systems. During the Phase II project, Lynntech will develop and scale-up a photoelectrolysis system capable of an overall solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of greater than 25 % under simulated solar conditions (AM 1.5 G). The performance of the system under varied solar conditions and over 500 hours of operation will be determined. A prototype photoelectrochemical hydrogen system will be fabricated and demonstrated to Air Force personnel.",

This proposal details an FPGA implementable, advanced wideband algorithm that truly models the entire frequency spectrum and linearly tracks statistical source covariance changes over frequency. This is achieved by using a technique called derivative based updating (DBU). The novel aspect of this algorithm is its application in the frequency domain to track jammer source variations in angle as a function of frequency. This algorithm is compared with a traditional subband ECCM technique for multiple jamming scenarios.  While the algorithm may be applied regardless of the front-end hardware design, front-end array hardware recommendations are recommended in this proposal.  Finally, a brief section on stretch processing is presented. Stretch processing allows a wideband radar with an LFM waveform to actually sample slower than the Nyquist frequency at the expense of range swath.",

This relies on a suite of advanced signal processing algorithms that can exploit the unique phenomenology from each sensor in the suite, fuse this data to improve performance, and cue an operator with a high confidence detection of targets. Under this Phase II SBIR program, ISL and DMT will develop an unmanned aerial vehicle hosted sensor suite and associated algorithms that exploits multiple phenomenologies to detect, identify, track and geolocate targets. The focus of this effort is a sensor suite using radio frequency and electro-optical and infra-red sensors along with automatic sensor cueing, automatic target classification, tracking, and prioritization to minimize human decision making.

        "abstract": "Cavitation peening is a novel method of inducing deep residual compressive stresses in metal components to enhance fatigue life and improve damage tolerance.  The process involves sweeping ultra-high pressure waterjets over the surface of the part to be peened so that the cavitation bubbles form and collapse on the workpiece.  The shock of the collapsing bubbles causes the formation of beneficial residual compressive stresses.  Measurements of these stresses has shown that they extend much deeper into the material than is possible to achieve with conventional shot peening.  Phase I results showed that the process works very well with carburized gears, improving the bending fatigue endurance limit from 90,000 psi to 135,000 psi stress level.  The Phase II program proposes to build on this success by peening carburized gears for the V-22 program and quantifying the improved fatigue life.  This low-cost peening method could improve transmission reliability by increasing fatigue life and reducing notch sensitivity of highly stressed transmission components.  Success in this area will likely lead to other applications for the process.",

        "abstract": "The remote identification of surfaced swimmers in a harbor environment is a critical requirement for a comprehensive waterside security system.  This requirement can be clearly divided into detection and classification objectives.  Detection in this context means identifying the presence of a target on the surface of the water.  Classification means discriminating between different types of targets - specifically, discriminating between swimmers on the surface and non-swimmer targets. In Phase I, Barron Associates, Inc. collaborated with L-3 Communications Klein Associates to develop highly-effective baseline automatic swimmer recognition (ASR) algorithms.  The baseline ASR algorithms were demonstrated using a diverse set of radar data that included images of swimmers and other small targets, such as birds, buoys, and floats.  Barron Associates extracted features from the radar images and classification algorithms to identify swimmers.  The ASR algorithm achieved perfect classification of the radar targets in closed-set tests and, importantly, achieved excellent classification performance in open-set tests. The objectives of this Phase II SBIR effort are to:  (1) implement the algorithms and supporting software for online, near real-time operation; (2) evaluate the algorithms in adverse environmental conditions; and (3)enhance the algorithms to incorporate additional sensor data, such as multiple radars, video/thermal images, and sonar signals.",

Due to the early successes and benefits shown by these systems, new platforms such as JSF will have even more comprehensive Prognostic Health Monitoring (PHM) capabilities. These systems generate enormous amounts of data on component and subsystem operation and health. A key issue that has emerged is that the volume of data produced by these systems is now greater than the capacity of the human analysts to review it.  Clearly, as the number of aircraft equipped with HUMS and PHM continues to increase, there is a critical need to automate analysis of this data. In addition, the vast quantities of aircraft health data that are archived after flight represent a potential gold mine of information on the fleet. During Phase I, Sentient developed a prototype AutoReasoner software package that automatically processes flight data using sophisticated data fusion and reasoning logic to produce actionable information on state-of-health at the LRU level.  This software was successfully demonstrated using HUMS data from the H-60 rotorcraft. In Phase II, Sentient will extend the capabilities of this AutoReasoner to include command level readiness information, and will develop data mining tools to scan the database post-flight and assess PHM system performance, emerging trends, and bad actors.

In Phase I, New Span Opto-Technology, Inc. has demonstrated a novel concept based on multiple protective mechanisms using photosensitive hybrid-layered structure for threshold-capable broadband sensor/eye protection. We have established the feasibility of broadband protection against high-power nanosecond laser pulses that can be tuned in real time from 400 to 2400 nm. The film-like device with large clear aperture has minimum effect on data capture during the laser exposure, while it provides wide field-of-view protection of almost 180 degrees. The device also has large dynamic range of energy protection against various lasers from low-power CW to high-power pulsed. In Phase II, we will improve our design based on our successful Phase I work, and develop a low-cost, reliable prototype to meet Phase II performance requirements. Another milestone in Phase II is to pass actual field test to support military and civil sensor/eye protection applications.",

        "abstract": "Aeroservoelastic analysis has achieved a high degree of maturity, covering all flight phases, while the important ground contact phase is not developed to the same degree of fidelity.  This requires modeling the landing gear and its associated systems to an improved level of detail, to be interfaced with the aircraft aeroservoelastic models, enabling dynamic interactions and loads to be analyzed with confidence.  It is proposed to address these landing gear modeling issues, including all phases of ground contact and runway properties, for application to design and test evaluation requirements.  Provision for including the flight control and propulsion systems will be made.  Stirling Dynamics has substantial landing gear methodology currently available, and will adapt and extend these methods for this SBIR project.  The models will be fully non-linear and suitable for time domain evaluation, with conversion to frequency domain by Fast Fourier Transform for assessment of rough runway response.  Options will be provisioned for use of different aeroelastic codes in the eventual simulations.  Phase II will continue development of the landing gear models and software, and will integrate the models with selected CFD codes, which will be adapted to account for ground effects and the aerodynamics of the extended landing gear.",

        "abstract": "Information dominance has become an essential component of military operations with tactical thinking focused on the \u2018see first, understand first, act first, finish decisively\u2019 principle. Of critical importance is the military\u2019s ability to use its sensor resources in the most relevant and effective manner possible to maintain information dominance in modern, dynamic tactical situations. Because the number of potential targets greatly exceeds surveillance assets available, it is crucial that there be some means for effective deployment and management of sensor assets throughout an engagement. This requires advanced resource and sensor tasking management capable of addressing scheduling needs in the face of a dynamic tactical situation. Here, we propose a system for Argumentation-based Negotiation for Automated Sensor Tasking (ANAST), an integrated video analysis and sensor management tool, to meet the challenge of this dynamic resource allocation problem. Argumentation-based negotiation addresses general resource allocation through dialogues between multiple competing tasks. Negotiation works continuously, providing dynamic adaptation to changes in the mission environment so that the resulting sensor tasking schedule fully integrates environment changes and the impact of schedule changes within the decision-making process. Furthermore, the incorporation of computer vision-based video analysis automatically identifies moving objects and creates tracking tasks from raw video.",

These integrated technologies are primary focused on axial propulsion systems, as rotomolding is best suited for symmetrical components such as the internal insulation on an axial motor.  Due to its zero-erosion characteristics, the HfC exhibits less particulate and better mission assurance as compared to Kevlar-filled EPDM, and therefore would benefit multiple munitions systems.  Additionally, CRG developed a cyanate ester elastomer, which has generated interest within the missile community for its high temperature and elastomeric properties.  CRG and MATECH propose to continue the HfC insulation system effort in Phase II, as a means to further investigate the cyanate ester-HfC system compared to the state-of-the art (SOTA) Kevlar-filled EPDM, and to develop a scale-up manufacturing plan and production costs of the HfC material.

The proposed receiver concept is compatible with emerging LWIR source technologies, e.g., optical parametric amplifier-based sources, as well as existing frequency-agile CO2 laser technology.

The tunable etalon\u2019s transmission will track the emission wavelength of the LIDAR transmitter.  Development of a low-noise amplifier matched to the receiver detector is required in order to realize the BLIP noise reduction resulting from the etalon.  Model calculations indicate that the NEP of the proposed receiver will be 4x less than what can be achieved using a conventional optical design and a commercially-available detector and amplifier.

MCPS consists of a fuel cartridge, fuel injection chip, power generation cell, and power management electronics.

        "abstract": "In the phase I, We have demonstrated that high power densities can be achieved for SOFC using  component surrogate fuels like dodecane or Tridecane via direct internal reforming. This approach can provide solutions for the highly power-dense applications required by Air Force (e.g. auxiliary power units for aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles) and many portable and transportation applications in commercial sector. Because the stack power densities are high, the system can be compact and light-weight. Since there is no external reformer or water tank required (reforming is done with H2O-CO2 recycled from the exhaust), fuel efficiency is potentially higher than other designs, reducing the fuel pay load. In addition, fast system start-up can be accomplished in part using partial oxidation reforming for heating the stack. Addition of a novel catalyst to a conventional SOFC allowed stable operations with liquid hydrocarbon fuels. This approach has an advantage that the catalyst can be \u00a1\u00b0tuned\u00a1\u00b1 to work with various fuels. The proposed Phase II SBIR project is to demonstrate a stable, high power density operation of this catalyst-assisted SOFC using JP-8 realistic surrogate fuel and other potential sulfur free logistic fuels.  Building on from successful demonstration during phase I, The proposed phase II will include optimization to the current materials, cell design as well as demonstration of small internal reforming model stacks.

        "abstract": "A program involving analysis and design, reinforcement materials research and development, composite fabrication, and composite property testing is proposed here to develop improved interlaminar properties of carbon-carbon composites used as the substrates for rocket propulsion components, such as exit cones and nozzle throats.  The improved interlaminar properties must be obtained with minimal impact on the in-plane properties of the C-C composites.  The most important technical objective that must be achieved to satisfy the primary objective of the proposed program is the successful further development of the concept of the discontinuous carbon fiber reinforcement interleaf material manufactured by Energy Sciences Laboratories, Inc. (ESLI) on San Diego, CA.  The focus of the ESLI reinforcement interleaf material development is to achieve high interlaminar properties, low impact on in-plane properties, manufacturing scale-up to reasonable sizes, and cost affordability.  A measure of success is the magnitude of interlaminar reinforcement properties improvement for similar impact on in-plane properties relative to competing technology such as stretch-broken fabric and needled fabric preforms. To provide the best assessment of the reinforcement interleaf technique to enhanced interlaminar properties, the proposed Phase II effort will procure stretch-broken and needled fabric reinforcement, along with continuous 2D carbon fabrics.  C-C composites will be fabricated using no interlaminar reinforcement, two different types of reinforcement interleaf materials developed and fabricated by ESLI, stretch-broken fabric and needle-punched fabric.  Mechanical property measurements, including both in-plane and interlaminar properties, will be performed to enable an assessment of the improved interlaminar properties and the reductions in in-plane properties associated with all of these composites.  Finally, C-C exit cone designs will be developed for all of these reinforcement methods and their associated composite properties, to determine an analytical assessment of the minimum weight design achieved by the various reinforcement methods.  BENEFIT: Enhanced interlaminar strength C-C composites, provided they are obtained with minimal impact on the C-C in-plane properties, may find immediate application in rocket propulsion components such as nozzles and exit cones.   If the high interlaminar strength, high in-plane strength C-C composites can be achieved, remaining hurdles to their implementation will include 1) fabrication scale-up to production sizes and quantities; 2) the economics of this approach relative to the competitive methods for achieving enhanced interlaminar properties; and  3) the resources required for qualification of the reinforcement for the target rocket propulsion components.  Challenges to the implementation of the proposed interlaminar reinforcement exist but would not be insurmountable with sufficient technical and cost incentives. Beyond the C-C rocket nozzle applications, there are a host of other C-C composite components that would benefit from the proposed interlaminar reinforcement technology.  Thermal protection system (TPS) components, both for the airframe and for the propulsion components, of USAF-envisioned space access and current and future missile vehicles would be other near term applications that would directly benefit from the proposed technology.  These TPS components include the leading edges of vehicle wings and missile fins, acreage region TPS panels, and control surfaces such as rudders, flaps, aerolons, and elevators.  The proposed technology, if successful in C-C composites, would likely be equally successful if implemented within other carbon fiber reinforced composite materials, both low temperature (i.e., organic matrix) and high temperature (e.g., ceramic matrix composites such as silicon carbide, hafnium carbide, zirconium carbide, etc.).  The range of applications associated with continuous reinforcement carbon fiber composites of other matrix forms is significant.",

Using a modified PhaseSpace tracking system, and newly developed software, PhaseSpace demonstrated in Phase I that it is possible to track reflective stickers applied to a model from 2 to 3 meter distances with resolutions down to 100 microns at 240 hertz.  In Phase II, PhaseSpace plans to show that this approach is viable in the wind tunnel environment, along with software-driven improved contrast enhancement to filter out \u201cnoise\u201d (extraneous reflected light).  As a stretch goal, PhaseSpace will attempt to increase the speed and the effective resolution to within 25 microns at camera frame rates of 480 hertz- 1000 hertz, which will result in an effective sampling rate of 120 hertz to 250 hertz.  PhaseSpace will develop custom software to run on an MS Windows \u00ae based platform to output the rigid body positions and attitudes along with wing deformations.",

Typical MANPADS can be carried and operated by one person. They weigh approximately 25-40 pounds, and are generally 5-6 feet in length, making them easy to transport. They are easy to store, maintain, set-up, aim and fire. Current countermeasures against these threats and the tactics associated with their use have proven to have limitations. DECMKV will be an innovative aircraft self-protection destructive countermeasure system capable of being dispensed from the F/A-18\u2019s AN/ALE-50 Integrated Defensive Electronic CounterMeasures (IDECM) system dispenser.  DECMKV will be capable of autonomously acquiring, tracking and homing on an inbound threat missile, and destroying or rendering it ineffective.  Future objectives also include adaptation of the DECMKV to other aircraft, including helicopters.  During the DECMKV Phase II effort, a prototype system will be designed, fabricated and demonstrated to validate the system\u2019s ability to meet the challenging maneuver and control requirements.",

The wax material that has been the most utilized in this application has been carnauba wax, but due to its non-domestic production and its dependence on natural growth and harvest mechanisms, a substitute for this material is desired.  Applied Colloids, Inc. proposes the utilization of its proprietary technology in supplying a wax substitute that is available in the United States and has met most criteria for these binder materials.  Phase I of this program dealt with the initial chemical and physical testing of these materials.  Phase II will be concerned with the characterization of their explosive and safety properties.  At the end of Phase II, the Applied Colloids substitute will have been shown to satisfy the military specifications for carnauba wax in terms of compatibility and safety.  Phase III will consist of the further scale-up of the production of this wax substitute and the extension of this technology into commercial fields, such as phase change materials.",

        "abstract": "The objective is to develop an electromagnetic modeling software code that can simultaneously handle analysis of the target, its environment and the sensors used to sense the environment along with the platform effects on which they are mounted. Our approach will be to generate the true impulse response of the targets thereby making identification much easier as it will strip off the various environmental distortions. Accurate modeling and simulation of the numerous effects present in a sensor configuration will support growth in the knowledge and understanding of the physical effects which contribute to the sensor response, when the target is not present. In addition to platform effects and sensor interactions, are effects due to the environment of the target. Clutter and ground bounce contribute to target returns and can make the discernment of the target signature more challenging.  Signal processing methods typically assume that received response is from far-field targets in stochastic clutter environments. In reality, the sensor response can contain a significant portion of the near-field and deterministic undesired responses from the transmitter itself. Reflections from ground, mountains or building structures may contribute target response in multiple range cells which are not stochastic. Quantifying the impulse response of the sensor system to the ambient environment of the target will include these deterministic effects.",

The proposed TAEM Measurement System will measure refractive and scintillation properties of both the ionosphere and troposphere.  Measurements generated for incorporation into the ionospheric state estimation model will include time-of-arriva, and signal amplitude for both L1 and L2 GPS signals for all visible GPS satellites above two degrees elevation.  The proposed system will incorporate these measurements into the TAEM 3-D Regional Ionospheric Electron Density Estimation Model, an assimilative 3-D ionospheric electron state estimation model to be developed by JPL.  This model will use Kalman filtering techniques to update a physics-based dynamic ionospheric electron density model designed for high-quality estimation in the surveillance band of interest to SSRs.

Existing multi-target tracking approaches that rely solely on spatial and temporal information from conventional electro-optical sensors fall short of demanding needs for persistent surveillance in complex environments, particularly urban areas.  Recent sensor developments are removing previous limitations on near-simultaneous acquisition and utilization of high-resolution spatial, spectral and temporal information from stationary or moving platforms.  Space Computer Corporation proposes to develop and demonstrate hyperspectral signature-aided methods to enhance long-term target tracking performance, with special emphasis on spectral-temporal signature extraction, signature evolution and matching to enable continuous recognition of specific targets moving in a complex scene.  In this Phase II program we will refine and extend the algorithms and processing architecture, characterize performance in more realistic scenarios, and deliver software tools to demonstrate the new tracking techniques using data from existing spectral imaging sensors.",

        "abstract": "Recent trends in law enforcement clearly illustrate the effectiveness of the taser to debilitate even the toughest targets, without causing permanent injury or lingering aftereffects. Current electric stun technology is either hand-held or short-range and tethered to the launch platform. The law enforcement agencies would greatly benefit from a longer range (6 to 40 meters), non-tethered electric stun projectile. The introduction of tasers caused sharp decreases in injuries to both police officers and suspects. It is expected that a longer range device would provide the same results. Lynntech proposes to design, fabricate, and test a non-lethal, non-tethered, electro-muscular disruption (EMD) projectile for a 40mm grenade launcher. A standard 12 gauge shotgun cartridge will be developed during the Phase II effort. The projectile will not require modification to the launch platform, will include wireless activated follow-up EMD capability, and will not be enabled until after the projectile has been launched. These features will ensure user safety before, during, and after firing and will allow for administration of additional doses to the target as required. Potential applications include the military and law enforcement agencies throughout the world, security personnel at airports, banks, private organizations, and everyday citizens seeking personal and property protection.",

This effort aims to upgrade and develop simulation tools to evolve affordable dual-use man virtual combat simulation technologies that will reduce the cost and time required to develop network-enabled, widely distributed sensor technologies for combat operations. Radiance proposes to develop, upgrade, and enhance the Virtual Combat Laboratory\u2019s (VCL) high-fidelity threat models for the development of network-centric warfare connectivity architectures and technologies. In addition, Radiance proposes to upgrade the current network monitoring and recording capabilities (Palantir) to allow improved analysis of sensors, next-generation communication systems, and battlespace management needs. Existing research methodologies for demonstrating and analyzing network-centric technologies are time-consuming, not real-time, and require extensive and costly flight testing. Leveraging the VCL\u2019s high-fidelity threat models and network monitoring technology will provide a high-fidelity, real-time simulation environment which can reduce the reliance on open-air range testing. Our strategy to commercialize this product is to design and develop it in a modular, configurable fashion so it is capable of accepting a variety of network messages, both military and commercial.",

The GuiDE is aimed to provide a low-cost alternative solution to existing airborne or ground-based aircraft countermeasure systems for protecting aircraft from beamriders and shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles such as man portable air defense systems (MANPADS). The system can also be integrated as a separate layer (Tier-2 or Tier-3) in a \u201clayered\u201d aircraft countermeasure system for enhanced coverage and padded protection. In this program, Orbital Research will design, build and test an Aerodynamic Maneuvering and Control Actuation System (AMCAS) on a candidate GuiDE airframe design compatible with the AN/ALE-50 Towed Decoy System. During the Phase I, ORI demonstrated the feasibility of multiple steering concepts in a low-speed wind tunnel, and examined the use of a GuiDE to counter hypothetical threat missiles approaching an aircraft from the rear hemisphere using six degree-of-freedom flight trajectory simulations. A study was also conducted to evaluate advanced seeker systems and the effect of seeker variables on the GuiDE design and control performance. During the Phase II, Orbital Research Inc. will advance the design and development of a candidate AMCAS and validate its performance on a candidate GuiDE design via experimental and modeling studies.",

        "abstract": "As the DoD shifts toward Network-Centric operations, the vision of sharing common information objects between command centers, aircraft, ships and ground forces over a global network seems closer than ever. One of the fundamental challenges of achieving this vision is bridging the gap between net-centric systems that share information using XML and tactical systems that require more efficient data representations.  AgileDelta developed Efficient XMLTM, an extremely compact, high performance binary XML format to satisfy this need. During JEFX \u201906 and JRAE \u201906, Efficient XML reduced bandwidth utilization and increased transfer speed by over 100 times, surpassing the DoD\u2019s best tactical data formats. JRAE \u201906 and JEFX \u201906 independently recommended immediate fielding. The World Wide Web Consortium identified Efficient XML as a best-of-breed capability and is creating a global web standard based on it.   This Phase II SBIR project will investigate, develop and evaluate Efficient XML integration architectures and migration strategies. It will define advanced architectures and protocols for dynamically negotiating and acquiring schemas for optimizing Efficient XML exchanges and enabling XML routers and guards to efficiently inspect Efficient XML streams. In addition, it will define architectures that enable rapid migration from expensive, proprietary protocols to Efficient XML without disrupting interoperability..",

The system semi-automatically extracts a target model from a training image sequence or one or more sample views of the target of interest.  The system will then search through an airborne video, extract features, match the features against features predicted from candidate target models (at different poses/angles),  and identify the targets of interest using a geometric projection invariant descriptor based vehicle classifier.

In this proposal wherein much preliminary (also MDA-funded) work has been demonstrated hitherto by the authors, Gallium Nitride-on-SiC power amplifiers in X-band radar are replaced with GaN-on-Diamond power amplifiers to enable nearly total and immediate heat extraction from the device\u2019s active region.  This proposal is focused on producing a 3\u201d GaN-on-Diamond FET wafer, as well as 5 W/mm GaN-on-Diamond FET devices.  Polycrystalline free standing CVD diamond \u2013 nature\u2019s most efficient thermal conductor \u2013 enables nearly perfect heat extraction from a \u201chot\u201d device, owing to the extreme thermal conductivity of diamond (GaAs, Si, and SiC are 35W/m/K, 150W/m/K and 390W/m/K respectively; diamond ranges from 1200-2000 W/m/K depending on quality). In the proposed scheme, the device\u2019s active epitaxial layers are removed from their original host substrate and transferred to a specially treated low-cost CVD diamond substrate using a proprietary low-cost manufacturable scheme.  The semiconductor-on-diamond technology proposed here may be applied to Si, GaAs, GaN, SiC, SiGe, etc. at up to 8\u201d in wafer diameter.",

The antennas will be based on a wideband printed radiator we invented and material optimization that enables the antenna to be integrated within the SDB airframe.  During Phase II of this project we will work closely with the Air Force and the SDB-II prime contractors to establish the primary electromagnetic (EM) and environmental requirements and ensure a suitable area on the SDB is used to locate the radiator.  We will conduct thorough electromagnetic modeling and testing of the performance of the new antennas and subsequently develop environmentally compliant prototypes that can withstand the conditions associated with the environmental requirements.

Ceramic matrix composite (CMC) materials have the potential to realize these benefits; however, the high cost of finished CMC components makes wide implementation impractical.  To reduce these costs, new innovative fabrication technologies are required that enable substantial processing speed increases to drive down the expense of machining.  Creare proposes to develop an advanced machining system (AMS) that will increase the processing speed for the machining of CMCs and other aerospace materials.  During Phase I, we demonstrated that our novel approach can increase the processing speed by 80% or more for edge milling, which translates to a 45% decrease in part cycle time.  We expect to exceed these results in Phase II.  During the Phase II project, we will extend our innovation to pocketing, drilling, and countersinking and complete a technology demonstration on a representative geometry.  During the  Phase II Option, we will integrate our system onto an end-user\u2019s machine tool.

        "abstract": "Weapons directed at enemy stores of chemical and biological agents can cause extreme collateral damage by venting live agents from broken containers into the surrounding area. This is severely hazardous for friendly forces, noncombatants, and the surrounding environment.  An Agent Defeat weapon (such as HTIs) is specifically designed to cause substantial damage to the target, while minimizing collateral damage.  In response to the environment created by the weapon in the facility, the agent may get neutralized through pyrolysis/thermal inactivation or combustion or may remain viable.  Most of the research thus far has focused on the pyrolysis and combustion of chemical agents and thermal inactivation of biological agents.  However, the combustion of biological agents has not been examined and even the most fundamental properties such as the ignition temperature are currently not available.  The objective of the proposed Phase II SBIR project is to investigate combustion neutralization technologies for biological agents and develop a model compatible with existing lethality assessment codes.  This objective will be accomplished through a combination of carefully controlled sub-system level bench scale tests on live agents and simulants and modeling.  In addition to measuring combustion properties such as the ignition temperature, flammability limits, and the products of combustion, the study also will yield a fundamental understanding of combustion mechanism.  The models and data from this study can be used to predict the extent of combustion and fractional viability of spores in a real life combustion event.",

The concept consists of a rigid framework which can remain connected to the mission equipment item even when the equipment is removed from the aircraft.  Interface hardware is designed into the system to quickly latch the mission equipment to floor ring or sidewall shackle tie-down provisions on the aircraft.

        "abstract": "KBSI proposes to develop a Framework for Intelligent support of Smart Transducers (FIST) that will revolutionize the way in which flight test and instrumentation engineers design, implement, test and manage sensor networks by exploiting the inherent benefits of the smart transducer technology.  FIST is modular, component-based, and platform-independent, and can be plugged into existing ISSs using a well-defined set of APIs.  In addition, FIST supports the rapid development of customized smart sensor management applications from various components. All of this will accelerate the widespread adoption of the IEEE 1451 family of standard. The Phase I effort resulted in the FIST methodology and component-based software that validated the methodology for T&E applications.   Under the Phase II effort, we will (i) develop reusable component-based FIST software that builds off the Phase I implementation, (ii) use FIST components to develop T&E applications that support smart sensor network design, commissioning, testing, and maintenance, (iii) develop smart sensor applications for condition based maintenance and homeland security, and (iv) transition FIST technology to the Air Force and other DOD centers.  Benefits include rapid, customized smart transducer applications that result in reduced cost and increased reliability for both the sensor network and the system being instrumented.",

        "abstract": "Fatigue properties of aerospace structures are improved significantly by the application of cold-working processes, which impart favorable compressive residual stresses at and near the surface of the metal. While cold-working production processes are tightly controlled to ensure the effectiveness of the process, human errors are known to occur and the degree of fatigue or damage resistance may be less than the design requirements. Today, no means exists to non-destructively measure the residual stress state of cold-worked fastener holes. Proto has years of experience in measuring the effects of surface enhancement techniques and believes that x-ray diffraction (XRD) technology can provide the NDI capability needed by the USN. Proto intends to prove that XRD is a feasible and cost-effective solution for the challenge posed by cold-worked fastener holes. Proto will perform numerous laboratory measurements on cold-worked coupons in the hoop and radial directions at the surface and subsurface, including the internal diameter of the holes, using its patented XRD tools. Proto will map these RS distributions and correlate that data with FEA and strain gauge data to establish the technical relationships for determining the effectiveness of the cold-working processes. In Phase II, Proto will deliver and demonstrate a rugged, portable XRD NDI system for measuring the effects of cold-working as well as the effectiveness of the cold-working processes.

This testing requires a core set of instrumentation onboard the test article, including Time-Space Position Information (TSPI), flight termination (FT), and telemetry (TM) functions.  At present, each test article employs a combination of unique modules to support these capabilities.  The time and expense to develop, flight-qualify, and maintain these unique modules is enormous, so a common module which provided these standard functions for a variety of test articles would result in substantial improvements in efficiency within the flight test community.

        "abstract": "In this Phase II research effort Arxan intends to build a practical and commercially feasible product - a reconfigurable-hardware-based protection-system integration product.  That product EnforIT-H shall meet certain design goals.  The first goal is to fill all unused FPGA space.  The second goal is to insert protection into an application after development has been completed.  For the third design goal of automatically supporting flexibility and re-configurability, we use the fact that our protections are instantiated on an FPGA.  For the design goal supporting instance dependent protection we propose the construction of a general mechanism for binding protection behavior to a particular set of hardware device characteristics.  For the design goal of strengthening the weaker links of a protection, we note that the EnforcIT product is based on the concept of building a network of mutually self-protecting protections using a variety of guards.  Lastly, in the interest of broad applicability, we propose to build our guards in a manner which is agnostic to the hardware which interconnects the FPGA, the CPU running the software to be protected, and any other devices (e.g. RAM modules) required by the selected set of protections.",

        "abstract": "Critical space and missile defense systems include high performance infrared (IR) sensors consisting of cryogenically cooled IR focal plane arrays and IR band-pass filters, which are both degraded by ionizing radiation.  One aspect of this problem is the absence of intentionally radiation hardened by design (RHBD) cryogenic IR band-pass filters. The current filters used in IR sensors are either radiation soft or radiation hard by accident.  All of the previous proposed solutions to prevent radiation induced darkening of IR filters have been shown to be invalid.  This leaves IR sensor designers with two options: 1) Complete the development of radiation hardened by design cryogenic IR filters, or 2) iteratively develop, fabricate, and characterize IR filters in the hope that some are accidentally radiation hard enough.  Option 1 will provide MDA and other agencies with intentionally radiation hardened designs capable of operation in environments that exceed total doses of 100 krad(Si). Subsequent programs may then choose a rad-hard by design filter, resulting in reduced cost and schedule risks to the program.  Option 2 will not only dramatically increase cost and schedule risks, but it will also leave the space and radiation community without a known solution and only limited radiation hardness.",

The proposed solution will incorporate a low-light sensor, image processor, microdisplay, support electronics and optics within a small form-factor. The inclusion of digital signal processing will enable enhancement of the night vision imagery beyond what can currently be achieved with an I2 tube system. As the system must be incorporated into a very restricted form-factor this can only be enabled by using a three-dimensional packaging technology that allows the integration of multiple, heterogeneous integrated circuits in to a high-density stack that possesses all the benefits of a monolithic device. The proposed device will be capable of imaging under extremely low-light conditions, and of enhancing imagery for optimal display and usability.

Training scenarios of this density give aircrew the ability to recognize and react with appropriate maneuvers, expendable countermeasures, and electronic jamming.  Realistic training is required regularly because threat reaction skills are perishable.  Unfortunately, threat training opportunities are minimal.  Some units have access to a small number of \u201cpostage stamp\u201d electronic combat ranges, but they cannot represent a realistic Integrated Air Defense System.

NGTS is a highly successful Warfighter Readiness Research Division program.  It simulates physics-based threat parametric data for high-fidelity-training.  NGTS has been successfully integrated into an Imbedded Electronic Warfare System (IEWS) to provide high fidelity threat training for MC-130P aircraft under AFSOC Project 02-028.   The RAS NEWTS proposal is ultimately to extend the success of the MC-130P integration to combat aircraft physically incapable of carrying an embedded system.

We will also study the possibility of implementing the single-element chemical sensor and multiple-element chemical sensor array.

We plan to implement a narrow-linewidth optical-parametric oscillator for producing the signal and idler waves necessary for efficient THz generation. We will achieve the state-of-art performance for a coherent THz source based on frequency mixing in an optimized GaP crystal. We plan to design and to implement a THz frequency upconverter based on a GaP crystal. We are going to integrate a THz source with a detection system and then to perform system testing.

We plan to design, to fabricate, and to test a THz generator and frequency upconverter based on waveguides.

The use of a new class of semiconductor materials can be applied at individual IC level through to an entire circuit board assembly as to be extremely intrusion sensitive.  External device integration can extend from very low profile integration to thick layer heat sink augmentation or replacement.  Internal device integration is initially focusing on memory circuits and processors (e.g. BGA, LGA, TSOP, LQFP and PGA), to be quickly followed by other electronic hardware.

In this project, we address this opportunity by developing a system INV-SE that uses combined spectral/spatial information to advance the operational utility of target detection algorithms.  INV-SE consists of a physics-based spectral detection algorithm in combination with an innovative spatial detection algorithm to provide a detection capability that is invariant to the illumination, atmospheric conditions, target pose, and viewing geometry.  Target spectral and spatial models can be supplied by the user or recovered from airborne imagery using new algorithms. If specific target spatial models are unavailable, INV-SE will include support for the detection of generic classes of manmade objects.  The algorithms have been derived for use with calibrated or uncalibrated spectral sensors.  A Bayesian technique is used to rank detection results by integrating the spectral and spatial cues.  INV-SE will be assessed using a large set of spectral and panchromatic image data that has been acquired over a wide range of conditions.  The Phase II project will result in a real-time INV-SE implementation on tactically relevant hardware. We will also consider the transition of INV-SE for a range of applications.",

This application will be developed as a version of Janya's existing IE engine, Semantex, with a new chat-specific architecture.  This architecture will allow automated monitoring of streaming real-time chat conversation and rapid generation of alerts when objects of interest are mentioned. The flexibility and modularity of Semantex's design will facilitate the rapid development these capabilities.  In addition, Semantex already contains extensible solutions for domain customization and processing noisy data useful for chat data.  Nonetheless, the linguistic complexities posed by chat mean the problem of high-level IE (for example, combining multiple entity mentions into a single entity profile) is extremely hard.  Better, more complete extraction will require conversation-level processing, as important facts about entities of interest may only be mentioned using anaphoric constructions that require decoding at the conversation level.  As such, the bulk of the research effort in Phase II will be directed at solving those problems.  Because chat data is of ever-increasing importance in the military domain, developing a chat IE application is an opportunity to further enhance the advantages of this rapid but non-intrusive form of communication.",

        "abstract": "Controlling stray light in ballistic missile defense (BMD) sensors is essential to target detection, discrimination and acquisition.  The most effective way to control stray light is to move or block the offending stray light source.  In the hostile environment of missile defense this is not an option.  The enemy dictates the stray light environment.  Defense sensors must contend with the sun, moon, earth limb, and countermeasures, at virtually any angle relative to the sensor boresight.  If a sensor is blinded by the sun or lured away by a countermeasure the result is no different than a failed launch.  Mission assurance depends on defining realistic stray light requirements, designing sensors to meet those requirements, and tests that verify sensor stray light performance.   While controlling stray light in missile defense sensors is critical, stray light testing is sporadic.  There is a need for a permanent stray light test station for missile defense sensors, staffed by personnel well versed in stray light, and allowed to grow over time with the support of multiple programs.  This Phase 2 program BRO will procure and integrate the facility hardware necessary to provide infra-red measurement capability to the visible stray light test station developed under SBIR B2-1065.",

        "abstract": "The task of accurately acquiring, tracking, discriminating and engaging a missile/warhead amongst closely spaced decoys immersed in clutter is a challenge for one or more radar systems. The objective of this proposal is to optimally design multi-sensor data collection, processing and fusion strategies when multiple radars and/or other sensors are employed to form a single integrated picture of the battlespace. Although the ambiguity function has long been recognized as an invaluable tool for assessing the performance of monostatic radars, it is only recently that extension of the ambiguity function concept to multistatic radars has been considered. The first extension was made to bistatic radars where it was shown that geometry can play a crucial role in the shape of the bistatic ambiguity function when plotted as a function of target range and velocity. More recently, extensions have been proposed for the general case of M receivers and N transmitters. It is proposed herein how to fuse multiple receivers by employing the multistatic ambiguity function which enables evaluation of such important performance metrics as detection and false alarm probabilities, conditional probability of ambiguity, target resolution capabilities, target parameter estimation accuracies and clutter rejection.",

(CRG), proposes the further development of heat-activated pressure venting mechanisms actuated by shape memory polymers (SMP) for meeting insensitive munitions (IM) requirements for ammunition containers and solid rocket motors.  SMP composite materials provide the same strength as conventional composites at normal operating temperatures.  However, at a threshold activation temperature, these novel materials soften to a controlled modulus of elasticity and thereby allow a predictable deformation under load. In cook-off conditions, at the threshold temperature specified by the propellant type, the SMP\u2019s transition temperature is exceeded and the SMP actuates in a controlled geometry (rather than simply melting).  SMP-actuated pressure venting mechanisms coupled with conventional ammunition containers will provide failsafe venting during slow cook-offs.  CRG has demonstrated the internal SMP ring as a venting system at a prototype level during Phase I.  Phase II will continue the internal ring design concept for prototype testing on an analog 7-inch solid rocket motor in a slow cook-off situation, and prepare the technology for Phase III transition.  By the end of Phase II slow cook-off testing, the SMP mechanism for IM will be at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6, system/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment.",

By combining the functions of a multi-spectral fusion (MSF) engine and a multi-target tracking and discrimination (MTTD) engine in a single, tightly integrated system,  the resulting MSF-MTTD system will be able to increase the reliability, range, and dynamic performance of EO/IR sensor suites.

We will also investigate the possibility of incorporating range information into the multi-modal representation of the scene. This representation will be created in real time via topographic data fusion (Stage 1) and parallel feature extraction (Stage 2), both of which utilize the processing power of massively parallel cellular nonlinear processor architecture at different levels of processing. The MSF-MTTD system will perform the analysis (Stage 3) of this feature set and the tracking and discrimination  of multiple targets at high speed, supporting ultra-high frame rate (> 1000 fps) sensor readout.

This solution is presently in the process of being evaluated for the relevant hypersonic rain erosion environs and full-scale thermal/structural loading.  At this time, it has exceeded all mechanical, thermal, and electrical and cost requirements, however it too has experienced significant material loss during recent full-scale sled tests through a rain field. As a result of these tests, and the modeling research conducted during the Phase I effort, MSI investigated alternative 3D reinforced fiber architectures to address the issue of material loss and or wear.    Phase I results indicate that high shear stresses due to droplet impact precipitated delamination of the 2D laminates, which ultimately lead to tensile failure of the outer fiber layer.  Repeated impacts coupled with aerodynamic shear caused dramatic material loss.  The Phase I effort systematically quantified the erosion event, and ultimately led to the investigation of 3D fiber architectures. This effort will be supported by The University of Delaware\u2019s Center for Composite Materials (CCM) with extensive material modeling to determine the loading interaction with the material and different 2D and 3D fiber architectures as well as subscale wear testing to screen and rank candidate materials.",

However, further improvements in existing state of the art multijunction devices will likely yield only incremental improvements.  Multijunction devices are currently limited by the inability to optimize the light absorption of the various layers due to the fact that materials in adjacent layers must be lattice matched, thus restricting the choices of semiconductors.  The proposed technology as demonstrated in the Phase I program overcomes this limitation by optimizing light absorption through the incorporation of quantum dot (QD) nanostructures while maintaining traditional lattice spacings between layers allowing for high quality multilayer devices.  The resulting improvements in current matching for the overall device will result in large efficiency gains.

In this new technique the physical layer is designed based on the vision of networked centric communications paradigm. IAI\u2019s design builds a framework for network nodes to share their resources including power and bandwidth to increase the physical link performance and to increase the battery life.  IAI is the only research group that has ever implemented cooperative communications scheme on a real time hardware. In Phase II, we take a modular approach to implement our cooperative communication technique on a software defined radio. In this approach we implement and test each module on FPGA based hardware independently then we implement the transmitter and the receiver using these modules. In Phase II Raytheon and IAI will integrate cooperative communications technique in Raytheon\u2019s tactical network simulation environment to evaluate and quantify the improvement in network performance. Once a successful integration is accomplished, Raytheon and IAI develop plans for implementing the technology on one of Raytheon\u2019s SDR radio platforms.  In Phase III Raytheon will use the Phase II work to actually implement and test the technology.",

In the proposed calibration system, innovative electro-optic (EO) field sensors will noninvasively monitor the near-field amplitude and phase emanating from an array under observation during transmit-mode calibration. In addition, compact, optically-activated RF emitters will provide reference incident fields to the array in order to perform receive-mode calibration. The pure optical signals that either interrogate or drive the EO sensors and RF emitters will be immune from electromagnetic interference, and the EO sensors/RF emitters can be arranged into their own array geometry and safely positioned within close proximity to the aperture of the antenna elements. The exceptional flexibility of the optical fiber, onto whose ends the very small EO sensors/RF emitters are attached, makes the proposed calibration approach a viable solution for the characterization of collapsible/deployable arrays, as well as other conventional arrays. The fiber-coupled array-calibration system will open a new paradigm of array operation and maintenance, from accurate on-site calibration and real-time detection of malfunctioning cells, to the evaluation of the overall array operating condition.",

The Air Force uses approximately 1.5 million gallons of hydraulic fluid per year, resulting in over $15 million in procurement and disposal costs. Hydraulic fluid is usually drained from the aircraft during routine maintenance and disposed of as hazardous waste. Recently the Air Force has started purifying hydraulic fluid for reintroduction to aircraft.  These purification systems require an online sensor to measure the quality of hydraulic fluid in real-time.  The rapid, on-site ability to measure hydraulic fluid quality is essential to avoid significant delays in servicing aircraft.  No online sensor currently exists to measure air content of hydraulic fluid.  Air causes problems such as hotspots, cavitation in pumps, poor heat transfer, loss of power, decreased viscosity, foaming, and decreased flash point.  InterSpace proposes to develop a unique sensor that noninvasively measures the percent air in hydraulic fluid.

In Phase I, the feasibility of producing a fully dense, non-micro-cracked Nanostructured cobalt\u2013refractory metal alloy with co-deposited hard ceramic particles was demonstrated.

A viable alternative to batteries, that could provide higher gravimetric and volumetric energy density, and lower life cycle cost, are hybrid battery/fuel cell systems with hydrogen stored as chemical hydride, which, when reacted with water, generates the required fuel as-needed. AeroVironment\u2019s (AV\u2019s) Phase I effort determined it would be feasible to develop an integrated fuel cell/battery hybrid energy storage system for the AV-designed and manufactured PUMA UAV, The 9-ft wingspan PUMA has a flight duration of three hours on rechargeable batteries, but will be able to fly for 6-8 hours with the fuel cell-based energy storage system.  In phase I we worked with several fuel cell system developers and conducted a bench top demonstration of an integrated fuel cell/battery hybrid system using a Protonex fuel cell and hydrogen storage system. In Phase II, we will optimize and build a fuel cell-based energy storage system and conduct several tests to demonstrate achievable flight duration. We will also perform feasibility studies for adding advanced solar cells on the PUMA wings and integrating a similar energy storage system into the Raven UAV.",

        "abstract": "In an electronics system, the incorporation of reprogrammable logic, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), into the design can offer many benefits to a digital designer.  For radiation hardened reprogrammable electronics, the choices among appropriate devices are very limited.  AFRL is at the forefront of designing and developing high performance radiation hardened digital solutions.  One such solution is the Via Programmable Gate Array (VPGA), which offers designers the high performance offered by a deep-submicron (90 nm) process, and the flexibility of reprogrammability with only one mask layer change.  However, for a design engineer accustomed to working with COTS FPGAs engineers, the path to implementing the design into the VPGA is not trivial.  A design methodology is proposed to ease this migration.  This design approach will facilitate the transferal of FPGA designs to VPGA designs.  As an option to this proposal, we offer to design, manufacture, and test four flight designs crucial to the development of the Plug-n-Play Satellite (PnPSat).  Because these designs are predominantly FPGA based, the option can serve as a springboard to VPGA implementations of these designs.",

The resultant debris cloud signatures contain highly desirable information on the intercept lethality  and warhead contents (nuclear, biological, high explosive, or chemical). The debris cloud is also a source of background clutter potentially interfering with sensor operation. The project objective is development and validation of the Debris Cloud Signature Toolkit (DCST), software for simulation of signatures from the debris cloud resulting from a high-altitude missile intercept. DCST will model the spatial, temporal, spectral outcome of successful missile intercepts in a single, complete, and comprehensive (UV-LWIR spectral coverage) model. Additionally, we will develop and test an optically efficient breadboard snapshot spectral imager for eventual model validation.  Based on the Phase I feasibility demonstration, this effort seeks to develop software modules for the important chemical, physical, and spectral aspects of these events and integrate these modules into DoD standard modeling software. The development and validation of the DCST represents a significant and innovative advancement to modeling, simulation, and analysis application tools for missile defense.",

        "abstract": "Accurate passive range estimation from single electro-optical/infrared sensors is a valuable enabling technology for many applications, particularly for defense purposes. Two applications of great interest are Sense and Avoid (SAA) for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and missile warning systems (MWS) for manned aircraft. Current passive image ranging systems rely either on stereo vision (or \u201cstereopsis\u201d) which provides a depth map (2.5D) of the scene in front of the device, or on maneuvering the sensor-carrying platform in a controlled manner. For objects at large distances, bearing angle has been successfully used for range estimation. However, it is not useful in many scenarios, especially when the intruder is heading towards the sensor in a fronto-parallel direction. In such circumstances, the sensor vehicle is required to make a deliberate maneuver which can be disruptive to the mission and cause inconvenience to both operators and regulators. Based on a comprehensive study of the problem, UtopiaCompression concluded that the object\u2019s size in the image can provide additional information regarding its location, even if the object size is barely resolved. This work describes a reliable, robust and real-time range estimation technique in an Interacting-Multiple-Model \u2013 Particle-Filter framework that can combine the bearing angle and intruder size information.",

We will build the MetaCORE (Metadata automated Categorization and Optimized Relevance Exploration) application as a complete metadata system architecture that can automatically populate a central repository with metadata mined from new and non-standardized legacy information products. A key advantage of MetaCORE is that all metadata will be stored in RDF, a next generation web standard accompanied by a powerful query language that provides greater functionality over other metadata storage formats. The modular MetaCORE system will enable the creation, filtering, retrieval and discovery of metadata using best-of-breed technology. Foremost among the technology that we will initially use to ensure that MetaCORE can achieve the most difficult task of discovering meta-data types and populating textually related metadata such as categories and keywords are Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) and Probabilistic Support Vector Machines (PSVM).",

Exploiting the context of the ongoing activity will be crucial to extraction effectiveness, as will teasing out the individual dialogs that structure the chat stream.  The IE process must also be modified in order to support extraction from those dialogs.  In addition, the results of the entire process must be analyzed to determine its accuracy, criticality, completeness, and veracity.

While great strides have been made in mechanical properties, CMCs still suffer from limitations in terms of shape capability, especially with complex-shaped parts such as turbine blades. Using high-strength fibers that have been woven into a fabric causes problems due to the nature of the fabric. The issues of greatest concern with regard to the preform are joining structures perpendicularly to other structures, poor interlaminar shear strength, and creating features with small characteristic dimensions such as wall thickness and radius of curvature. In Phase I, Ultramet demonstrated the fabrication of complex-shaped silicon carbide fiber-reinforced silicon carbide matrix (SiC/SiC) CMCs using a novel, non-woven preforming technique. This technique allowed the fabrication of a near-net-shape turbine blade containing thin walls, thin internal ribs, small radii of curvature, and small features, and the blade was bonded to a perpendicular support structure. Testing showed the material to have isotropic properties, and a shear strength of 8 ksi was measured. Phase II will focus on improving the tensile strength of the composite and the toughening effect of the reinforcing phase.",

Despite these very substantial gains in spectral efficiency, the ARTM Tier I and Tier II waveforms are not yet in widespread use in the telemetry community.  The adoption of these new modulation techniques has been slowed by concerns over the robustness of the demodulators for these waveforms.

High altitude LIDAR systems are currently limited by available spectral filter technology.  These systems, which utilize an interrogation source of a visible wavelength, have poor signal to noise ratios when operated in the daylight, due to scattered returns from sunlight off the water\u2019s surface.  Narrowband spectral filters are used to improve daytime performance by blocking returned signals outside the spectral band of the interrogation source.  However, many narrowband filters have the added disadvantage of restricting the system field of view.  We propose to develop a new type of spectral filter composed of an array of volume holographic gratings which can be tailored to a broad acceptance angle while maintaining an extremely narrow spectral bandpass of 1 \u00c5 or less.  We also propose to study volume holograms for use as beam splitters in multispectral systems.",

These systems will use software-defined modems and programmable encryption circuits based on high-performance integrated circuits.  But with the required increases in density, performance and complexity of integrated circuits, also comes increased vulnerability to radiation.  Without hardened integrated circuit components available for system design, radiation-hardening must be accomplished through reduced use of digital programmable circuits, circuit redundancy, and shielding.  This adds significant size, weight and power which in turn reduces system performance and reliability. Silicon Space Technology has demonstrated that astute modifications to a commercial CMOS process can yield significant improvement to the circuit\u2019s radiation hardness.

The jet engines of interest are Pratt & Whitney\u2019s F135 engine or General Electric\u2019s F136 engine.  Both engines use a common exhaust sys-tem produced by P&W.  One attractive approach to reducing the weight of the jet propulsion systems is to replace high density metal nozzle components with ceramic matrix composites, specifi-cally S200 CMCs. To fully implement S200 CMC components for engine applica-tions several technical hurdles need to be achieved. Some of those hurdles are at the materials science level others purely at the manufacturing and process control level. The focus of this effort is at the manufacturing level. It is specifically, to correlate in-process, non-destructive evaluation data with S200 CMC component thermostructural performance. COI Ceramics and Pratt& Whitney have demonstrated with significant success that they can dimensionally locate and estimate the size and type of defect using various NDE methods. Some of those NDE methods investigated for S200 CMCs in the referenced work have included, air scan and water-coupled ultrasonics, front flash thermography, microwave, real-time ultrasonic camera. Non-destructive evaluation of manufactured parts will be important in reducing manufacturing time and cost while produc-ing the best end item parts. COI Ceramics Inc., Pratt & Whitney Inc. and the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory have done sev-eral studies of various NDE methods for in-process inspection of S200 CMC flaps and seals for the JSF common exhaust nozzle. The proposed research will study existing NDE data and the appropriate representative S200 CMC material samples and NDE data, sub-scale test components and test types, and to demon-strate through mathematical composite materials analysis the ability to predict degraded CMC thermoelastic constants and re-sidual material strengths for the most typical defects. Then use those properties locally in finite element modeling thus incor-porating the NDE data into the structural models to predict the CMC component thermostructural response under required loads. Semi-automated production tools which include a graphical user interface to incorporate the selected defects into the CMC com-ponent geometry and automatically generate thermostructural analysis models. The tools will enable engineers and technicians to quickly evaluate effect of defects in CMC components.",

Additionally, SOF units have a critical need for short range tactical communications to stay in contact with other units in the field. Presently, SOF has the equipment to perform these various functions but they are in separate physical packages.  What is needed is a merging of communications transceiver and threat warning capabilities into one single lightweight package.  This state-of-the-art solution will be a small, rugged, VHF/UHF tactical threat warning radio.  In addition, this Radio will be augmented with enhanced features, such as networking and DF capability.  The Radio must support secure voice and data, but at the same time continue to provide fast wideband signal detection.

        "abstract": "Silicon Carbide (SiC) is a promising new material for optical substrates and structures for use in advanced cryogenic sensor systems such as those for STSS. However conventional optical manufacturing technologies use abrasive-based grinding and polishing which leaves significant subsurface damage and residual stresses in the material. These residual stresses can lead to degradation of the optical performance of the system once it is deployed. We propose to demonstrate rapid damage-free shaping of lightweight aspheric SiC mirror substrates using Reactive Atom Plasma (RAP) processing. This novel technology allows for rapid and deterministic shaping of mirror surfaces while simultaneously removing the subsurface damage created during previous grinding steps.",

These processes will be integrated into the current suite of state-of-the-art propulsion system/plume modeling codes to enable accurate end-to-end (i.e., nozzle flow, near field, and far field plume) simulation of low thrust plume signatures. Prototype chemical modeling software called DIVERT (Direct-dynamics Information for Very Energetic Reaction Trajectories), demonstrated in Phase I, will be generalized and automated in order that it can be applied to generate key cross section and band model data. The resulting cross section and band model data, as well as the near-field data and models, will be used to generate total radiation signatures with SOCRATES-P/FLITES. These signatures will be validated against available field data.",

This effect is completely passive, without the need for active phase, polarization or amplitude control, and can be achieved with an appropriately designed all-fiber output coupler.  In Phase I, we advanced the modeling and fabrication techniques for such an output coupler and proposed an individual fiber laser architecture that has inherent benefits for incorporation in multi-element arrays.  A model for predicting the stability and robustness of up to a 7-element array of close packed fibers was developed and used to select a design that shows robust locking for 4 fiber lasers.  In this Phase II effort we plan to build and test this 4-element laser system and to use the knowledge gained in this effort to model and propose higher fiber count systems that can be scaled up to 100 kWatt.",

Echoes and images are used to enhance displays for operator review.  The system will be less tedious for an operator than current methods, move more processing onto the UUV, and emphasize automated data processing.   Other objectives are to mitigate technical risk in using broadband, multi-aspect processing, to implement a smooth transition between side scan and synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) as operating frequency is reduced, and to reduce false alarms via fusion of side scan sonar images, side scan echo features, SAS images, and multi-aspect echo features.  Specially designed algorithms are used for signal/array processing, feature extraction, echo-image fusion, and sequential classification.  For example, SAS imaging with a small aperture wide-beam, wideband, dolphin-like sonar depends upon two different algorithms for adaptive beam narrowing, one for echo-based motion compensation (registration) and the second for reducing SAS spotlight size.  Another example is a method for image similarity measurement that can tolerate distortion, size, rotation, and location differences without loss of shape information.",

Thus the core module will be independent of the INS and the specific geophysical sensors that are used in a particular application and, as a consequence, will not require alteration when new or different INS and geophysical sensors are used.  The resulting software package will be able to accommodate any number of geophysical sensors of any type. Also, since the probability densities for the GPAN approach are not assumed Gaussian and in fact are generated and updated in the course of processing, this particular data-fusion approach is applicable to both the legacy ESGN system and the future FOGN system with errors that are predominantly random in nature and are driven by gyro ARW errors.",

However, spinel is not as strong as other materials, such as sapphire or ALON optical ceramic, which are currently used for such applications. In order to be acceptable for the most demanding of these applications, the strength of spinel must be increased. Surmet has demonstrated spinel ceramic with an average strength of 300 MPa, and has shown that the process is scaleable and repeatable. Improved strength is obtained by producing a fine grained microstructure, coupled with an optical quality polished finish.  The material exhibits suitable optical properties for existing and projected applications such as windows and domes. The process is commercially viable and scaleable to large size components.  In Phase II, we propose to investigate more advanced means of improving and controlling the spinel microstructure to further improve spinel strength.  Additionally, means of improving strength through refined finishing methods will be performed based on methods which Surmet has previously demonstrated on ALON.

        "abstract": "The MDA is developing the Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS), a constellation of satellites designed to monitor, detect, and track ballistic missiles.  Each STSS satellite employs multiple visible- and infrared-light imaging sensors.  The critical tracking function is provided by the combination of a starring FPA to detect LWIR light, and a silicon-based scanning camera to detect visible light.  A second visible light camera employed by each satellite is the chief component of an instrument known as a Star Tracker.  Star Trackers provide attitude and position information to the satellite by recording an image of fixed star constellations, and then matching the image to star maps stored in the instruments memory.  Detection of very low light levels by these visible-light cameras requires the suppression of background and stray light reflections to unprecedented levels.  The AR performance of conventional thin-film coatings is inadequate to meet the STSS program requirements, and AR coatings exhibit short lifetimes when operating in space due to damage caused by thermal variations and radiation exposure.  As a result there is an urgent need for an alternative AR treatment for STSS sensors that offers a significant increase in the quantum efficiency (QE) of silicon imagers combined with an improved lifetime when operating in space.  The AR technology must also be compatible with the complex and demanding fabrication process employed to produce silicon-based sensors. A new type of high performance AR technology for silicon-based visible-NIR light sensors offering the potential for superior stray light suppression and increased lifetime in high radiation environments, has been demonstrated as a result of a Phase I project.  Based on surface relief micro-structures built directly into the sensor window material, the new AR treatment completely eliminates the limitations due to stress, thermal mismatch, adhesion, radiation damage, complexity, narrow-band performance, and cost associated with conventional thin-film AR coatings. AR micro-structures fabricated in silicon windows showed extremely high suppression of reflected light, reducing the typical surface reflection of silicon from an average of 35% to a level below 0.3% over a broad wavelength range from 400 to 1000nm.  This performance would result in a QE increase of more than 10% in the blue spectral region and an average QE increase of better than 20% in the red to NIR for a silicon imager incorporating the new AR treatment.  Initial thermal cycling tests showed no reduction in performance or any micro-structure damage after repeated and rapid temperature excursions from 77K to 350K. The proposed Phase II project builds upon the success of the Phase I effort, and will demonstrate and deliver an AR treatment that can maintain a high level AR performance over an extended operational lifetime in the presence of proton and ionizing radiation. The potential for a near-term benefit to the STSS program through integration of the AR treatment fabrication process in an STSS sensor manufacturing line, will be realized and refined in Phase II.  In parallel with another currently funded MDA SBIR project developing AR microstructures for the infrared detectors on STSS satellites, the proposed work will be afforded an increased efficiency through established working relationships with sensor prime contractors.",

Currently used shipping containers for MDA\u2019s SRMs do not have sufficient combined ballistic resistant capability and IM characteristics.

The overall objective of this SBIR topic is to develop a lightweight field-portable (i.e., hand-held) device that fulfills a two-fold purpose as follows:  (1) it will detect/identify Chemical Warfare Nerve Agents (CWNAs) of operational concern and (2) it will be used as a diagnostic tool by appropriate medical professionals to rapidly screen for and to identify those individuals who have been exposed to CWNAs and determine those individuals who require treatment.  The primary purpose of this device will be diagnostic testing of biomedical samples (e.g., urine) for the presence of nerve agent metabolites.  The Phase I focus and objective was to develop a detailed plan which articulated an effective strategy to formulate a diagnostic tool with the capability to detect/identify CWNAs.  In accomplishing the objective of this Phase I project, six sub-objectives (tasks) were achieved.  They were the following: (1) define the operational and technical (analytical) requirements for a CWNA medical diagnostic tool; (2) select target CWNA metabolites for detection; (3) develop technical specifications and quality control (QC) procedures to verify the function of the diagnostic tool against the technical specifications; (4) research and identify biological reagents for CWNA detection; (5) select measures for target pre-concentration and/or derivatization; and, (6) develop detection strategy and prototype design for the CWNA medical diagnostic device.  The  technical objective of the SBIR Phase II program will be to produce a proof-of-concept medical diagnostic tool that can demonstrate the capability to detect/identify multiple agents in the nerve agent class.  In addition, an automatic reader and communications device will be demonstrated that presents the test results of the device.

        "abstract": "A critical aspect of the MKV system concept is the restraint and dispense of the individual KVs from the carrier/launch vehicle.  The individual KVs need to survive launch and fly out towards incoming targets while the KVs are attached to the Carrier Vehicle (CV).  As the CV approaches an incoming group of targets (re-entry vehicles and countermeasures), the KVs must be dispensed on controlled velocity vectors without inducing significant pitch, roll and yaw motions into the KVs.  Even if the individual KVs can correct for motion errors induced during dispense, correcting these induced motions reduces the divert/control capability of the KVs. Systima is proposing to demonstrate the MKV Restraint and Dispense System Technology in a flight test.  The flight tests will be performed using an MKV dispenser system design updated to match the latest MKV system design.  This flight test will confirm that there are no issues or difficulties when the technology is applied in the actual operating environment.  This test will verify that the flight performance of the dispenser matches the performance observed during ground tests and it provides additional confidence that the dispense system is ready for integration with the CV and KV flight test hardware.",

        "abstract": "The economical fabrication of ogive missile domes is a key driver for the development of future missile systems.  An essential, and unsolved, part of the fabrication process is the fast and accurate measurement of the transmitted-wavefront error of the ogive dome over its full aperture.  In the proposal we describe the development of a prototype interferometer for solving this measurement problem. The interferometer that is proposed is insensitive to alignment yet provides measurements of the entire aperture in double-pass while stitching in only one direction.  It is configured in a manner that is relatively insensitive to alignment of the dome to the instrument.  The measurement data provided by this instrument is essential to providing feedback to a deterministic final figuring process such as magnetorheological based technology. The effort is divided into two major phases: an algorithm testbed and a prototype instrument.  The testbed will be based mostly on catalog components to allow for rapid implementation so that software can be developed and tested quickly.  After the testbed, a prototype system will be built that will allow for the full aperture measurement of tangent ogive domes.",

        "abstract": "Military aircraft often receive damage from a variety of causes.  This damage is detected through visual inspection or through the aid of handheld nondestructive inspection devices.  Regardless of the inspection method used, however, determining the damage\u2019s exact location and spatial orientation is critical.  Typically, hand measurements are taken relative to structural features such as fasteners, doors, or panels and are then manually transferred to paper.  This practice is often inaccurate, labor- and cost-intensive, and incompatible with other data collection formats.  In contrast, the SURVICE Engineering Company has developed proven techniques to improve the process.  We are intimately familiar with precision damage measurement since our core business areas\u2014aircraft survivability analysis and aircraft battle damage and repair (ABDR)\u2014often require detailed post-test inspection and analysis of damage and its end effects.  And we have developed procedures and software to use the Metris X-Station and iGPS measurement systems to accurately and quickly collect data to support our survivability analyses.  In Phase I of SBIR AF06-102, we enhanced these capabilities and developed a technology demonstration to show the feasibility of accurately locating and measuring aircraft damage.

Therefore, we will compare the dose-dependent efficacy and anticonvulsant tolerance liability of imidazenil or midazolam for protecting rats against diisopropyl fluorophosphates (DFP)-induced status epilepticus (SE) and on neuropathology using the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compare the dose-dependent efficacies of imidazenil, diazepam or midazolam administered alone or in combination with HI-6 and atropine against DFP-induced seizures or SE. Efficacy against DFP-induced SE will be evaluated by telemetric monitoring of cortical electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), core body temperature and activity. Aim 2: Evaluate the dose-dependent protection elicited by imidazenil, diazepam or midazolam in combination with HI-6 and atropine on DFP-induced neuropathology. We will evaluate rat brains for neuronal degeneration using the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragmentation measurement and light microscopic histological examination. Aim 3: Compare the tolerance liability of imidazenil, diazepam or midazolam in the presence of HI-6 and atropine against DFP-induced seizures and neuropathology following a 14 day protracted treatment with increasing doses of these benzodiazepine recognition site agonists. After termination of protracted treatment, anticonvulsant efficacy will be evaluated with telemetric monitoring as described in aim 1 above.  We hope that the results of these studies together with the widely published information regarding the favorable pharmacological profile of imidazenil (appendix 1), available preliminary data on the acute and chronic toxicity, and mutagenic effects of imidazenil (for details see appendix 2) will provide the rationale for future Phase III studies.",

It is capable of viewing all objects in both day and night vision to 1000 ft.  The camera is less than 3 inches long, and will weigh less than 5 oz.  The thermal camera is based on a microbolometer array, and a novel lens system with wide and narrow FOV settings.  The capabilities range from recognizing people at 500 ft to imaging vessels from the same distance.  Prototypes to be constructed for each camera will be integrated with a gimbal and data link, developed by others, to form final payloads.  Cameras will be tested for imaging over appreciable ranges, night vision, shock, vibration, and thermal cycling prior to delivery.  Following delivery, cameras will be flight tested, first on non-SL-UAV platforms, then on SL-UAVs.

Applying the Hydrogen treatment to the superlattice should result in smoother substrate surfaces, higher material purity and more abrupt superlattice interfaces, all important factors that should significantly enhance device operation.

TSC\u2019s Phase I approach will be refined and applied to government-provided threat based target models, scenarios and radar systems during Phase II. TSC\u2019s technique simultaneously generates 3D volumetric radar images and estimates the precise target rotational state of targets in ballistic torque-free motion using one or more radars. TSC\u2019s 3D radar imaging methods are an innovation over traditional radar discrimination features such as RCS statistics and apparent length, which are derived from time-dependent radar signatures and do not estimate genuine invariant properties of the target or its motion state. 3D radar images are referred to a body-fixed principal axis coordinate frame which is the same for all radars that view the target at any time during the exoatmospheric midcourse stage of flight, greatly simplifying the task of registering images for true data level fusion compared to conventional approaches.",

Another of the complications is the degraded accuracy of the track estimates, along with the track estimates\u2019 uncertainties.  In order to minimize these complications, an accurate separation point estimator is desired to work in conjunction with the target-tracking algorithm in order to properly conduct track genealogy.  We are proposing augmenting the Probabilistic Multi-Hypothesis Tracking (PMHT) algorithm with a separation point estimation capability in order to build a very effective track genealogy function.  This topic is critical to the discrimination problem because identifying and tracking the different objects separating from a missile launch is needed so that the lethal objects can be determined.  As part of the development and assessment process, the new track genealogy function with PMHT will be implemented in the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Benchmark and compared with a generic track genealogy.",

We propose to develop a decision support system that 1) enables decision makers to pose diverse questions about their tasks and environment, 2) provides answers (using multiple modalities) and explanations permitting the decision makers to fully understand the system's underlying data and reasoning, and 3) offers proactive guidance by suggesting additional questions and providing relevant and timely information relevant to the decision maker's context. To achieve these objectives, Cycorp will team with Modus Operandi and build on their KMF work providing semantic access to Space Wing data, as well as with Stottler Henke and their scheduling/planning expert systems.  Together, we propose to have an operational prototype question answering system for Space Wing decision makers by the completion of Phase II.",

        "abstract": "An important outcome of both flutter and flying qualities flight testing is the assurance of safe aircraft operation within its operational flight envelope. The objective of flutter testing is to demonstrate that the aircraft is aeroelastically stable within the envelope, while the objective of flying qualities testing is to demonstrate that the aircraft is controllable within the envelope. Although the frequency ranges of interest are quite different, both flutter and flying qualities testing traditionally require several minutes of data at a given flight condition using frequency sweep, chirp, or other long duration inputs from which critical parameters can then be estimated. To dramatically reduce this time to five seconds or less, Systems Technology, Inc. (STI) proposes to create a software solution based on the use of innovative parameter identification techniques that work with short duration, pulse-like inputs, which are easily generated by a pilot in a flight test environment. Wavelet-based techniques are used to identify frequency responses from which damping and frequency of critical flutter modes or flying qualities metrics can then be determined as part of on-line flight test activities.",

        "abstract": "Military applications of high power millimeter-wave directed energy weapons technologies require high field superconducting magnets that are incorporated in gyrotron devices.  The magnets must be cooled to cryogenic temperatures to operate, giving rise to several technical challenges.  Gyrotron magnets have traditionally required a relatively long time to cool-down (typically at least 24 hours) and require high input power compressors.  The compressors are also bulky, heavy, and motion-sensitive, making them difficult to integrate into mobile platforms. Recent developments in high temperature superconducting magnets have aided, but not eliminated these problems.  Present projections for second generation superconducting materials, YBCO, indicate the superconducting magnet will require cooling to approximately 50 Kelvin.  This makes the use of several different refrigeration approaches technically feasible.  To minimize cool-down time and overall system size and weight, the best refrigeration approach must be determined and refined for the mobile gyrotron application. A key operational parameter in military applications is field readiness, including time to cool the superconducting coils to their operating temperature.  To date efforts have focused on standard Gifford-McMahon cryocoolers which are capable of very low temperatures.  But G-M cryocoolers are hampered by motion sensitive compressors and high power draw (from low efficiency).  Newer, oil-free compressors address the first issue, but refinement is needed to reduce size and weight, and to improve efficiency.   A novel technique was identified and investigated in Phase I to address the weaknesses of G-M cryocoolers.  Using a modified pulse tube refrigerator technology, it is possible to greatly enhance cryocooler efficiency, especially near room temperature.  Variable inertance pulse tube refrigeration technology presents an exceptional opportunity to significantly advance gyrotron magnet technology by reducing power requirements, minimizing system size, and greatly reducing cool-down time.",

Interface Explorer will help to achieve 100% assurance on large scale applications. The project\u2019s strategy is natural for big problems: divide and conquer. On components, we will address the assurance gap, with easy to use, no-compromise delivery of 100% property assurance, scalable in performance with few or no indeterminate cases. At the system integration level, Interface Explorer will help to enable 100% assurance of properties expressing compliance with integration constraints.    Today\u2019s tools also use programming language semantics to express application level properties. This requires at least the trust that the absence of programming errors or weaknesses will assure application level properties. Interface Explorer will help to enable provable 100% assurance of application level properties.",

        "abstract": "Several efforts are currently underway to enhance the electronic warfare (EW) training on Air Force aircraft using on-board, \u201crangeless\u201d EW training.  On-board EW training provides closed-loop simulations of air-defense environments for realistic in-flight combat training of aircrews.  The training capability can be an integral part of the aircraft operational flight program (OFP) or can be an external simulator carried onto the aircraft.  An on-board system allows training to be accomplished any time the crew is in the air, providing a low-cost training alternative. Although these embedded EW training solutions have been demonstrated to provide an accurate training experience, there are logistics problems that limit widespread use.  Standalone computer-based trainers require additional equipment to be carried onto the aircraft unless the training threat simulations are embedded into a component the aircraft OFP.  Designing additional training modes into the OFP requires the expense of flight software changes and an associated flight test program.   To support a low-cost EW training system that meets current and future requirements, there is a need to develop a ground based threat simulation tool that can stimulate the aircraft EW subsystems and monitor aircraft and operator responses over existing aircraft data links.  An off-board training system should result in minimum changes to the aircraft OFP, will not require any installation on the aircraft, and could provide a centralized threat simulation for multiple aircraft in future training exercises.   Lavender Industries and our primary subcontractor, the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI), propose to demonstrate a low-cost EW training system consisting of a commercial PC-based application that is coupled to an existing military ground radio unit.  The training system will use existing training environments, including the X-CITE ground training environment and the Imbedded EW Simulation (IEWS) developed by AFRL, and the Virtual Electronic Combat Training System (VECTS) embedded training system developed by GTRI.  The EW training system will support the closed loop threat simulation by applying threat indications at the appropriate aircraft time or position over the data link, and by monitoring aircraft navigation data and countermeasure events to accurately simulate threat response.  Lavender will initially demonstrate an approach using the capabilities and subsystems currently present on Block 30/35 class F-16C fighter aircraft, and then demonstrate a general solution for multiple platforms.",

The proposed wavefront sensor comprises a derivative of MetroLaser\u2019s widely used PhaseCam, a digital holographic interferometer, bringing the power and benefits of digital holography to meet the requirements set out in this solicitation.

(ROI) proposes to design, develop and demonstrate to the Navy an embedded distributed fiber optic sensor (EDIFOS) system for the real-time, structural health monitoring, damage assessment, and lifetime prediction of full scale synthetic material arresting gear cables. The proposed EDIFOS system uses a distributed array of fiber Bragg grating sensors, sensitive to stress/strain, impact damage, kinking and bending, and temperature, embedded within the strands of a synthetic material arresting cable structure. Fiber Bragg grating sensors are a mature technology typically used for the in-situ structural health monitoring of advanced structures. The periodic grating produces an optical, wavelength-encoded signal whose properties are dependent on the structural, and mechanical environment of the sensor fiber. The FBG sensor interrogation system monitors the status of each of the individual FBG sensors distributed along the sensor fibers and transforms this information in real-time in to a graphical display of the stress/strain and temperature state of the entire arresting gear cable. An alarm system triggers to pinpoint those locations of potential damage.

Integration and fusion of information resources is a high priority in both military and commercial business organizations.  With the explosion of web-based resources, the interoperability of information has become an even greater problem. The essence of this problem is the implicit and frequently inconsistent semantics of the information. Multiple systems may refer to the same object with different terms, or conversely the same term may reference different objects across systems. Merging information sources without understanding the semantics can lead to potential errors and mistakes. C2OSIF provides the semantic integration framework that allows information from disparate sources to be integrated, compared and analyzed irrespective of the structure and fidelity of the information. The underlying semantic structure captures the capabilities and dependencies of each system, allowing information updates from different sources to be analyzed to identify cascading, cumulative direct and indirect consequences of proposed changes. Sharing data and services is the primary focus of the C2OSIF solution which serves as the bridge between the information needs of each community, allowing the completion of C2 tasks more efficiently and effectively, and introducing the means to discover newer, better ways.",

        "abstract": "The raw detection data obtained by a radar typically consists of primitive measurements that correspond to discrete range-bearing cells, multiple of which can contain energy reflected from a single target.  The radar system employs a centroid processing algorithm to combine the primitive measurements and form a single detection report.  However, if multiple targets exist close to one another, this centroid process can produce undesirable results such as track degradation and/or track drop, since the measurements for more than one target may be combined to produce a single report.  We propose a method for utilizing feedback from the tracker to produce the appropriate number of centroid estimates in a given area, thus avoiding track drop.  Our method is a modification of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm as applied to the Gaussian Mixture Estimation problem; accordingly, we will refer to our algorithm as EMARCT (an Expectation Maximization Algorithm for Radar Centroid processing with Tracker feedback).  In Phase II, we will enhance the algorithm by improving the initialization and termination components of the iteration and by adding the ability to independently estimate the number of targets.

Diamond Antenna in conjunction with our Phase I sponsor and building upon the work of our Phase I program plans to further the maturation of this technology.  This will include finalizing the design of the Roll-Ring\u00ae and couplers, identifying the failure modes and associated risks of this technology, fabricating a reduced channel count channel prototype to fit within the existing slip ring envelope, and demonstrating the capabilities (signal transfer as well as reliability).",

        "abstract": "This project explores new methods that can dramatically improve the ability to accurately predict the useful life remaining for individual digital printed circuit boards at any particular point in time. The proposed capability will improve the system maintainers\u2019 ability to identify marginal circuit boards and components, and to replace them prior to actual failure in the field to prevent mission compromise. Our approach encompasses the novel use of new technology that supports sensor-fusion spanning the DC to EHz range of the electromagnetic spectrum enabling maintainers to visualize both electrical and physical changes within these digital circuit boards that are indicative of pending failure, long before their actual failure in the field. This is accomplished by providing maintainers with extremely high resolution imagery of the inner constructs of electronic printed circuit board components, solder connections and the PCB itself to visually identify marginal components, developing defects and identified/untested failures. In addition, computer algorithms also examine these images to detect the presence of prognostic indicators of future or pending failure. Such phenomena can neither be detected nor modeled using today\u2019s conventional test program set (TPS) and automatic test equipment (ATE), however, this capability provides clear indication of events suitable for prognostic purposes.",

        "abstract": "While zero-based tolerance protective clothing is suitable for first responders, it provides an unnecessary level of protection for first receivers who are exposed to a considerably reduced threat.  The use of zero-based tolerance garments by first receivers is particularly problematic since they often work in the same garments for an extended period of time.  Consequently, the unique needs of first receivers present an opportunity to develop an extended wear garment that is both comfortable and provides an appropriate level of protection. This Phase II SBIR proposal describes the development of a multilayered protective fabric that will offer a comprehensive combination of self-decontamination, barrier protection, and comfort.  The reactive capability of the proposed fabric was demonstrated in Phase I by the positive identification of a surrogate breakdown product present on exposed fabric.  In addition, the Phase I research also demonstrated that the reactive fabric reduced the breakthrough of chemical agent surrogates when compared to unmodified fabric.  The Phase II research will continue the development of the fabric by improving the capability to protect against chemical agent breakthrough and identifying suitable manufacturing methods.  The Phase II research will conclude with the assembly of a garment and live agent testing.",

        "abstract": "This Phase II proposal is submitted under topic MD05-066 and continues the develop-ment of low cost, needled C/SiC for throttleable divert and altitude control systems (TDACS).  The TDACS is being developed to guide the kinetic weapon of the Navy\u2019s Standard Missile-3 to the target.  The throttleable solid rocket motor technology embodied in the TDACS increases the range, standoff distance, and engagement area of SM-3.  A TDACS motor, which has been successfully ground tested by Aerojet, employed nee-dled C/SiC composites from General Electric Ceramic Composite Products (GE) for some of the hot structural components.  While the GE components performed well, the material is time con-suming and expensive to produce for two reasons.  First the needled carbon fiber preforms are purchased from France, and second the chemical vapor infiltration process requires a lengthy high temperature furnace cycle.  Furthermore, because the French-supplied needled preform is not optimized for the TDACS application, the performance and reliability of the needled C/SiC components can be improved if the material is designed based upon the requirements of the TDACS motor.   This Phase II proposal seeks to build on the Phase I results that identified improved de-signs for needled C/SiC TDACS components, and pointed toward improved preox fabric con-figurations for needled preforms.  The Phase II program will 1) fabricate and characterize a vari-ety of composite configurations to provide an alternate, inexpensive domestic source for needled C/SiC, and 2) design the composites so they exhibit properties that optimize performance of sev-eral TDACS hot gas components.  The component designs will be developed by Materials Re-search & Design (MR&D) using a combination of micromechanical and thermostructural models to audition needled C/SiC composites.  The composites will employ needled carbon fiber pre-forms manufactured by Textile Engineering and Manufacturing (TEAM) in Slatersville, RI.  The composites will be densified by Goodrich-Supertemp in Santa Fe Springs, CA leveraging their CMC production furnaces.  Additional material will be densified at GE to provide baseline data and investigate less expensive densification via polymer impregnation and pyrolysis (PIP).    Southern Research Institute (SoRI) will measure the critical properties.  The measured data cou-pled with the design results will lead to the selection of specific materials and component designs for ground testing as TDACS components.  The proposed approach simultaneously defines the composite material and structural configuration leading to a more cost effective development program than existing \u201ccut and try\u201d methods.",

        "abstract": "Almost all known Internet worms use some variants of control-hijacking attack to spread themselves. It is generally agreed that defeating control-hijacking attacks using sandboxing is the most effective and user-transparent approach. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to design, implement and evaluate a novel sandboxing system called Paid. Paid uses a program analysis approach to automatically extract a system call model from an application program\u2019s source code or binary code, and at run time checks the application\u2019s runtime system call behavior against the extracted model to detect and stop any unauthorized system calls. An application program\u2019s extracted system call model essentially becomes the security policy used to sandbox that application\u2019s execution at run time. Through advanced program analysis techniques, Paid will be the first known sandboxing systems that can automatically derive an accurate and application-specific security policy for each individual application that guarantees zero false positive rate and almost zero false negative rate. Because of its ability to reduce both the false positive and negative rate to an unprecedented level, Paid is expected to mark a revolutionary advance in execution sandboxing technology and significantly improve the technical capability and thus market appeal of commercial sandboxing-based intrusion detection/prevention products.",

Recent research by others, as well as our own work, has successfully shown that FTIR spectroscopy is capable of classifying bioagents from genus to strain level.

Current predictive tools for augmentor performance and static stability (i.e., lean blowout) are based on decades old empirical correlations that do not provide reliable estimates for advanced augmentor designs.  Recent advances in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and advanced combustion diagnostics have provided new insight into the fundamental processes that occur in these flows.  Reacting flow CFD has yet to mature to a level where it can be practically applied as a design tool for this problem.  In this project, we will develop reduced order models to provide designers with a significantly improved near term predictive capability for these flows.  Our modeling approach involves using low order CFD calculations of the nonreacting flow or simplified calculations of the reacting flow to characterize the flow timescales, and reactor models to characterize the important chemical timescales in the system.  Timescales that determine blowout are identified and used to form a Damk\u00f6hler number for predicting blowout.  This methodology will be extended to the use of networks of reactors to fully model augmentor flows.  Fully coupled reacting flow CFD and experimental data will be used to support model development and validation.",

Even further dynamic range improvement is possible with the use of advanced multi-rate architectures.

There are both anthropogenic and natural sources of acrolein in the environment. Acrolein is produced by combustion sources (e.g., vehicle exhaust, prescribed agricultural burning, cigarette smoke) and industrial sources, including manufacturing facilities of wood products. There is, however, very limited data quantifying the emissions of acrolein from these sources. Also, there are few reports of the ambient levels in surrounding regions that may be impacted by these sources.\n\n\n\nThere is a need of air quality instrumentation for acrolein for routine air quality monitoring in urban areas for health effect assessment, and at specific sites for source assessment studies. EPA Region 10 has identified as a priority issue the development of a measurement technique for monitoring acrolein. EPA is under increased pressure to regulate hazardous air pollutants as required by the 1990 Clean Air Act. In the Phase I program, we demonstrated the feasibility of a quantum cascade (QC) laser-based system for acrolein measurement, offering fast response and high sensitivity (~1 ppbv, 1 sec). The instrument is based on Tunable Infrared Laser Differential Absorption Spectroscopy (TILDAS) using QC lasers. The QC-TILDAS method has distinct advantages over indirect detection methods. Infrared absorption is an absolute, highly specific technique. In the Phase I program, we identified the optimum spectral region for acrolein monitoring. We investigated and identified background suppression methods with chemical scrubbers to remove interferences from the acrolein measurements, critical to achieving sensitive acrolein detection. In addition, we conducted laboratory studies of ambient and source emissions of acrolein.\n\n\n\nThe objective of the Phase II project is to fabricate and demonstrate a fully functional, fast response, cryogen-free QC laser spectrometer to measure acrolein. The instrument will have compact size to fit in a rack mountable box and will be capable of long-term, autonomous operation in the field. It will be able to obtain sensitivities in the parts-per-billion (ppbv) range for source monitoring and sub-ppbv range for ambient conditions.\n\n\n\nThere is a need for commercially available air quality instrumentation for acrolein and other toxic air pollutants. The QC-TILDAS system to be built and demonstrated in this program will have wide commercial applications for both routine air quality monitoring and for source assessment of hazardous air pollutants.",

The sorbent also maintained  its capacity over 40 adsorption/ regeneration cycles. In Phase II, we will first optimize the  sorbent and scale-up its production.

        "abstract": "We hypothesize that infrared (IR)  cameras mounted on unmanned tethered helium balloons accessed via a wireless  network can remotely sense water quality in mixing zones at site scales. Mixing zones are limited regions in water  bodies where the initial dilution of point-source wastewater discharge  occurs. Mixing zones are an important  component of the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)  permitting process within Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) water quality  management programs. In Phase I, MixZone  developed a low-cost, rapidly deployable, aerial remote sensing system for  monitoring water quality in riverine mixing zones. Our patent-pending platform monitors outfall performance  and focuses on temperature as a dilution tracer. In cooperation with EPA Region 10 and Oregon  Department of Environmental Quality, we successfully field demonstrated our  system at an industrial discharge site.  We proved the technical feasibility of our remote sensing concept to  gather continuous, real-time, site scale, geo-reference mixing zone data for  NPDES regulatory compliance and ESA habitat assessment. Alternative aerial remote sensing platforms have  limited availability, high costs, and long lead times to schedule  deployment. The cost of our platform  will be 1/3 to 1/10 of competing technology.  Our platform can be deployed by 2 to 3 people with minimal operator  training and is suitable for monitoring at fixed locations for longer time  periods than is practical for alternative airborne sensors. In Phase II, we will continue to focus on  mixing zones in rivers, where vertical mixing of point sources discharges is  rapid but may exhibit long downstream distances for full lateral mixing. We will develop technology to better aim and  control our sensors. We will identify  temperature differentials and associated wastewater types (e.g., process  cooling waters, municipal effluents, pulp mill effluents, etc.), outfall  configurations (e.g., surface shoreline, submerged single port, multiport  diffuser), and ambient conditions that lead to successful monitoring. We will develop tools for hydrodynamic mixing  zone model validation and calibrations.  We will commercialize our platform by demonstrating deployment with  industrial sponsors. We will work with  EPA partners on technology verification.  Although our platform detects temperature as a water quality parameter,  the potential to model the fate and transport of other discharge constituents  may be much more widespread (e.g., shoreline recreational exposure to pathogens  from wastewater discharges, determination of spatial extent of contaminated  sediment deposits from mining operations, detecting the impacts of contaminated  groundwater interactions within in groundwater/surface recharge zones, and  analysis of thermal refugia habitat for endangered species management).",

        "abstract": "The goal of this research project is to  develop a simple, rapid, and highly automated sample collection system that  will concentrate a broad range of pathogens simultaneously. The system will integrate continuous flow  centrifugation (CFC) with an innovative positively charged filter so that large  (i.e., protozoan parasites and bacteria) and small (i.e., enteric viruses)  bioparticles can be concentrated under an integrated platform. Because CFC is not subject to the limitations  of traditional filtration approaches that are subject to fouling, and because  its utility was evaluated extensively through Phase I study using a broad range  of waterborne pathogens, the integration of CFC and cartridge filtration will  extend the utility of the sample concentration platform to accommodate a  diverse range of natural and treated water samples that cannot be processed using  current filtration methods alone.\n\nThe system developed in this research  project is intended to be compatible with current and commonly employed  analytic detection techniques and other advanced detection methods such as  real-time PCR, DNA microchip arrays, as well as other biosensors. This innovative sample collection and  concentration system will provide concentrated samples for routine and advanced  water quality monitoring, and will be readily incorporated as a front-end  measure for rapid identification of bio-agents in the face of bioterrorism  events and post-attack monitoring.\n\nThe final product is envisioned as an  automated sample collection and concentration device that will accommodate a  variety of water matrices ranging form finished drinking waters to  particle-rich matrices such as surface and wastewaters. The open design of the automated system also will  extend the utility of online and real-time sensor arrays for waterborne  pathogens and indicator microorganisms.",

        "abstract": "There are more than 480,000 trucks on U.S. roads, and each vehicle produces up to 20 tons CO2, 420 lbs of CO, 11 lbs of particulates, and 250 lbs of nitrous oxides per year, when idling, and producing auxiliary power needed for the driver&rsquo;s comfort. A Quiet Reliable and Compact Fuel Cell Based APU (QRCFC-APU) is proposed to significantly reduce these emissions. The QRCFC overcomes challenges with current diesel fuel reforming and fuel cell reliability, when converting diesel fuel to power on trucks. Under the Phase I effort, a QRCFC test article was designed and its critical reformer component was tested to show that it can limit reformate CO and sulfur contents to levels that are compatible with the fuel cell. In addition, an individual cell test showed that the fuel cell can reliably operate with the reformate generated by the reformer. These tests showed the feasibility of the QRCFC system. Under the Phase II effort, the individual QRCFC reformer and fuel cell components will be refined and scaled up, and the system tested at the 2kWe power level. Emissions, efficiency, reliability, and short-term durability will be proved in these tests. In addition, test data and analysis will be used to project the performance of the QRCFC as a truck-based APU, and both first and operating costs will be estimated. These results will then be contrasted with alternative APU approaches, as well as simple truck idling. Under the proposed Commercialization Option, the QRCFC components will be further refined and capacity will be increased to 6kWe and the unit tested. Lastly, the 6kWe unit performance will be verified through testing at an EPA-supported Verification Test Organization, which will help drive commercialization of the unit.\n\n\n\nIf the QRCFC penetrated just 20 percent of the truck APU market, it will result in the reduction of more than 12,000 tons of NOx, 20160 tons of CO, 544 tons of particulate, and 1.5 million tons of CO2 emissions each year. Besides this important application, the QRCFC also could provide similar benefits to military and civilian boat, mobile power and remote power applications. These represent a market of more than 100,000 additional units, with a related large beneficial emissions reductions.",

        "abstract": "Applied Sciences, Inc. (ASI) investigated the use of inexpensive carbon nanofiber (CNF) to impart electrical conductivity to polymer systems to allow the use of electrostatic painting (ESP) techniques to paint these polymers in the same manner as metals without the need for a solvent- based primer coat. The production of polymer composites that can be electrostatically painted with no additional processing steps will remove a major barrier to the replacement of metal parts with composites parts on automobiles. The full development of this technology will increase the use of composite components in the automotive industry, which is in consonance with the efforts of the automotive industry to reduce weight, increase fuel efficiency, and eliminate corrosion while maintaining appearance, performance, and low-cost.\n\n\n\nIncorporating carbon nanofiber into polymers at low loadings is known to create composites that can carry electrical currents while simultaneously increasing mechanical properties. Composites produced from a variety of commercially available composite fabrication techniques (e.g., injection molding, compression molding, long fiber thermoplastics processing, sprayable gelcoat); different polymers (PP, PEEK, PC, Nylon, PE); and carbon nanofiber types and grades were tested under this program. The composites tested all had electrical conductivities between 10-4 to 10-6 S/cm, with loadings as low as 2 weight percent of carbon nanofiber. The conductive composites were painted using ESP techniques, and then tested for surface finish quality, adhesion, and abrasion resistance.\n\n\n\nThe conductive composites received the paint with no alterations in the painting process and behaved similarly to metal. The CNF neither affected the surface quality, nor did it impact the adhesion of the paint to the composite surface. The best nanofiber variant proved to be the XT version, and the best processing methods were the long fiber thermoplastics processing and the sprayable gelcoat. The sprayable gelcoat allows the ability to selectively place conductivity at the surface of the composite.\n\n\n\nOverall, the program was successful in demonstrating that composites made conductive with the addition of CNF can be electrostatically painted without the addition of a conductive primer coat. Elimination of the conductive primer will eliminate approximately 0.23 lbs of volatile organic compound (VOC) emission per automobile, or about 18 percent of the total VOC emissions related to painting and finishing. ESP of polymers will reduce manufacturing costs by about $100 per vehicle. The net present value of this is conservatively estimated at $500 M for the industry over the next 15 years. Ultimate savings could reach $2 B annually.\n\n\n\nConductive composites have further potential of being used in numerous under-the-hood applications and other areas where electrical conductivity is needed, and more widely as electronic enclosures, composite electrostatic precipitators, anti/deicing heaters for aircraft, and anti-static flooring, countertops, and truck bed liners.\n\nASI and its partners will pursue further cost-reduction strategies in Phase II to enhance the attractiveness of this technology. Technical advances and increased production capacity developed during the Phase II effort are expected to increase this cost savings.",

        "abstract": "Petroleum is finite and as world economies develop it will be increasingly expensive.  Consequently, crude oils containing contaminants including mercury and sulfur will be processed.  The resulting extensive pollution along with concerns over climate change make it highly desirable to find alternative sources for plastics as a means of pollution prevention.  Plastic water bottles in California are filling up available dumping space and when released into the ocean cause environmental problems.  Finally, during the production of foamed plastic articles, significant quantities of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are generated.  The purpose of this multi-phase SBIR research project is to develop and commercialize next-generation bioplastics using nanotechnology to address these ecological concerns.  We expect the resulting \u201cgreen\u201d plastics to compete on a price/performance basis.\n\n\n\nPLA is a bioplastic made from corn but available from any fermentable biomass resource, including plentiful cellulosics.  Life cycle analysis shows multiple environmental benefits over petroleum-based plastics. However, the property window of PLA is limited - the heat distortion temperature (HDT) is too low. In Phase I, University expertise developed under previous EPA STAR funding was exploited to develop nanocomposite technology that successfully overcame the HDT limitation.  Presently polystyrene is largely used for these applications and foamed with 3-5 weight percent hydrocarbons.  If PLA is used the additional benefit of displacing at least 1 million pounds per year of VOCs may be realized.  Because of the clear commercialization potential of the nanotechnology, a commercialization agreement with the Sealed Air Corporation (SAC) - a $4 Billion/year in sales multinational - was reached and will provide rapid commercialization if the technical milestones of this Phase II project are met. \n\n\n\nTo meet the full suite of requirements on solid and foamed trays, additional material property targets have been identified in conjunction with SAC; meeting these requirements constitutes the basis of the Phase II work plan.  When successfully met, a commercialization option will be exercised at the end of the first year and co-funded by a $100,000 SAC investment.  This will enable an expanded work plan culminating in the production of prototypes using an industrially relevant pilot scale production line.",

        "abstract": "Coal-fired utilities emit 48 tons of  elemental mercury into the atmosphere each year. Rising costs and escalating energy demands  are expected to increase our reliance on energy produced by these  facilities. However, with the Clean Air  Mercury Rule (CAMR), mercury emissions from these utilities must ultimately be  decreased to 15 tons for Phase II by 2018. To meet this mission cap, new technologies  must be realized that reduce the output mercury with minimal implementation and  operational costs. The first phase of  CAMR, required in 2010, encourages mercury control technologies based on  &ldquo;co-benefit&rdquo; reductions.\n\nFrontier&rsquo;s SBIR technology is intended  as a &ldquo;co-benefit&rdquo; technology and involves a method and product for reducing  persistent elemental mercury present in the flue-gas at coal-fired  utilities. The technology prescribes a  water-soluble organic compound as a simple amendment, which is added as a  liquid to the utility&rsquo;s existing wet flue-gas desulphurization (FGD) unit. The amendment forms an insoluble precipitate,  sequestering the elemental mercury, which is readily separated from the  produced gypsum with little or no additional capital investment.\n\nPhase I results demonstrated that the  proposed organic compounds are capable of removing elemental mercury from a  synthetic flue-gas using a pilot-scale, Venturi scrubber. Under optimized conditions, 95 percent of  elemental mercury present in the gas phase can be removed and greater than 99  percent of this mercury can be simultaneously complexed in the scrubber  water. The product also will remove greater  than 99 percent of dissolved or inorganic mercury. The technology has been shown to work  effectively over the pH range of a typical wet FGD scrubber (pH 5-8).\n\nThe primary goal of Phase II research  is to translate the technology from the Phase I pilot system to a beta-scale  test at a working coal-fired utility. To  accomplish this, investigations into the mechanism of operation, fate of  mercury in the by-product, and compatibility of the proposed technology within  installation requirements will be made.  The Southern Company has offered its Mercury  Research Center  at Plant Crist in Pensacola  as a beta site, and Black and Veatch are interested in sponsoring the  Commercialization Option of the proposal should the initial Phase II results  show promise. CCI, a domestic chemical  manufacturer, has prepared to produce the organic compound on a commercial  scale at a market competitive price.",

        "abstract": "A volatile organic compound (VOC)  detection system that is portable, sensitive to the low-ppb level, and able to  provide reliable measurements in real time is needed for environmental  compliance monitoring and process control in chemical plants. Recently, hand-held and battery-powered  ppb-level VOC photoionization detectors (PID) have become commercially  available. However, the presence of  water in the sample air interferes with the detection accuracy in PIDs.\n\nThis project describes the development  of a membrane device to remove water vapor from the gas being sent to portable  PID-based VOC detectors. The membrane  uses a perfluoro polymer that is water-permeable and VOC-rejecting. The membrane device is compact, lightweight  and energy efficient, which makes it convenient to integrate into a portable  detection system.\n\nTo reduce water relative humidity in  the air from 100 percent to 10 percent while sending 200 mL/min gas to the  detector, a membrane with an area of 0.1 m2 is required. In the Phase I project, membranes with the  required permeance and selectivity were prepared and made into bench-scale  modules with various configurations and the required membrane area of 0.1 m2. These modules were evaluated for  nitrogen/toluene separation, and the configuration was optimized to achieve  better separation performance. In  addition to removing water from the air, these modules have been demonstrated  to enrich VOC content by 10- to 100-fold in the gas sent to the detector.\n\nIn Phase II, we will optimize module  configurations using more innovative designs for improved water removal  performance, and construct a prototype membrane device to deliver to our  business partner, RAE Systems, Inc., for testing and evaluation. Integrating such a membrane device with a  hand-held ppb-level, VOC detector, such as the ppbRAE Plus detector made by RAE  Systems, only adds 30-40 percent by volume and 100 percent by weight, which  would provide an easily portable system with much improved performance.",

        "abstract": "Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)  remain a significant environmental threat even though manufacturing of PCBs was  discontinued 30 years ago. Due to the  chemical and thermal stability of PCBs in the environment and the continued use  of transformers containing these chemicals, very specific regulations are in  place that require quantification of PCBs in all transformer oil. The Toxic Substance Control Act has mandated  that the concentration of PCBs in transformer oil be less than 50 parts per  million. Analysis of PCB concentration  is currently performed by SW-846 Method 8082 standard method in an analytical  laboratory using gas chromatography.  This type of analysis is time consuming and costly. In addition, for this offsite analysis, oil  must be removed from the transformer that potentially exposes workers and the  environment to PCBs. Eltron is  developing a new portable real-time sensor that can be used onsite to not only  quantify the PCBs that are present but also to determine PCB concentration.\n\nIn the EPA Phase I SBIR project,  Raman Spectroscopy and multivariate analysis were combined to create a rapid in situ sensor capable of a simultaneous  detection of PCB concentration and composition within transformer oil. Regression models were prepared that could  detect PCB concentrations as low as 5 ppm, and classification models were  prepared that could predict the type of Aroclor present in transformer  oil. During the Phase II project, sensor  sensitivity will be improved by testing all major transformer oil types and  accounting for appropriate interferences.  Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy will be used to lower the sensor  detection limit. Finally, a prototype  instrument including user friendly software will be prepared for field testing.\n\nThe final product of this project  will be a real-time sensor that is cost effective, portable, user friendly, and  most importantly will prevent the hazardous removal and transportation of  contaminated transformer oil for PCB analysis.  The expected instrument capital cost is equivalent to current GC costs  ($30K); however, the per sample testing cost will be significantly less than GC  methods. This type of hand-held sensor  will find extensive use by electric utilities (Sacramento Municipal Utility  District) and hand-held Raman instrument manufacturers (Raman Systems,  Inc.). An expected global market of $119  M is expected for this type of instrument by 2009.",

        "abstract": "This proposal offers the demonstration of an approach to integrate the latest corrosion sensor technology with corrosion structural effects modeling to enable the transition from periodic corrosion inspections to an efficient, focused prognostics and health monitoring (PHM) system. The fundamental vision of the proposed program is to provide the customer with a demonstrated process suitable for integrating corrosion effects analysis tools, structural criticality prioritization algorithms, in situ corrosion sensors, conventional non-destructive inspection (NDI), and data management structures to monitor and assess aircraft structure. All of these capabilities currently exist at varying levels of maturity. At the end of Phase II, such a PHM system will be designed, developed, integrated, validated, and demonstrated. The resulting system will include state-of-the-art hardware, software, and analytical techniques packaged into a powerful structural management philosophy. Demonstration in Phase II includes installation of hardware on a private jet to provide a flying demonstration article, and a detailed Program for implementation on a USAF asset, the A-10 \u201cWarthog.\u201d",

Maintenance is an important aspect of reliability, assuring that equipment is on line and operational when it is needed.  The trend toward electronic/networked maintenance documentation presents an opportunity to improve maintainer effectiveness, but new tools must be developed to manage interactions between the information sources and maintainers.  In Phase I Instrumental Sciences, Inc. (ISI), with subcontract team member Sentar, Inc., researched techniques for an Automated Multimedia Maintenance Support Tool (AMMST) based on the artificial intelligence field of cooperative multi-agent distributed work environments.  In the Phase II continuation, ISI will develop an engineering prototype AMMST, building on the successful Phase I results.  Our approach applies the multi-agent architecture to produce a distributed information management tool set to support maintenance operations.  These tools gather relevant information from diverse sources upon user request or maintenance scenario identification, then they filter the information and format it for interactive multimedia presentation to the user.  The Phase I results included a successful demonstration of a distributed information-gathering architecture, employing cooperative agents to interface with local and distant maintenance resources.",

The MFNO plasticizer synthesized on the completed Phase I program has been demonstrated to be insensitive to impact, shock and friction, and it proved to be insensitive when tested in a propellant sample. However, MFNO showed moderate volatility which will be suppressed by chemical modification while retaining the desirable MFNO properties.

Aerojet will test the MFNO ingredients for sensitivity and thermal properties. The selected IM compliant MFNO plasticizers will be formulated in a propellant mixture and tested, and then scaled up for more advanced formulation and more thorough propellant characterization.

The targeting of a boost phase missile requires a sensor that can both acquire the target and perform plume / hardbody discrimination.

In re-entry phase, an imaging polarization sensor should provide aimpoint selection and orientation determination in the presence of a wake.  Polaris' Phase I effort has shown that the use of polarization for next generation seeker systems can offer significant benefits. Limited data exists, however, and an instrument is needed for confirmation.  Prior to instrumentation development, modeling needs to be done optimize instrumentation development and assess the feasibility for imaging polarimetry to impact missile defense applications.

Therefore apriori planning of sensor siting for optimizing the timeline and quality of discrimination feature measurements represents a significant opportunity to maximize discrimination performance.  The Phase I effort successfully demonstrated the capability to perform discrimination sensor planning using an innovative approach for rapid waveform / feature level discrimination analysis across extremely large operating areas.

During the Phase I effort, Radiance designed a high bandwidth Fast Steering Mirror (FSM) utilizing a new class of piezoceramic actuators with demonstrated mirror deflections mechanically amplified 4.5 times that of conventional piezoceramic actuators for the same input voltage. Results from testing of a single-axis prototype suggest significant improvements in power efficiency, size and mass reductions, and thermal management over comparable electromagnetic voice coil systems, and represents the first step in the progressive development of a flight-worthy system.  The progressive demonstration in Phase II will include: demonstration of the amplification factor; integration of a microradian-accuracy measurement sensor; and development and demonstration of the power supply/controller and two-axis FSM design. The design objectives will include the performance objectives stated above for a FSM weighing less than 250 g (excluding the mirror) and requiring less than a 60 W power draw.  A fast steering mirror meeting these objectives will produce a significantly higher bandwidth than an electromagnetic (voice coil) FSM meeting the other objectives.   Such a system enables a kill vehicle (KV) to rapidly scan a large search area and to simultaneously track many objects.  Incorporation of the micronradian-class precision measurement sensor yields pointing accuracies sufficient to direct laser pulses toward the many targets and retrieve range information.

        "abstract": "This Air Force Phase II SBIR program seeks to further develop the first tantalum carbide (TaC) structural ceramic fiber for TaC(f)/TaC(m) CMCs for use in aluminized propellant solid rocket motor (SRM) applications. TaC has been identified as the best performing ceramic composition for aluminized propellant SRM applications. MATECH/GSM proposes to scale-up TaC structural ceramic fiber to a level suitable for low rate initial production (LRIP) of 500 filament TaC ceramic fiber tow during the Phase II program. The 500 filament TaC ceramic fiber tow will be tested per the comprehensive fiber test matrix outlined in the statement of work. This TaC ceramic fiber property database will enable direct comparison with existing commercially available high temperature \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d ceramic fibers. This database will be critical in designing and modeling the performance of  TaC(f)/TaC(m) CMC rocket nozzles. MATECH/GSM proposes to fabricate 4D TaC fiber preforms using pultrusion processing of 500 filament ceramic fiber tow and fabricate TaC(f)/TaC(m) CMC composite test panels for mechanical and thermal property measurements. MATECH/GSM will fabricate and test fire \u201czero erosion\u201d TaC(f)/TaC(m) CMC thrusters. Hot fire motor tests under aluminized propellant conditions will be conducted at Aerojet\u2019s Sacramento test facility.",

PSI will utilize its unique Infra-red spectral imaging and other technologies to characterize the near-field plumes generated by Aerojet monopropellant hydrazine thrusters in a high altitude simulation facility. For the far-field plume, PSI will extend its Phase I work and will measure velocity dependent cross sections of hydrazine thruster plume species with atmospheric O/N2 at hyperthermal energies.

The particular bearing of interest is a turbine engine inter-shaft bearing, a bearing that is inaccessible and therefore very difficult to monitor using traditional methods. The cage sensor must measure temperature and vibration, survive temperatures approaching 300 \u00b0C, and operate autonomously, communicating wirelessly with a remote receiver and, ideally, harvesting waste energy. Sentient demonstrated an autonomous, temperature-measuring cage sensor during the first part of Phase I, proving the feasibility of the approach. During the second part of Phase I, Sentient will incorporate vibration monitoring and will push the maximum operating temperature of the sensor to 200 \u00b0C. The Phase II goals are to push the maximum operating temperature to 300 \u00b0C, optimize sensor communication for the metallic environment inside the turbine engine, design and build a complementary receiver, and test the cage sensor on a representative system, if not on an actual turbine engine. By the end of Phase II, Sentient will have a fully functional, autonomous cage sensor that is ready for integration into a JSF turbine engine, and into the JSF PHM system.",

SSI proposes to develop a Radiance Simulation Toolkit to predict the spectral illumination of RSOs from geophysical sources for space object characterization, pointing and tracking of satellites, as well as to support the management and adaptive tasking of sensors on both ground and space-based platforms.  The proposed effort also includes an assessment of the possibility of characterizing small satellites via the spectral signature of their exhaust plumes, which provides information on satellite mass, engine thrust and propellant type, as well as the thrust vector. The proposed Toolkit is based on innovative concepts demonstrated in Phase I that couple short-term troposphere-to-ionosphere weather forecasts and an Earth surface model with radiative transport calculations to predict the spectral irradiance illuminating the RSO. Predicting the target spectral signature will involve integrating the source illumination with an RSO hardbody model, exhaust plume radiance map, and sensor models.  The Toolkit should significantly aid in the characterization of the capabilities and intent of RSOs.",

In order to take full advantage of this \u201cnew\u201d composite system, and to compete against titanium, low-cost manufacture of AFR-PE-4E resin and prepreg must be achieved.  Current F135 and F136 engines slated for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) require ducts that total up to 300 pounds per engine.  AFR-PE-4E composite has currently been selected for these structures which will require continuous service temperatures in excess of 316\u00baC (600\u00baF) while retaining maximum physical strength. The high cost of AFR-PE-4 resin is primarily driven by the high cost of the 4-PEPA and 6FDA monomers.  Reducing the AFR-PE-4E resin cost can be realized through obtaining alternate monomer sources.  The major goal of the Phase II SBIR program is to identify a combination of lower cost monomer suppliers and demonstrate their suitability through fabrication of carbon fabric prepreg trial lots and discriminator panels.  Chemical characterization and physical mechanical testing is planned to provide a thorough assessment of batch-to-batch reproducibility, storage stability, and reactive behavior.  The thermal performance, processing characteristics, and cost benefits will be determined and compared to the baseline AFR-PE-4E material.",

The principal focus of the proposed work will be on uniaxial nonlinear optical crystals for mid-IR high power laser sources.  Laser damage on the surface and in the bulk is at least in part due to the use of inefficient, not walk-off corrected nonlinear optical crystals resulting in thermal effects and the need to use a high pump power for a desired output power.  Zinc germanium phosphide (ZnGeP2; ZGP) appears to be the most important representative of this group but the chalcogenide AgGaSe2 will also be investigated.  In addition, KTiOPO4 (KTP) will receive attention because its use as optical parametric oscillator up to 4 \u00b5m IR generation also is principally limited by birefringent walk-off, and for its overall commercial potential.

Toward this end, both field-portable equipment (such as X-ray fluorescence instruments and anodic stripping voltammetry) and colorimetric spot test kits (based on sulfide or rhodizonate ion) have been used.

        "abstract": "Accurate models for the atmosphere are critical to the performance of signature-based hyperspectral target-detection algorithms.  The problem of recovering atmospheric properties from a hyperspectral image is ill-posed in the sense that significantly different atmospheres can generate similar radiance spectra at the sensor for the same ground material.  In this project we will develop a software product, ATMOD, that combines MODTRAN forward models, image-based estimates, and weather forecast products for atmospheric modeling.  ATMOD will be integrated with state-of-the-art detection algorithms to allow the detection and characterization of low-spectral-contrast targets such as targets concealed by vegetation or sub-pixel gas plumes.  ATMOD will consider the visible through the short-wavelength infrared and the long-wavelength infrared spectral regions.  The combined modeling and detection algorithms are designed to run in real-time on COTS hardware.  We will characterize ATMOD using a large amount of hyperspectral imagery and a large amount of forecast data.  We will also consider the transition of ATMOD for a range of applications.",

Presently, there are no codes that can adequately resolve multi-scale plasma systems with complex boundaries.  The most promising approach is Structured Adaptive Mesh refinement (SAMR). In Phase I, we successfully identified three key innovations which extend SAMR to EM-PIC simulations with conformal boundaries.  Our goal is to incorporate these innovations and develop a first-ever, multi-resolution 3D, parallel, object-oriented EM-PIC code, EMPOWER (Electro-Magnetic Particle Operation With Extended Resolution). This code will possess unique user-defined geometric precision capabilities implemented via a combination of SAMR and conformal meshing algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Finding new antibiotics to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a compelling medical need, since the inherently antibiotic resistant nature of the bacteria is being enhanced by the increasing appearance of strains resistant to all currently-marketed antibiotics.  Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a required and constitutive component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, including Ps. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Shigella species, which contributes significantly to antibiotic resistance.  WaaP is a kinase encoded by these organisms and is required for complete synthesis of LPS.  Knock-out mutations in the waaP gene are lethal in Ps. aeruginosa thus making inhibition of WaaP a useful target for the development of new antibiotics.  The goal of the proposed project is to find small molecule inhibitors of WaaP that will be developed into a new class of narrow-spectrum antibiotics especially targeted to Ps. aeruginosa.  The research proposed will support high-throughput screening of a 100,000+ compound library and numerous follow-up assays in order to identify compounds with pharmaceutical properties suitable to serve as templates for antibiotic development.

The innovation is a remote active T/R module using electro-optic true-time-delay line, which will significantly improve beam steering performance of fast response time, wide bandwidth, frequency-independent operation with reduced power consumption and increased remoting length for future XBR systems.  Unlike any existing approaches, the unique feature of the proposed device is that a large number of different time-delayed signals can be generated simultaneously at a single output end based on innovative electro-optic Bragg gratings in a single-mode optical fiber.  Another unique feature of proposed devices is the low loss propagation immune to electro-magnetic interference.  This property makes the proposed device idea for remoting the transmitter/receiver (T/R) module in a large scale XBR.  It allows placement of each T/R module\u2019s receiver and exciter in any location of interest, where constrains of the size and weight can be significantly relaxed.

This project will develop an integrated 3D Java framework for a user interactive Virtual Body framework, which can serve as a Virtual Body for anthropometry/anatomy based generation of human body models for biomechanics, physiology, and injury simulators. In Phase I we developed a software framework for visual manipulation and processing of human body anthropometric, skeletal, vascular and other databases. We also demonstrated the framework for scan/anatomy based virtual human body model generation and predictive simulation of cardiovascular system responses to high-g aircraft maneuvers. The fully developed Virtual Body developed in Phase II will allow for complete user control and editing of morphing capabilities including: skeletal, muscular, vascular, skin, and other anatomical systems. It will provide the capability to generate/edit the static/dynamic human body models from laser scans, anthropometric databases, even pictures for predictive modeling of human body performance. The Virtual Body will also act as a data-generator/preprocessor for available human body simulation software biomechanics, ergonomics, cardiopulmonary physiology, blast injury and other simulators. It will be demonstrated on modeling pilot biomechanical and physiological responses to test and combat stresses.",

        "abstract": "A key element to attaining decision superiority is the effective and timely use of ISR assets. The capabilities of manned and unmanned collection platforms, combined with space-based assets portend a huge increase in the effectiveness of ISR to achieve decision superiority. However, a key impediment remains the effective command and control of ISR assets and the associated lack of automated decision support systems. To fully realize the benefits of ISR platforms and their capabilities and to support the overall construct of effects based operations, decision support systems are needed to assist ISR planning staff in optimal planning and mission rehearsal of their associated assets to support effects assessment. Here, we propose an Integrated ISR Plan Analysis and Rehearsal System (I2PARS) for effects assessment. The system consists of five functional components: a user interface for scenario specification and ISR mission visualization; a GIS processing component for supporting map-based display and geospatial processing; an ISR mission plan optimization manager; an evolutionary algorithm--based mission plan generation component; and a data translation bridge for interoperability. We see considerable potential for this approach to address key decision support functionality required for the AOC ISR battlestaff.",

The feasibility of the method, established during the Phase I research, will be demonstrated during Phase II, when diagnostic and scaled prototype detectors will be implemented.  When coupled to an intense pulsed neutron source, the fast response and sizable detection areas of BaF2 scintillators permit the rapid imaging of the environment in a relatively economical package.  Furthermore, the vigorous competition from background gamma-rays can be managed by deploying a segmented detector, which permits the use of a single high intensity neutron pulse or a rapid series of smaller pulses.  The main focus of the Phase II research is on implementing the detection scheme so that the imaging capability can be optimized.  To that end, diagnostic detectors will be used during Year 1 of the research to develop the pulse sensing hardware and image reconstruction software that will be used in the full-scale imager.  During Year 2, a scaled prototype will be implemented using detector elements optimized in size and configuration in a modular arrangement.",

About 75% of all Navy piers and wharves are over 40 years-old and required increased repair and maintenance. The U.S. Navy is continually looking for the best methods and materials to repair its reinforced concrete waterfront structures. Cracking of concrete and on-going corrosion of embedded reinforcing steel is the principal problem associated with premature deterioration of reinforced concrete structures.  The extensive research conducted during Phase I of this project leads us to the development of a simple, low cost process of treating recycled rubber, which was introduced into an off-the-shelf concrete repair product.   The use of surface treated recycled rubber in cement-based concrete repair material improved its extensibility and crack resistance properties. During Phase II of this project, it is proposed here to further optimize the concrete repair mixture and demonstrate the feasibility in field-testing by performing the real-life repair of concrete structures. The utilization of waste rubber tires, as source material is compliant with Navy goals for sustainability in construction.  This success of Phase II will also allow for commercialization (Phase III) for civilian applications such as concrete buildings, bridges, airfields and highways.",

Silicon Carbide is an emerging technology, that promises dramatic enhancements in size, weight, and reliability of power converters, and therefore significant work is required to accurately model the aging and wear out mechanisms.  The significant benefits of SiC technology, and the increased confidence level in critical survivability of the converter, for manned and unmanned airborne applications, motivates this work.  It is expected that the prognostic control techniques demonstrated here can accelerate adoption and application of this and other new semiconductor technologies, by addressing concerns with the new devices and unknown failure mechanisms.   The methodology developed uses predictive modeling and simple robust sensing to avoid excessive sensing requirements in the prognostics of complex converters.  This approach requires detailed knowledge of the aging mechanisms, the physical driving forces behind these mechanisms and the observable precursors of failure.  The precise history of the system, combined with measurement and modeling, can then predict that the system will not fail, within a given time frame, with a high degree of confidence.",

Lightweight high strength materials have greatly advanced the capabilities of jet aircraft, munitions, space vehicles, as well as ground support vehicles. However, it is impossible to avoid delamination cracks and micro-cracks in fiber-epoxy based composite materials that can even be caused by small impacts during transport and handling of munitions. We have begun developing a self-healing technology, which repairs these defects with high healing efficiency and can be implemented on conventional fiber reinforced \u2013 epoxy composites used in munitions and other aerospace applications. In Phase I, we demonstrated that thermally initiated self-healing of an epoxy-based system can be accomplished by controlling its chemistry.  The modulus of a self-healed sample was comparable to that of the control sample in the low strain region.  Unlike previous approaches, our technology simultaneously closes and seals the crack.  In Phase II, the chemistry and microstructure of the self-healing polymeric system will be optimized to achieve the desired mechanical properties and high self-healing efficiency.  Additionally, fiber-reinforced composites will be fabricated using this novel polymeric system, and evaluated for performance. The goal is to demonstrate that fiber reinforced composites with high self-healing efficiency can be developed. Two leading research institutions are collaborating with us in the proposed program.

While they are the future, IBRs tend to be expensive components, so proper care and maintenance is both necessary and warranted.  At the core of their upkeep is the characterization of their vibrational properties and, more specifically, the damping characteristics of the individual blades.  The physical phenomenon is complicated because the component is one piece of material and the behavior of each blade influences the behavior of the others.   The objective of the proposed work is to develop a method for extracting information about the damping, excitation forces, and frequency mistuning of individual blades from the vibratory response of the IBR as a whole.  The vibration data could be from non-rotating bench-top experiments or rotating experiments such as a spin-pit or engine test.  The method would work with non-linear coatings so that the bench-top experiments could serve as the basis of an inspection machine for coated IBR/Blisks.  In addition, a nonlinear forced response prediction code will be developed for predicting how IBR/Blisks with nonlinear coatings will vibrate when they are used in the engine.",

Initial research will focus on slow moving and crossing target detection in dense clutter environments using multi-channel array data for a variety of radar/platform architectures.  Validation of performance will be accomplished with the aid of meta-model simulation tools.  As part of these primary tasks, we will develop methods of modeling slow moving target motion to adequately simulate notional STDA GMTI operation.  We will establish performance metrics for the notional radar architectures.  Subsystem requirements will be developed as part of the normal requirements flow down process, including digital signal processing throughput and latency requirements.

THz frequencies however have not been fully and successfully utilized because of a lack of compact high power sources and high efficiency detectors. To address these needs, EIC Laboratories proposes to grow large-area, defect free ultrapure nonlinear optical crystals for generating and detecting THz radiation in the 0.3 \u2013 20 THz range (10-600 cm-1).  In Phase I, we have investigated various high and narrow bandgap semiconductor crystals for their THz performance as emitters and/or detectors.  Among these semiconductors, covering a wide THz spectrum from 100 GHz to 40 THz, we have identified a few for in-detail investigation in the Phase II effort.  The Phase II research will concentrate on producing defect-free, high optical quality, large crystals from zone-refined precursor materials using vertical modified Bridgman technique. Extensive growth modeling/simulation and crystal characterization will be used to optimize crystal growth conditions.  The performance of these materials as THz sources and sensors will be evaluated. Practical applications of the THz crystals in explosives and non-explosives detection, bio molecules, various amino acids forming proteins and personnel identification by hair and skin analysis will be demonstrated.",

Alternative designs have focused on complex multilayering to increase the effective emissivity of the material, whereas Andrews Space will focus on reducing the thickness, thus decreasing the overall system mass.

There are two basic elements: (1) continually detecting and modeling the observable 3-D obstacle field in real-time, and (2) autonomously guiding the vehicle to accomplish a given set of mission objectives while ensuring there are no collisions with obstacles.  A key innovation of the proposed approach is maturation of a technique to accomplish the stated objective that requires only a single 2-D image stream (a stream available on essentially every unmanned air vehicle in the inventory today). A key technical challenge is to realize the system in hardware that simultaneously meets demand for real-time execution of computationally intense algorithms and severe constraints on subsystem mass, volume and power consumption. Demonstrated phase I algorithms will immediately move into practical implementation and evaluation on an existing low-cost surrogate flight test vehicle using commercial-off-the-shelf FPGA hardware. Hardware and software design specific to integration on the Wasp micro air vehicle will proceed in parallel.  Flight demonstration of the developed technology on the production Wasp vehicle is proposed as a program option.",

Using existing detonators, the highest hazard classification a fully assembled weapon can achieve is Division 1.2.3. This  limitation is due to the sensitive explosive components necessary to start the initiation process. Although direct initiation of an EIDS using current state of the art Exploding Foil Initiator (EFI) technology has been demonstrated, it required a large, unweaponizable, amount of electrical energy.  The development of a 1.6 Detonator would significantly reduce logistics cost, improve overall safety, and enable a 67% increase in igloo storage capacity of fully assembled weapons such as the Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) and the Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM).  The Phase II effort will build on the Phase I confinement experiments and KOWIN software analysis. These results indicate that a 1.6 Detonator may be achievable using confinement, geometry, and a correctly designed EFI. The main objective of this effort will be to produce a breadboard level fireset coupled with an initiator of a size that would be weaponizable and then perform limited testing of that system.",

In Phase I, a probabilistic approach using basic statistical techniques (response surfaces and Monte Carlo simulations) was developed to show the potential of test reduction through simulation. Feasibility of the approach was demonstrated using conceived augmentor simulation and experimental data. The need for highly accurate simulations was shown, and will be addressed in Phase II. In Phase II, cutting-edge CFD technologies of 1) Second Order Second Moment (SOSM) method, and 2) non-linear, sensitivity derivatives using Automatic Differentiation (AD), will be developed to propagate uncertainties through the simulation. These technologies will be implemented into the highly accurate DREAM code being developed under AFRL sponsorship, thus creating the much-needed infrastructure in CFD to meet the accuracy requirements of probabilistic methodology. For initial demonstration on a simple engine sub-component, the AFRL Augmentor High-Impact-Technology (HIT) rig will be analyzed.

Metallized carbon nanofiber has the large aspect ratio of vapor-grown carbon nanofiber and the high electrical conductivity of the metal. It can introduce significant electrical conductivity and shielding effectiveness to polymers at moderate concentrations. In Phase I, Materials Research Institute developed two processes capable of producing highly conductive metallized carbon nanofiber. A new dispersion scheme was established for integrating the metallized carbon nanofiber with polymers. The resulting composite material exhibited much improved electrical conductivity. In Phase II, the metallization processes will be optimized for commercialization. New and improved processing schemes will be investigated for incorporating the metallized carbon nanofiber into adhesives, coating materials, and structural polymers for EMI shielding, electrical grounding, and lightning strike protection applications. Electrical conductivity and shielding effectiveness of the prototype materials will be characterized to validate the proposed technology.",

The drive can function without the use of liquid lubricants and will be able to operate at very cold temperatures and over a wide range of temperatures by using low wear, high friction solid lubricant materials.  Liquid lubricants currently used in gear drives tend to become too viscous to flow at low temperature and too thin to lubricate at high temperatures.  Because these drives use no liquids, \"oil free\" traction drives will not encounter the problems associated with the changing oil viscosities of liquid lubricants which will enable them to operate reliably over a wide range of temperatures.

The objective for developing SAFTTS is to support the Air Force\u2019s objective of Operationally Responsive Space through demonstrating technologies that reduce significantly the cost and scheduling hurdles presently associated with launch vehicle operations.  Current space launch operations require extensive networks of remote, ground-based tracking and communications sites to provide Range support, and are available only at limited geographic launch areas. Existing Ranges require long turnaround times and are costly to use due to aging equipment costs and fixed staffing costs. Using space-based assets for tracking and communications functions, along with on-board autonomous intelligent software flight termination capabilities, can combine to lessen launch/operating costs, reduce logistics and launch complexity, and reduce turnaround time, all while continuing to provide unsurpassed safety. Development of key \u201cDestruct\u201d algorithms identified and started in Phase I and used by today\u2019s Range Safety Officers (RSO) is proposed.

An immediate benefit of this research will be the availability of tool for the detection of rootkits that have been maliciously introduced onto Windows platforms.

This more flexible approach will allow the identification of a much wider class of rootkits than previously attainable.

The smart material pumps have been successfully built to operate at high frequencies, but valve limitations have consistently reduced overall performance.

A new unified pressurization and valving approach makes use of existing architecture in the pressurization systems, employing piezoelectric, magnetostrictive, or similar smart materials, and couples compact valve sets to the assembly.  A current design, which links the valve motion to that of the reciprocating prime mover, has been developed and tested with promising results, including an increase in the optimal drive frequency.  Additional design, testing, and analysis are proposed for a Phase 2 effort to further increase the functional bandwidth of the valves and the power density of the actuators.

        "abstract": "Toyon Research Corporation, teamed with Teledyne Scientific, proposes to develop a hybrid T/R module for application to large space-based antenna arrays using multiple technologies that are optimized for specific functions within the module. This approach runs counter to previous thrusts to develop a single-chip T/R module, which invariably involve a compromise in performance. In the past, taking the hybrid approach meant accepting higher losses in transitioning on- and off-chip and higher costs integrating multiple chips in return for the increased performance with each chip. Due to the availability of new flip-chip MMIC assembly machines that are capable of reliably bonding many thousands of parts per hour with extremely low loss and virtually no parasitic effects on bonded components, the performance and cost penalties of hybridization are largely eliminated and the only downside is the somewhat larger area for the T/R module compared with the single-chip approach. Further, the hybrid approach actually reduces cost for the T/R module by increasing yields for screened parts. It also allows a \u201cplug-n-play\u201d design capability wherein the same basic T/R module architecture can be tailored to the specific application, whether it is LEO or MEO radar or LEO or GEO communications payloads.",

We are witnessing a revolutionary change in the computing environments as legacy stove-piped systems are giving way to flexible customizable multi-agent systems. However, most of the currently available multi-agent systems do not sufficiently address the requirements and needs of information assurance (IA). Even current research does not fully address some of the hard problems posed by the requirements for availability, integrity, confidentiality, authentication, and non-repudiation. 21st Century Systems, Incorporated (21CSI) is pleased to propose to continue the research and development of tools and methodologies to allow the application of a definable set of information assurance rules to the development and run-time monitoring of software agents. 21CSI\u2019s Information Assurance for Intelligent Agents (IA2) project encompasses: a powerful rules-based static analysis implemented as a plug-in to the Eclipse IDE; a tamper-proof deployment methodology; and the run-time monitoring of agents executing on popular agent platforms.

MOST apertures could serve as very lightweight, discrete, hybrid reflectors for SSA applications further amplifying the system level gains possible through the implementation of a common Visible/RF aperture.  The key innovation is the combination of an aperture that is large enough to be suitable from an RF perspective and precise enough for an inner region to function optically, yet remain light enough to meet system level mass goals.  RF gain has been demonstrated from S to Ka-Band and interferometric optical measurements are beginning to be made.  Building on Phase I successes, the Phase II effort focuses on working with industry partners to refine a point design, advancing TRL level of the RF shells, and demonstrating closed loop system optical performance of relevant MOST sub-apertures.

However, chlorination cannot be used without consideration to the impact of discharged chlorinated waters on marine ecosystems as water with significant levels of residual chlorine is toxic to many kinds of aquatic life.

        "abstract": "Accurate and efficient sensitivity and uncertainty analysis tools are needed for modeling and simulation codes.  Automatic Differentiation (AD) is a process by which an existing computer model is automatically \"enhanced\" to provide a complete sensitivity (Jacobian) matrix of all code outputs with respect to all inputs in a single run of the enhanced code.  Although termed \"automatic\", the out-of-the-box AD tools require significant skill and manual effort to properly enhance the simulation code.   OKSI, teamed with the developer of the AD technology, has created \u2014 under previous MDA efforts \u2014 a simplified and powerful AD implementation process, appropriately named Automated Automatic Differentiation (A2D).  This package improves the automation in several ways: 1) setting up the process, 2) dealing with the AD preprocessor conflicts, 3) establishing a powerful graphical user interface, 4)validating the sensitivity results, and 5) creating error tracing tools to pinpoint the line of code introducing the validation error.  A subset of the Optical Signatures Code (OSC) was used as a testbed for the development of the A2D.  As such, extensive experience was gained in working with OSC, understanding the potential pitfalls in differentiating the code, and establishing a proof of feasibility in the process.  The capability was recently demonstrated with the complete suite of JANNAF low altitude plume codes.   OKSI has teamed with the OSC developer, Teledyne Solutions Inc. (TSI), who will provide the guidance to assure that AD-OSC best meets the needs of the large OSC user base.  TSI will also support independent verification and validation (IV&V). With the given Phase-I head start, during Phase-II OKSI / TSI will focus on producing an AD-enhanced version of OSC (AD-OSC) that encompasses the entire OSC code.  AD-OSC will be able provide sensitivity/uncertainty analysis for any OSC scenario.  The end product of the Phase-II will be AD-OSC ready for distribution to the user community.  Under additional Optional tasks, OKSI will also implement AD-OSC into an inverse problem solution \u2014 called ASCOPE \u2014 for the extraction of model parameters when matching code predictions with sensor measurements.  Under a second Option, OKSI will apply AD to the OPTISIG code and perform extended testing and validation on the AD-OSC/OPTISIG codes.",

Producing such a dome in a cost effective manner will require achieving the optimal balance between competing requirements. Selection of durable dome materials, with suitable transparency, high speed/tight tolerance fabrication techniques, and potentially the incorporation of suitable grid/resonant structures to provide EMI shielding are all critical to the development of optimal multimode seeker dome designs.  During the Phase I effort, Surmet has performed a trade study on candidate dome materials, design and manufacturing concepts.  Leading substrate materials have been identified as ALON or Spinel for seekers employing MWIR imaging modes, and Zinc Sulfide for seekers employing LWIR imaging. As a result of the Phase I effort, three key technologies were identified for further development under Phase II.  Slip casting of material blanks and high speed optical finishing techniques offer the opportunity to reduce ALON dome costs in high volumes.  Protective coatings are required to protect the relatively soft and weak LWIR dome substrates in external environments.

Brighter, less stable, non-traditional X-ray sources were also considered for possible XNAV application with promising initial results, especially for formation flying applications.  Taking advantage of concurrent XNAV efforts at DARPA to the maximum extent possible, Phase II will develop and validate XNAV algorithms via a simulation which will be targeted for integration with Goddard Space Flight Center's GPS Enhanced Onboard Navigation System (GEONS) software.  The error budget will be developed in more detail to support the algorithm and simulation work.  XNAV holds great potential for NASA as an enabling technology for fully autonomous interplanetary navigation and could provide a significant mission enhancement as an adjunct to the Deep Space Network (DSN) and ground based navigation.",

        "abstract": "There are numerous challenges associated with maintaining high-quality performance in complex operational environments. For Air Weapons Controllers (AWCs), maintaining high levels of proficiency is a critical and challenging task because of the complexity of the domain. AWCs are primarily responsible for enhancing the situational awareness of the fighter pilots with whom they are working. Opportunities for practicing skills for maintaining situational awareness are often limited by requirements for full crews of human teammates, qualified instructors, and access to full-up simulation platforms. Even in Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) training research exercises, the focus of training is often not on the AWC.  The AWC primarily serves a supporting role to the pilots during DMO exercises.  Thus, assessment and feedback of the AWC\u2019s performance is often a peripheral activity for the instructor. What formal methods of assessment that do exist involve analyses of observed performance that do not provide immediate feedback to trainees. To meet these challenges we propose developing Scenario-based Performance Assessment for Dynamic Environments (SPADE), a vignette-based tool for assessing AWC performance before and after a DMO exercise. Based on MECSM products, SPADE will provide competency-based training and assessment opportunities to AWCs in order to supplement and maximize current DMO training.",

        "abstract": "The environment which the US military must operate has grown increasingly complex. Successful command hinges on the ability to quickly assemble and assign capable teams to cope with emergent demands, often across barriers of time and space. It is imperative that a commander be able to quickly identify personnel that have the required capabilities and expertise to carry out the necessary tasks in both a face-to-face and a virtual team environment.  Locating and accessing critically needed knowledge and expertise is often a significant challenge for military commanders. We propose to develop the TeamBuilder software package to enable military commanders to rapidly identify and assemble ad hoc teams, whose members have the expertise to execute specified types of missions, and are likely to work together well as a team. The commander will specify what needs to be done, when and where, and TeamBuilder will recommend who should be assigned to the mission and summarize why they are qualified for the job.  The Aptima team will apply their knowledge of teamwork theory, experience extracting information from unstructured text, skills in integrating disparate data including communications data, and know-how on processing data to create ideal teams using both algorithmic optimization and social networks.",

Using a set of nine key attributes mapped to the four categories and 26 associated views from DODAF, our assessment tool will enable quantified comparisons to an established reference architecture.  The assessment tool enables a user to answer a series of questions structured to compare, measure, and drive consistency across all inputs. Key capabilities of this architectural assessment tool are its ability to (1) Incorporate the impacts of emerging technology and (2) Measure the enablement for Human Systems Integration (HSI) factors to assist with reduced manning, operator workload, and automation related analysis.  This tool is currently planned for use by PEO Submarines with engineering trade studies, technology impact assessments, and Advanced Processor/Tactical Build (APB/ATB) planning.

A prior program at Creare resulted in the design of a two stage, high-capacity turbo-Brayton cryocooler.  The cryocooler is comparable in mass and efficiency with competing cryocooler technologies and has the inherent benefits of negligible vibration emittance, ability to cool remote or distributed loads, and high reliability.  The continuous flow nature of the turbo-Brayton cycle allows heat to be transported many meters from the cryocooler to thermal interfaces.  In addition, the cryocooler can be configured with ultra flexible tubes to provide heat transport from gimbal mounted instruments without the use of two phase heat transport systems or conductive straps.  During the proposed program, we will continue with the development of the cryocooler by demonstrating a high capacity compressor.  The other key components in the system\u2014the turboalternators, recuperative heat exchangers, and electronics\u2014have been demonstrated or are under development.  The successful development of the compressor is predicted to reduce cryocooler input power by 20 to 30%.

Aerius Photonics has developed an advanced in-line optical preamplifier (I-LOP) technology to enhance the performance of LADAR receiver systems by optically amplifying return pulses 100 to 200x prior to signal detection.  The new I-LOP technology is a complementary technology that can be used to boost the performance of high-sensitivity detector technologies (APD, PIN) that are presently being developed for LADAR applications.  The I-LOP can simultaneously provide high gain, low noise, and offers the future potential for high-speed detector gating.  By inserting the optical preamplifier in the optical system path, before the final detector, LADAR return pulse intensities can be increased by over 100 times prior to detection and additional amplification by the high-sensitivity detector.  By utilizing these I-LOP modules it will be possible to greatly enhance the performance of laser radar and laser rangefinder systems operating at 1064 nm and eye-safe wavelengths in the near IR.

The possibility exists, therefore, that a skilled foreign attacker can modify the circuit between the original design tapeout and its fabrication.

AR&C is identified as a critical enabling technology for future NASA Exploration and DoD missions including NASA's CEV, operation and commercial cargo re-supply to ISS, lunar transfer vehicle assembly and MARS missions. Multiple sensors that provide relative measurements of range, bearing and pose are the key to meeting the safety related issues with implementation of this technology.\n\nThis Phase II effort will provide a real-time hardware-in-the-loop demonstration using the robotic arm to autonomously capture a target spacecraft. The baseline demonstration uses a ground-based variant of the Space Shuttle robotic arm to grapple an uncooperative target. In Phase II, AOS will build an HGS prototype and demonstrate its performance in a hardware-in-the-loop scenario. The prototype employs a modular design approach to the integrated sensor suite. Initially, only the sensor subset addressing passive range and pose estimation will be implemented. Additional sensor modalities will be added as determined in the requirements development. \n\nThe demonstration baseline employs a robotic arm supported on an air bearing floor and a free floating robot operating as the target vehicle. An air bearing floor allows the arm and target to move freely in three relative degrees of freedom. HGS provides an error signal and possibly associated rates along the axes. These signals drive the arm guidance with sufficient accuracy to successfully grapple the target.",

Non-intrusive high frequency electrical field probes of high sensitivity have both military applications in fields of high power microwave weapon (HPM) development, and wide commercial applications.. Based on the successful demonstration of a 33GHz electrical field sensor with high sensitivity of 0.1v/m in Phase-I program, in this phase-II program, we propose to further develop this new class of compact non-intrusive electrical-field sensor that can work up to 96GHz with high sensitivity of 0.1v/m. This new class of sensor is closely coupled with recent progress in electro-optic (EO) material and ultra-high frequency EO modulator researches and having the critical performance attributes that have been long sought for both military and commercial applications. The sensor utilizes high-speed phase matching 96GHz electro-optic modulator technology and incorporates efficient antennas with an integrated amplifier that is powered via an optical fiber. Agiltron\u2019s on-going world-class new EO material development and Nano-speed switch and modulator technology promises to further extend the sensor bandwidth well above 96 GHz with sensitivity better than 0.1v/m. The proposed non-intrusive fiber-optic electrical-field sensor is also compact and cost effective which has not been attained before.",

Preliminary tests have been carried out to show the feasibility of the preparation of the cathode electrode by painting. The capacity of the cell with the painted cathode was better than that of the standard cell with the pressed-powder (PP) cathode. This cell also showed lower polarization during phase transitions due to improved mechanical bonding between cathode (FeS2) particles.  The data presented substantiate the contention that painted electrodes offer equivalent performance as standard PP electrodes but at a much lower cost. Work is needed to optimize the spraying conditions to achieve higher throughput and equivalent electrochemical performance in full-sized batteries.  Also proposed is using this technology to prepare full-sized batteries by applying this technology to painted separators and anodes to ultimately prepare an entire three-layered composite cell.

Our revolutionary approach is to develop a new junction architecture, the lateral-collection planar micro-junction based on single-layer Liquid Phased Epitaxy (LPE), that is more tolerant of defects and that eliminates interfaces and process steps where contamination and defects can be introduced. This new technology will be compatible with usual silicon Read Out Integrated Circuits (ROICs) for back illuminated Focal Plane Arrays (FPAs). The proposed planar lateral-collection micro-junction is a new junction architecture for HgCdTe that has important benefits over traditional two-layer LPE mesa structure, which should lead to improved operability and array yield. Because it is a planar architecture, the thickness and quality of the critical CdTe passivation layer is more controllable and reproducible.  Small-area unit cells, below 20x20 \u00b5m\u00b2, are facilitated. Operability and yield should both be improved because the new fabrication process is much simpler. The mesa etch step is eliminated, and there is no need for LPE growth of a second HgCdTe layer.  Photolithography on planar surfaces is also easier.

        "abstract": "A new structural joining technique is under development which employs a massive number of nanomaterials to achieve unique combinations of properties.  One-dimensional nanomaterials (nanotubes, nanohelices, etc.) are anchored onto the opposite faces of the joint, and compatibly functionalized and engaged to form chemical bonds over their tremendous surface areas.  The exceptional mechanical, physical and functional attributes as well as the tremendous surface area and aspect ratio of one-dimensional nanomaterials effectively restore the mechanical and physical (thermal, electric, etc.) continuity across the joint.  The slender, compatibly functionalized nanomaterials act as flexible molecular chains with pronounced energetic preference (versus entropic resistance) toward chemical bonding at near-ambient conditions; the joining process thus minimizes any damage to materials, and offers major energy and environmental advantages.  Nano-engineered joints embody several design variables which can be tailored to meet diverse performance requirements; they can effectively join dissimilar materials, and accommodate thermal expansion mismatch.  Nano-engineered joints can complement high mechanical attributes with multi-functional features such as integrated health monitoring and thermal conduction (or insulation) for heat management. The Phase I project has developed: (i) a comprehensive theoretical framework for modeling the mechanical behavior of nano-enigneered joints; (ii) processing techniques for anchorage of aligned nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes and silica nanohelices) onto various substrates; (iii) methodologies to compatibly functionalize and engage nanomaterials for chemical bond formation (and mechanical interlocking in the case of nanohelices); and (iv) experimental data on progressively refined nano-engineered joints, yielding shear strengths of about 20 MPa which (at this early stage of development) compare well against modern aerospace adhesives.  The proposed Phase II project will continue the Phase II research toward: (i) development of comprehensive design procedures for nano-engineered joints; (ii) establishment of versatile, high-throughput, low-cost, energy-efficient and environmentally benign techniques for production of broad categories of nano-engineered joints; (iii) design, fabrication and thorough characterization of representative aerospace joints within composite structures and also between structural composites and thermal protection ceramics (selected joint designs will be evaluated by Boeing under simulated service conditions); and (iv) assessment of the competitive performance, and the cost, energy and environmental implications of nano-engineered joints versus competing technologies, and development of refined strategies for market transition.",

If similar performance could be realized in autonomous flying vehicles and weapons, it would greatly enhance their effectiveness by enabling near-ground flight in urban, forest, and indoor/in-cave environments. We have investigated the integration of biomimetic visual motion detection and flight control for collision avoidance in Phase I. Visual processing is based on adaptive motion detection as observed in flies. Adaptation has the effect of reducing detector dependence on non-motion-related parameters of visual stimuli, improving estimates of optic flow. The control theory is based on a model for wide-field neurons (tangential cells) that spatially integrate local optic flow estimates. The outputs of these integrators are applied as feedback signals for direct control of vehicle dynamics. When combined, these algorithms provide a reflexive or inner control loop for avoiding collisions and centering in clutter. In Phase II we propose to develop a demonstration of the combined algorithms in autonomous vehicles, develop an implementation suitable for use in a small UAV, integrate the lower-level reflexive guidance with higher- or mission-level control, and establish a road map for integration into an operational micro-UAV in Phase III.",

However, these advances have not been paralleled in the performance and availability of single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) based on similar design and materials platforms.  Moreover, the limited work that has been done to date has been focused on optimizing devices for telecommunications wavelengths in the vicinity of 1550 nm, and there has been even less effort towards devices for use at 1064 nm.  For this SBIR program, we propose to apply innovative design concepts for the development of high performance SPADs optimized for 1064 nm applications.  In particular, we will implement novel bandgap and electric-field engineering approaches to tailor the SPAD avalanche gain properties to realize higher single photon detection efficiency while maintaining the very low dark count rates that are made possible by optimizing the absorption region design for the detection of 1064 nm photons.  We will apply design concepts that we have innovated during Phase I of this program (as well as in the course of developing state-of-the-art 1550 nm SPADs) that involve optimization of the device electric profile for photon counting as well as epitaxial layer compositions.  These efforts will culminate in 1064 nm large area detectors (with active area diameters up to 500 um) that demonstrate feasibility in meeting NASA performance targets including 50% detection efficiency, bandwidth of 500 MHz, saturation levels of 50 Mcounts/s, and non-gated operation.

Even a relatively low-yield nuclear device can result in depletion of all un-hardened LEO assets within a short time.  Particularly severe space weather events, such as corona mass ejections can also serve to significantly degrade the life of our assets.  Replacement of our spacecraft in this environment without clean-up isn\u2019t practical, because their lifetime would be vastly degraded.  Methods are being investigated to reduce the intensity of enhanced radiation belts by transmitting VLF electromagnetic waves from space-based assets which will pitch-angle scatter the electrons via cyclotron-resonant wave-particle interactions.  Proton scattering, a much harder problem due to the need to transmit at even lower, less efficiently propagating frequencies, is also investigated.  The proposed effort is concerned with the design and development of responsive technology necessary to make such a system operational: 1. Conductive, high-capacitance, long (1,000-m class) VLF antennas, with high volumetric stowage efficiencies. 2.

The concept builds from APELC\u2019s successful development of the Gatling Marx generator system, in which several Marx generators drive a common load, while remaining completely autonomous in their operation.  The proposed solution utilizes a similar multiple Marx generator topology, with each generator operating autonomously in its voltage output pulse magnitude and timing of the pulse delivery.  This autonomy makes the system capable of waveshaping and impedance agility for multiple load applications.  Furthermore, with temporal control of pulse delivery, the system is uniquely capable of a graceful failure. The multiple generator topology further lends itself to higher repetition rates than conventional designs, due to distributed switching which results faster switch recovery.  Repetition rates in excess of 100 Hz are anticipated, with lifetimes of millions of shots. The APELC system avoids the use of transformer oil or hazardous materials, instead utilizing solids and pressurized dry air for insulation, thus making the system independent of altitude and attitude.

Today\u2019s high-performance radars rely on electronically steered arrays made of thousands of radiating elements with a Transmit/Receiver (T/R) module connected to each element.  Typically, a T/R module contains a low-noise amplifier for the receive portion, a transmitter power amplifier, and a phase shifter integrated into one (or more) MMIC chip.  The output power of the transmitter amplifiers ranges from a few tenths of watts at millimeter wave frequencies to tens of watts at lower microwave frequencies (L/S band), and the power dissipation in amplifiers becomes a practical limit to the transmitter output power.  In normal operation of space-based radars, however, the transmitter is not turned on at all times, and the power consumption is mostly in the receiver portion.  For those reasons, one critical design goal for T/R modules is the power-added efficiency (PAE) of amplifiers, both the LNA in the receiver and the power amplifier in the transmitter.   The Phase II program will lead to the development of a single MMIC chip low-power consuming T/R module. Parameters like the RF performance, DC consumption performance and hence temperature performance will be used to find the most cost effective method to produce highly integrated T/R modules and to develop testing methods for such integrated chips. The proposed program will lead to MMIC design concepts and T/R module designs for achieving the required performance and reliability for space qualified subsystems. Beyond the specific MMIC mentioned, this Phase II SBIR will make significant contributions in mHEMT device characterization and the commercialization of mHEMT technology.",

These motor drives developed in the Phase II program will be of higher reliability and efficiency than present motor drives with reduced requirement for forced air cooling. These inverter modules will be used in a modular design to produce a 50kW and up to a 138kW motor drive for NAVY applications. In the Phase II option, the packaging will undergo only minor modifications to be insertion ready for all SiC components.

However, modern electronics and sensor technology have now developed to where it is conceivable to autonomously detect, identify, and obtain enough data to aim and detonate weapons based upon known target vulnerabilities. In effect, we now have the opportunity to develop a more ideal weapon, capable of defeating its target set with a minimum amount of high explosive and fragments, thereby minimizing collateral damage. To do this, it is first required to develop an algorithm to define optimal endgame conditions that maximize target defeat. This can be done using current analysis codes and processes used in new and innovative ways. Once these optimal endgame conditions are defined, modern guidance systems can be set to intercept the endgame trajectory some distance from the target to achieve the selected optimal endgame scenario and defeat the target.",

Instead, APELC employs the use of solid insulators and dry, breathable, pressurized air. This proposal also brings an R&D component to further the development of enhanced resonant structures that will bring high efficiency to the proposed system, thereby making it well suited for airborne applications concerned with energy resources.

Executable architecture data model (EADM) developed in a feasibility study now allows for tools to embed within architecture descriptive execution rules that can be unambiguously interpreted by other tools.

Complete interoperability will be achieved within CPN-based tools (VSO, CPN-Tools).  Limited interoperability for IDEF0 and UML tools may result from incomplete or opaque specification of execution rules.  A gap analysis will identify these limitations.  Performed tests will establish whether the semantics of one tool\u2019s execution rules are preserved when translated from its local execution format to EADM XML implementation format and then converted to the local execution format of the second tool.

        "abstract": "Bio-inspired adhesives are under development which employ nanofibrillar structures for reliable and strong adhesion to various substrates.  Applications toward micro air vehicle locomotion and in broader dry adhesives markets are emphasized.  Biological adhesives (employed by gecko, spider, etc.) rely on multi-scale structures with nanofibrillar contact elements for effective adhesion to rough or smooth surfaces of diverse materials.  The nanofibrillar structure enables reliable achievement of high adhesion capacity despite surface flaws and variable contact angles.  The nano-scale structure also lowers the required preload pressure, offers stability under high-amplitude fatigue, and provides inherent self-cleaning capabilities.  The multi-scale structure of biological adhesives allows them accommodate the surface roughness and assume different configurations favoring strong attachment and convenient detachment.   The Phase I research is implementing an integrated theoretical/experimental research program, which has so far led to: (i) comprehensive theoretical modeling of bio-inspired adhesion mechanisms; (ii) development of alternative processing techniques for production of bio-inspired adhesives; and (iii) production and experimental evaluation of progressively refined bio-inspired adhesive systems.  The proposed Phase II project will build upon the theoretical and experimental accomplishments of Phase I research toward: (i) refinement, expansion and integration of the theoretical models and design methodologies; (ii) further development of processing techniques for efficient production of more complex and versatile nanofibrillar structures; (iii) design and production of bio-inspired adhesives, and thorough characterization of their adhesion, self-cleaning, detachment and long-term durability attributes; (iv) development of mechanisms embodying bio-inspired adhesives for effective attachment and convenient detachment, and their incorporation into novel micro air vehicle locomotion systems; (vii) tailoring of bio-inspired adhesion mechanisms toward broader markets for dry, pressure-sensitive adhesives; and (viii) competitive market analysis of the technology.  The thorough understanding of the biological adhesion mechanisms realized in Phase I research together with the strong reliance on sound theoretical principles, effective use of recent advances in nanotechnology, and close collaboration with major suppliers and end-users have been key to the success of Phase I research, and will be further emphasized in Phase II project toward full development and market transition of the technology.",

An important consideration for this system is that the vibration environment over the frequency band 0.01 to 100 Hz may be as much as 200 microrads rms in the angular domain. Commensurate linear acceleration environment is also assumed. The new Transformational Communications Satellite system (TSAT) needs a dynamic, packet switched environment. This requires constant acquisition, tracking, and termination of laser communication links. The need for seamless and efficient transitions between the acquisition and tracking modes is an important operational requirement. Efficient transitions means less time is needed to stabilize the link with a newly acquired terminal and this increases the effective system communications bandwidth. ATA is currently actively involved in these technologies and this research and development will show that a combination of the MIRU-LC and controls algorithms simplifies the interface to the controls subsystem.",

In Phase I POC developed a working SSMM prototype that successfully generated high-voltage pulses 10 MHz damped sinusoidal wave production with a 2 kHz repetition rate.  This Phase I SSMM prototype has a failure-safe design, protecting the generator from static and dynamic voltage imbalance for any number of IGBTs in the system. In Phase II POC will develop an all-battery-powered, high-rep-rate SSMM engineering prototype with remote triggering capability that specifically meets Air Force requirements.  The Phase II SSMM prototype, battery-powered and 0.3 cubic meter in volume, will consist of five modules generating 100 kV/1 kA impulse per module, producing a 500 kV/1 kA damped 100 MHz sinusoidal wave packet at repetition rates up to 2 kHz.  In Phase II POC will also develop a business and commercialization plan for engineering development and marketing.",

        "abstract": "With an increasing focus on Joint operations, current military training exercises are becoming more complex, relying on live, virtual, and constructive (LVC) environments.  Currently, performance measurement, assessment, and feedback for JTF trainees in Joint training exercises focuses on observations made by Observer/Trainers (O/Ts) during exercises.  However, observer-based data collection presents several challenges to O/Ts. Using current paper and pencil methods, it is exceedingly difficult to collect and organize observations efficiently, to correlate and fuse observations in accordance with training requirements, and to use synthesized data to produce coherent AAR and exercise products.  Moreover, given the complexity and volume of system data, sheer number of systems and observers involved, and distributed nature of LVC events, it is often difficult to establish the exercise context under which observations are collected.  To address these challenges, we propose to develop the Joint Measurement Operations Controller (JMOC).  JMOC will include components that 1) facilitate the collection and fusion of data across O/Ts during Joint LVC events, 2) fuse those data in ways that support the development of effective trainee feedback and exercise summary products to support learning, and 3) integrate observer-based and system-based data to provide a more comprehensive picture of training outcomes and effectiveness.",

These micro air vehicles (MAV) have stringent space and payload requirements.  Existing battery technology cannot provide the energy densities needed to meet future mission durations. Low temperature micro fuel cell systems powered by hydrogen or hydrocarbons offer promising power performance. However, current materials technology limits these systems to using planar stacks of membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) that produce power. MEA stacks take up a significant amount of space which would be available to enhance payloads or increase fuel volume.  Luna Innovations Inc. is developing a fuel cell fiber MEA that adapts the traditional stack structure by wrapping the MEA layers into a small thread-like structure. The inherent flexibility of these fibers allows them to be interspersed among the existing avionics, lift structures, and payload. Fuel cell fibers also represent a distributed power system which is more fault and damage tolerant. New process technology used to construct the fibers will be demonstrated. Modeling will be used to optimize the power system design to include hybrid power sources. A prototype MAV power system will be delivered.",

Various approaches will be demonstrated, with a focus on approaches that are consistent with implementations utilizing state-of-the-art technology to provide independent EA/EP capabilities against multiple simultaneous threats. Current implementations are limited in their capabilities due to constraints imposed through the limited flexibility of the architecture. This manifests itself in the difficulties experienced in adding features and capabilities to the current generation of DRFMs employed for the T & E community. Another example of this is the current limitation in generating only one pulse output when the techniques employed may call for multiple overlapping returns. The evolution of developmental sensors to larger bandwidths and frequency agility when using compressed waveforms also drives the focus on real-time implementation and wide bandwidth capabilities.

Sources of error include spatial and temporal discretization, inadequate physical models, and human errors in the setup and use of the CFD code.  Systematic identification, reduction, and control of these various error sources is crucial if the results of CFD simulations are to be trusted for design and performance assessment of air vehicles.  While grid refinement studies may verify the spatial accuracy of a solution, these studies are generally laborious and time intensive.  Continued development of a standalone Error Transport Equation (ETE) solver is proposed.  This tool will provide numerical error bars, quantifiable levels of uncertainty in both local and globally integrated variables.  To automate error reduction, the proposed program exploits an existing mesh adaptation package.  The CRISP CFD\u00ae mesh adaptation code, used with several unstructured Navier-Stokes solvers including the Air Vehicles Unstructured Solver (AVUS), when combined with the ETE solver, provides a promising, viable path for automated error reduction and solution verification.  In addition, the proposed program will address uncertainty quantification for detailed studies where the effects of model selection, solver algorithm, boundary conditions, inputs, etc. are systematically varied, through the use of Response Surface models.",

The system is based on the production of a high flux of the positron-emitting radioisotope nitrogen-13 produced by accelerating high-energy deuterons onto a carbon target.  We propose to further enhance the capabilities of this system by the addition of a moderator for producing high quality positron beams, and by upgrading the deuteron accelerator to achieve extremely high positron beam flux levels.  Specifically, the Phase II project will: (1) develop a high performance neon moderator for producing slow positrons; and (2) procure and install an accelerator upgrade that will boost the deuteron energy from 1.5 MeV to 5 MeV.

They include mission- and intent-focused displays; expert systems; robust, high availability architectures that result in minimal or no operator maintenance during a mission; and constraint based reasoning. In the interest of constraining our initial look to a manageable subset of the overall combat system, we have determined that it is feasible to develop a Command Decision Support System that provides high level advisory decision support and human interface capabilities to ship's command personnel as part of our Phase II effort. The system concepts evolved using a highly-structured Humans Systems Integration process and employs advanced AI-based and visualization technologies. Commercial high availability architectures are an essential enabler for reduced manning and several approaches have been explored. Leveraging our success with 24/7 commercial gaming systems, we will develop the foundation for a high-availability combat system architecture consistent with optimized onboard performance as well as offboard GIG/IA compliance. Constraint based reasoning approaches will be further investigated and demonstrated during Phase II as a means to reduce the level of uncertainty thereby transferring cognitive workload from human to machine.",

To keep pace, similar developments are needed in other supporting spacecraft systems.  Under the Phase I project, SpaceWorks developed an initial version of PnP spacecraft structure that included all-aluminum construction, modular panels for quick assembly, standard PnP mechanical and electrical interfaces on interior and exterior surfaces, electronics infrastructure and harnessing recessed within the structural panels, and locking hinge joints to permit panels to rotate for easy access to internal components for integration and test.  In Phase II, we will reproduce very significant portions of the design in carbon fiber composite and deliver a qualified, flight-ready composite spacecraft structure.  The transition from aluminum to composite will reduce spacecraft structure mass by 33% and increase the payload mass fraction.  Panel design and materials maximize the flexibility to incorporate multifunctional features such as embedded high performance thermal management devices and integrated structural sensors.  Through modeling, demonstration, and hardware validation we will demonstrate that this approach can be extended to support the requirements of responsive spacecraft.",

        "abstract": "Images from space satellites are often compressed in a lossy manner to ease transmission requirements such as power, error-rate, and data stream size. These requirements differ from standard computer image processing requirements since storage space, processing speed, and power constraints differ between PCs and satellites. To facilitate use of satellite images in applications such as image analysis, dissemination, storage and retrieval, etc., a method is needed to convert images to a widely supported format. Since lossy formats lose information, too many transcodings, poorly performed transcodings, or transcodings between poorly chosen formats will degrade image quality, sometimes making them useless. Images such as military photos and deep space objects require high quality, so it is desirable to avoid or minimize loss during transcodings. NASA has requested software transcoding from the CSSDS Image Data Compression recommendation to JPEG2000 (J2K) with minimal image degradation. In Phase I Cybernet demonstrated mathematically that the wavelets used in the CCSDS format can easily, quickly, and accurately be transformed to the JPEG2000 format. This mathematical proof was implemented in a GUI software tool. \tFor this Phase II proposal, Cybernet Systems Corporation will create a robust, end-to-end solution for transcoding CCSDS images to widely supported formats for dissemination, using mathematical techniques developed during the Phase I. This will be done in four stages. First we will evaluate or implement production level CCSDS, in order to provide users with an easy to integrate, small, fast implementation of this image compression standard. Second, we will create a toolset for optimal conversion to other image formats, including J2K, minimizing transcoding error. Thirdly, since J2K allows a lot of choice for encoding, we will create an optimal J2K encoder tailored for CCSDS images. Finally, we will integrate these toolsets into existing systems as needed.",

The proposed system achieves operating-point control using fuel modulation, passive optical sensors and the full authority digital engine control (FADEC) to identify local temperature excursions and trims fuel flow to reduce overall pattern factor.  Miniature sensors integrated into the fuel nozzles collect radiation emitted by the combustion gases and process multiple spectral bands to produce an intensity-independent output.  Because the sensors are distributed around the annulus, they provide redundant, overlapping spatial information on the combustion.  Logic in the FADEC would identify an association between a specific fuel injector and increased temperature pattern factor, and modify the fuel flow accordingly. In Phase I, we identified combinations of optical signals that track fuel/air ratio in staged combustors.  In Phase II, we will use a flexible prototype optical system to measure in a multi-injector high-pressure combustor the relationships between fuel modulation, pattern factor and sensor signals, and their sensitivity to field of view, and we will demonstrate control using operator-in-loop testing.

For example, LSP is currently in production to improve the FOD tolerance on a number of fan-blade leading edges. Success in these applications of LSP has come with a significant empirical burden. Current process development requires a determination of process effects on small blocks of material, process tuning and quantification of performance benefit on small-scale fatigue coupons, finally followed by qualification in full-scale rig tests. Significant problems often arise in moving from coupons, where benefits may be large, to full-scale components due to differences in geometry, loading, and failure mechanisms. In structures where the residual stress states have not been methodically engineered, compensatory tensile stresses may exist in areas of significant applied stresses, possibly resulting in a detrimental effect on material performance.  The proposed work will develop verified computational engineering design tools for advanced surface treatments, which will eliminate the need for coupon level testing. Through the use of the engineering design tools, customers will be able to take advantage of advanced surface treatments at lower development cost and reduced risk.",

        "abstract": "Radiant Aviation Services have been providing airports with an economical, operationally efficient and environmental (non-fluid) system for deicing large aircraft since 1998.  They have already perfected the science to employ a two stage infrared area-deicing system, which is FAA approved.  Leveraging this technical expertise we are proposing an electrical infrared system, which will consist of ground mounted modules that will deploy an array of emitters.  The modules will be modified mobility bins that can be easily transported by Air Force cargo aircraft.  The electrically powered emitters will produce the same-patented effect that our commercial systems in Newark, Oslo and soon at JFK already achieve.  This system will fit contingency operational needs.  Using an electrically powered system will allow it to be quickly installed and able to use existing bare base electrical generators.  The ground-based emitters will have their infrared energy reflected off lightweight reflectors that can be easily attached to the ceiling of any contingency flow through hangar.  This fully integrated system can be sized to deice helicopters up to large mobility aircraft.  As per the solicitation, deicing fluid will only be used for holdover purposes.  We already have operational procedures for holdover glycol use at Newark and achieved at least a 90% reduction in glycol use compared to conventional methods.  Our technical expertise and operational understanding of this capability will ensure outstanding results in Phase I and II with rapid transition to Phase III and use by military or commercial interests.",

        "abstract": "In the training industry, widely dispersed training audiences (particularly for Web-based content) require various levels of access control to training materials. The use of smart cards, biometrics, and other tokens as security access/user identity verification keys provide an avenue not only to deliver the right distance learning applications to the right people, but also to provide a trusted audit trail for data modifications. Various Authentication Management Infrastructure (AMI) systems have emerged to help organizations manage the complexity associated with deploying complex, enterprise-wide authentication schemes involving identity tokens and biometrics. Within the training and development communities, the Learning Management System (LMS) has also emerged as an important product category. The LMS not only allows organizations to more effectively and efficiently manage the vast amount of metadata associated with training activities (learners, courses, transcripts, test results, certifications, skills, etc.), but also to provide a standardized run-time environment for launching and management of Web-based learning materials. The SCORM and Aviation Industry Computer Based Training Committee (AICC) standards have been developed to, among other things facilitate the integration of Web-based learning content from multiple providers into a single organizational LMS. There is, however, no standardized way to integrate the use of these strong authentication tokens (and the AMI products that provide this functionality) with the Learning Management System that launches and tracks training and learners. It is up to each LMS to provide its own ad hoc authentication infrastructure, leading both to unnecessary management complexity, and to under use of the security and traceability provided by Authentication Management Infrastructure systems. The purpose of this SBIR is to investigate and develop a standard framework and scripting language that would allow the enterprise AMI to be deployed efficiently in protecting and auditing training assets and records.",

During the project engineers will design, construct and demonstrate a Recovery System prototype in a series of tests in which a Pioneer-size, fixed wing, test UAV (also manufactured for the program) will be guided to the Recovery System and captured. Each successive test represents an incremental and reasonable level of risk, enhancing the chances of success. Initially, the recoveries will be land-based and remotely-piloted. However, by the end of the project, the UAV will be guided autonomously by TALS (Tactical Automatic Landing System), and recoveries will be ship-based under calm sea conditions. With the replacement of TALS by UCARS-V2 during a later program, recoveries at more demanding sea states and conditions would be readily possible.",

Plans for highly portable EMP weapons are available on the Internet and could be deployed against military and/or commercial aircraft  overseas or against civilian aircraft in the U.S. or within ally nations.  A coordinated attack on commercial airlines would deal a serious blow to national security and to the economy.  Therefore, it is imperative that the U.S. retain technical superiority to protect both military and commercial aircraft against EMP attacks.  The primary vulnerability is that aircraft control is almost exclusively electronic and inherently susceptible to EMP weapons.  Luna Innovations Incorporated proposes to develop a flight-hardened fiber optic-based control system for airfoil electrohydromechanical actuators.  The proposed system will measure pressure, temperature, current, voltage, and rotary and linear position at critical control and monitoring points and will provide feedback for closed-loop control.  The fiber optic readout system will be flight-hardened and support 12 sensing channels per card, sampling synchronously at 20kHz (2.0MHz for current). The system is based on an approach conceived specifically to provide 1) high sample frequencies, 2) high channel count, 3) low cost, and 4) absolute measurement.",

Scientific Systems Company, Inc. of Woburn MA and its subcontractor, Lockheed Martin MS2 Tactical Systems (LMTS) of Eagan MN, propose a foundational, control-theoretic approach that is based on three innovations:  (1) a multisensor-multitarget likelihood function which encapsulates all relevant information regarding the characteristics of the various sensors; (2) a \"dynamic situational significance map\" that mathematically specifies the meaning of \"tactical significance\" for a given theater at a given moment; (3) an intuitively meaningful and potentially computationally tractable objective function, namely the expected number of targets of tactical significance; and (4) integration of these concepts with approximate multitarget filters. Phase I showed the feasibility assessment by simulating satellite trajectories (MSX, INTELSAT 511, and THOR 2A), and demonstrated: (1) a tractable sensor management (SM) objective function for the SBV sensor, (2) excellent SM performance for the reduced complexity scenarios considered, and (3) satisfactory tracking errors. The primary focus of the Phase II will be the development of a prototype sensor management algorithm to be tested using realistic simulated multisensor data with the goal of characterizing system performance for a range of realistic scenarios involving platforms such as the MSX, SBSS.

Animals readily adapt to new circumstances by squirming out of impediments.

Exteroceptive reflexes can be readily instantiated for heading control, beacon tracking, as well as flow and orientation relative to gravity. Coupling feedback indicating hindrance or precarious conditions to increases in intrinsic variability at specific loci in the control system can maximize adaptability when entangled or trapped.

Optimal techniques for compensation of turbulence effects are only as good as the knowledge of the turbulence environment.  The basic required parameters are r0, the Fried coherence length, and fG, the Greenwood frequency.  These are specifications of the mean spatial and temporal statistics of the turbulence. Generally, these parameters plus the Kolmogorov spectrum are utilized for analysis and simulation of optical propagation through turbulence.  It is recognized that the Hill spectrum, including inner scale, L0, is a more realistic model of index variations.  This model includes a turbulence enhancement in a spectral subrange prior to the inner scale roll-off.  Knowledge of this enhancement and the subsequent roll-off is important for predicting the statistics of both phase and scintillation effects and has a direct impact on adaptive optics design and performance.

Subsequent to fabrication and validation, the Phase II instrument will be integrated into the EOIL Test Stand at Kirtland Air Force Base. In Phase I, we have successfully demonstrated technical feasibility by fabricating an Off-Axis ICOS instrument and quantifying several key EOIL species, including O2(X, v = 1) and O(3P).  Due to the novelty and importance of the latter measurement, the resulting data was submitted for publication during the Phase I period.  Finally, mid-infrared quantum cascade lasers were utilized to measure nitric oxide and ozone.  Phase I commercialization activities were focused on the development of a nitric oxide monitor for both medical and industrial applications.",

A laser source reflects off an RSO and the returning light is collected by an array of Stokes vector polarimeters. Through the use of an image correlography algorithm, a high fidelity image of the RSO can be reconstructed without atmospheric perturbation.  The successful implementation of this sensor relies on a multi-disciplinary effort requiring expertise in optical engineering, electronics design, mechanical design and manufacturing processes.  Radiometric calculations and electronics design performed on Phase I demonstrate the ability to construct a Stokes vector polarimeter with sufficient signal to noise ratio to resolve the energy returned.  A novel division of amplitude polarimeter concept has been formulated that provides a simple, compact and efficient package to act as the unit cell sensor.

The system's motion stabilizing controller allows launch and recovery operations in sea conditions up to sea state five.  The proposed development program consists of two main parts:  1) developing a preliminary design for controller and essential mechanical elements of the system by using simulation to assess performance and refine the design, and 2) designing and building a fractional scale version of the mechanical design to perform a demonstration of the controller's ability to hold the platform stable in the presence of simulated ship motion.  The proposed program will culminate in a feasibility demonstration:  mounted on a rudimentary ship-motion simulator, the scale system will hold a platform fixed in inertial space in the presence of base motion.

The reflected radiation is then collected and temporally resolved with ultrashort time resolution. Paint thickness will be determined by measurement of the temporal difference between reflections from the front and rear surface of the layers of paint with known indices of refraction. A prototype will be constructed that utilizes a femtosecond fiber laser pumped THz source for generation and detection of sub-picosecond THz pulses.

        "abstract": "Loop Heat Pipe (LHP) is a high performance heat transport device using capillary forces to circulate the working fluid in a closed loop.  Conventional LHPs usually have one capillary pump (evaporator) to acquire waste heat from a heat source.  Recent efforts have focused the development of LHPs that contain two or more evaporators.  Even though two-evaporator LHPs performed very well, the volume of each compensation chamber (CC) became much larger than that of the single-evaporator counterpart.  The reason was that all but one CC would be liquid-filled during normal operation.  The one that was not liquid-filled had to be large enough to accommodate the system liquid expansion at maximum temperature.  As a result, LHPs with more than 3 evaporators were not feasible for practical applications simply because the CCs became prohibitively large.  In the current research, the CCs of a multiple-evaporator LHP were capillarily-linked.  In other words, the CCs always contained a mixture of liquid and vapor (two-phase), allowing the loop to operate with a much smaller fluid charge.  Consequently the required CC volume was also reduced.",

NAIMS will provide a mechanism for prioritizing information based on relevancy within a mission-specific decision making context. The system concept is based on capturing human cognition in the form of decision models -- with subsequent mappings of incoming information to decision model variables.  The innovative NAIMS approach to message prioritization and delivery is based on algorithmic prioritization of the message universe with regard to message relevance to the course of action decision model. The system is designed to compute priorities for messages based on selected mission profile attributes and decision model state, while also constantly adapting to refine the criteria for which the priority assessments are made.  A unique feature of our approach is that initially clustering occurs in unsupervised manner, and is iteratively refined as decisions are made, using the choice of messages as feedback.  Further, the utility of the Phase I effort is expanded by combining NAIMS with the Tactical Group Decision Analysis System (TGDAS) which we are developing under a DARPA-sponsored SBIR Phase II contract and which is focused on USSOCOM decision teams.",

Precise location and identification of cracks and breaks, as well as an accurate assessment of loss due to fiber bends, splices, and connectors, are critical to maintaining signal integrity along the link. Commercial OTDR units do not have the spatial resolution required for short-length network analysis; event dead zones are in the meter range but attenuation dead zones are 4 \u2013 5 meters. To address the diagnostic needs of fiber networks, Luna Innovations will develop a compact, high-spatial resolution Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometer (OFDR). The specific advantages of an OFDR-based device are the improved spatial resolution, sensitivity, and accuracy relative to OTDRs. OFDR is ultimately capable of achieving micrometer-level two-point resolution and does not suffer from significant launch, event, or attenuation dead-zone limitations. Recent advances have shown that OFDR is both a cost effective solution and a viable candidate for testing length ranges greater than 1 km with millimeter resolution.

For example, it may exist in paper format or as an electronic word processing document and may require manual editing and formatting to make the training available via websites, personal digital assistants (PDAs), or video format to make it widely available and more useable.

The task of training authors and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) needed to turn training source material into lessons and to verify their accuracy could be made considerably easier and more productive if they were given more powerful tools and more automated processes.

        "abstract": "In previous work, Ultramet has developed and demonstrated a rapid, low-cost method of applying oxide, carbide, and nitride interface coatings to carbon, oxide, and silicon carbide (SiC) fibers at low temperature (as low as 100\u00b0C) via ultraviolet-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (UVCVD). The state-of-the-art interface coating for SiC fiber-reinforced SiC matrix (SiC/SiC) composites is boron nitride (BN). Unfortunately, in the presence of oxygen and water vapor at elevated temperatures, composites using BN interfaces have severe embrittlement problems due to the formation of a liquid and/or solid reaction product that attacks the fibers or strongly bonds the fibers to the matrix. The stability of the BN interface in moisture-containing environments such as turbine engines can be improved by depositing it at higher temperatures or by doping the BN with silicon. In Phase I, Ultramet demonstrated the feasibility of uniformly applying silicon-doped BN interface coatings onto carbon and SiC fibers at relatively low temperatures using the UVCVD process. After several process development trials, the silicon-doped BN interface was applied to a Sylramic fabric preform that was subsequently infiltrated with a SiC matrix to form a SiC/SiC composite. Uniform deposition of the silicon-doped BN interface was demonstrated throughout the fiber preform, and despite a very low fiber reinforcement volume fraction (",

It is proposed here to continue this effort, greatly maturing the software tool and establishing its benefits in a real-world, high-fidelity mission planning demonstration.  We refer to this software tool as the Mission Planner.  It will take advantage of technologies developed under the Air Force\u2019s Integrated Adaptive Guidance and Control Program to quickly generate mission plans for launch vehicles.   At the end of the Phase II program, the Mission Planner will be able to perform automatically many of the tasks currently performed manually requiring numerous engineers and their time and effort.   This tool will be able to map out trajectories, generate achievable footprints, perform trade studies, and determine per-formance requirements and necessary vehicle characteristics to complete the mission.  Our goal will be to develop a product that executes fast and has many autonomous features, allowing for substantially re-duced mission planning time and personnel needed. The maturation of the Mission Planner will involve a high fidelity model of Lockheed\u2019s Hybrid Launch Vehicle concept.

The fusion of device level physics-of-failure models derived from fault-to-failure progression data, usage measurement and advanced statistical techniques will enable assessment of remaining useful life of electronic systems. The work performed in Phase I focused on understanding failure mechanisms present in semiconductor devices, specifically the manifestation of failure in microprocessors due to accelerated life testing. The knowledge and techniques applied throughout Phase I ideally lends itself to investigation of failures at a system level. Backed with the intimate knowledge of the cause and effect of semiconductor failure and methods for incipient identification, Impact is in a prime position to transition focus and leverage knowledge from one digital component to numerous components present on a digital board to deliver a robust system-level prognostic capability.  The Phase II program described herein will integrate collaborative diagnostic and prognostic techniques from engineering disciplines including statistical reliability modeling, damage accumulation models, physics of failure modeling, and sensor-based condition monitoring using automated reasoning algorithms. Critical prognostic features extracted from sensed parameters including, but not limited to component temperatures, power consumption, and built-in tests (BIT) results will be analyzed using advanced fault detection and damage accumulation algorithms. Using model-based assessments in the absence of fault indications, and updating the model-based assessments with sensed information when it becomes available provides health state awareness at any point in time.",

This material is capable of demonstrating an electro-optic coefficient that is more than an order of magnitude higher than the industry standard lithium niobate material. In addition, they have the promise to operate efficiently up to and beyond 100 GHz. The development of thin film ferroelectric relaxors having ultra-high electro-optic coefficient would dramatically enhance the capabilities of optical waveguide electric field sensor probes for use in Directed Energy and High Power Microwave (HPM) test environments.  Phase I sensor design confirmed that sensors using PMN-PT would present substantial performance advantages over lithium niobate in terms of sensitivity, compactness, and bandwidth. The Phase II work plan follows through on the successful Phase I epitaxy of buffer layers on sapphire to achieve single crystal PMN-PT films on sapphire. Achievement of repeatable materials properties will be critical to the development of reliable sensor devices. High frequency sensors would involve extensive simulation, fabrication and testing to 100 GHz.

This proposed effort represents the first systematic study of the complex interactions between cascaded nonlinear multiplier stages, with the goal of developing new multiplier and system designs that will reduce these unwanted effects. The resulting terahertz sources will achieve greater reliability, efficiency, bandwidth, and ease-of-use. In addition the new design rules will greatly reduce system design cycles and enhance manufacturability, thereby reducing costs. The knowledge gained through this research will be used to achieve vastly improved terahertz sources for NASA's atmospheric and radio astronomy missions; as well as a wide range of emerging commercial applications such as imaging systems for security screening and industrial process control.",

To meet this objective, we present a framework for integrating phenomenological, empirical, and physics-based sensor impacts models with specifications of the environmental state obtained through local measurements, global data-assimilative models, and climatology. Metrics of sensor impairment will be balanced with sensor capabilities to maximize the efficacy of the system of sensors available to complete the intended mission.

The result of our Phase II effort will be a prototype for real-time nowcasting and forecasting of sensor degradation due to a wide variety of environmental phenomena, and a demonstration that integrated sensor management techniques which include space weather effects can improve the performance of globally distributed networks of sensors conducting ground-to-space and space-to-space observations of the Battlespace Environment.",

For the operation of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs), such as the GlobalHawk, significant effort is required to survey each airfield at which the UAS will operate, and to specify detailed taxi path waypoints, which the UAS tracks using GPS guidance. This approach requires significant effort to survey airfields, and manual human oversight to monitor the operation of the UAS on the airfield and to avoid obstacles and other aircraft. The Mosaic ATM team will leverage significant research, development and deployment expertise in UAS operations and airport automation systems to develop a UAS Ground Operations Management System (UGOMS) for UAS airfield operations. The UGOMS will provide accurate, real-time position determination on the airfield through the fusion of multiple sensor inputs already available on the aircraft, without reliance on external navigation systems, and without detailed a-priori surveying of the airfield. Further, the UGOMS will support higher-level automated decision-making during airport surface operations, to identify airport markings and signs, detect obstacles and other aircraft, and to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the aircraft on the airfield.",

Microchannel heat exchangers offer improved performance compared with plate-fin heat exchangers, but the expense of manufacturing microchannel heat exchangers is prohibitive and current fabrication methods limit the heat exchanger size and the materials of construction.  We propose a microchannel heat exchanger that enables low-cost manufacture of compact heat exchangers from a wide variety of common alloys.  In Phase I we developed generalized design methods for the microchannel heat exchangers, used these methods to assess heat exchangers in the F-35 JSF power and thermal management system, and identified the heat exchangers with the highest payoff from our microchannel technology.  In the Phase I Option we demonstrated the key fabrication step needed to build this heat exchanger.  In Phase II, we plan to scale up and optimize our fabrication approach, conduct extensive tests of subscale heat exchanger cores under prototypical conditions, and build a full-size prototype heat exchanger sized to meet specifications for service on the F-35.  We propose Option Phase tasks to test the full-size prototype under realistic conditions.",

This will employ the use of existing measurands and operands. Current Area Prognostic Health Management (PHM) Managers and Air Vehicle Managers use on-board software reasoners to reduce ambiguities and provide a level of automated diagnostic intelligence.  This SBIR will add integrated aggressive fault detection (FD) and fault identification (FI) capabilities for life-limited digital systems using robust techniques for processing sensor and flight data.  Ridgetop will insert innovative and powerful new reasoning technologies into the CPU Board platform and logistics framework so as to provide advancements to current electronic prognostic capabilities on military systems. These enhancements will work within the current PHM architecture to support the aims of the JSF Autonomic Logistics System by providing health awareness, remaining useful life (RUL) predictions, and condition-based maintenance (CBM) actions.  The approach involves extraction of externally-accessible test points, and processes the data sets using historical trending techniques, and Bayesian Networks to maximize fault coverage and prognostic accuracy, and minimization of false alarms. These techniques will increase component reliability margins and system availability goals while reducing (through improved root cause analysis) costly sources of \"No Trouble Found\", \u201cRetest OK\u201d or \u201cCannot Duplicate\u201d problems.",

The primary motivation to replace a metallic material in a weapon system has been lower weight.

However, as metal prices increase, particularly for titanium and superalloys, it is becoming increasingly evident that some airframe structures not only benefit from the lower density of composites, but also from lower cost.  Many emerging tactical missiles operate at high Mach numbers resulting in high aerothermal heat loads and temperatures in control surfaces and fins, where superalloys are currently used.  This program has selected a missile component for demonstration of a high temperature polymer composite, which provides the added benefit of reducing the areal weight of the parasitic thermal protection layer.  This program will take the high temperature polymer composite through the entire development process, starting with requirements, concept development, preliminary and detailed design, and coupon and subcomponent testing, with the program culminating with the delivery of detailed engineering drawings for production of units for qualification tests.

It can also track all objects simultaneously throughout their trajectories regardless of the number and the direction of fire.  It operates in a stand-alone mode, and can be readily deployed on the ground or a littoral platform, as well as on a moving platform on the ground and in the air.  Moreover, unlike optical sensors, it can operate both day and night, and in all types of weather, including dust.  Most important, it is small, lightweight, easily portable, and low cost.",

Our first commercial market will be the wireless (WiFi) security and we have secured an agreement with a WiFi vendor moving into Phase II to provide us with a data feed through which CABN will visualize the geographic, network, security, mission, and social flow contexts of cyber assets. In Phase II we will refine our user requirements, implement the designs we developed in Phase I, and integrate our prototype with a military system. Because we are designing for transition into existing military tactical display systems and require a commercially viable approach, we have developed an essential component strategy. Our approach is modular by design \u2013 developing geographic and information visualization components that leverage the data sources of and can be integrated into our partners\u2019 existing systems, into existing military systems, or into a stand-alone system singularly or in concert.",

        "abstract": "High-Power Microwave fields with frequencies near 1 GHz have been shown to upset electronic equipment at a distance. The challenge lies in finding a high-power source that provides a pulse of continuous-wave power 20-30 ns in length, with reasonable efficiency, low cost, small size and mass, and peak power approaching 1 GW. Existing sources for this application include magnetrons and switched oscillators. Magnetrons require either large magnets or large Helmholtz coils that require massive power sources. Switched oscillators are too small to store sufficient energy. To address the shortcomings of existing sources, we propose developing a Microwave Pulse Compressor (MPC), which uses a resonant cavity to compress and amplify the power from a source with moderate power. When a spark fires across a shorting switch, the resonance condition of the cavity is lost, causing the cavity to dump its high-power output. MPCs require only a microwave source with modest power to drive them, so they have modest size and weight. MPCs are larger than switched oscillators, so they can store more energy. We will base our compressor on the Nessie source, resulting in a peak power of 350 MW for 20 ns, with a repetition rate of 400 Hz.",

These lasers must provide at least 10 to 100 kW of output power with excellent beam quality, and have high electro-optical efficiency and output power to weight ratio, and have simple thermal management requirements.  To meet these demanding requirements, Aculight proposes a new spectrally beam combined (SBC) fiber laser system.  The approach allows spectral combination of many lower-power fiber lasers, into a single beam with excellent beam quality.  The fiber lasers, and therefore the entire system, has much better efficiency, power-to-weight-ratio, and thermal manageability than conventional solid-state lasers.  The proposed approach for the Phase II effort utilizes two gratings in an optical design that allows much broader line widths for each fiber laser, enabling much higher power per fiber and reduced system complexity.",

In the Phase I, the authors demonstrated a conceptual automated recovery system that (1) allows UAVs to adopt/encode the best-practices from the manned aircraft community, (2) uses a combination of inner-loop and outer-loop (autopilot) algorithms to return to stable flight; (3) can be used early on during the onset of an upset to quickly recover stable flight before a more serious upset condition occurs, (4) is applicable across a wide variety of UAV platforms, and (5) can take advantage of innovative actuation concepts if available.

Thus, pre-filter techniques that can improve tracking performance relative to breaks and swaps, and can reduce the computational loading on the tracking system, are critical to the overall AEW system mission performance. The fundamental objective of this research program is to develop a multiscan pre-filter algorithm that reduces the amount of non-target measurements passed to the tracker while maximizing the number of target-oriented measurements that are passed to the tracker. The multiscan pre-filter operates using efficient (computationally cheap) methods to identify measurements that could feasibly associate together to form a target track before passing the data to the tracker where more expensive association techniques are employed.",

The sliding interface speeds and pressures experienced by slipper materials on the HSTT rail far exceeds any phenomena studied and documented to date.  During the Phase I effort, a math model was developed to predict slipper wear using the free body loads and slipper reaction forces generated from commonly used HSTT test planning, design and analysis methods.  The proposed Phase II effort includes designing and fabricating a wear testing machine to simulate steady state wear conditions as well as dynamic loading scenarios.  This will enable the researchers to better understand the physics and thermal phenomena involved in such high speed, high pressure loading environments.  The data from the tests will be used to refine the math model developed in Phase I and compiled into a software tool to provide accurate wear prediction.",

        "abstract": "A major challenge facing the U.S. Navy\u2019s Anti -Submarine Warfare (ASW) mission area is the ability to effectively detect, classify, localize and neutralize quiet modern submarines in shallow water. Current towed array sensors, including TB-23, TB-29A, TB-16 and MFTA, provide desired acoustic performance but are not optimal for deployment from an unmanned vehicle. Compatibility with these platforms requires significant reductions in sensor power, diameter, bend radius and production cost. The Compact Towed Array (CTA) SBIR Phase II effort will result in development of high-performance towed array components that provide multi-mission, directional sensing capabilities for submarine, surveillance, surface ship and unmanned vehicle towed arrays. All of the potential applications for CTA technology benefit because the superior performance acoustic sensors and electronics are small enough to provide a ubiquitous solution across the spectrum of fatline, thinline and ultra-thinline arrays.  Multi-mission commonality is a primary goal for these high volume components that will provide cost savings throughout the entire supply chain starting with procurement and extending through life-cycle support. Development of next generation reliable compact towed arrays that can be stowed and deployed from multiple platforms supports the Sea Shield Pillar of Sea Power 21 while achieving substantial fleet life cycle cost savings.",

Under the Phase I effort, ISL demonstrated that the imagery alone collected from a typical UAV sensor output data stream can be exploited to provide targeting level coordinates when combined with high-fidelity geocoded imagery. During Phase I, ISL developed advanced image registration techniques based on the log polar transform to register low-fidelity UAV imagery with high-fidelity georeferenced imagery in order to estimate the target location. During the Phase II effort, ISL and Raytheon will refine the techniques initially developed during Phase I to insure that the algorithm provides the necessary robustness and accuracy required by the end user.

With comprehensive understanding of track systems and military vehicles, GSE will use FE analysis to optimize the bushing design taking into account actual track loads and temperature, material properties, coating techniques, and assembly methods to offer a solution that will significantly prolong the life of the track systems. Specifically, the track tension and rotation will be decoupled. In conjunction with the numerical analysis, optimized bushing designs will be fabricated and tested in a T158LL track bushing simulation machine at KRC.  Numerical results can be matched with instrumented experimental data to gain confidence in FE predictions.

We are developing InGaAs monolithically interconnected modules (MIMs) that convert thermal photons from the ~1100C General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) into electrical power. The innovation is that these MIMs are designed to operate at higher cell temperatures (150C) and be more radiation-hard than current MIMs to better match the cell environment on missions. In Phase 1, we developed a model that predicts an optimum InGaAs bandgap (adjustable during epigrowth) for the operating temperature and 1100C blackbody GPHS spectrum of ~0.7eV, made sample devices, and tested temperature coefficients to confirm the model and measured data agree (e.g. model predicts \u00961.7mV/C for Voc vs. \u00961.8mV/C for data). In Phase 2, we will perform five iterations of a model, design, epitaxially grow, process, and test cycle. Data from each cycle will be used to improve the next design. Testing will include both radiation, temperature stability and accelerated life testing. Before program completion, we will survey NASA and commercial space power contractors for needs and make samples of the best design to distribute among space power contractors as a step toward generating interest and commercial sales.",

The  technical risk associated with the proposed Phase II project is low because all Phase I technical objectives were achieved using an innovative approach that consists of a synergistic combination of parallel architecture and differential circuits; based on the results obtained in Phase I,  it is anticipated that the power consumption of  a 4096-lag, 1 GHz bandwidth, 2-bit/4-level  digital auto-correlation spectrometer chip fabricated with IBM's 90 nm will be less than 4 W. The overall benefits of the proposed project, if successful, consist of the availability of a new class of high-bandwidth and ultra-low power digital auto-correlation spectrometer chip that will facilitate the construction of NASA's spaceborne microwave remote sensing instruments with substantially lower life-cycle costs,  power consumption,  and mass relative to that of existing filter-bank and acousto-optical spectrometers.",

The casting of these parts does not always assure perfect crystal grain orientation that is critical for performance under high temperature conditions.  Recent engine failures and aircraft mishaps have made imperative efficient and direct measurement of grain orientation in aircraft turbine blades.  There does not exist a method to measure grain orientation across the entire turbine blade.  Conventional chemical etching and visual inspection or laboratory based x-ray analysis is unsuitable for entire turbine blade crystal quality control.  X-Ray Optical Systems (XOS) of East Greenbush, NY proposes to develop a compact, low power, large beam x-ray diffraction analyzer that can directly and non-destructively measure whole turbine blade crystal grain orientation in factory production lines or in the field. This is made possible by using novel, proprietary large size polycapillary collimating x-ray optics and highly stable and reliable X-Beam x-ray sources developed by XOS which have been successfully applied to in-line measurements of crystal texture of superconducting thin films and on-line measurements of phase distributions in steel plating factories.",

The system will also have the capability to learn and recall the acoustic signature of novel faults and the capability to send an alarm. The health monitoring proposed here is based on a microphone phased array positioned such as to have a direct line of sight to the machine to be monitored. The microphone signals are recorded simultaneously and used to scan or beamform over a grid enclosing the machine to capture its acoustic signature. The acoustic image is then integrated to obtain the machine noise spectrum that is used to identify damage or faults by an automated expert system. The system will operate properly without human intervention while targeting and identifying developing faults.

        "abstract": "The ability to actively control the buoyancy of underwater sea gliders could greatly enhance the efficiency of the underwater vehicles.  Both large displacements as well as small (trim) displacements are beneficial to finely control the buoyancy of the sea glider.  For Phase I Mide proposed and showed that it is feasible to utilize either shape memory allow (SMA) dimples, or super elastic alloy (SEA) dimples of varying size, to alter the volume of the craft at select locations, thus altering the buoyancy of the sea glider.  In their non-actuated state the dimples when actuated create small mounds on the body of the sea glider.  Phase I also developed and demonstrated a novel multi-layered actuator that can be used for buoyancy control in deep water.In the base effort of the Phase II, Mide is proposing to develop both a shallow and a deep water SMA buoyancy actuator and to test these actuators in pressurized water tanks.  These actuators will be integrated into a buoyancy control system and tested in the pressurized water tanks.  In the Phase II option effort, Mid\u00e9 is proposing to re-design both the shallow and deep systems using the knowledge gained in the base effort and to demonstrate them on a sea glider. BENEFITS: The primary commercial benefit of this technology is in the efficiency improvements of under water gliders.  This technology will lower the operating cost of these gliders.  If proven successful this technology could span to other platforms that would have a significant impact on the Navy.  All commercial submersibles, used in research, surveying and exploration will benefit from this technology.",

The bandgap and high carrier mobility of germanium make it ideal for high-speed, fast-response, NIR imaging, and germanium photodetectors are well-established, highly-stable, NIR calibration reference detectors. However, processing CMOS circuits directly on germanium is difficult. High-speed silicon CMOS imagers have been built, albeit with only visible light sensitivity. Thus, while neither silicon nor germanium by itself embodies a perfect set of properties for the large-scale fabrication of NIR-sensitive FPAs, when these materials are brought together using reliable high-interconnect-density, 3D-stacked-circuit technology, robust, high frame rate, high-resolution NIR FPAs, with pixel pitch below 10 microns, can be manufactured using commercial, high-volume CMOS processes. This engenders rapid commercialization, high quality, and a lower cost than contemporary NIR FPA technologies. The proposed Phase II stepwise development program demonstrates each of the technological components individually and then integrated into a fully-functional HEL radiometric FPA, which will be characterized and its performance demonstrated for the application.",

However, changes within these emissions can be a highly significant indicator that a failure has occurred within the IC as well as within adjacent circuit card paths. These failures often result in increased electric and electromagnetic interference that exceed EMI specifications. Further, the hardware and software requirements to capture and analyze these emissions are relatively simple in comparison to today\u2019s highly complex automatic test equipment, however this approach was previously not possible until the recent development of comprehensive analysis capability within oscilloscopes and spectrum analyzers.

Use of nanoparticles is known to enhance Raman signals by several orders of magnitude.  Our goal is to achieve similar gains in ROA signals by using a sensitive detection system in combination with improved surface enhanced chemistry and microfluidics-based single-molecule detection techniques.  This will result in improved precision of measurement and shorten measurement time.",

In Phase I, the unique integrated-flow-field design (IFF) has been shown to provide highly superior passive water management that results in a H2/O2 PEMFC that is gravity independent, achieves higher voltage efficiencies than conventional PEMFC designs, can be operated safely at high pressure (with resulting higher efficiencies), will enable passive operation, and requires extremely low excess O2 to maintain stable operation.\n           \nThe Phase II Program will bring ElecroChem's IFF PEMFC concept to the threshold of commercialization.  In Phase II, scale-up and IFF optimization will be carried out.  For complete passive operation, stack systems will incorporate an ejector to produce the low reactant flows and for product water removal. High performance membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) will be developed. These Ph II efforts will produce a 250W IFF stack deliverable that will be integrated directly into NASA's Exploration Energy Storage Plan.\n\nThe use of the IFF innovation will significantly simplify PEMFC operation and will result in higher and safer performance.  Specifically, for space applications, the higher voltage efficiencies produced and the lower excess O2 required by the IFF will result in significantly lower fuel cell power plant weight.",

Ideal assays would identify the earliest stages of disease based on easily-available samples, such as blood.  RTI has extensive experience in the use of animal models in biological research, and an established interest in the development of diagnostic tests for prion diseases.  Our Phase I efforts have utilized advanced proteomics techniques to isolate proteins specifically altered during TSE pathogenesis in an animal model.  Further, we have developed an in vitro cell-culture model of scrapie infection which can be used to define proteins of interest in TSE diagnosis.

Full and efficient utilization of NSRL requires the automation of precise sample positioning and sample exchange that is otherwise performed manually at the cost of hours of beam time, compromised biostatistics and risk of personnel.  The device and system will consist of eight sample holders providing an environmentally controlled enclosure.  Samples to be irradiated will be translated into the ion beam, one at a time, within the controlled environment.  Samples to be accommodated include, but are not limited to, cell cultures (multiple containers), small animal (flies, worms, fish) cultures, mice, rats and small samples of shielding or electronic materials.  Operating software will be compatible with that in use at the irradiation venues, specifically NSRL, and will be used to establish environmental control settings, to record environmental conditions, and to control and record the insertion of samples into the ion beam.  Stray doses to samples in waiting will be less than 0.001 of the dose delivered to exposed samples, and measures are included to minimize neutron flux within the sample chamber assembly.  Total and neutron doses will be measured. Three objectives will be met in Phase II research: (1) implementation of user requirements (determined in Phase I) in a final design to be subjected to Critical Design Review (2) construction and testing of a complete sample management system at SHOT, and (3) installing the final prototype product at NSRL and placing it into use for the benefit of the user community.",

It addresses the difficulty of communicating highly technical information among specialized engineering groups so that the concept of operations illustrated by the storyboard accommodates the consideration of context of use, user task performance, and effective application of new technologies.  This difficulty is especially pronounced when the user's tasks are unusual (space operations) and the technology to support the task is novel (autonomous software with which humans interact and monitor).  Communication is enhanced by focusing on the common language of storyboard sketches and related categories of information describing them.  The storyboard tool will help authors manage versions of storyboards to track alternate approaches for human task support and to maintain libraries of storyboards from previous systems.  After assisting with the creation of storyboards and refining them in concurrent engineering sessions, the tool will assist in translating the storyboard information into data forms importable by analysis tools used by NASA systems engineers.",

Fault Tolerant Electronics Supporting Space Exploration (FTESSE) creates an electronic design paradigm using reprogrammable FPGAs to create swappable Circuit Object Blocks (COBs) \u0096 analogous to software objects \u0096 for the first time enabling redundancy on a micro-scale. The result is an increased tolerance of point failures by several orders of magnitude over traditional approaches.

Bad areas can be mapped like the bad sector data on a disk drive, enabling COBs to be placed in areas of working gates to recover system performance. Hardware tested during Phase I verified point failures could be introduced into an example circuit and corrected. As in the Phase I model, circuits to be monitored reside on a Slave FPGA, and a Master FPGA monitors outputs of all COBs, sensing faults and mapping non-working gates on the Slave FPGA. The Master is a rad-hard, triple mode redundancy (TMR) FPGA, but the Slaves need not be, opening the doors to higher performance applications while maintaining high levels of fault tolerance.",

These efforts can also serve uniquely the Crew Exploration Vehicle radiator systems needs.  The TCMS for the radiators of the both CEV and exploration missions need to operate at higher elevated temperatures and provide the space environment stable low ratio of (solar absorptance/emittance) performance in high radiation orbits involving intense UV, electrons and protons along with stable charge mitigation. The CEV application also needs it to withstand typical launch environments. According to the phase I findings, none of the state-of-an-art material systems that are currently in use are designed for the needs of the space environment stable operation at elevated temperatures, and hence, can not meet the same. The Phase I efforts proved the feasibility and identified the next generation solid state chemistries and processing requirements that can provide the multifunctional space stable performance at higher temperatures and also provided the unique guidance for tailoring the ESD performance when these very large thermal control areas get exposed to very low temperatures. The proposed phase II efforts will continue R&D and scale up the synthesis of the identified candidate engineered passivated pigments and validate its space environment stability with use of recently developed next generation negative CTE passivated additives with abilities to tailor CTE, thermal shock and thermal cycling performance. Thus, these Phase II efforts can provide the next generation \"Robust\" validated TCMS products that can be exposed to the elevated temperatures (500C) and conducting tasks geared towards putting together plasma spray technology and experience base as applied to TCMS for various exploration missions.",

        "abstract": "Communities near airports are often exposed to high noise levels due to low flying aircraft in the takeoff and landing phases of flight. Propulsion source noise is the major contributor to the overall noise level. The noise generation mechanisms for a typical turbofan engine are complicated, which makes it a significant challenge to identify the noise sources. Each engine component, such as fan, compressor and turbine, can generate both broadband and narrowband noise. Particularly, the fan noise, more specifically the interaction of the rotor with the downstream stator, is important due to the trend towards the development of civil aircraft turbofan engines with higher and higher by pass ratios. \nNearfield acoustical holography (NAH) refers to a process by which the noise sources and the resulting sound field can be reconstructed based on sound pressure measurements taken on a surface in the neighborhood of these sources. Thus, the development and application of appropriate generalized acoustical holography (GAH) system by extending NAH to handle arbitrary geometry and complex noise sources, novel measurement and data processing methods, and innovative inversion and regularization techniques will conceptually allow the identification and ranking of complex turbomachinery noise sources that are otherwise difficult to characterize. This system will also enable the use of more effective active and/or passive noise control measures by providing useful information that is impossible to obtain by direct measurements.",

Radars today rely on phased-array antenna for beam forming and beam steering, and, in most cases today, the arrays are built with a large number of transmit-receive (T/R) modules made of amplifiers, phase shifters and duplexing switches.  Microwave monolithic integrated circuits (MMIC) technology enables integration of those T/R module functions into a single MMIC chip, which, in turn allows compact implementation of phased array antennas with thousands of radiating elements. A typical T/R module consists of several circuit components that need to be optimized to achieve optimum module level performance.  These components typically include a low noise amplifier (LNA), power amplifier (PA), switch, phase shifter and attenuator. This Phase II program will lead to a development of a 35 GHz T/R MMIC delivering output powers in the transmit path  of 30 dBm with an associated PAE of greater than 40% and at the same time exhibiting a noise figure of less than 2.5 dB in the receive path. While beyond the specific MMIC mentioned, this Phase II SBIR will make significant contributions in MHEMT device characterization and the commercialization of  MHEMT technology.",

Key requirements for a redesigned dunnage system include elimination of wood dunnage, supporting structural loads, significant reduction in total ownership costs, easily repaired system components, light weight, ease of use and high impact resistance. Dunnage airbags will be designed to meet and/or exceed existing load requirements, reduce weight, withstand environmental conditions (hot, cold, wet), take rough handling and provide ease of handling. Stanchion accessories will be designed to perform equivalent functions as current wood dunnage practices while significantly reducing time to implement. Both items will be designed to provide years of service with minimal repair and maintenance. Proposed dunnage systems will not functionality of current impact restraint systems/operations, or require costly transport system modifications.

        "abstract": "We propose to develop the Intelligent, Semi-Automated Procedure Aid (ISAPA) intended for use by International Space Station (ISS) ground controllers to increase the efficiency and safety of flight operations while reducing costs for NASA. ISAPA is innovative in that it is centered on a \"person-in-the-loop\" approach to automation. While ISAPA executes procedures, it asks the user for confirmations, decisions and allows the user to easily override. To increase situational awareness, the aid clearly presents, through notifications and advanced visualizations, what is being performed. The second major innovation is ISAPA's intuitive authoring tool which enables controllers (without programming skills) to build new and modify existing semi-automated procedures using drag-and-drop graphical widgets. As space station construction progresses and procedures change, authoring utilities allow the straightforward updating of procedures. ISAPA also supports gradual procedure automation, allowing flight controllers to migrate a manual procedure towards automation as confidence is gained. The system will integrate with existing mission control center systems, specifically: \"Thin Layer\" for sending commands, \"Information Sharing Protocol\" for receiving telemetry, and use official formats, such as \"PRL\", for persisting procedure data. ISAPA will also include a simulator to assist in the validation process of procedures. \n\nDuring Phase I, Stottler Henke developed a prototype of the ISAPA execution tool, authoring tool and simulation tools while constructing two sample procedures based on real-life controller procedures. During Phase II, Stottler Henke will develop a full ISAPA system ready for integration into the ISS MCC. Special emphasis will be placed on compliance with NASA ground console software certification. \n\nISAPA technologies from the Technology Taxonomy are Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence and Human-Computer Interfaces from the Information section.",

This team will work to develop the FWM fire extinguisher which was proven to extinguish fires in phase I.\nFWM is a proven fire suppression technology with the ability to extinguish large fuel fed fires, as well as, small electrical fires. Unlike sprinkler water systems it does not damage structures, and unlike CO2 or Halon fire extinguishers it has only inert chemicals water and nitrogen, so it is not a health hazard, environmental hazard and easily scrubbed from the air with dehumidifiers when used in spacecraft. This new extinguisher's innovative design has the capability to discharge in any orientation, and has been dubbed the Universal Discharge Orientation System (UDOS). During Phase I the UDOS system was capable of extinguishing fires in both normal vertical positions as well as upside down.  During the Phase II efforts the system will be evaluated to extinguish fires in any 360 degree orientation. The ultimate objective of this project is to develop a FWM fire extinguisher which can be commercially manufactured and is capable of extinguishing both large open fires and enclosed electrical fires with minimal water usage.",

Many of the specific conditions and events of interest to airline maintenance are not being monitored by automatic systems, and some events are being identified through a subjective determination by the aircrew.  This subjective determination can result in both maintenance being performed unnecessarily and maintenance not being performed when needed.  AeroTech will develop a multi-tier, Quantitative Condition Alerting and Analysis Support (QCAAS) system for aircraft that will in real-time, automatically downlink to maintenance personnel, reports on the occurrence of specific conditions and events (e.g. loads exceedance).  The reports will be displayed on a web based, ground station network.  The system will also track individual aircraft's exposure to particular in-flight conditions allowing airline personnel to tailor maintenance programs to individual aircraft.  By providing quantifiable data in real-time, operational decisions can be made to minimize the impact and maximize the benefits of on-condition maintenance.

Fabrication of modular components yields fabrication savings associated with large production volume and automated integration and test.  In-space assembly permits staged deployment on an as-needed, as-afforded basis.  It also decouples stowed launch geometry from deployed operational geometry.  The SWARM concept uses formation flown spacecraft, containing multiple universal docking ports, to dock with modular elements and maneuver them to dock with other, similar elements.  In the process, systems can be assembled that are much larger than what can be fit or folded into a launch vehicle fairing, or what can be launched on a single vehicle.

The objective is to build a reactor that generates a hydrogen stream with a heating value of 5-10 kW. The process is based on a novel type of ceramic membrane that allows only the passage of oxygen ions and electrons. Steam is passed on one side of the membrane and a gasified fuel on the other. On the membrane surface steam is reduced to hydrogen while the oxygen passes as an ion through the membrane. The ion oxidizes the fuel on the other side of the membrane, while the electron associated with the ion flows back to the steam side of the membrane. The process is driven by the difference in chemical potential between fuel and steam. Effectively an energy transfer is established which oxidizes the fuel as the steam is reduced to produce hydrogen. Since the membrane is impermeable for gases (the oxygen ion is a solid) very high purity hydrogen is generated. It is intended to demonstrate a system containing a liquid fuel gasifier coupled to a hydrogen reactor, while addressing the most crucial heat integration aspects.",

Inadequate injector designs have been the cause of major failures during engine development of all earlier liquid rocket systems including the SSME; the root cause for this may be attributed to the use of relatively simple empirically based, one-dimensional tools in the design process that are incapable of identifying localized failures driven by three-dimensional geometry and physics effects. The proposed three-dimensional, CFD tool will focus on rigorous modeling of the mixing and combustion processes in cryogenic liquid-gas injectors that operate in the trans-critical and sub-critical regime and exhibit strong non-linear sensitivities to real fluid thermodynamics, as well as turbulent mixing effects.  The advanced models developed will permit improved predictions of combustion chamber mean heat flux and localized peaks, as well as lay the foundation for predicting unsteady response of the injector and its coupling to the feed system dynamics.",

        "abstract": "The structural integrity of jet engine turbine or fan rotor disks is vital for aviation safety. Cumulative cracks at critical loading and high stress areas, if not detected and repaired in time, may lead to catastrophic failure. Traditional methods such as Fluorescent Penetrant Inspection (FPI) and eddy current are limited to point-by-point measurement and are very time consuming. Disassembly of the engine is required for each inspection, which in turn may cause maintenance induced problems. \n\nWe propose a wireless in-situ ultrasonic guided wave health monitoring approach. It applies light, thin, high temperature leave-in-place ultrasonic guided wave circumferential patch transducers around the root of the disk, and a pair of innovative tube antennae that wirelessly couple the transducers to the inspection instruments. Guided waves travel in the disk for crack inspection, and the inspection could be done even when the disk is rotating. Phase I results clearly demonstrate that the guided wave is very sensitive to tiny cracks on a rotating aluminum disk, and the tube antennae worked well. The envisioned system can inspect a relatively large area, has minimal effect on the rotor performance, instantaneously provides reliable and quantitative data such as crack location and severity level, and minimize and eventually eliminate the need for structural disassembly.",

The proposed fuel is a ceramic-ceramic (CerCer) composite of mixed uranium-refractory carbides such as (U, Zr)C or (U, Zr, Nb)C in a matrix of refractory carbides that mostly include transition metal carbides such as ZrC, NbC, TaC, and HfC. Due to its low neutron absorption cross-section, ZrC is the primary refractory carbide of choice. Replacing ZrC with higher temperature refractory carbides such as TaC and HfC could further improves the high temperature performance of CerCer fuels. However, higher neutron absorption cross-section penalty for Ta and Hf could potentially offset the performance enhancement gain. Due to complete containment and encapsulation of mixed uranium carbide in zirconium carbide matrix, the proposed CerCer fuel could be conveniently fabricated to different geometrical shapes such as solid block prismatic, twisted ribbon, pebbles, wafer, or square lattice honeycomb. Considering the operational parameters for the NT/BP systems, it is reasonable to argue that the proposed CerCer fuel concept could set the upper material performance limits while providing more flexibility in the geometrical design of the fuel.",

        "abstract": "Development of a microgravity and hypogravity compatible microwave plasma methane pyrolysis reactor is proposed to recover hydrogen which is lost as methane in the conversion of carbon dioxide to water via the Sabatier process.  This will close the hydrogen loop which currently requires 50% resupply. Efficient production of hydrogen from methane was conclusively demonstrated during Phase I using microwave plasmas with power levels ranging between 50 - 120 W.  In the plasma reactor, formation and deposition of solid phase elemental carbon was shown to be far less problematic than for current methods of catalytic methane decomposition in fixed bed and fluidized bed reactors.  This new technology has strong potential for continuous hydrogen production over extended time periods, with minimal maintenance and operator intervention.  Microwave plasmas produce extremely high temperatures localized within very small volumes, resulting in low overall power requirements. Microwave plasmas also produce minimal thermal effects on downstream piping and other system components. These features provide the basis for a small, light, and low power method for hydrogen reclamation. By recovering all of the hydrogen which is lost as methane in the Sabatier reactor, the requirement for production or resupply of hydrogen is reduced to the absolute minimum.",

Materials intended for exterior application must also be inert towards the sulfuric, hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acid present.  Aspen Aerogels, Inc. proposes to continue its development of aerogel composites intended for thermal and chemical protection to a Venus spacecraft.  During the Phase I program, we fabricated several aerogels with inherent thermal conductivities below 40 mW/m-K.  In Phase II, we propose to optimize the synthesis through systematic changes in gelation, extraction, and pyrolysis conditions.  Furthermore, we will demonstrate thermal conductivities of 100 mW/m-K at 500 C under 90 bars of CO2 pressure.

The sprayable insulation based on aerogel forms an aerodynamically smooth, uniform coating with better cohesion and lower thermal conductivity.  Aerogel sprayed insulation has shown in Phase I better thermal performance than polyurethane spray-on foam insulation at similar or lower areal densities. Application of thinner layers of insulation combined with greater material resistance to cracking and debonding will eliminate the generation of in-flight debris. Minimization of volatile gas blowing agents and organic components will reduce gas expansion through intracellular pressures and reduces the risk posed by shedding events during ascent.  The proposed sprayable insulation can render future space transportation systems safer and more reliable.  Addressing lower temperature requirements of the thermal protection system, lightweight hybrid aerogel sprayable compositions will be developed. Hybrid aerogels with various dopants will be synthesized for better compatibility with the binders or organic foams.

The knowledge-based expert classifiers prototyped during Phase I were tested and validated at selected pilot sites across the globe. The results of the Phase I work have clearly demonstrated the technical feasibility of the GDA approach to automated crop area assessment with medium resolution imagery.

AFN originates from complex interactions of turbulent flow with airframe components that are extremely difficult to compute efficiently and accurately. In Phase I the feasibility of an innovative generalized lattice Boltzmann equation (GLBE) approach as a computational aeroacoustics (CAA) tool was evaluated.  A subgrid scale (SGS) with wall damping was introduced into the GLBE to enable large eddy simulations.  GLBE results on wall turbulence statistics compared well with direct numerical simulations and experiments. The GLBE approach, which uses multiple relaxation times, was significantly more stable than, and as computationally efficient as, the more common single-relaxation time LBE at high Reynolds numbers. It was also computationally competitive with finite-difference methods on single processors, but GLBE had the major advantage of scaling near-linearly on large parallel computers. GLBE computations also accurately reproduced the tonal frequencies for cross-flow over a single, and a pair of cylinders, and feedback-generated tonal frequencies for flow over cavities, which are CAA benchmarks for AFN.  With feasibility demonstrated in Phase I, further developments of GLBE, including innovative use of wall-layer models, dynamic SGS models, improved boundary condition implementation and grid refinement strategies in Phase II would enable simulations of very high Reynolds number CAA problems of complex geometry with high fidelity. The GLBE approach developed will then be interfaced to an existing far-field acoustics prediction code to efficiently address AFN in configurations of interest, including high-lift systems and landing gear.",

A key goal of the project is to increase the lifetime of LDAs operating under long-pulse (>2 msec), quasi-CW conditions by a factor-of-10, to at least 1 billion shot lifetime, in order to meet NASA mission requirements. A critical issue with operating LDAs for long pulses is localized diode heating leads to current and optical instabilities, which damages emitters resulting in LDA failure. SRL has demonstrated that diode instabilities can be detected and eliminated, and SRL's fault protected drivers increase laser diode lifetimes by more than a factor-of-10. A key technical step that will be implemented in Phase 2 is to develop and integrate SRL fault protection with laser diode stacks. This will also include NASA-developed temperature/voltage diagnostic to provide additional information on laser diode performance and lifetime. In Phase 2 SRL will develop multiple laser diode protection technologies, and deliver to NASA an integrated fault protection module for test and evaluation. This fault protected driver package for laser diode stacks will support scale up designs for flight hardware in Phase 3.",

Aircraft fires represent a small number of actual accident causes, but the number of fatalities due to in-flight, post-crash, and on-ground fires is large. The novel OBIGGS system will inert aircraft fuel tanks with nitrogen generated by a hollow fiber membrane module. The system will provide a cost effective method for fuel tank inerting, will be robust and resistant to chemical contamination. An OBIGGS system that is based on nitrogen generation is environmentally friendly and does not require hazardous chemicals for fire suppression. In addition to improving aircraft safety by mitigating hazardous in-flight and on the ground conditions the OBIGGS systems will also contribute to aircraft security and will mitigate aircraft damage from hostile attacks.",

This proposal would develop a graphical user interface for high energy multi-particle transport. With this innovation, users of the MCNPX code would have access to a powerful graphical user interface for efficient creation and interrogation of their input files, which would significantly reduce the amount of time required to create and debug input files.\n\nSpecific enhancements that are proposed include the implementation of the Los Alamos Quark-Gluon String Model Module in MCNPX;  adding the source creation capability to the graphical user interface; improvements to data visualization and 3D geometry plotting; and the investigation of implementing spline surfaces in MCNPX.",

        "abstract": "The proposed activities will result in the development of a novel hyperspectral feature-extraction toolkit that will provide a simple, automated, and accurate approach to materials classification from hyperspectral imagery (HSI).  The proposed toolkit will be built as an extension to the state-of-the-art technology in automated feature extraction (AFE), the Feature Analyst software suite, which was developed by the proposing company.  Feature Analyst uses, along with spectral information, feature characteristics such as spatial association, size, shape, texture, pattern, and shadow in its generic AFE process. Incorporating the best AFE approach (Feature Analyst) with the best HSI techniques promises to greatly increase the usefulness and applicability of HSI.  While current HSI techniques, such as spectral end-member classification, can provide effective materials classification, these methods are slow (or manual), cumbersome, complex for analysts, and are limited to materials classification only. Feature Analyst, on the other hand, has a simple workflow of (a) an analyst providing a few examples, and (b) an advanced software agent classifying the rest of the imagery. This simple yet powerful approach will become the new paradigm for HSI materials classification since Phase I experiments show it is (a) accurate, (b) simple, (c) advanced, and (d) exists as workflow extension to market leading products.   The deliverables of this proposal will allow HSI products to be fully exploited for the first time by a wide range of users.",

As distributed real-world systems comprised of many autonomous decision-making entities become more complex, so do their corresponding individual models and simulation systems.   However, existing tools for low-level single host debugging, data and event collection and local analysis do not adequately address the problem of understanding large distributed systems consisting of thousands of autonomously executing agents. In this Phase II effort, we propose to create a comprehensive semantic debugging and knowledge discovery and analysis system for agent-based simulations called IntelliTrace.  The key innovation behind semantic and model driven system analysis is that it will bridge the gap between the semantics of model execution and the resultant implementation behavior realized within a software system.

The Misfolded Protein Diagnostic (MPD) Assay detects infectivity in a crude sample through the use of labeled Pronucleon peptides that undergo conformational change in the presence of the misfolded infectious prion protein.  The conformational peptide change is propagated throughout the ensemble of sequence specific Pronucleon peptides in the reaction via a nucleation event resulting in an amplification of signal.  Preliminary data supports the simplicity and exquisite sensitivity of this non-immunological approach to infectious prion protein detection.  Level of detection has been determined to be near 1 infectious dose for titered murine sCJD plasma samples.  During Phase I funding, the MPD Assay has been under optimization with keen focus on defining the positive controls for the assay as well as looking at variability between normal human plasma samples to better define the threshold of detection.

The  developed self seal coatings and rotation molded self-seal tank will be compared with  currently used/existing COTS/MOTS self-sealing fuel tank technologies.  We will further improve bullet impact resistance, self sealability of different size holes, adhesion to substrate, fire and smoke performance,  chemical resistance,  flexibility, water and salt fog  resistance. These coatings will be tested in accordance with the self seal fuel tank specifications (i.e., MIL-DTL-27422C and MIL-T-5578B) used by the U.S. Marine Corps.  UDRI will perform the ballistic impact testing. UDC will design, develop, produce the coatings and conduct limited developmental testing. The resultant performance will be verified by an independent test facility. UDC will provide materials and application specifications for the self sealing tanks and coatings.

It uses an innovative solid rocket motor with individually controlled nozzle throats providing real time controllable thrust and steering with a fixed expansion-deflection exit cone, which provides optimum expansion at all altitudes.  The propellant is an environmentally friendly, safe, low cost, phase stabilized ammonium nitrate propellant with a delivered specific impulse equal to ammonium perchlorate propellants.   Phase I has shown the feasibility of the enabling technologies.   Phase II will demonstrate the enabling technologies through bench testing and solid rocket static firings.

WebCore identified and tested shelter panel constituents (foams, fibers, resins and advanced coatings) for use in a fire-resistant thermoset composite TYCOR shelter panel.  These results form a baseline solution for the Phase II effort, which will expand the possible solutions in thermoset composites and include thermoplastic composites fire-resistant solutions as well.

For this Phase II effort we will design, develop, and field test a Engineering Demonstration Model prototype of the DIFAR In-air Sensor System (DISS).  The primary innovation of DISS is the use of unique Micro-Electronic Machined Sensor (MEMS) acoustic vector sensor technology for spatial mapping using electronically steerable beamforming.  The MEMS sensor configuration provides very high array gain, small footprint, and low power consumption, with the ability to scan in three dimensions to permit persistent surveillance.  MEMS acoustic vector sensors have tremendous capability, but current high unit cost will limit their use in expendable sensing systems.  We will explore the feasibility of using two more affordable DIFAR element alternatives based on bi-directional hearing aids and arrays using cheap commodity microphones.   We will develop detection, classification, bearing estimation, and tracking algorithms for organic processing of target data.  Integral to these algorithms is a robust false alarm mitigation process to minimize the generation of spurious reports.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to produce a fully characterized polyurethane heart valve prosthesis that will be ready for clinical evaluation. Existing replacement valves suffer from several shortcomings. Specifically, biological tissue fixation and methods used to mount the tissue to the supporting stent of bioprostheses cause time dependent structural changes such as calcification and leaflet wear, which lead to valve failure. The flow disturbances created by mechanical valves include high velocity jets, turbulence and areas of stagnation, which cause blood cell damage, lead to thrombus formation and necessitate the use of anticoagulation for the rest of the patient's life. The trileaflet polyurethane valve, originally developed in the design of the AbioCor replacement heart has demonstrated excellent durability and hemocompatibility in clinical evaluation. This type of valve has the potential to address both the blood compatibility problem of mechanical valves and the durability problem of bioprostheses. The changes necessary for adapting the AbioCor trileaflet valve design to the requirements of a prosthetic replacement valve was the focus of the Phase I project. The novel methods for reducing the forward flow pressure loss ensure superior hemodynamic performance without compromising valve efficiency, durability and fluid flow patterns through the valve. Phase II studies will be primarily concerned with optimizing the design of the polyurethane replacement valve, and completing the necessary requirements to support a submission for clinical trials. We will be also be evaluating valves made from bisphosphonate-modified polyurethanes, which have displayed substantial resistance to calcification.  The valve design will be optimized to address potential issues with calcification and blood compatibility.  A novel dynamic in vitro calcification model and an in vitro blood compatibility model will also be used to compare polyurethane valves with tissue valves.  In depth fluid dynamic studies on critical areas are planned to quantify any potential for thrombus formation (stagnation) and red blood cell damage (high shear regions).  Finally, in vivo animal experiments are planned to verify both hemocompatibility and calcification resistance provided by the polyurethane valve design. Existing replacement valves suffer from several shortcomings. We anticipate that the anticoagulation therapy requirements of mechanical valves can be substantially reduced by using a polyurethane trileaflet valve. We further anticipate that a polyurethane valve design can potentially mitigate the calcification and durability problems of bioprostheses associated with tissue fixation and leaflet mounting. Finally, a polyurethane valve can be manufactured at a substantially reduced cost compared to existing valves. In summary, the valve proposed in this research will lead to a new generation of replacement heart valves that improves upon the shortcomings of existing replacement valves, reduces the cost burden on the health care system and improves the survival rate of patients with heart valve prostheses",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pressure ulcers are a significant problem in long-term health care. Estimates of prevalence in the long-term and extended care environments cluster around 8% and appear stable over the past decade. An estimated 30% of new entrants to homebound care are at risk for developing pressure ulcers. Yet it has been forcefully argued that pressure ulcers are largely preventable regardless of a patient's Braden Risk profile when proper precautionary standards of practice are followed. While reduction to zero may be unrealistic, especially in the near-term as a result of institutional, systemic, and individual factors endemic to the U.S. health care system, nonetheless a reduction from the present rates of incidence in long-term and homebound care is feasible and would yield human and financial savings through diminution of patient sequelae and co-morbidity. Improvement in adherence to standard prevention, treatment, and management practices is a reasonable and worthwhile objective. The Academic Edge, Inc. (AEI) is developing a suite of educational materials and support resources to address prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers. These are to be delivered via web as well as other media. The materials will be interactive, accurate, effective, and extensible. The media and site will address pressure ulcers in terms of both prevention and treatment and will target home health aides (HHA), nurses and other supervisory personnel, and, to a lesser, but no less important extent, patients and their families. In Phase 1, AEI demonstrated the feasibility of the effort by identifying salient HHA beliefs, generating core content and design documents, evaluating those documents through end-user focus groups and subject-matter-expert (SME) reviews, and by producing a video covering a portion of the content and conducting a field trial of that video. Phase 2 will develop two interactive courses, a web portal of pressure ulcer information, and job aids and other performance support tools to increase performance of four key objectives: (1) monitoring for signs of pressure ulcers, (2) taking active steps to identify, monitor, and mitigate risk factors, (3) managing pressure ulcers using current standard practices, and (4) supervising others who interact with those at risk for pressure ulcer formation. These will be developed using a theory-based design and development model and will be evaluated continuously using focus groups and advisory panel reviews. The core content and courses will also be evaluated in two sets of field trials: an initial small scale formative (n=20) validation trial for each course that ensures everything is working correctly in each course and a set of larger summative trials (n=440, home health care personnel; n=120 nursing students) that evaluate the effectiveness of the effort. Pressure ulcers are a significant problem in long-term care. The number of individuals receiving long- term homebound care has increased rapidly in the last decade. Home health aides represent the fastest growing occupation in the U.S., with a projected growth rate of 56% over the 2004-2014 period, adding some 350,000 jobs in that same period. Although most home health aides appear to be willing to take steps to reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers, there presently exists no standardized, friendly, and effective training on pressure ulcers and their prevention for the HHA field. What little training does exist generally targets more advanced practitioners and does so through books and other paper-based media. A readily available, evidence-based, and theory driven set of interactive courses, tools, and resources for individual and small group training, developed in multiple media, should be extremely well-received by home health organizations, can be adapted to be used in broader applications, such as pre-professional nursing training, and will positively affect this important, and mostly preventable, public health concern.",

There exists the need for network interfaces that can be easily reconfigured at the hardware level to provide the user with any desired functionality, from real time intrusion detection to remote visualization.  This project will develop a framework for an adaptable Network Interface Controller (NIC) to remove the bottlenecks present in current network/computer system architectures.  Phase I involved a feasibility study of the framework, including consideration of potential target physical devices and development of sample applications.  A virtual network machine was defined, a network application program interface was produced, code samples were generated, and initial hardware prototyping was undertaken.  In Phase II, the initial framework baseline specification will be expanded and used to demonstrate a comprehensive hardware prototype.  Finally, a client configuration application, which demonstrates local and remote reconfiguration of the network interface and its plug-in modules, will be produced.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The NIC framework should remove the end-user bottlenecks present in high-speed data transmission, by allowing users to transition from software-based network implementations to much faster on-card hardware-based solutions.

        "abstract": "Realizing the promise of nuclear fusion depends in part on effective plasma facing components (PFCs) that can withstand the intense heat loads, forces, and neutron bombardment of long-pulse high-power reactor operation.  A single reactor such as ITER will require thousands of PFCs.  Because imperfections in the joints of just one PFC could have disastrous consequences for reactor operation, joint quality must be evaluated nondestructively during manufacture.  A suitable NDE approach must accommodate the complex geometries of the components, provide 100% inspection of the joints, yield resolutions of one millimeter or less, and operate as part of the manufacturing process.  This project will investigate the use of a revolutionary new NDE technique known as phased array ultrasound for the inspection of PFC joints.  In Phase I, the feasibility of using phased array ultrasound for inspecting PFCs was demonstrated by:  (1) experimental detection of joining defects in representative PFC specimens using phased array transducers; and (2) the design and numerical validation of a more advanced phased array transducer customized to the actual three-dimensional PFC geometry.  Phase II will develop a prototype phased array system, appropriate for in-line production inspection of PFCs.  Instrumentation capable of driving this advanced system will be developed.  The instrument and probes will be demonstrated on PFC mockups representative of the different stages of production.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The NDE system should serve a long-standing unmet need for inspection of dissimilar metal bonds with complex geometry.  Such scenarios arise not only in various components of fusion reactors, but also in nuclear fission reactors, petrochemical plants, aerospace vehicles, and manufacturing industries",

To achieve the best performance, specialized lasers are used to produce electrons for these accelerators.  These lasers must be precise and reliable, and must provide much more power, in order to fully enable the capabilities of these accelerators.  This project will develop a powerful and reliable laser ideally suited for use in electron sources for accelerators.  The laser will use novel fiber-laser technology that is better suited to meeting the specific requirements of electron sources than previously-available technologies.  The laser will produce pulses lasting less than one-tenth of one billionth of a second, at rates beyond a billion times per second, precisely synchronized in time with the cycles of electron accelerator systems.  Phase I demonstrated feasibility by combining commercial electronics technology with technologies used in optical fiber communications.  The solution is robust and reliable, and will allow for an easier integration of the laser with an accelerator, compared with previous approaches.  Phase II will combine this new laser-pulse-generation method with advanced optical-fiber amplifier technology and nonlinear optics technology, to produce the high power laser needed for electron accelerators.  The laser system will be thoroughly tested, and then delivered and installed at an electron accelerator facility.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  In addition to enabling electron accelerators to be more productive, powerful lasers with similar characteristics should find use in semiconductor processing, where they can improve the performance and reduce the costs of flat-panel display screens, and improve the yield of semiconductor chips.  The lasers also could be used for critical marking, cutting, and micromachining applications.

        "abstract": "Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are one of the most efficient and cleanest power generating systems being developed.  A key component is the cathode air heat exchanger, or recuperator, which ensures that the cathode air, and thereby the cells, are at sufficient temperature to permit ion mobility \u00bf and thereby improve overall SOFC system efficiency.  At present, commercially available metallic recuperators contribute a significant cost to the overall cost of an SOFC generator.  This project will develop and demonstrate a \u00bfhybrid\u00bf recuperator that combines a high temperature ceramic section with a low temperature metallic section to reduce overall costs, while achieving high effectiveness and long life.  The configuration takes advantage of the low fouling capability of a ceramic heat exchanger core at high temperature, while lower grade metallic materials are used in medium-to-low temperature regions.  By incorporating both sections into a single unit, costly interconnect ducting and fittings, along with associated support structure and insulation, will not be required.  In Phase I, a single pass ceramic monolith was manufactured and tested to determine its heat transfer performance, plenum sealing methods were evaluated, and the system\u00bfs ability to withstand temperature gradients and thermal cycling was determined.  The monolith was integrated into a multi-pass, cross-flow recuperator configuration and the effectiveness of the recuperator was determined to be greater than 80%.  In Phase II, the ceramic monolith will be further refined to enhance heat transfer performance, and a low cost sealing/attachment arrangement will be implemented.  Pre-commercial prototypes will be produced and used to conduct performance and durability testing, and to establish manufacturing techniques and costs.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The \u00bfhybrid\u00bf recuperator should significantly reduce the cost of a key component in SOFC generators.  It is estimated that a cost reduction of $100/kW, compared with state-of-theart metallic recuperators, can be achieved.  The technology also should be applicable to other high temperature applications such as metal melting furnaces, glass furnaces, chemical process reactors, forge furnaces, etc",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Conventional body-powered assistive appliances intended to help children having upper limb deficiencies have proven inadequate for some activities, most notably play. The critical component in these systems that contributes grasp functionality, called a prehensor or terminal device, must strike a balance between functionality for activities children wish to accomplish and cosmesis for parents who desire their child have a normal appearance. Parents most often select more cosmetic devices designed to mimic the anatomical hand, while studies have shown children prefer devices that are more functional. Those who do select more functional devices often find existing units offer disappointing or inadequate performance for play activities as they require too much cable excursion or operate inefficiently and demand too much cable tension to effect grasp. These problems leave many children without an acceptable device at precisely the time they should be learning lifelong prosthetics usage skills. In Phase I, ADA demonstrated the technical feasibility of a prehensor designed specifically for children's daily activities. An adaptive digit was designed that provides the enclosing grasp children primarily use as opposed to high-force pinching grasp common for adults. Also included was a Variable Mechanical Advantage (VMA) grasping engine that efficiently transforms cable excursion and tension into quality, stable grasp. This engine significantly improves the ratio of grip force achieved to the input cable tension (called the forward force ratio, FFR). ADA's prototype achieved a maximum FFR of 0.78, as compared to current devices which average an FFR of 0.2. The end result is that children can achieve higher levels of gripping force with less physical exertion, freeing them to do what they desire most-play. This Phase II effort will focus on refining the proven Phase I prototype design to 1) minimize its commercial manufacturing cost to benefit families of limited means and 2) validate its performance in actual service with children users. To gain commercial acceptance, additional features such as passive holding capacity and improved cosmesis will be incorporated. ADA will work with practicing prosthetists in the Shriners Hospital network through the design phase and into clinical evaluations. By partnering with Shriners, ADA will establish an early, working relationship with the nation's leading provider of child's prosthetic care and equipment. Throughout, ADA will maintain focus on commercial viability by constantly working with outside partners to ensure satisfying children's grasping needs remain central to the effort and in crisp focus. If successful, the Phase II effort will produce a child's prehensor that is functionally superior to all currently available conventional prehensors. To ensure success with parents as well as children, ADA will include market-driven cosmetic features in addition to adaptive grasp, VMA, and passive holding capability. The Phase II effort will leverage this technology to create an entity that will be attractive to Phase III investors. Due to the small market size, children with upper limb deficiencies are made to get by with prosthetics not suited to their special needs. This research seeks to develop a functional prehensor designed specifically to outperform available devices in both daily use and cosmetic acceptance.",

Utilizing this basis, a set of materials, device and process development tasks have been devised. These include continued lifetime improvements and development of an encapsulation process. During Phase-I, the impact of light-emitting layer morphology and cathode interactions on device performance was identified. This has allowed a prioritization of these issues for final development. Technical objectives include exceeding the commercialization threshold and achieving greater than 1000 hour product lifetimes with a flexible encapsulation process adaptable to small and large scale manufacture. This includes advanced light-emitting polymers (LEP) formulations, cathode development, and device structure optimization to meet performance milestones along with encapsulation adhesive, getter materials and\nlamination process trials and optimization.  If successful the outcome of this project includes benefits for mobile electronic product designers and consumers using low cost and low energy manufacturing in the U.S. display and lighting industries. Furthermore, the science and engineering work compliments R&D efforts in related materials technologies. The proposed technology is uniquely attractive among OLED lighting technologies currently under development in that it allows for low manufacturing set-up and operating expenses, and therefore early commercial adoption. Because of this cost structure, which is radically different from conventional, high capital, glass-based OLED processing, there is a significant early commercialization opportunity in mobile backlighting products and other specialty lighting applications. In these product areas, the proposed technology's voltage, brightness, DC drive, and form factor makes it preferable to existing inorganic approaches. The low capital cost structure and dependence on advanced materials technology also provides opportunities for distributed manufacture in the U.S. away from the centralized Far East display manufacturing base. Outside of the organic display and lighting industries, this research would enhance the scientific understanding for other emerging printable and organic electronics technologies including organic photovoltaics, thin film transistors and memory, where low cost manufacturing of high-efficiency devices are paramount for commercial success.",

The capillary diameter and length that will yield optimal resolution and efficiency will be determined using a state-of-the-art image-intensified CCD camera capable of creating short time-interval images, in which noise can be identified and filtered out.

The detector and generator combinations will increase the safety, reliability and efficiency of nuclear and other power plant facilities. The discovery of fatigue cracks and piping integrity without the removal of insulation, and possibly the detection of aging in polymeric cabling materials will be possible.

Dentists are increasingly involved with the treatment of OSA with oral appliances, an accepted treatment of OSA for patients with mild to moderate disease severity and for those patients who cannot or will not be treated with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) developed and validated the Apnea Risk Evaluation System (ARES), a convenient, cost-effective alternative to laboratory sleep studies to facilitate rapid, cost-effective diagnosis of OSA at home. ARES proved effective during the Phase I study in confirming diagnosis of OSA in a dental setting and in evaluating treatment outcome and assessing titration levels in patients fitted with mandibular-advancing devices (MAD). The primary goals for Phase II will be to: 1) acquire a large database of ARES treatment outcome studies from 100 patients treated with MAD, 2) document treatment efficacy using the Alertness and Memory Profiling (AMP) system, a highly sensitive and objective method for quantifying outcome, 3) develop a system for monitoring and improving MAD titration, and 4) develop a model for predicting treatment success with oral appliances. The result of this effort will be to provide a basis for expanded use of MAD therapy by selecting patients most likely to benefit from this treatment and providing measures to maximize the benefit to those selected. Dentists and dental sleep specialists represent an important access point for identifying patients with undiagnosed OSA. Although many individuals do not routinely visit their primary care physicians, the majority receive routine biannual dental examinations. Dental professionals can therefore play an important role in the identification of patients at-risk for OSA. The ARES provides a cost-effective method for dentists and dental sleep specialists to test patients for OSA and evaluate treatment efficacy. The Phase II project is designed to build upon the success achieved during Phase I in working with the dental community to provide a comprehensive program that be implemented to facilitate early identification and efficacious treatment for patients with loud snoring and OSA.",

        "abstract": "Polarized electron beams are important to high energy physics and nuclear physics experiments. At present, linear colliders and nuclear science machines use DC polarized sources, as these have been proven to provide polarized beams with good cathode lifetimes and acceptable emittances. However, future linear colliders, including the International Linear Collider (ILC), will require emittance damping rings that can be large and expensive.  A gun that can produce low emittance polarized beams with a reasonable cathode lifetime can reduce or even eliminate the damping ring requirement.  In particular, a superconducting radiofrequency electron gun that uses a gallium arsenide photocathode has the potential to produce polarized electron beams with very low emittances, while still providing for long cathode lifetimes.  This project will demonstrate that the cathode lifetimes in a superconducting radiofrequency gun can rival the lifetimes achieved in existing DC guns and that a gun system can be designed with very low electron beam emittances.  Using simulations, Phase I showed not only that low emittances can be achieved but also that ion backbombardment, which limits the lifetime of cathodes in DC guns, can actually be less than in DC guns.  Phase II will design modifications to the existing cavity and cryostat, which will be used for the lifetime testing.  Phase II also will develop a preliminary design for a superconducting radiofrequency gun, which would be suitable for use with the ILC.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  In addition to ILC applications, the electron source could be used in other radiation sources to produce high-power, coherent radiation, spanning THz to UV and perhaps beyond, through various mechanisms such as coherent synchrotron radiation and FELs.

This Phase I project will customize a TELE to a) provide science lessons for middle school students while increasing comprehension; b) that allow less qualified teachers to feel comfortable using the materials; and c)  that reduces the barriers to implementation among teachers. To develop, test, and evaluate the product, Advanced Fuel Research will use the open source software of the Concord Consortium.

        "abstract": "High field superconducting dipole magnets, with a field strength of about 4.5 Tesla and a bend radius of about 0.7 m, are required in the high radiation areas of beam transport in future rare isotope accelerators.  However, the small bending radii of these magnets produce unwanted higher-order harmonics in the magnetic field, which are detrimental to accelerator operation.  This project will develop a novel coil design, the double-helix dipole, which provides an inherent ability to cancel unwanted higher order harmonics.  The double-helix dipole employs helical windings on composite or moldable ceramic coil forms, thereby creating very robust coil structures, as needed for reliable superconducting magnets.  Phase I designed a bent dipole magnet to meet the specifications of the planned Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA).  It was shown that the higher-order harmonics caused by the bending radius of the coil could be compensated by modifying the conductor path of the double-helix coils, thus allowing the magnet to meet field quality requirements.  A manufacturing process for double-helix coils was developed, and two prototype coil windings were manufactured and shock tested with liquid nitrogen to qualify the constituent materials for cryogenic applications.  During Phase II, two superconducting magnets will be manufactured and cryogenically tested at a national laboratory.  The first magnet will be a short straight coil without iron yoke to qualify the superconducting cable and the manufacturing technology.  The second magnet will be a prototype bent magnet with iron yoke. Field measurements will be performed at operational temperature, in order to verify the method of compensating for higher-order multipole components in the winding itself. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The bent double-helix magnets should be an important contribution to accelerator magnet design for planned rare isotope accelerators.  In addition, the high uniform field and the low manufacturing cost would make the technology an ideal fit for use in the field of proton therapy.  The coil technology also should be suitable for use in rotors and stators of high power electrical machinery.",

The proposed system will utilize a suite of miniature wearable motion sensors to characterize limb and torso motion and compare it to stored reference profiles to evaluate adherence to body movement protocols such as yoga, meditation postures, and tai chi. Data will be collected in real time from wearable sensors using a low power standardized digital wireless personal area network technology. The recent commercial availability of low-cost high-precision miniature motion tracking sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) and standardized personal area networking technologies make the proposed project technically feasible at this time. Up to seven small wireless sensor packages may be worn on the body to collect motion and optionally other physiological parameters such as heart rate, respiration rate, and blood oxygen concentration. The acceleration and angular rate sensing information at each sensor location is transmitted to a handheld computer or smartphone (a handheld computer with integrated cell phone) where it is recorded. Personal area networking technologies, such as the Bluetooth network, are now standard in many commercially available handheld computers and smartphones. The use of a standard wireless networking solution will allow a researcher to invest in a set of sensors that will be compatible with new portable computing and cell phone devices for many years to come. Recorded motion data are automatically processed and characterized into a list of recognized poses and movement sequences that can be directly compared to a scripted protocol. A report is automatically generated from the analysis software package presenting an adherence index expressed as percentage of the number of deviations between the recorded and scripted movement sequences.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced Medical Electronics Corporation (AME) proposes to develop a 16 node wireless surface electro-myography (EMG) system, including a custom integrated circuit (IC), for research and clinical applications. The study of muscular activation patterns has been widely used for clinical purposes and has proven to be a useful tool for investigating neurological pathologies in pediatric and adult populations including ataxia, dystonia and Parkinson's disease. The current state-of-the-art for wireless EMG applications is a collection of EMG sensors wired to a body-worn amplifier and transmitter device in a star topology. The connecting wires, which are secured to the body, may (1) restrict body movement, especially with children, and (2) add noise and/or motion artifacts. Sensors based on the proposed integrated circuit will not suffer from these limitations since they will locally amplify, digitize, and transmit digital EMG signals without the need for wires, which is of particular importance in dynamic EMG measurements where the subject is in motion. Recent advances in IC technology enable AME to design and fabricate wireless EMG nodes that integrate the functions of EMG sensing, signal conditioning, digitizing, wireless transmission, and power sourcing into a very small electrode package. An electrode package held to the skin by adhesive will be able to transmit the data via a wireless network to a data collection PC. The system will implement a network protocol that will support up to 16 independent wireless EMG sensors. In phase I, AME has completely specified the IC requirements, designed the analog building block circuits, designed a custom wireless network protocol, and performed simulations of the analog IC and wireless protocol. In phase II, AME, with its partners, will build a production prototype wireless EMG system, and verify its performance in a human study. This project's innovation stems from AME's ability to integrate all the functions necessary to perform wireless EMG data collection onto a miniature node. This device will support detailed human neurological studies, which support numerous research areas including, but not limited to, ataxia, dystonia, and Parkinson's disease.",

It will be designed with modular amplifiers that allow either a low noise clinical bandwidth or an enhanced wide bandwidth. It will be comparatively evaluated in human tests against a tethered system. The developed UWB wireless system will be suitable for applications such as high channel count scalp EEG, cortical grid electrodes, multi-contact depth electrodes, and fine wire microelectrodes for multi-single-unit recording. The proposed UWB wireless EEG system will make possible for the first time recording single neuron extra-cellular action potential (AP) and local field potential (LFP) from freely behaving and seizing humans. It will also remove restrictions imposed on patient movement and susceptibilities to artifact from movement caused by a tethered system. Ultra-wideband (UWB) is a fast emerging radio technology with the potential for major advances in wireless communications. The UWB standard is officially designated IEEE 802.15.3a. The utilization of large bandwidth allows UWB to transmit large amounts of data. One of the most common neurological diseases is epilepsy. Epilepsy refers to the tendency to have unprovoked seizures, and encompasses a number of different syndromes. It has a prevalence of 0.5 to one percent. This translates to approximately two million persons in the United States. Furthermore, three to five percent of the population will have non-febrile seizures at some point in their life. Radio- telemetry of EEG has been recognized as a goal in the epilepsy monitoring community for many years. The application of UWB to EEG monitoring is new and innovative. It will offer a significant improvement to the field over the slower existing technology. No comparable device is currently available.",

The heat dissipation rate of electronic devices has increased dramatically as a result of advances in semiconductor materials, faster switching speeds, compression of circuit physical architecture, and miniaturization of device envelops.  These market trends are expected to continue and there is a critical need for advanced materials with improved thermal conductivity capable of meeting the package heat dissipation requirements of current and future high power electronic systems.  In addition the materials will need to have a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) that minimizes the CTE mismatch that occurs at the interface between packaging components of different materials.  The objective of the Phase II effort is the development and demonstration of cost-effective package assemblies that incorporate\ngraphite-metal components with a thermal conductivity of from 500 to 600 W/m-oK and a coefficient of thermal expansion that can be adjusted between 5.0 and 10 ppm/oC.

The research will produce the key knowledge required to enable the production of low-cost, high-volume graphite-metal components to satisfy the packaging requirements for the above applications.  The packaging products supported by this manufacturing technology will benefit a broad spectrum of commercial, industrial, and military high power electronics end users.  The adoption and wide-spread use of the graphite-metal packaging products for electronic systems will enable commercial electronic devices based upon more efficient higher power semiconductor materials that will provide benefit to society in the form of reduced energy consumption and improved environmental quality.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Malignant gliomas have a very poor prognosis with median survival measured in months rather than years.  It is a disease with great need of novel therapeutic approaches.  Within cancer gene therapy the use of adenoviral vectors to deliver HSV-tk (AdV-tk) has been one of the most widely studied and promising approaches.  A few dose escalation Phase I studies have shown good safety profiles with encouraging anecdotal results.  However, its clinical efficacy has not yet been assessed for any tumor type.  Thus, clinical Phase Il and Ill studies are needed to evaluate the true potential of AdV-tk.  A completed phase I study of AdV4k + prod rug gene therapy in recurrent malignant gliomas demonstrated a safe dose range for AdV-tk in brain tumors and some encouraging results.  Preclinical studies demonstrate improved efficacy without added toxicity when AdV-tk gene therapy is combined with radiation therapy.  The current study proposed in this application seeks to evaluate the combination of AdV-tk + prodrug gene therapy in combination with radiation therapy for malignant gliomas.  Since this radio-gene therapy combination has not previously been studied in human brain tumors, a Phase I study must first be performed to assess potential toxicity of the combination (the subject of this Phase I application).  The long-term goal of the research described in this proposal is to develop a product that will increase survival time or quality of life for patients diagnosed with malignant gliomas.      The patient population with unresectable malignant gliomas was chosen since these patients receive radiation therapy as standard of care following stereotactic biopsy for confirmation of diagnosis.  In addition, no other local therapies are available for these patients.  The primary objective for this Phase I study is to evaluate the safety of escalating doses of AdV-tk with a fixed dose of the oral prodrug, valacyclovir, and standard radiation therapy.  Three dose levels of AdV-tk, ranging from 3x1010 to 3x1011 vector particles in half log increments, will be evaluated with 3-6 patients per dose.  The study will be conducted by Advantagene, which has a track record of efficient translation of laboratory studies into clinical gene therapy studies, with patient accrual at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which has an active brain tumor clinical group.  The Phase II portion will assess clinical efficacy at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the highest dose level reached in this Phase I study.",

It is now recognized that atmospheric loading of aerosols, generated through human activities, can exert an influence on the earth\u00bfs radiation budget comparable in magnitude with greenhouse gases.  However, uncertainties in the understanding of both direct and indirect aerosol forcing limit the ability to quantify human influences on climate change.  This project will develop a particle single scattering albedo monitor that combines extinction and scattering measurements in one instrument, with rapid time-response, active temperature/relative humidity control, and high sensitivity.  This monitor will provide a simpler, smaller, lower cost alternative to cavity ring downbased systems and more traditional instruments with no loss in sensitivity or accuracy.  In Phase I, a laboratory prototype was constructed and calibrated.  Both particle extinction and absorption coefficients were measured simultaneously using monodisperse polystyrene latex particles ranging in size from 0.1 to 8.0 microns in diameter.  A baseline precision for the extinction measurement was ~0.3 Mm-1 in 60 seconds integration time.  The monitor\u00bfs response to scattering was flat for particles from 0.1 to 2 microns, but fell to 75% of full response at 8 microns.  Modeling indicated that the falloff was caused by use of a highly non-ideal integrating volume.  Phase II will develop a robust and improved prototype instrument, which will be compared to a number of commercially available instruments.  Once its performance capabilities have been established, the prototype will be used in the field to measure aircraft exhaust and urban air pollution.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The comparatively low cost and ease of use of this sensor should allow almost routine measurement of the scattering properties of atmospheric aerosols, something precluded by the cost and complexity of current instrumentation.

In the Phase II program a dual, all thermoelectrically cooled system for detection of NO, CO2, CO and OCS in exhaled breath will be designed, constructed, and deployed in a clinical research program.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is one of the most common and costly illnesses in the US, with over 20 million Americans suffering from asthma with an annual societal cost of over $18 billion. Sadly, about 5000 Americans die every year from asthma, even though most asthma death is preventable with proper treatment, and the rates are especially high among the socioeconomically disadvantaged. The metered dose inhaler (MDI) is the most common form of treatment, with nearly 50 years of patient acceptance, physician confidence, and FDA approval. In the near past, MDIs used chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propellants, but these are in the process of being phased out by the EPA and FDA due to their high ozone depletion potential (ODP). Newer MDI devices are now pressurized with hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellants, which overcome the ODP problem. New problems with formulations and device incompatibility made it time-consuming and expensive for the pharmaceutical industry to begin to use the new propellant HFA-134a. The new MDIs that use HFA-134a are 3-5 times more expensive than the old CFC inhalers, which is a big problem for some of the patients that need them the most, and the global warming potential is 1300 times higher for HFA-134a than for carbon dioxide. Aerophase has developed an inexpensive carbon dioxide (CO2) propellant MDI that is competitive with the HFA MDIs, with high drug delivery efficiency and dose reproducibility. We have demonstrated that asthma drugs can be effectively formulated in our compact and reliable inhalers. In our just-completed phase II SBIR project we developed inhalers using several different designs, and selected two optimized designs for SBIR Continuation testing and pilot-scale production according to the FDA Draft Guidance for Industry (Metered Dose Inhaler and Dry Powder Inhaler Drug Products: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Documentation, CDER, 10/98). Our proposed CO2 propellant MDI devices will create competition so that the entire future of the MDI is not totally dependent upon one or two HFA propellants that could develop problems with availability, affordability, long term toxicity, and/or environmental impacts. The overall mission of Aerophase Inc. is to improve healthcare through aerosol medicine. The primary purpose of the proposed project is to relieve symptoms and prevent death from asthma, especially among the hardest hit groups like African Americans, with a CO2 propellant inhaler that is as effective as and less expensive than currently available MDIs. In the US, 10% of the population has asthma, 5000 people die from it each year, and the total cost to the economy is over $18 billion per year; notably the impact of asthma is especially hard on African Americans due to a variety of factors including air quality and access to medical care. One of the most popular tools in the treatment of asthma is the metered dose inhaler (MDI), a small aerosol canister filled with drug and propellant which administers a puff of medicine for inhalation; this popular device has been used for 50 years, but is going through major changes today due to the phase-out of the use of chlorofluorocarbon propellants (because they harm the environment by damaging the protective ozone layer in the stratosphere); the most popular replacement MDI propellant has been hydrofluoroalkane (HFA), which does not harm the ozone layer; unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the prices for the new HFA inhalers are much higher than for the old inhalers, which is especially hard on socioeconomically disadvantaged patients that need asthma therapy the most. Fortunately, Aerophase has invented new, inexpensive, MDI inhalers that use carbon dioxide as the propellant gas; competition from our new inhalers-which work just as well as the HFA MDI devices in laboratory tests-will help keep asthma treatment costs down; the proposed SBIR Continuation project will allow us to make our new CO2 MDI device meet the FDA guidelines for MDI usage and stability so that we can manufacture them for human clinical testing.",

AFCO Systems Development (ASD) proposes to advance the state of system security monitoring technology and meet its objective by developing a PCI card that combines coprocessor based firmware, reconfigurable computing and hostbased software to provide a comprehensive and extensible platform against such attacks. The proposed solution will be upgradeable in the field by replacement and/or reconfiguration of its firmware, software or hardware (VHDL). An immediate benefit of this research will be the availability of tool for the detection of rootkits that have been maliciously introduced onto Windows platforms. This is accomplished, not by searching for the particular &lsquo;signatures&rsquo; known to be carried by this type of malware, but rather by the examination of operating system internal data structures for any corruption or inconsistency. This more flexible approach will allow the identification of a much wider class of rootkits than previously attainable. An additional benefit of our research efforts is that the (platform independent) algorithms we develop can be ported over to other environments, including new bus (e.g. PCI express) and processor (e.g. VMX) architectures.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The role of proteoglycans and carbohydrate polymers such as heparan sulfate in biological processes are becoming better understood, but this new frontier has only begun to be explored. Tissue regeneration is also an emerging frontier. This proposed research, when completed, will make an important contribution to both the proteoglycan and tissue regenerative fields, with a specific, clinical impact on periodontal regeneration. The objectives of this project are both scientific and developmental in nature. Scientific advancements in the structural and functional understanding of proteoglycans, such as Perlecan, are proposed, along with innovative studies investigating their role as therapeutics in bone healing. Site-directed mutagenesis to the Perlecan core will establish a valuable precedent. One of the major innovations of this technology is the ability to deliver DNA, not protein, to generate natural, endogenous Perlecan expression in the wounds or surgical sites. With this patented technology, a host-glycosylated Perlecan core will be generated in vivo, intended to promote vascularity, proliferation, and differentiation for enhanced healing. In addition to being highly cost-effective, this technology offers a low-cost alternative to the costly recombinant biologic adjuncts already in the marketplace. The development of a safe, effective, and useful product for periodontal bone regeneration is another important objective. Phase I support for this project enabled the creation of a prototype Perlecan expression construct for delivery of sequences encoding domain 1 (D1) of the core protein. In situ heparan sulfate glycosylation of the expressed core was validated, and new bone formation appeared to be enhanced by delivery of the Perlecan D1 expression construct in vivo. This Phase II project proposes to develop important modifications to the prototype Perlecan D1 expression construct, to identify other effective bone graft materials for co-delivery with the Perlecan D1 expression construct, and to test the Perlecan D1 expression construct in guided tissue regeneration. Structural modeling has allowed rational design for site-directed mutagenesis of the Perlecan D1 core sequence to increase glycosylation and enhance growth factor binding, while addition of a COOH-terminal tag on the prototype transgene will enhance development and characterization. Effective bone graft materials for co-delivery with the replication-defective adenovirus system, or with plasmid DNA in liposomes, will be identified from common bone graft materials or by copolymerization with resorbable poly D-lactide microparticles through an industry partnership. Periodontal regeneration in vivo will be assessed by radiographic and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging in a university collaboration, by histomorphometric analysis of new bone, new periodontal ligament, new cementum, and immunohistochemical measurement of osteocalcin at a 3 week and 12 week post-surgical time point. Expression of the Perlecan D1 transgene will be assessed locally and systemically while safety and toxicity of molecular Perlecan and heparan sulfate delivery is investigated.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Science apathy is growing at the K-12 education level, and represents an alarming development with potentially devastating consequences at individual, societal and economic levels. Surprisingly, this student apathy is increasing while the general public reads record numbers of popular science books and watches increasing amounts of science TV programming. In spite of the $70 billion investment in technology during the 1990s, K-12 science education fails to excite students. Technology has become prevalent in science education without fundamentally improving test scores or student attitudes. We claim the core of the problem is how technology is being used. Our main objective is to deal with the science apathy challenge by creating engaging discovery-oriented science learning modules uniquely combining social learning pedagogies with distributed simulation technology. This combination is part of a new framework that we call Collective Simulations. This framework will create extraordinary immersive, yet cost effective, learning experiences based on wirelessly connected handheld computers. For instance, in a K-12 course covering physiology, each group of students controls physiological variables of a single system/organ on their handheld computer, while a central simulation gathers all the data and projects them. Collective Simulations allow students to learn about the intricacies of interdependent complex systems by essentially becoming organs and engaging in a simulation-aided discourse with other students and teachers. In the long term, Collective Simulations would include other health education topics such as infectious diseases, nutrition, and physical education. Additionally, these simulations could also be used in medical school training, patient education, and museums. Our specific Phase II aims include working with content experts, educational researchers and practitioners, and assessment experts to: 1) scale up content by incorporating more human systems and creating complete, ready-to-use learning activities that cover a semester-length course; 2) increase system usability by simplifying the use of this technology by a) using networking technology that can automatically configure itself without the need for technical experts, and b) incorporating Phase I user-interface and content feedback provided by medical experts, students and teachers; 3) scale up assessment by raising the number of schools involved, widening the school profiles through the inclusion of inner city schools, and tapping into outreach programs such as the University of Colorado Science Discovery program with access to 30,000 students; 4) disseminate broadly by working with publishers to align simulation content with existing and proposed human physiology textbooks; and 5) broaden participation by making the technology more affordable for economically disadvantaged schools. The research proposed for Phase II is highly relevant to general public health. Health science apathy, increasing at a societal level, is often rooted in K-12 science education failing to be of interest or relevance to everyday life. Collective Simulations, especially when exploring compelling content (e.g. connecting physiology with nutrition, physical education and substance abuse), are likely to engage students more and to turn them into better-informed, and consequently healthier citizens.",

        "abstract": "If CO2 could be scrubbed from the flue gas of power plants and safely sequestered, the country\u00bfs most important source of electricity, fossil-fired power plants, could operate without emitting significant amounts of greenhouse gases.  Although technology for scrubbing CO2 from flue gas is commercially available, it is far too expensive and requires too much energy to be widely deployed.  This project will develop technology to reduce the costs and energy requirements for the stripper of a CO2 scrubber, with the objective of making CO2 scrubbing an affordable technology for controlling emissions.  Specifically, the expensive metallic heat exchangers, which are fundamental to CO2 scrubber operation, will be converted to plastic designs.  Thermal efficiency of the scrubber will be improved by replacing the conventional reboiler and stripper column with a unique heat and mass exchanger that again is based on a plastic heat exchanger.  In Phase I, performance data from a proof-of-concept experiment confirmed that the proposed technology could effectively strip the CO2 from an MEA absorbent at a significantly lower temperature than required by a conventional stripper.  By lowering the temperature for stripping, and by using the plastic heat exchangers, the derating of a power plant that used an MEA scrubber could be reduced from 35% to 20%.  Moreover the use of plastic heat exchangers would reduce capital costs for the MEA scrubber by 24%.  In Phase II, the plastic heat exchanger technology will be scaled-up and tested under controlled laboratory conditions, using several thermally-regenerated absorbents.  A preferred absorbent will be identified.  Engineering analyses will be performed to determine the potential reductions in energy use and capital costs.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as decribed by the awardee:  The new scrubber technology would allow the nation to use its vast reserves of coal in existing and planned power plants, without contributing to the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere.  Furthermore, since CO2 is increasingly being used to recover \u00bfstranded\u00bf oil reserves, the technology could play an important part in extending the nation\u00bfs oil resource, by lowering the cost of CO2",

        "abstract": "Secure sources of clean freshwater are essential to the welfare of communities throughout the world.  Unfortunately, both in this country and abroad, freshwater supplies are increasingly being contested.  Faced with threats to growth, economic development, and the health of their citizens, governments are battling over the rights to freshwater supplies.  Desalination, particularly if it is powered by a sustainable source of energy, can alleviate this critical shortage.  This project will develop technology to dramatically reduce the cost of water from a desalination plant that runs on renewable energy.  The novel desalination cycle operates similarly to a conventional multi-stage flash evaporation plant, except that all stages operate at atmospheric pressure.  This change allows the expensive metallic heat exchangers and vacuum vessel used in conventional plants to be replaced with inexpensive plastic heat exchangers.  A novel configuration for the solar collectors, based on low-cost evacuated-tube collectors, provides most of the thermal energy for producing water.  In Phase I, performance data from a proof-of-concept experiment confirmed that the proposed technology could achieve a very high thermal efficiency.  The experimental data was used to calibrate a computer model, which predicted that the efficiency of the process would be about twice that of a conventional thermal desalination plant.  The cost of water was projected to be less than half of cost of water from competing desalination concepts powered primarily by renewable energy, and competitive with the cost of water from conventional desalination plants.  Phase II will build and test a larger model of the desalination concept and operate the model in the field with thermal energy provided by solar collectors.  The installed cost for a commercial desalination plant will be developed from a detailed manufacturing cost analysis of the plastic heat exchangers that form the core of the plant.   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should allow economic growth in parts of the country that do not (or will not in the future) have secure water supplies.  The technology also would improve agricultural and industrial productivity, including the enhanced recovery of oil and natural gas, by greatly reducing the volume of wastewater, which often can have high disposal costs and adverse environmental impacts.",

I This project will build on Akaka's OpenClinica platform, the leading open source clinical research solution, to develop a broad-based open source software infrastructure that enables interoperability in heterogeneous clinical and translational research, and to develop targeted commercially-supported open source solutions from this infrastructure.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dedicated high-resolution small animal imaging systems have recently emerged as important new tools for cancer research. Of these systems, x-ray microcomputed tomography (microCT) shows promise as a cost-effective means for detecting and characterizing soft tissue structures, skeletal abnormalities, and tumors in live animals. Existing CT systems provide high-resolution images with excellent sensitivity; however, use of this powerful modality for many important functional studies is limited due to their slower speed of operation (5 to 30 minutes acquisition time) and limited area coverage. To address these limitations, we propose to develop a high speed, high sensitivity, and large area detector for x-ray microCT. The detector will be based on a new high efficiency, low afterglow, structured scintillator coupled to a modified architecture CCD with a specially designed readout to accommodate high frame rates. By the end of the Phase II research we will have developed a fully functional prototype microCT system based on this novel detector. The envisioned system will allow volumetric data acquisition in one second or less, while minimizing the radiation dose to the animal. The efficacy of this system will be demonstrated by imaging tissue vascular physiology and perfusion in organs, as well as by conducting functional physiologic studies in small animals. This new imaging technology has enormous potential in both medical and non-medical applications. The estimated market size for high resolution, reduced afterglow scintillator, high temporal and spatial resolution detector, and other technologies being developed under this program is well over one hundred million dollars. A significant fraction of this market represents areas where the involved technologies will have a major impact.",

These images allow investigation of metabolism in the region being studied and are a useful tool for understanding the functioning of the organs as well as diagnosing symptoms of diseases. Nuclear medicine is a very important modality in cardiac imaging, providing both diagnosis as well as prognosis. SPECT is more commonly used in localizing coronary artery disease and as many as 90% of myocardial perfusion studies are now performed using SPECT. The role of PET in cardiac imaging is gradually expanding, particularly in the areas of detecting coronary artery disease (where it shows ~10 to 15% higher accuracy then SPECT) and assessing myocardial viability. Recent developments in combining nuclear medicine with X-ray CT imaging provide better attenuation correction in cardiac imaging studies. It is clear that nuclear medicine technologies are playing a prominent and an increasingly important role in cardiac care and clinical diagnosis. However, there is urgent need for improvement in the performance of these imaging modalities in order to exploit their full potential.

Positron Emission Tomography (PET) offers high sensitivity to a range of biological processes through the use of targeted radiolabeled probes. Unfortunately, precise signal localization can be extremely difficult due to low spatial resolution and the lack of anatomical information in PET. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can provide high spatial resolution and excellent soft tissue contrast, but suffers from poor signal strength leading to low sensitivity. The overall goal of the proposed effort is to combine the best features of PET and MR modalities for small animal studies into a single imaging instrument that will record data in both imaging modalities simultaneously. The most immediate benefit of the integrated system will be to provide high-resolution anatomical context for PET studies. This will lead to better overall understanding of the origin of the PET signals. The 'in-register' MR images may be used to compute scatter and attenuation in the PET images and also to estimate partial volume errors in the lower-resolution PET scans, thus aiding quantification of the PET signal.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Information on the structure and function of proteins is important for unveiling biological processes taking place on a molecular level. X-ray crystallography has been successful in determining protein structure, however, it is not well suited for analyzing hydrogen atoms and water molecules. It has been shown that the thermal neutrons are a far better tool for probing interactions between proteins and water, because they interact directly with light nuclei, not their electron clouds as in case of x-ray diffraction. However, the use of thermal neutrons has been underutilized, partially due to the lack of adequate detectors. Current two-dimensional detectors for neutrons do not provide adequate area coverage, spatial resolution, sensitivity, and geometry best suited for the given application. To address these issues, we propose to develop a large area digital imaging detector for thermal neutrons, which offers a better combination of surface coverage, spatial resolution, detection efficiency and dynamic range than is currently possible. The detector is based on a novel, large-area scintillator, tailored for imaging thermal neutrons, coupled to a digital readout. This thermal neutron imaging system will advance the state-of-the-art of detectors used in macromolecular crystallography and neutron radiography. High resolution neutron imaging will provide better insights into biological systems, and polymers and other ordered structures. For example, it will provide better understanding of disease progression, improved insights into viral structures through neutron diffraction studies. The proposed detector could be employed at any neutron source facility and would help to advance basic research in protein mechanisms as well as drug design.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The \"Big Idea\" driving this project is that human memory is small, the body of scientific knowledge is vast and that breakthroughs are possible if software can do a better job of connecting researchers with knowledge in text and databases. The first step is to stop looking for words (as a search engine does) in data but instead try to find facts in data. A fact is something claimed in text or a database explicitly. A fact may not be true but we want to develop software that finds those facts. What does a fact look like? Consider the following sentence from MEDLINE: \"Recently, we have found that Htt is an antiapoptotic protein in striatal cells and acts by preventing caspase-3 activity.\" It contains the fact that the gene id 6532 (in the Entrez Gene database) regulates gene id 836. Software can extract such facts from a sentence like this. But the current state-of-the-art is not doing a great job of it. The reason is simple-current systems are focused on not making mistakes which means that they miss a lot of opportunities to find facts. The best reported performance is around 40% of the facts being found which we think is severely compromising the usefulness of text mining technologies in bioinformatics. This is where we are trying a different approach-we are focused on finding all the facts. We call this \"total recall\" which we demonstrated was possible in Phase I but total recall comes with a price: we make lots of mistakes. The key innovation is that we keep score of how confident we are of any given fact which gives us an important point of leverage in sifting good from bad facts. Our Phase II proposal focuses on developing techniques to reason over such fact heavy analysis by exploring soft clustering approaches, structured classification and effective user interface design. We have partnered with Harvard, Columbia and Pfizer to keep our research effort focused on problems that actually matter for genomics experiments and early phase drug discovery. In addition we fit into the NIH's data sharing policy by making our software free (with source code) to organizations who make their data free too. We, as do many others, believe that many great scientific discoveries lay implicit and just below the surface of the research literature. All that is required is for the right researcher to see the right sentence or database entry to form a novel hypothesis and cure a disease. Total recall approaches to fact extraction make that all the more likely an outcome. The dominant paradigm in text mining is to treat the text like a database. But researchers would be better served with a more \"search\" like approach to extracting and correlating facts in text and databases. We are committed to making all the facts, or total recall, available to scientists which is currently not available.",

Most clinical laboratories and hospital transfusion services use manual test tube hemagglutination methods to perform anti-D detection and compatibility tests. However, traditional red cell agglutination titering methods have serious limitations. Agglutination reactions are generally detected visually, that is, in these tests, the technician subjectively evaluates the procedure's results and, consequently, antibody detection procedures are slow, labor intensive and error prone. Because of the subjective nature of sample evaluation, results from these tests are far from uniform. In recent years, alternatives to manual test tube methods have been developed. Some of these new technologies have been adapted for large-scale automated testing of blood samples. While automated methods based on agglutination reactions and red cell detection allow for easier manipulation of large numbers of samples, they require several washing and centrifugation steps, and involve very expensive and complex instrumentation.

A key feature of this technology is that it will prevent biofilm formation without an associated risk of creating antibiotic resistant bacteria. The coating combines a novel protein resistant polymer with an antibacterial peptide. The peptide kills bacteria through a multi- tiered mechanism that is fundamentally different from that of clinical antibiotics and is therefore unlikely to promote resistance. Coatings will be produced by binding the peptide to surfaces in two modes: via a flexible tether and entrapment. A layer of the antibacterial peptide prepared in this way should be safe, functional, and long-lasting. This Phase II SBIR plan focuses on meeting requirements for short term central venous catheters. First, coating constituents will be selected to maximize activity. Activity and mode of action will be characterized with a close look at covalently tethered versus physically bound peptides. As a part of this process, structural and functional relationships of surface bound antimicrobials will be examined. Second, methods will be developed to ensure robust performance of coatings under physiological conditions. Efficacy over time under these conditions will be measured, where efficacy criteria include biofilm inhibition as well as nonthrombogenicity. Prototype catheters coated with this technology will then be produced and tested against clinically relevant bacteria including methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis.

Mammography is the main imaging procedure (screening) for detecting suspicious findings with its high sensitivity but its lower specificity (false positives) is well documented. With increased emphasis on early detection of breast cancer, it appears the effort to avoid missing a malignant lesion may have led to a low positive biopsy rate for cancer, between 10-31%. Unfortunately, breast biopsy is neither a benign nor an inexpensive process. Besides affecting patients physically and emotionally, the procedure frequently causes internal scarring, which may obscure the results of future mammograms. With approximately 1,700,000 women undergoing breast biopsy per year in the USA, combined with a cost between $750-5000 per procedure, the cost to the U.S. healthcare system is significant. Ultrasound is widely regarded as the adjunct (secondary) procedure of choice to mammography, especially for distinguishing cystic from solid masses in which accuracy is 96-100%. Results suggest that more accurate application of ultrasound could help reduce the number of biopsies by up to 40% with a cost savings in conservative estimate of well over $1 billion per year in the USA, mainly by reducing the number of False Positives that are biopsied. However, earlier studies in which ultrasound was evaluated largely as a primary screening tool reported a wide variance in Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and an unsettling range of False Negative (FN) rate from 0.3-30%. Despite improving scanner technology with excellent near-field imaging and an increasing number of positive clinical reports that show sonography can distinguish benign from malignant solid nodules with, it is likely that a majority of radiologists in the U.S. recommend that breast US be used only to determine whether a lesion is cystic or solid and/or for needle guidance. Although a well defined rule-based system has been developed (BI- RADS) for reporting, describing and scoring the Level of Suspicion (LOS) for cancer based on the ultrasound appearance of breast masses. Also it is difficult to teach the method with high variability between radiologists.         Almen Laboratories with its clinical collaborators has developed a sophisticated computer-aided image analysis system for a variety of medical imaging applications. Almen Labs' Computer-Aided Imaging System (CAIS) provides extensive tools to identify objects of interest or concern such as breast masses in a medical image. It also measures numeric features of the mass, analyzes the important information content and then compares the mass of interest to images of masses with known findings and outcomes. The most similar known masses are retrieved and displayed nearly instantaneously for the radiologist to review. During our Preliminary Study this software system was optimized for the diagnostic breast ultrasound examination to standardize interpretation. Our goals for Accuracy, Sensitivity and Specificity were exceeded and the CAIS also exceeded the performance of four expert radiologists. These results represent the highest performance for any known ultrasound CAD.         This Phase I & II Fast Track grant application targets important advancement and more extensive clinical validation of this breast ultrasound tool. The goal is to provide radiologists with a higher degree of confidence to differentiate many benign from more suspicious lesions. We propose to complete evaluation and validation of the Computer-Aided Imaging System in the clinical environment. We hypothesize that correct classification of masses on breast ultrasound (specificity of interpretation) can be significantly improved with no significant reduction in detection of cancer (change in sensitivity) by using the CAIS. Lesions of lower LOS such as complex cystic masses will be ruled out as candidates for biopsy with a higher degree of confidence with use of the computer-aided imaging system.         We will acquire approximately 580 new digital ultrasound cases with biopsy confirmation or two-year follow up from the PACS networks at our three medical centers. These IRB approved data will be assembled in an expert research database with physician interpretations and LOS scores for analysis. We will test and enhance the existing CAIS to streamline the graphical user interface and processing flow to meet the needs of the practicing radiologist. We will process and analyze 580 new patient ultrasound images using the created during preliminary studies and \"calibrated\" and confirmed by leading radiologists template database of 332 biopsy proven cases. In Phase II the impact of Database size and case mix on CAIS accuracy will be statistically evaluated. A group of four expert Radiologists will interpret the 580 validated cases while using the developed CAIS for decision support and their accuracy will be compared to their performance while working alone. Variability and accuracy will be determined using sensitivity and specificity analysis. CAIS reproducibility and sensitivity to imaging system variables also will be examined.         The completed CAIS will be deployed to the dedicated Internet portal in order to provide professionals with wide access to the validated system and the database. The developed digital database of lesion templates with known findings also will be available as a \"teaching tool.\" The completed product will help improve accuracy of practitioners, potentially increase their confidence in breast ultrasound particularly in benign findings, reduce variability of interpretations, and increase ultrasound's role in breast cancer detection and management. Significant support from potential commercial partners has already been received.         Almen Laboratories and collaborators have developed a sophisticated computer-aided diagnostic system for medical imaging applications that provides extensive tools to identify objects and image features of interest, analyze the information content and then store, retrieve and compare different objects and images of interest based on this information. In preliminary research this software system was tailored to the specific application of standardizing interpretation of diagnostic breast ultrasound. The implemented Computer-Aided Diagnostic tool was designed and tested on an IRB-approved cohort of 332 cases with confirmation of the \"truth\" via biopsy or benign followup. Sensitivity, Specificity, PPV, NPV and ROC Area (AZ=0.96) exceeded our goals as well as the performance of four radiologists (avg. AZ=0.86) and represents the highest performance for ultrasound CAD in the literature.         This Phase I & II Fast Track grant application targets further advancement and performance evaluation of the breast ultrasound computer-aided tool, which may provide radiologists with a higher degree of confidence to differentiate many benign from more suspicious lesions. Results suggest that more accurate application of ultrasound could help reduce the number of biopsies by up to 40% with a cost savings in conservative estimate of well over $1 billion per year in the USA, mainly by reducing the number of False Positives. Although a well-defined rule-based system has been developed (BIRADS) for reporting, describing and scoring the Level of Suspicion (LOS) for cancer based on the ultrasound appearance of breast masses, it is difficult to teach the method and there several studuies show high variability between radiologists.         We propose to refine, evaluate and validate our Computer-Aided Imaging System (CAIS) to assist interpretation of breast ultrasound studies in the pre-clinical environment. The System compares a breast mass in question to a database of images with known findings, displays those closest in \"Relative Similarity\" and computes an estimate of LOS, ultimately with the physician in the loop. Phase I will independently test (using ROC Area) the CAIS on a new set of 580 cases using the Reference Database developed previously. Phase II will evaluate the performance (Sensitivity, Specificity) of the same four Radiologists from our prior study this time using the CAIS as an aid. We hypothesize that the specificity of interpretation of breast ultrasound can be significantly improved with no significant change in sensitivity by following a structured implementation of the ACR BIRADS method for describing and scoring LOS for cancer with our CAIS. Lesions of lower LOS such as complex cystic masses will be ruled out as candidates for biopsy with a higher degree of confidence with use of the computer-aided imaging system.

A Quiet Reliable and Compact Fuel Cell Based APU (QRCFC-APU) is proposed to significantly reduce these emissions.  The QRCFC overcomes challenges with current diesel fuel reforming and fuel cell reliability, when converting diesel fuel to power on trucks.  Under the Phase I effort a QRCFC test article was designed and its critical reformer component was tested to show that it can limit reformate CO and sulfur contents to levels that are compatible with the fuel cell.  In addition, an individual cell test showed that the fuel cell can reliably operate with the reformate generated by the reformer.  These tests showed the feasibility of the QRCFC system.  Under the Phase II effort, the individual QRCFC reformer and fuel cell components will be refined and scaled up, and the system tested at the 2kWe power level.  Emissions, efficiency, reliability, and short term durability will be proven in these tests.  In addition, test data and analysis will be used to project the performance of the QRCFC as a truck based APU, and both first and operating costs will be estimated.  These results will then be contrasted with alternative APU, approaches, as well as simple truck idling.  Under the proposed Commercialization Option, the QRCFC components will be further refined and capacity will be increased to 6kWe and the unit tested.  Lastly, the 6kWe unit performance will be verified through testing at an EPA supported Verification Test Organization, which will help drive commercialization of the unit.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress in sequencing the human genome has led to a new goal - expressing and characterizing the human proteome. A promising area where proteomics can have a major impact is autoimmune disease. Proteome-wide screening against sera from patients with particular autoimmune diseases can enable the discovery of new autoantigens, the development of microarray-based diagnostic assays, and effective treatments for autoimmune disease. During Phase I, we developed a novel, low-cost, high throughput approach for proteomics based on Bead Sorted Libraries of In Vitro Expressed Proteins (BS-LIVE- PRO). These protein libraries can be expressed inexpensively in a single cell-free translation reaction using a Bead Sorted Library of In Vitro Expressible DNA (BS-LIVE-DNA) as a template. Additional novel technologies developed during Phase I which augment this approach include: i) solid-phase PCR to produce BS-LIVE-DNA from cDNA libraries, ii) a method (PC-PRINT) to rapidly phototransfer the protein on each bead in the BS-LIVE-PRO onto discrete spots on a microarray surface using proprietary photocleavable linkers, and iii) methods to decode the randomly arrayed spots generated by PC-PRINT using photo-transferable DNA or mass-tags (PC-CODE). We propose to extensively optimize and evaluate this new technology during Phase II with the aim of commercializing BS-LIVE-PRO. We will apply BS-LIVEPRO to autoimmune diseases in collaboration with Dr. Donald Bloch at the Massachusetts General Hospital, a leading expert on autoantigen discovery and primary biliary cirrhosis. Similar studies will be carried out on other vasculitis autoimmune diseases in association with Dr. Peter Merkel, Director of the Vasculitis Research Consortium.     Proteome-wide screening against sera from patients with particular autoimmune diseases can lead to the discovery of new autoantigens, the development of diagnostic assays to identify autoimmune disease and, ultimately, improved treatments.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are an estimated one million people in the U.S. infected with HIV-1, with 40,000 new cases reported each year. While most of these patients greatly benefit from highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), they often develop multi-drug resistance associated with mutations in viral genes which cause problems for long-term treatment. Knowledge of the spectrum of mutations in HIV-1 genes is extremely important in order to effectively adjust the drug treatment for these patients and also for drug-na ve patients. DNA sequencing is the most accurate and comprehensive method currently available for detecting these mutations and genotyping mutant viruses. However sequencing is both expensive and most importantly does not easily detect subpopulations of drug-resistant strains below 20%. It is also difficult to link specific mutations to individual viral species. The principal objective of this proposal is to develop a highly sensitive, cost-effective and high throughput system for detecting drug-resistant strains of the HIV-1 virus based on mass spectrometry of in vitro expressed proteins (MASSIVE-PRO). During Phase I, MASSIVE-PRO was developed and evaluated using WT and drug-resistant forms of HIV-1 genes. Several important goals were achieved including: i) Elimination of proteolysis of expressed polypeptides, ii) Demonstration of the ability to detect drug resistance mutations in subpopulations of HIV-1 down to the 5% level and iii) Sequence- based determination of drug-resistance mutations. In Phase II, a comprehensive HIV-1 genotyping drug resistance test based on MASSIVE-PRO will be developed. A key aspect of this test will be the ability to routinely detect and characterize drug- resistance mutations in the PR and RT genes down to the 5% level. Dr. Richard D'Aquila's laboratory at Vanderbilt Medical School, recognized internationally for its expertise on HIV-1 drug-resistance, will serve as a subcontractor, participating in assay development and providing samples to AmberGen for validating the MASSIVE-PRO assay. Quest Diagnostics will also advise on assay development to ensure compatibility with large-scale commercial laboratory practices. Public Narrative There are an estimated one million people in the U.S. infected with HIV-1, with 40,000 new cases reported each year. Optimal treatment of these patients requires a low-cost but highly sensitive diagnostic method of detecting drug-resistance mutations in HIV-1 genes in patients initiating or undergoing drug therapy. Currently, DNA sequencing of the mutant virus cannot easily detect subpopulations of drug-resistant strains below 20% which can lead to failure of treatment. Recent progress by AmberGen demonstrates that this limitation can be overcome by using a newly developed method based on mass spectrometry of in vitro expressed proteins (MASSIVE-PRO). During Phase II, a HIV-1 genotyping drug-resistance test with sensitivity for drug resistant subpopulations of virus under 5% will be developed and extensively tested.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There exists an urgent need to develop an effective, non-invasive method of detecting colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. Such non-invasive testing, if instituted for a large segment of the population, could result in a dramatic reduction in the approximately 56,000 annual deaths caused by CRC. However, current methods for early detection of CRC, which include the fecal occult blood test (FOBT), a non-invasive fecal DNA test (PreGen-Plus) and endoscopic colorectal examination (colonoscopy) either have nominal effectiveness due to low sensitivity (FOBT, PreGen-Plus) or low compliance due to rigorous preparative requirements (colonoscopy). The principal objective of this project is to develop a cost-effective, high sensitivity, non-invasive method for scanning protein truncating mutations in the APC gene from fecal DNA as part of a large-scale population CRC screening test. Such mutations constitute the earliest molecular event in CRC tumorigenesis. During Phase I, a new method based on mass spectrometry of in vitro expressed proteins (MASSIVE-PRO) was developed and evaluated for detection of chain truncating mutations in the APC gene using cell-line as well as a few patient-derived DNA samples (stool and tissue). All of the goals of the Phase I project were achieved including: i) Demonstration of the ability to scan the complete MCR region of the APC gene, ii) Ability to achieve high sensitivity (~1%) to detect chain truncating mutations, iii) Ability to detect mutations using DNA isolated from the stool of CRC patients. Significant improvements in the MASSIVE-PRO technology beyond the Phase I goals were also achieved including: i) Ability to scan missense mutations using the K-Ras gene as a model from cell-line, tumor and stool DNA; ii) Enhanced ability to perform multiplexed MASSIVE-PRO using MS-MS sequencing. During Phase II, research will shift to a thorough evaluation of MASSIVE-PRO on DNA derived from fecal samples including prospective samples obtained from pre-operative CRC patients in collaboration with Dr. Paul Schroy, Director of Clinical Research for the Section of Gastroenterology at the Boston Medical Center. A critical goal will be to reliably detect less than a 1% level of chain truncating APC mutations relative to wild-type protein. Enhanced sensitivity will also be obtained by utilizing MASSIVE-PRO to scan for missense mutations in K-Ras and other genes associated with early CRC tumorigenesis. The results obtained from MASSIVE-PRO will be validated by full-sequencing on DNA extracted from surgically removed matched tumor tissue. For the purpose of developing a CRC population screen which meets the requirements of a clinical laboratory environment and for eventual FDA approval, AmberGen will work closely with Quest Diagnostics, Inc., which operates the largest network of in vitro diagnostic testing facilities in the U.S. All results will be statistically analyzed in collaboration with Prof. Josie Dupuis, Associate Professor of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health. There exists an urgent need to develop an effective non-invasive method of detecting colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S (150,000 new cases and 56,000 deaths). Current methods for early detection of CRC include the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and endoscopic colorectal examination (colonoscopy) but these methods are of limited effectiveness due to either their sensitivity or cost. The objective of this project is to develop a novel non-invasive molecular test based on mass spectrometry of in vitro expressed proteins to screen for mutations in various genes involved in early development of CRC. This test promises to be rapid, highly sensitive and low-cost. If successful, the test will enable more extensive screening and consequently increased surveillance and early treatment of colorectal cancer.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced Molecular Diagnostic Test for Neurofibromatosis ABSTRACT Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the NF1 gene. In children, NF1 causes learning disabilities, coordination problems and benign tumors later in life that grow on nerve tissue. Currently more than 100,000 Americans suffer from NF1 with the disease having one of the highest prevalence rates for a genetic disorder (~1 out of 4,000 births). Progress has recently been made in identifying possible drugs for this disease including the proposed use of statins to alleviate learning disabilities in children with NF1. There is a critical need for a cost-effective test to screen for mutations in the NF1 gene. However, a significant problem is the wide variety of NF1 mutations which have been found to occur. Most inactivating mutations (>80%) are chain truncating and distributed throughout the gene. The preferred method to detect such mutations is the protein truncation test (PTT). However, because of the many limitations of conventional PTT, it is not practical for routine clinical use. Instead, current diagnosis is normally based on established non-genetic clinical criteria. Significant progress was made during Phase I in overcoming these limitations by developing a cost- effective alternative to conventional PTT. One approach utilizes an ELISA-based protein truncation test (ELISA-PTT) to detect chain-truncations. In contrast to conventional PTT, ELISA-PTT eliminates the need for electrophoresis and radioactivity. A second and complementary approach, based on mass spectrometric analysis of in vitro expressed proteins (MASSIVE-PRO), is able to additionally scan for missense mutations by precisely measuring the mass shift from single amino acid substitutions. Studies performed using these improved assays on normal and mutant cDNAs as well a limited number of NF1 patient samples revealed that these tests are highly effective with sensitivities comparable to and in some cases superior to standard DNA sequencing. During Phase II, we will further develop and extensively evaluate these novel NF1 diagnostic assays. The ELISA-PTT will be improved to allow scanning of the entire NF1 coding region using mRNA isolated from patient blood and a single-step PCR protocol. The MASSIVE-PRO assay will also be improved so that it can provide specific sequence information about mutations in the NF1 gene. Advanced technologies based on several innovations which can significantly reduce the number of PCR and cell-free translation reactions will also be evaluated. These assays, once optimized, will be extensively evaluated in collaboration with Dr. Ludwine Messiaen, Director of Genomics at the University of Alabama and a world leader in NF1 testing using a repository of validated genomic DNA and mRNA samples from NF1 patients. Clinical beta-testing will be performed during the third year in Dr. Messiaen's laboratory. In addition, Quest Diagnostics will work closely with AmberGen in order to assure these NF1 tests are properly designed for the requirements of the clinical laboratory environment.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that the annual incidence of spinal cord injury (SCI), not including persons who die at the scene of the accident, is approximately 11,000 cases per year. The number of patients currently affected by SCI in the United States has been estimated at 250-300,000. Currently patients with SCI face a life-long sentence of extreme morbidity. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also known as Scatter factor (SF), has documented scattering, proliferating, and protective effects on neurons in the brain, spinal cord, and in peripheral nerves, and has significant potential as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of brain and SCI. Administration of an HGF/SF-like compound holds promise as a new approach to the clinical management of SCI. However, treatment modalities that employ gene- or protein-based formulations are characteristically expensive and difficult to administer. Therefore, therapeutic approaches that employ small molecule mimetics of natural growth and protective factors may be powerful alternatives to such therapies. The primary focus of research at Angion Biomedica is the development of small molecules that regulate HGF/SF/Met signaling to therapeutic advantage. To this end, we have identified a small molecule, Refanalin, that recapitulates the biologic activity of HGF/SF by activating the HGF/SF receptor, Met. Our working hypothesis is that Refanalin acts as a neuroprotectant while promoting cell proliferation, axonal growth, and functional recovery in the setting of SCI. As delineated in our Progress Report, administration of this small molecule mimetic of HGF/SF represents a highly innovative approach for the treatment of SCI, with significant clinical potential. In vitro, Refanalin activates the same intracellular signaling cascades as HGF/SF, scatters renal cells, induces endothelial, epithelial and Schwann cell proliferation, and protects against apoptotic and necrotic cell death. In an experimental model of spinal cord ischemia, Refanalin improves neurological recovery and preserves neuronal and grey matter integrity. Importantly, in a well-described and clinically relevant model of SCI, Refanalin improves neurobehavioral score, attenuates neuronal cell death and augments neuronal regeneration. A comprehensive and good laboratory practice adherent set of regulatory studies indicates that acute systemic administration of Refanalin is safe and well- tolerated. Long-term (3-month) safety studies of Refanalin undertaken by the National Institutes of Health NIH Rapid Access to Interventional Development program are underway and preliminary results are extremely encouraging. This translational research Phase II application is designed to explore fully the therapeutic potential of Refanalin in SCI. Dose-response, treatment time window and dosing schedule studies for Refanalin will be followed by determination of Refanalin efficacy in clinically relevant models of SCI. Successful completion of the proposed research will enable submission of an Investigational New Drug Application to Food and Drug Administration FDA for clinical studies with Refanalin. The primary focus of this proposal is the development of small molecules that regulate SF/HGF/Met signaling to therapeutic advantage. Our lead HGF/SF mimetic, Refanalin recapitulates the biologic activity of HGF/SF by activating the HGF/SF receptor, and represents a highly innovative approach to the treatment of spinal cord injures, with significant clinical potential.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an SBIR Phase II proposal directed at the continued development of a diagnostic for the early detection of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). It relies on a functional test of dark adaptation kinetics (the transition from being light-adapted to being dark-adapted) that has been shown in previous work to detect the onset of AMD at least four years before it is clinically evident. Testing is completely non-invasive and can be performed by an unskilled operator with a minimum of patient burden. Our Phase I aim was to demonstrate feasibility by building a preliminary prototype diagnostic that could distinguish AMD patients from normal old adults in = 20 minutes. This aim was easily achieved. A range of early to late AMD patients was readily discriminated from clinically normal old adults in = 20 minutes. The difference was both substantial (~100% dark adaptation impairment for AMD patients relative to normal old adults) and statistically significant (t = 6.02; p < 0.0001). Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 100%, respectively, with the degree of dark adaptation impairment tracking disease severity. Finally, there is promising pilot data for follow-on development of a commercial AMD screening test that can be completed in = 10 minutes. Our Phase II aim is to build a robust commercial prototype and evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for detection of early AMD in a cross-sectional study of 200 patients (50% normal old adults; 50% having a range of early to intermediate AMD). Our goal is sensitivity and specificity = 90% with a test duration = 10 minutes. The University of Alabama at Birmingham and Johns Hopkins University will serve as clinical test sites. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness for individuals in developed countries over 50 years old. It already affects more than 13 million people in the US, including one-third of those over 75, and the problem is expected to get worse as the population ages. Unfortunately, there is no simple means for early detection. A diagnostic for early AMD could aid in the development of early-stage treatments and identify individuals for intervention before the devastation of late-stage vision loss.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this program is to develop novel inhibitors of human sphingosine kinase (SK) that are effective as therapeutic agents for retinal and choroidal vascular diseases. Because of its critical role in sphingolipid metabolism, we have focused on SK as an innovative molecular target for the development of new drugs for the treatment of ocular diseases associated with excessive angiogenesis. Sphingolipids are being increasingly recognized as key mediators of stress responses, cell differentiation and proliferation, and are known to mediate the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa) that are of central importance in eye disease. We hypothesized that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) produced by SK within retinal endothelial cells in response to VEGF is critical to the cascade of events that results in the vascular leakiness and neovascularization that are hallmark pathologies in eye disease. Therefore, SK is a key molecular target for the development of new therapeutic agents. Because of the pivotal role of SK in regulating proliferation, we are developing SK inhibitors to be used as drugs to treat eye disease. In Phase I of this program, we demonstrated that our proprietary SK inhibitors block signaling pathways induced by VEGF and TNFa in human retinal endothelial cells. Importantly, we further demonstrated that administration of our SK inhibitors reduces vascular leakiness in two animal models, including a VEGF-induced subcutaneous model in nude mice and a 3-month diabetic retinopathy model in STZ-treated rats. No toxicity to the animals was observed in either model. These studies provide the first proof-of-principle demonstration that SK inhibitors are likely to be effective in the treatment of eye disease. In this Phase II project, we will evaluate the therapeutic activity of the SK inhibitor in two additional in vivo models of ocular disease, including oxygen-induced retinopathy and laser-induced chorodial neovascularization. Additionally, we will determine the optimal schedule for treatment of the animals in the eye disease models. Finally, FDA-required studies will be completed to enable the submission of an Investigational New Drug application for the SK inhibitor ABC294640. The following Specific Aims will be addressed: 1.) To evaluate the protective effects of ABC294640 in a model of oxygen-induced retinopathy. 2.) To evaluate the protective effects of ABC294640 in a model of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization. 3.) To complete cGMP synthesis and IND-directed toxicology studies with ABC294640. Overall, the studies proposed represent a focused approach to evaluate and move the SK inhibitor ABC294640 into clinical trials for the treatment of ocular disease. This will provide rapid evaluation of the first-in-class inhibitor of this innovative molecular target.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to investigate, design and manufacture a sophisticated, pre-production protein crystal detection microscope, the Crystal Finder(tm) microscope workstation, incorporating extinction polarization and quantitative birefringence imaging for digitally enhanced display of crystal bulk contrast (referred to herein as Detect-X(tm) technology). Many protein crystallization experiments are of the trial-and-error type, where frequently only one in 1,000 experiments provides a crystal hit. Often these initial hits are difficult to detect because crystals may be small, colorless and disguised by amorphous precipitate material. Most commercial microscopes used to analyze protein crystallization setups provide crystal edge contrast only, which is not compatible with efficient screening of colorless membrane protein crystals grown in lipidic cubic phases. Thus, there is a critical need for more reliable and rapid methods fort the accurate characterization of crystalline materials. To provide a solution to this problem, research conducted during Phase I of this project demonstrated the successful implementation of the Detect-X(tm) technology in a proof-of-concept instrument. This technology, allows detecting crystals by virtue of their bulk properties (birefringence) rather than their refractive index difference with the background (i.e. crystal edges and facets). This technology results in a higher number of accurately detected protein crystals, with a concomitant decrease in false positive hits. Specific Aim I: A pre-production automated polarization microscope, the Crystal Finder(tm) microscopic workstation with Detect-X(tm) technology will be designed and built by Appalachian Electronic Instruments (Fairlea, WV). Specific Aim II: A user friendly instrument control interface and optimized Detect- X(tm) software will be designed and implemented by Emerald BioSystems (Bainbridge Island, WA). This software will be integrated into existing Crystal Miner(tm) crystallization tracking software and relational database. Specific Aim III: The instrument will be evaluated for performance in imaging of challenging protein crystals in a crystallization trial using digitally enhanced crystal detection. A side-by-side comparison with competing commercial protein crystal imaging instruments will be carried out. It is anticipated that the Crystal Finder(tm) microscope workstation will dramatically impact the successful identification of difficult-to-detect protein crystals in crystallization trials. The unique features and superior performance of the Crystal Finder(tm) microscopic workstation provides the basis of its commercial success. It is expected to set the standards for automated high-throughput image-enhanced protein crystallization experiment screening and will be the instrument of choice for both large consortiums and medium-size research laboratories.        Protein structure is a cornerstone in biological science and medicine providing a molecular basis for disease and drug action. The technology advancement described in this proposal, and built into a protein crystal detection microscope workstation, is expected to make a significant contribution to the needs of the protein crystallography community and public health. It is expected to accelerate the pace by which protein structures are solved, and will be a critical mediator of advancement in medical science and drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to develop and test information visualization display technology that will aid clinicians in diagnosing and treating unexpected events in critical care environments. Unexpected events occur frequently in the ICU and many are related to missing, inaccurate or misinterpreted information. In a one year study of 1024 patients in an ICU, 241 human errors extended the stay in the ICU by 425 patient days and consumed 15% of the ICU's resources. Critical care clinicians discover critical events earlier and diagnose the events more accurately when data is presented in a graphic display. Preliminary studies found that when a graphic display of arterial blood gas information was used, the visual ABG display was more effective in communicating the status of the pH, PaCo2 and HCO3-values to the user, thus significantly increasing the situational awareness of the user. In addition, the display significantly increased the accuracy of the diagnosis while reducing cognitive workload. Our research plan is to build upon the successful results in phase 1 and extend the display to include more variables to give the clinicians a holistic understanding of the patients gas exchange state. Data-driven visual metaphors will be refined through an iterative design process. Usability testing will guide design enhancements. The resulting display will be implemented in C++ programming language. The utility of the graphic display will be measured using both a realistic patient simulator and a clinical ICU study. Thirty critical care clinicians will be called into a simulated ICU to assess the status of a patient in 4 different scenarios. Performance of the participants in the simulation will be evaluated based on the time to detect a given event, formulate a correct diagnosis, and provide effective supportive care. During the clinical evaluation we will place the new display in the ICU room and observe and record clinician's interventions and actions. Expert evaluators will rank order the performance of the clinicians both with the display and without. In addition, we will use a series of subjective instruments to ascertain information about desirability, perceived effectiveness and utility. This proposed display system has the ability to significantly increase patient safety by reducing the number of errors associated with misinterpretation of this information. In addition, it is anticipated that the new visualization system will have educational impact, as it will provide a clear demonstration and interaction of variables to both novices and experts alike.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Applied Medical Visualizations L.L.C. has developed a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic display (PkPd Display) intended for anesthesia care providers. In Phase I, we designed a display that was based on a two drug interaction model, which was previously developed for an opioid (remifentanil) and a sedative hypnotic (propofol) in human volunteers. The measures for this PkPd interaction model include the probability of loss of consciousness and loss of response to various noxious stimuli. The model was evaluated in the operating room on its ability to predict loss and regain of consciousness and to predict non-responsiveness to noxious stimuli in a wide variety of patients. The results were positive. The models adequately predicted clinical endpoints of interest to an anesthetist and is hence, commercially viable. For Phase II, several aspects of the PkPd Display merit development and further evaluation prior to commercialization: 1. we will evaluate the usability of the PkPd Display and ensure it will not interfere with other critical aspects of anesthetic delivery and appropriate patient care. The display will be evaluated in both patient simulator and operating room settings. 2. We will expand the number of interaction models used within the PkPd Display to include other commonly used anesthetics, such as inhaled agents and additional opioids. 3. We will characterize differences in the drug-drug interaction in patients scheduled for elective surgery who chronically consume opioids, and update the PkPd Display with these results 4. We will implement optimization techniques so that the display's models predict drug combinations that will result in a rapid wakeup by the patient while maintaining adequate analgesia during recovery. If successfully implemented, use of the PkPd Display could result in fewer hypertensive and hypotensive episodes, fewer adjuvant drug interventions, a lower incidence of patient movement, a lower incidence of the need for pharmacologic reversal of opioid effect to restore spontaneous ventilation, and more rapid wakeup at the end of surgery. By generalizing the PkPd models for use with inhaled agents and opioids, the display will be usable in a significantly larger portion of administered anesthetics worldwide. By accounting for additional model covariates, such as the opioid tolerant patient, the display can provide accurate predictions for outliers beyond the normal population, possibly reducing risk of respiratory depression and inadequate analgesia. Optimizing the display will bring intelligence into the display, providing complex optimizations with a simple presentation to the user. 7. PROJECT NARRATIVE Applied Medical Visualizations L.L.C. has developed a graphical drug display intended for anesthesia care providers. This display is intended to help anesthesiologists visualize a patient's level of sedation and analgesia during surgery, resulting in more effective anesthetics and less episodes of inadequate analgesia experienced by the patient.",

        "abstract": "Applied Sciences, Inc. (ASI) investigated the use on inexpensive carbon nanofiber (CNF) to impart electrical conductivity to polymer systems to allow the use of electrostatic painting (ESP) techniques to paint these polymers in the same manner as metals without the need for a solvent- based primer coat.  The production of polymer composites that can be electrostatically painted with no additional processing steps will remove a major barrier to the replacement of metal parts with composites parts on automobiles.  The full development of this technology will increase the use of composite components in the automotive industry, which is in consonance with the efforts of the automotive industry to reduce weight, increase fuel efficiency , and eliminate corrosion while maintaining appearance, performance, and low-cost.\n   Incorporating carbon nanofiber into polymers at low loadings is known to create composites that can carry electrical currents while simultaneously increasing mechanical properties.  Composites produced from a variety of commercially available composite fabrication techniques (injection molding, compression molding, long fiber thermoplastics processing, sprayable gelcoat), different polymers (PP, PEEK, PC, Nylon, PE), and carbon nanofiber types and grades were tested under this program.  The composites tested all had electrical conductivities between 10-4 to 10-6 S/cm, with loadings as low as 2 weight percent of carbon nanofiber.  The conductive composites were painted using ESP techniques, and then tested of surface finish quality, adhesion, and abrasion resistance.\n   The conductive composites received the paint with no alterations in the painting process and behaved similarly to metal.  The CNF did not affect the surface quality, nor did it impact the adhesion of the paint to the composite surface.   The best nanofiber variant proved to be the XT version, and the best processing methods were the long fiber thermoplastics processing and the sprayable gelcoat.  The sprayable gelcoat allows the ability to selectively place conductivity at the surface of the composite.\n   Overall, the program was successful in demonstrating that composites made conductive with the addition of CNF can be electrostatically painted without the addition of a conductive primer coat.  Elimination of the conductive primer will eliminate approximately 0.23 lbs of VOC emission per automobile, or about 18% of the total VOC emissions related to painting and finishing.  ESP of polymers will reduce manufacturing costs by about $100 per vehicle.  The net present value of this is conservatively estimated at $500 M for the industry over the next 15 years.  Ultimate savings could reach $2B annually.\n   Conductive composites have further potential of being used in numerous under-the-hood applications and other areas were electrical conductivity is needed, and more widely as electronic enclosures, composite electrostatic precipitators, anti/deicing heaters for aircraft, and anti-static flooring, countertops, and truck bed liners.",

        "abstract": "Commercial-scale marine aquaculture has the potential to balance the increasing demand for high-quality seafood products with the limited harvest capacity of our nations oceans. However, water reuse in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) is limited by the accumulation of nitrate, which can be toxic to many species, especially marine species. Thus, nitrate removal by denitrification presents a pressing need for the continued expansion of intensive recirculating aquaculture. In the waste treatment industry, denitrification has traditionally been achieved by adding methanol or a similar chemical to act as the necessary carbon source, which requires sophisticated computer monitoring and control systems. This project proposal will continue to investigate the potential for using Polyhydroxyalkanotes (PHAs), a biodegradable biopolymer produced from sugar fermentation, as an alternative carbon source for denitrification in aquaculture systems. Through a series of lab-scale denitrification bioreactor studies, the denitrification capabilities of PHA were quantified at more than 2.0 kg/m3-day using the effluent from a research production tank stocked with tilapia. The problems associated with clogging and short circuiting of the PHA filter bed were addressed by utilizing the PolyGeyser\u00ae bead filter technology which promoted a healthy thin biofilm due to its characteristic frequent and gentle backwashing. This Phase II project will cumulate with the development of a commercial PolyGeyser\u00ae Denitrification Filter employing PHAs as a simple, low-cost alternative to the relatively complex existing treatment methods. The final goal is to develop commercial systems to complement the exiting line of PolyGeyser\u00ae bead filter to provide both nitrification and denitrification in aquaculture systems.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microarrays are a powerful way to measure the impact of contaminants in the environment, and sheepshead minnows (Cyprinodon variegatus) are the most commonly used species in salt water environmental testing. In this proposal, we explain how we will develop and validate a large microarray (5,000+ genes) in sheepshead minnows. We will conduct a number of short and long term exposures on sheepshead minnows using several anthropogenic compounds (pyrene, copper, cadmium, and bisphenol A), then use the microarrays to measure the gene expression signatures for these compounds. This data, along with a variety of physiological endpoints, will be the basis for a relational database. We will analyze the data and decipher the patterns resulting from the various exposures to identify the unique fingerprints for each compound. Microarrays in sheepshead minnows will round out EcoArray's offering of microarrays for environmentally significant aquatic species. Measurement and analysis of environmental contaminants is very important to the EPA in its Superfund monitoring activities, and the sheepshead minnow is an important species that is routinely used for the monitoring of coastal superfund sites. In addition, diagnosis of ecotoxological effects at the gene level in sentinel species like sheepshead minnow offer the promise of future ability to tie ecotoxicology to human health, a goal of the National Center for Toxicogenomics. Experiments by our research group and others have shown that microarrays can be used to detect changes in gene expression caused by exposure to contaminants, and it is clear that contaminants have unique genetic signatures. Because many contaminants act at the gene level to induce or repress gene expression through both receptor-mediated and non-receptor mediated pathways, microarrays can help to elucidate signaling pathways that are affected. In general, microarrays offer a direct, effective way to provide detailed data about the biological effects of the environment on animals. In addition, analysis using microarrays is generally considerably less expensive than current testing methods. With the successful completion of this grant, we will incorporate the sheepshead minnow microarray and its database into our existing product line and sell it to the EPA, USGS, researchers in academia, as well as industrial concerns interested in compound screening and environmental monitoring/remediation.     This project will result in a fully developed microarray for ecotoxicology testing in salt water. This microarray, together with the database this project will begin, can provide detailed, gene-level data on the biological impact of a chemical or an environment. In so doing, it can lead to assessment not only of water quality, but also of the implications of chemicals and environments for human health.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Precious liquid samples such as aqueous genomic DNA are the bedrock for immense efforts currently underway to better understand associations between disease phenotype and genotype. These efforts promise to pave the way to better prevention and treatment of human disease. Many laboratories maintain archives of thousands of such precious samples for years at a time while they pursue better understanding of both common and rare diseases. Current methods for managing precious liquid samples are fraught with problems, including poor inventory control, poor ability to search inventory without directly accessing samples, constant sample concentration changes due to evaporation, excessive time required to aliquot samples, and samples becoming lost, mislabeled, or contaminated with significant frequency. The goal of this project is to develop and commercialize a system for long term storage of precious liquids that eliminates or significantly reduces all of these problems. This system stores liquids in standardized containers with machine-readable tags for unambiguous identification. An automated precision dispenser which does not require pipette intrusion ensures sample integrity while dispensing microliter aliquots of precious liquid. An interface between the dispensing equipment and an archived-liquid database application will allow laboratories to conveniently maintain accurate inventory control and facilitate improved experiment planning. This workflow-based system will increase the efficiency and reduce the error rate of genomic research by ensuring that the precious liquid samples are less time consuming to inventory and access, are contamination-free, maintain their concentration levels, and are correctly and positively identified. When completed, the system will be commercialized by marketing it to life- science laboratories, forensic laboratories and hospitals. In Phase 1 of this project, key inventions were built and tested with excellent results proving feasibility: (1) the compact long-term storage and dispensing container maintains precious liquid in an evaporation and contamination resistant manner; (2) the user-friendly dispensing mechanism can deliver 1-1500fl aliquots touch-free with state-of-the-art precision; and (3) a user- friendly archived-liquid sample tracking database application was planned with the input of prospective customers using Agile Software methods. During Phase 2 of the project, the technology risk of manufacturing this novel liquid storage container with unique and permanent identification will be reduced (Specific Aim 1), commercial versions of the semi- and fully-automatic Precision Dispensing System will be designed and built (Specific Aim 2), and the workflow-based liquid sample tracking database will be built and integrated with the storage cartridges and precision dispensing equipment (Specific Aim 3).These early versions of the commercial equipment will be Beta tested in a nationally known genetics core resource laboratory. During Phase 3 using other funds this fully developed novel system will be introduced to the commercial marketplace. Research laboratories in the U.S. and worldwide store thousands of precious liquid DNA samples but use inefficient and error-prone ways to manage them. Archivex is developing an integrated system for storing, dispensing and inventorying precious liquids which will be convenient and affordable, will pay for itself through reduced labor costs, and will lead to improved public health by increasing the productivity and effective collaboration of laboratories. The hardware will ensure the integrity of the stored liquids and enable contamination-free precision dispensing, while the database application will allow researchers to better take advantage of their full sample collection, including more efficient analysis of experimental outliers",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Zhang, Yun Abstract There are over 40 lysosomal storage disorders, and most of these diseases affect adversely the central nervous system (CNS). The mainstay of treatment is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). However, ERT is not effective for the brain, because the enzymes do not cross the brain capillary wall, which forms the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vivo. Without treatment of the CNS, the young patients are destined to progressive neurodegeneration and death. The limiting factor in the future treatment of these diseases is the transport of the enzyme across the BBB. Bypass of the BBB with direct injection into the brain is not effective, because only a small part of the brain is treated with a trans-cranial delivery system. Conversely, virtually all cells of the brain can be treated with a trans-vascular delivery system that enables the enzyme to cross the BBB following intravenous administration. A new approach to the BBB delivery of large molecules such as enzymes is the molecular Trojan horse technology. A bi-functional fusion protein is produced with genetic engineering, wherein the missing recombinant enzyme is fused to a BBB molecular Trojan horse. The latter is a genetically engineered protein that is able to cross the human BBB by receptor- mediated transcytosis on endogenous BBB peptide transport systems. Pre-clinical studies show that a large enzyme with a molecular weight >100,000 Daltons, can be delivered to brain via transport across the BBB, following attachment to a BBB receptor-specific Trojan horse. The present work will produce a novel fusion gene encoding a lysosomal enzyme and a genetically engineered molecular Trojan horse, which will allow the production of the corresponding fusion protein, AGT-180. The fusion gene will be incorporated in a eukaryotic expression vector followed by permanent transfection of cells. These phase II studies will enable production of a master cell bank and development of the purification and downstream processing of the fusion protein. Fusion proteins comprised of BBB targeting antibodies and recombinant enzymes could be therapeutic in the treatment of the brain in human lysosomal storage disorders. 1 Zhang, Yun Project Narrative Lysosomal storage disorders are serious inborn errors of metabolism, and about 75% of the ~40 lysosomal storage disorders affect the brain. The mainstay of treatment is Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT). However, ERT is ineffective in the brain, because the enzymes do not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The present work will produce a novel recombinant fusion protein that is able to both (a) bind a human BBB receptor to trigger transport into the brain, and (b) retain high lysosomal enzyme activity. This novel drug, designated AGT-180, will be a model for the treatment of the brain for multiple genetic diseases. 1",

ESPs are optically-encoded microfabricated particles that can be manipulated using magnetic force. They are manufactured on commercially available photolithographic equipment using efficient and robust techniques borrowed from the semi-conductor industry. They have significant advantages in cost throughput, scalability, and flexibility over existing bead-based liquid array platforms. We will develop a liquid array system that can accommodate multiplexing levels of 1000-plex or more, and that will be more flexible and easier to use than existing systems. Its design will also permit substantially lower capital and running costs and similar or better quantitative performance, including precision, limit of detection and dynamic range. The ESP technology will provide a broad platform for many different kinds of assays. It is versatile, and has the potential to be used in basic biomedical research, as well as high- throughput discovery and clinical diagnostics. The ability to control the particles magnetically is a significant advantage. The technology has the potential to be useful in basic research, diagnosis and prognosis of a wide variety of diseases.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop a Colonoscopy Force Monitor (CFM), a handheld attachment mounted on the colonoscope shaft which provides a physician with real-time feedback on the force and torque applied during colonoscopy. The CFM is designed to improve the training of endoscopists, establish best practices for performing colonoscopy by quantitative characterization of expert's skill, and enhance colorectal cancer screening procedures by making them safer and more comfortable. Improved training and development of best practices will contribute to the safety and effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening. In addition, the use of CFM could reduce or, under some circumstances, eliminate the use of deep sedation for colonoscopy, and lessen the overall cost of the exam. The CFM prototype development performed to date has advanced beyond the original objectives of Phase I. Three generations of the CFM-a prototypes were designed, built, and validated in phantom testing by experienced endoscopists. The objectives of Phase II of this project are to build and test the CFM a-prototype. The CFM performance will be first assessed in colonoscopy simulator tests. Then, clinical studies will be conducted simultaneously at two partnering organizations: Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NYC, and the Institute for Clinical Research at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Washington, D.C. At the end of Phase II, the full-performance, preproduction prototype of CFM will be developed, a clinical trial of the effect of CFM on training and ongoing education will be performed, and necessary engineering documentation will be prepared in accordance with regulatory requirements. Colonoscopy Force Monitor (CFM) is a handheld device measuring and displaying the torque and push/pull forces applied by a physician during colonoscopy. The technology is designed to improve colonoscopy training, establish best practices, and improve colorectal cancer screening procedures by making them safer and more comfortable.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad long term goal of this work is to develop sustained release subcutaneous drug delivery systems in order to achieve a more continuous dopaminergic stimulation in the treatment of Parkinson's Disease (PD). The immediate goal of this project is to develop an injectable sustained release formulation for the recently approved anti-Parkinsonian agent apomorphine. Apomorphine is useful in some patients but often requires frequent injections because of its very short half life. We have developed a proprietary subcutaneous sustained release platform technology based on suspensions of polymer-coated pure drug particles. High drug loading and sustained release kinetics have been achieved with several other drugs and this technology has been adapted to apomorphine. The specific aims of the Phase I proposal were: to formulate sustained release suspensions for the dopaminergic agonist apomorphine; to test the in vitro release characteristics of these formulations into buffer; and to test the in vivo pharmacokinetics and the duration of the formulations in rats. The successful completion of these goals is described in the Phase 1 report. We successfully delivered apomorphine in a sustained fashion for 24 hours in rats. The specific aims of this Phase 2 project are to optimize the parameters of the formulation, and to complete the necessary preclinical work to apply for an FDA Investigational New Drug Exemption. The team of investigators is expert in drug development, polymer chemistry, neuropharmacology, pharmacokinetics and clinical neurology. We have experience in collaboration with large pharmaceutical companies leading to the approval of novel drug delivery systems. This project could lead rapidly to the development of an improved injectable dosage form of apomorphine. Completion of these aims will constitute a readily identifiable milestone that will continue in Phase 3, in which we will clarify the potency, duration of action, and safety of the formulation in clinical trials. Apomorphine was approved in 2004 for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The benefit of this treatment is limited by the very short elimination half life of the drug necessitating frequent injections, which in addition to additional discomfort and inconvenience may actually lead to a progression of the underlying disease. The purpose of this project is to develop a sustained release injectable formulation for this drug that will both increase its effectiveness and reduce its side effects",

Additionally, the NSRL facility currently does not support processing of samples during or directly after radiation exposure, or long duration radiobiology studies.  Our proposed automated system will address the above issues as follows.  First, an automated sample movement system will be developed to reduce the overhead time of the current manual system of moving samples to/from the radiation target area.  Second, an Online Assay System will be designed to provide immediate sample analysis, such as sample fixation and freezing, to allow a better understanding of the radiation effects on the samples.  Third, the Single Loop for Cell Culture (SLCC, developed by Payload Systems Inc. for NASA) system design will be modified to support long duration radiobiology research.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year in the United States at least 1.4 million people seek medical attention for a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Between 75% and 90% of these are mild or moderate injuries. These can inflict profound and persistent impairment of physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning. The physical, social and economic sequelae of TBI can persist for the victim's entire life, a burden that is borne by the individual, their family, and by society. However, mild and moderate TBI is challenging to diagnose. Conventional methods such as imaging and neurological examination are often insensitive to mild injury. There is no blood- based diagnostic tool to aid clinicians in the diagnosis of mild and moderate TBI. However, such a rapid, reliable, and sensitive tool would greatly improve diagnosis and triage of TBI patients, would more accurately guide treatment and management options, and therefore would improve patient outcome while reducing management costs. Banyan Biomarkers Inc. has been recognized as a pioneer in the development of ultra-sensitive brain injury biomarker diagnostic assays. We have the commitment to providing such a tool to the marketplace, based on proprietary TBI biomarkers. Previously, in our Phase I SBIR project, a sensitive ELISA for quantifying one brain injury biomarker (BA0123) in CSF was successfully developed, and proof-of-concept data confirming that BA0123 is increased in CSF following brain injury was obtained from preclinical studies. Subsequently, a second complementary neuro-biomarker (BA0252) was discovered and a specific ELISA assay for its sensitive detection was developed. Proof-of-concept data to support the hypothesis that both biomarkers are increased in CSF and serum of human patients with severe TBI was generated and preliminary data show detection of these markers also in mild and moderate TBI patients. The data supporting the development of both biomarkers as tools to aid in the diagnosis of TBI are very compelling. In Phase II of this project a commercializable ELISA assay kit for both biomarkers (BA0123 and BA0252) will be developed. Assay components (antibodies and antigens) will be produced in abundant supply and under quality assured conditions. Feasibility data will be collected from clinical studies of severe, moderate, and mild TBI that will allow correlation of biomarker levels to clinical measures of injury severity, disease progression, and outcome. The accuracy with which the biomarkers can discriminate magnitude of injury, and patients that are likely to have poor progression and outcome will be evaluated. This analysis will determine the sensitivity and specificity of markers BA0123 and BA0252 when used singularly or in combination. These data will be used to support a pre-IDE application to the FDA. The deliverables of this Phase II project are two quality-assured ELISA assays for the brain injury biomarkers establishing the foundation toward their commercialization. These assays will be used to analyze clinical samples, further confirming the use of the biomarkers as tools to aid in the diagnosis of severe, mild and moderate TBI.    Each year in the United States at least 1.4 million people sustain a TBI, of which about 50,000 die, 235,000 are hospitalized, and 1.1 million are treated and released from an emergency department. Current methods used to assess the existence and severity of brain injury, based on imaging techniques such as CT scanning or MRI, are expensive, not consistently reliable, not universally available, and are slow to produce results. Banyan Biomarkers is developing rapid, reliable, sensitive, and economical blood tests for brain injury that would greatly improve diagnostic and triage capabilities, would more accurately guide treatment options, and therefore would improve patient outcome.",

Haptics is an exciting field, but industry adoption has been slow. Yet without haptics in applications like medium-run paint spraying, the two alternatives (fully automated or fully manual) are unappealing. Robots are prohibitively expensive to program for short runs, and fully manual operations endanger worker health.  The technologically revolutionary haptics field has not yet revolutionized manufacturing. Some manufacturing tasks lack good alternatives, especially in medium run production, where one must choose between high-cost, time-consuming robot programming versus poor worker health.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR research effort is to create a PDA-based instrument for the comprehensive assessment of chronic pain (i.e., the location, quality, intensity, distress, interference, and beliefs dimensions) that offers improved accuracy and efficiency over conventional approaches. The KnowPain assessment instrument will be able to provide reliable and valid ratings of pain with significant reduction in both the required number of questions and assessment time. Existing multidimensional chronic pain assessment protocols often require an hour or more to complete. Item response theory (IRT) and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) are the key technologies that will enable more accurate and efficient administration of pain questionnaires. Multivariate IRT (MIRT) will be used to perform a statistical study of questionnaire item performance as it relates to the underlying respondent traits. All necessary tests of IRT assumptions, item calibrations, assessments of model fit, and differential item functioning will be performed. The MIRT analyses will result in a calibrated bank of pain assessment items that will be utilized by the CAT-driven KnowPain instrument to optimize the efficiency of pain assessment via administration of a minimum number of appropriate items. The KnowPain assessment instrument will be tested with human subjects in a validation trial against conventional measures. The accurate assessment of pain is an important goal; the first decade of the new millennium has been declared the \"decade of pain control and research\". As further support, the Joint Council on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) has declared pain the 5th vital sign. Products resulting from this research are anticipated to offer a great benefit to the field of pain assessment. Current pain assessment questionnaires are often time consuming to fill out. A device, such as the KnowPain instrument, that offers an adaptive set of pain assessment questions will not only reduce the time involved with current pain assessment methodologies, but also provide more accurate results and be more appealing to patients and clinicians.",

The CDCU will be a revision of the Drinker's Check-up (DCU), a Windows program and a web application developed for older adults. Revisions of the programs are necessary to tailor the programs to a college student population. The DCU intervention consists of integrated assessment, feedback and decision-making modules. The programs will use the FRAMES elements common to effective brief interventions. We will also revise the follow-up program for the Windows version (Follow-up College Drinker's Program, FCDCU) and integrate follow-up components into the web application so that it has the same features and functions as the CDCU /FCDCU Windows application. The target population is heavy drinking college students (5 or more drinks per occasion for males, 4 or more for females & peak BACs >80mg% in the previous 2 weeks). Phase II goals include: revisions of the Windows and web applications based on feedback from the pilot study and expert panel; pilot testing of the final prototypes; and a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of the Windows version with a 12 month follow-up to assess its effectiveness. The RCT will compare the CDCU to a no treatment control group. There are substantial public health implications from this project. Developing a suite of Internet and Windows based programs increases the ability of universities to use these programs and the likelihood they will be used in a variety of different settings. If the clinical trial shows that the CDCU program is effective in reducing heavy drinking, it could be widely disseminated at relatively low cost. Our pricing structure (a one time fee) also will put this suite of programs at an advantage relative to its competition and make it less costly to adopt. Colleges are experiencing increasing pressure to implement evidence-based intervention programs to reduce heavy drinking and alcohol-related problems in their student body (NIAAA, 2002a,b). At the same time they need alternatives that are less expensive, require less staff effort and training, yet are empirically supported. The CDCU, if effective, could help meet those needs.",

Culturally specific stress is associated with the risk for these problems. The objective of the proposed research is to develop a stress assessment inventory for Hispanic adolescents. This Phase II study builds upon the results of the Phase I feasibility study. The study will further validate and norm immigrant and non-immigrant versions of the Hispanic Stress Inventory-Adolescent (HSI- A.). A cross-sectional research design with a nested test-retest component and multisite, multimeasure features will be applied. A stratified sample of middle and high school students (N=1600) and clinical sample of adolescents with a diagnosed behavioral health problem will be selected (N=400) in 4 research sites representing the diversity of the United States Hispanic population: LosAngeles, Miami, Dallas and Boston. The 160 items developed in the Phase I study will be self administered to the adolescents along with the criterion measures and analysis will determine the standardized version of the HSI-A. The six objectives of this study of Hispanic early (13-15 years) and late adolescents (15-17 years) are: 1) To determine, through a series of exploratory factor analyses, the global construct validity and factor structures of the HSI-A immigrant and non- immigrant versions; 2) Estimate the construct validity of the final HSI-A by analyzing the similarities and differences in scale and subscale scores between the student sample and the clinically defined contrast group; 3) Assess the HSI-A for criterion-related validity using concurrent measures; 4) Assess the reliability of the HSI-A through the use of internal consistency, split-half and test-retest procedures; 5) Using survey data from a national sample of Hispanic adolescents, generate national normative data and actuarial profiles of the HSI-A; 6)Assess the reliability of the HSI-Athat includes web-based administration and scoring features as an integral part of the commercialization plan. The HSI-A will be marketed through a commercialization plan and will provide a screening tool for early detection of elevated stress and the prevention of the onset of mental health disorders by mental health professionals. The President's New Freedom Commission has recommended that the screening and early detection of mental disorders and the reduction of health disparities be priorities in the transformation of the nation's mental health system. The proposed research will address these two national public mental health needs through the development and commercialization of the Hispanic Stress Inventory - Adolescent.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a strong need in drug discovery for cellular assays that better predict human responses to drugs. A key technical hurdle has been the difficulty of incorporating complex tissue architecture and cellular microenvironments into an assay format that is compatible with the high throughput approaches used for early drug discovery. In this proposal we propose to develop and commercialize a Microfluidic Reconstituted Tissue Device (fF-RTD) that will enable more physiologically relevant cellular assays in a high throughput, automated format. The device is a tubeless, automatable array of microfluidic channels for co-culture of mammalian cells in adjacent compartments in a three-dimensional format. The unique liquid flow properties at the microscale enable the construction of a robust, highly reproducible two-compartment tissue model in a highly parallel fashion. This means that potential drug molecules can be tested for their effects on disease processes in the context of intact tissue as opposed to non-physiological monolayers of cells. In Phase I, we developed a prototype microfluidic device and used it to extend a well established model of mammary epithelial acinar morphogenesis into a two compartment tissue model including fibroblasts. We will use this mammary tissue model to establish the design parameters of the fF-RTD and to functionally validate it for robust high throughput tumorigenesis assays. Prototype devices will be fabricated from elastomeric polymer and optimized designs will be fabricated from polystyrene. The plastic fF-RTD devices will be validated using assays for key tumorigenic processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion using mammary epithelial and stromal cell lines as well as primary cells. In situ immunocytochemistry methods and fluorescent imaging will be the key methods used for analysis. Finally, the fF-RTD will be fully validated for high throughput screening and drug discovery by optimizing its integration with standard automated liquid dispensing equipment. Cellular assays that are more predictive are greatly needed in the pharmaceutical industry to improve the success rate in clinical trials, and in biomedical research in general to increase our understanding of disease mechanisms. In this proposal we plan to develop and commercialize a Microfluidic Reconstituted Tissue Device that will enable more physiologically relevant cellular assays in a high throughput, automated format.",

        "abstract": "Millions of dollars are lost worldwide due to insect and fungi caused spoilage in stored grain. We propose to develop new technology for early detection that takes advantage of the fact that small amounts of spoilage cause significant increases in CO2 concentration throughout the grain mass and storage structure. The new sensor will be designed for placement in stored grain structures to continuously monitor CO2. The readings will be processed intelligently to give users information about the characteristics and extent of the spoilage for their quality management decision making process. This will require the development of inexpensive, easy to install, easy to use, reliable sensor hardware to withstand the harsh grain facility environment. And software that accounts for dynamic factors such as grain type, grain quantity, storage structure architecture; to effectively alert the user about developing decay.\nPhase I trials have shown that early detection is feasible long before a human can smell it, or a temperature cable can sense it. Phase II is required to complete the R and D of the sensor hardware, software, and method for delivering the data. Phase II will also include pilot field tests of the prototype sensor concurrent with data collection for the software modeling. Commercialization of this device will allow new protection of the US grain yield during post-harvest storage, help prevent dangerous mycotoxins in the food chain, and avoid financial loss due to the application of timely spoilage mitigation.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Introduction: Skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness affect older adults and often lead to frailty, falls, fractures, immobility and institutionalization. At any age this decline can be ameliorated by progressive resistance training (PRT). During traditional PRT with weights, the agonist (target) muscles lift a weight with a shortening contraction (SC) and then lower the same weight with a lengthening contraction (LC). Recent randomized controlled trials suggest that eliminating the SC-phase and applying a larger-than-normal load to the agonist muscles during the LC-phase of the training cycle (LC-only training) can result in greater strength increases at a lower acute metabolic cost and a lower rate of perceived exertion than traditional SC-LC training. LC-only training, however, tends to be more specific to improving LC strength than SC strength. Even larger increases in both SC and LC dynamic strength and muscle morphology are achieved by combining lower-load SC with higher-load LC training which is particularly attractive for older and energetically impaired adults. Despite the advantages and need for such a regimen, no commercial system exists that has the flexibility to enable both lower-load SC and higher-load LC training that is suitable for older adults and accessible to the broader public for independent use. Innovation: Bio Logic Engineering Inc. is addressing this need by developing an innovative computer controlled and motorized system that enables safe and effective strength training with velocity-controlled shortening contraction (VSC) and lengthening contraction (VLC) training protocols. The system provides programmable variable-resistance force target trajectories across the range-of-motion in both VSC and VLC phases of each training repetition. Trainees modulate their level of exertion to follow customized target trajectories that are visually displayed along with real-time force-position feedback. The unique design is ideally suited for older adults since the magnitude (intensity) of the target trajectory for the VLC phase can be programmed to be significantly elevated with respect to the VSC phase. The technology is currently being developed as a leg press machine to improve mobility in older adults but is transferable to training of other muscle groups. Aims of Phase II: System mechanics, electronics and software will be refined to improve safety, ease-of-use, flexibility and dynamic performance. Clinical performance will be assessed with 36 healthy older adults randomized into two different 16-week PRT groups stratified by gender: (GROUP 1) 9 males and 9 females will perform traditional SC-LC training with the weight-stack and (GROUP 2) 9 males and 9 females will perform motor-driven VSC-VLC training. The hypothesis to be tested is: the adaptive response to 16-weeks of PRT will be greater for the VSC-VLC group than the SC-LC group as measured by the maximum voluntary leg extension strength during standard one-repetition maximum SCs, one-repetition maximum VSCs, and isometric contractions. Commercial Opportunity: The potential market for the system is large considering its use in health clubs, wellness centers, physical therapy clinics, assisted-living communities, hospitals, and academic institutions. The objective of this research is to continue to develop, refine and test a novel computer-controlled strength training system to assist in combating sarcopenia which is an age-related progressive loss of skeletal muscle that leads to a decline in muscular strength, power and mobility. The working hypothesis is that 16 weeks of progressive resistance training with the new computer-controlled system, which enables variable-resistance through the range-of-motion and elevated loading during the muscle lengthening phase, will lead older adults to greater increases in strength than with traditional weight training methods. The long-term goal of this research is to make widely available an innovative apparatus and method to improve the efficacy of progressive resistance strength training, especially in older adults.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project will support 'translational medicine', defined as \"a basic laboratory discovery that becomes applicable to the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of a specific disease\". Our goal is to improve the probability of a laboratory discovery that impacts human health by providing a better research tool for studies using pigs. Pigs develop conditions similar to humans (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity) and are useful to researchers trying to identify both causes and treatments of these diseases. The anatomical similarities between the cardiovascular system of pigs and humans makes them a useful surrogate for testing new medical devices such as stents. Pig and human cytochrome P450 enzymes are so homologous that pigs should be the preferred model for drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics studies. Yet, pigs are under-utilized. A device that makes it easier to obtain their biofluids, and also simultaneously acquires physiological data from conscious and mobile subjects, could increase the value of pigs to human health research. The reduction of stress associated with elimination of restraints or handling, should also improve the quality of data by reducing hormones which confound the study (e.g. catecholamine release redirecting blood flow away from the liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract during a pharmacokinetics study). Therefore, we propose to refine and expand the capabilities of a prototype movement-responsive cage that we built, and began to test, during Phase I studies. The project milestones outline the successive addition of capabilities to this cage, including automated blood sampling, programmed dosing, and physiological data acquisition modules for core body temperature, blood pressure and electrocardiography. In accordance with the intent of the SBIR program, the ultimate objective is an instrument that can be sold to laboratories involved in pharmaceutical and biomedical research. Each development milestone will culminate in validation experiments, to be accomplished by comparing data acquired using the new technique with data either from the literature or from a crossover study employing a conventional technique. For example, the concentration of the same drug will be compared in blood sampled manually from a restrained pig vs blood sampled automatically from a mobile pig. Another validation study will evaluate comparisons with human data. For example, one advantage of using a pig for pharmacokinetics studies is their acceptance of solid dosing forms, such as capsules or tablets. Pigs swallow pills willingly, without coercion or handling, if the pills are hidden in a cookie. This device will collect programmed blood samples to establish the pharmacokinetics of a solid dose, and provide comparisons of different formulations within the same subject. When successive doses represent a marketed or generic drug, the pig will provide drug bioequivalence data. Demonstration of the same level of oral bioavailability in the pig and human for marketed drugs would validate the technique, and encourage initial screening in pigs instead of relying solely on human clinical trials for bioequivalence. The pig is a valuable model for human illnesses such as diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Simultaneous pharmacology studies in pigs will accelerate research by providing more relevant information to those scientists trying to characterize these health problems, and also to the pharmaceutical researchers trying to develop treatments. The movement-responsive cage facilitates simultaneous pharmacology studies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RPN Research has developed a new medical device, the Bioelectric Field Imager (BFI) which can measure the electric field in human skin non-invasively. The hand-held BFI scans a vibrating sensor over the skin without making contact with it and plots the surface potential distribution over a 1 cm distance in about 1 minute. Using a table-mounted version of this new imager in Phase I of this project, we have revealed for the first time that malignant melanomas in mice generate an electric field that can be easily detected by the BFI. These studies found that the electric field can be detected as early as one day after injection of the melanoma cells and the electric field strength is proportional to both the size and growth rate of the melanoma. We have also completed a Phase I Clinical Trial using the hand-held BFI to measure the electric field in both benign and malignant human skin lesions and have found that malignant basal and squamous cell carcinomas generate large electric fields in human skin as well. In our Clinical Trial we found that the hand-held BFI detected an electric field averaging 696 mV/mm at the borders of three of the four malignant lesions in the study (3 basal cell carcinomas and 1 squamous cell carcinoma). This 75% reliability rate in our first human clinical trial is encouraging. In addition, the average electric field measured near benign lesions (223 mV/mm) was only one-third the size of those near malignant lesions, making it very easy to distinguish between the two. In 9 out of 13 benign lesions (70%) we detected a very small electric field and correctly predicted in a blinded study they were not malignant. During this Phase II SBIR we will refine the design of the hand-held BFI to make it more versatile and reliable for human use my making it lighter, wireless and compatible with a wider variety of lesion shapes. We will complete a Phase II Clinical Trial with at least 300 patients to establish the reliability of this new instrument for rapidly distinguishing malignant from benign skin lesions. We will also compare the electric field near melanomas as measured with the BFI to that measured using conventional microelectrodes to both serve as a confirmation of the accuracy of the BFI and to further demonstrate its advantages over the direct contact measurement approach. If the handheld BFI is able to reliably detect malignant skin lesions, it will improve the quality of life for tens of thousands of dermatology patients in the United States alone.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pneumothorax is an accumulation of air in the pleural cavity, often as the result of a blunt trauma causing a partial collapse of the lung. While a pneumothorax is easily treatable, it can become life threatening if not detected at an early stage. Current methods for diagnosing pneumothorax (chest x-ray, chest CT scan) are not possible for emergency squads or battlefield medics and not practical for long-term monitoring of critical care patients. It is especially important for first responders to properly diagnose and treat a pneumothorax when an airlift evacuation is considered, as the reduced pressures could result in an expansion of the pneumothorax and death. A portable handheld pneumothorax detector that is inexpensive, accurate, and non-invasive therefore would be a great benefit. Working with Lawrence Livermore National Labs, BIOMEC has developed prototype pneumothorax detection devices based on patented Micropower Impulse Radar (MIR) technology. This device emits very low power radio frequency impulses of a very high frequency and broad spectrum (1-4 GHz). The resultant echoes are collected by extremely high-speed circuitry and analyzed by a proprietary software algorithm. Funded in part by the Phase I and Phase II NIH SBIR program, we have demonstrated the ability of these devices to accurately detect the presence or absence of a suspected pneumothorax in over 40 patients at two metro-Detroit hospital emergency departments. While originally based on a laptop computer for data collection and analysis, BIOMEC is currently in the process of miniaturizing the electronics and completely interfacing the device with a handheld PDA. The next steps in commercialization of this device are to complete the miniaturization and integration with the PDA, complete the clinical study, and apply to the FDA for 510(k) clearance to market. In parallel to these efforts, BIOMEC will apply for additional patent coverage, begin manufacturing scale-up, and identify the appropriate market channels. The markets for this device include both the civilian emergency response teams (EMTs and ER staff) as well as military battlefield medics. Longer-term markets include continuous monitoring for pneumothorax, for example in an intensive care unit after cardiac surgery. BIOMEC has had significant discussions with physicians and support staff in both the civilian and military markets and received extremely positive feedback regarding the value and need for this device. A full time business development person is now required to develop these channels to support the commercialization of this device into these markets. A handheld inexpensive pneumothorax detector will be commercially attractive to emergency medical personnel and trauma clinicians along with battlefield medics. Also, it would be useful for patient monitoring in a cardio-thoracic ICU or critical care units. The combined market for these applications is quite large. With further development, the device may be able to detect other trauma conditions, such as hematoma and hemorrhagic stroke.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer Clustering for Residential Histories Abstract: This project will develop a new, comprehensive approach for evaluating clustering in case-control data that accounts for residential histories, risk factors, covariates and cancer induction and latency periods. To date, two of the major deficiencies of geographic studies of cancer are that they lack an appropriate methodology for investigating clusters over the life course and risk factors/covariates are not included in the analysis. These limitations are overcome by this project. Local, global and focused tests for residential histories will be developed based on sets of matrices of nearest neighbor relationships that reflect the changing space-time geometry of the residential addresses of cases and controls. Exposure traces that account for the latency between exposure and disease manifestation, and that use exposure windows of varying duration will be defined. Several of the methods so derived will be applied to evaluate clustering of residential histories in an ongoing case-control study of bladder cancer in south eastern Michigan, and to identify local excesses of breast cancer in Marin County, California. Because humans are mobile, these new methods are a significant advance over approaches that ignore residential histories and instead rely only on place of residence at time of diagnosis or death. The major innovation is the creation of methods for analyzing and modeling the residential histories of cases and controls to identify geographic excesses of cancer risk, both in the study population itself as well as in relation to putative hazards such as point-source releases of carcinogens. Cancer Clustering for Residential Histories Relevance: The techniques and software to be developed in this project will provide a more concise and accurate description of clustering of cancer cases that accounts for risk factors, covariates, residential history, cancer latency, time of diagnosis, and the exposure windows during which causative exposures are hypothesized to have occurred. To our knowledge the techniques and software from this project will be the first to address all of these factors within a single, comprehensive framework.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research will assess the technical feasibility of developing a new and unique miniature ophthalmic intraocular pressure (IOP) sensor, to be retrofitted into the cannula of a conventional Glaucoma Drainage Device (GDD) and surgically implanted under the sclera for the purpose of continuous measurement and transmission of these IOP readings to a remote receiver. Current technology does not allow for real-time, continuous monitoring of IOP (24/7, diurnal and nocturnal readings). The long-term objective of this project is to enable physicians to study, diagnose and more clearly understand the response mechanism relating to IOP that can lead to more effective development and titration of glaucoma medications or other timely therapeutic options. Elevated and fluctuating IOP over a 24/7 period is an independent and proven risk factor for eye damage in the short term and glaucoma progressions in the long term, which if left unchecked or unmanaged could lead to blindness. This Phase II research is dedicated to developing technologies that assist physicians to more effectively treat the glaucoma patient. This is inline with the mission of the National Eye Institute. Under Phase II, specific aims include system microminiaturization, packaging and biocompatibility. Research and development will specifically involve designing, fabricating, and integrating various MEMS and ASIC chips into a unitized singular micro scale chip to perform a number of systems activities (i.e. power transfer [RF-ID], chip interrogation, IOP data capture and storage, wireless data transfer, remediation, resolution, etc.) involving methods researched and determined in the successful portion of Phase I. These sequential methods include design input, product development, product integration (MEMS sensor, ASIC & biocompatible materials) and product validation and testing. In conclusion, with this telemetric IOP sensing technology, physicians will be able to measure the effects that medications and life-style factors have on the IOP of their patients in a real- time and continuous model.",

The development of labels to non-radioactively track therapeutic cells in vivo is needed to measure the efficacy of delivery systems, bio-distribution and effective dose. In Vivo Survey Technology\" (IVST) is a label material designed to be assayed by a number of measurement technologies and able to be readily taken up by cells.

In Phase I, multi-detection nano- materials were successfully prepared that combined neutron activation analysis, electron microscopy, fluorescent imaging and magnetic resonance imaging. This Phase II application seeks support to optimize the labeling of cells with IVST materials, to demonstrate that all measurements can be performed with the newly developed IVST nano-particles and to compare a variety of coatings that can target IVST particles to specific cell types. IVST will allow researchers to conduct analyses on cell therapy protocols not readily feasible previously and to obtain badly needed basic information to optimize for success in clinical trials. The project will develop tools that allow researchers to track, identify, and measure the amount of implanted cell in living subjects over long periods of time.

Currently, the gold standard for many manifestations of vascular disease, especially arterial occlusive disease, is x-ray angiography, an invasive, costly, and potentially hazardous procedure. In the United States alone, an estimated 3.3 million diagnostic x-ray angiograms are performed annually at a cost to the healthcare system of over 6 billion dollars. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) offers a noninvasive and potentially less costly alternative. The availability of an effective intravascular contrast agent that can simplify data acquistion and image interpretation of MRA procedures could propel wider utilization of this diagnostic tool. Our Fast Track SBIR application will evaluate a gadolinium-based contrast reagent that is ideally suited for MRA. The formulation of this reagent is based on a novel chemical procedure for the production of stable lanthanide oxide colloids. Preliminary data demonstrates that the gadolinium oxide colloid is stable in an aqueous suspension under a variety of challenges, including autoclaving, and demonstrates that this reagent provides a strong T1 brightening signal comparable to the same molar concentration of gadolinium-DTPA. The synthetic process yields a gadolinium oxide core that is tightly bound to an inert matrix, which should afford a toxicity profile comparable to chelated gadolinium. Phase I study will focus on toxicology, biodistribution, and in vivo stability, as well as further characterize the reagent. If Phase I research is successful, Phase II research will expand toxicity evaluation in a non-rodent model as required for IND filing with the FDA and will perform efficacy studies to evaluate our MRA reagent using an in vivo swine model of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion.",

We believe that the unique properties of BioScale's sensor system meet the rigorous needs of an HIV viral load diagnostic for point-of- care use in resource-poor settings: rapid, easy-to-use, automatable sample preparation, inexpensive, rugged with low-power consumption. We have successfully completed the specific aims in our Phase I program and plan to continue development and validation of a field-deployable HIV viral load diagnostic. The specific aims of our Phase II application are: 1. To evaluate the accuracy, threshold of detection and usability of a laboratory prototype instrument (alpha unit) and version 1.0 assay in clinical samples, in comparison to gold standard HIV viral load assays. 2. To develop a field deployable prototype instrument (beta unit), and 3. To evaluate the field deployable unit for accuracy, detection threshold and usability for infant HIV diagnosis and adult HIV viral load quantification. As with existing gold standard HIV viral detection methods, such as RT-PCR, BioScale's proposed assay has two distinct applications: quantitative measurement of HIV viral load in adults for disease monitoring; and qualitative infant diagnosis to determine the presence or absence of HIV infection in infants below 15 months of age.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): / Abstract Reporter genes are essential for accurate and sensitive gene activity measurements. Linked to DNA response elements they provide a means to screen compounds that alter specific signaling pathways. Efficient reporter genes encode enzymes that act on pro- fluorescent and pro-chemiluminescent substrates to give highly amplified signals. Certain enzyme / substrate combinations allow detection of gene expression changes over a range of 5-7 orders of magnitude. Few suitable reporter genes limit simultaneous high throughput screening of multiple compounds and signaling pathways. Fluorescence quenched probes are highly suitable for genomic, biochemical, and immunoassays. Because the fluorescent signal is generated only by uncoupling of the fluorophore and quencher, the probes' have nearly undetectable background signals. The signal is typically generated in one of three ways: a change in conformation of a fluorescence-quenched probe (e.g. DNA linearization via hybridization), cleavage of the probe (e.g. proteolysis of peptide substrate), or hydrolysis of a substrate-fluorophore conjugate (e.g. galactose removal from fluorescein-digalactoside). Recently, we conceived and have initiated development of a novel mechanism for eliciting fluorescent signals by direct enzymatic reduction of azo bonds. Our azoreductase cuts azo bonds of our Black Hole QuencherTM dark quencher molecules to anilines leading to loss of quenching and thus to generation of fluorescence. Under this grant we propose to apply azoreductase to develop a powerful and versatile new reporter technology. A number of assays can be envisioned employing the azoreduction mechanism, including reporter gene assays to study cell signaling pathways and immunological detection of proteins such as western analysis and ELISA. Principle objectives of this Phase II grant are to assemble a functional, simple, yet versatile azoreductase-based reporter gene system for expression in mammalian cells. New enzyme variants and pro-fluorescent substrates we will be combined with existing reporter technology for extended versatility and multiplexing. Azoreductase will also be explored for further in vitro applications to facilitate multiplex detection Technology to be developed under the proposed research should find broad applications in the general study of cell and molecular biology as well as to high throughput screening of drug candidates. Reporter genes are essential to accurately measure specifc gene activity . In combination with fluorescent molecules they provide for high quality replacements for older radioactivity based methods. Technology to be developed under the proposed research at Biosearch Technologies should find broad applications in the general study of cell and molecular biology as well as in high throughput screening of drug candidates.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans suffer a disproportionate health burden from chronic diseases and conditions such as obesity, cancer, hypertension and stroke, diabetes, asthma and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, African Americans experience significantly more premature morbidity and mortality compared to white Americans. Traditional means of reaching African Americans with health messages has had limited success largely due to limitations in using culturally appropriate messages and media. Public health needs demand the development of health communication strategies with increased appeal as well as demonstrated efficacy to reach the African American community. BioTechnical Communications, Inc. (BTC), the applicant organization, is proposing to use two communications technologies - Black radio and the Internet, to raise awareness and improve knowledge and attitudes about chronic diseases and their risk factors experienced by this target population. The commercial success of Black radio comes from an ability to address the unique cultural niche central to African American life. Humor, appeal to family unity, struggles of urban life, and celebration of cultural heritage are some of the many characteristics popular on contemporary Black radio. The emerging technology of web casting, made possible by the Internet, will, in addition, allow us to test another potentially highly effective medium for health information delivery to Black Americans. Our long-term goal is to have a measurable impact on the health literacy of the African American community using a culturally relevant and effective medium to improve public health and decrease health disparities. Based on the successful completion of a Phase I project testing the feasibility of a radio formatted Entertainment-Education strategy to promote education about cancer, BTC will now proceed with the Phase II proposal to launch a professionally produced 40-episode health education serial radio drama with a companion web-based component. Our health education focus has broadened to address the particular health burdens experienced by African Americans in the U.S. - obesity, breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension/stroke. This project will use a medium that transcends social class and can be used effectively especially given the heterogeneity of the Black radio audience.",

These agents include surfactant, antibiotics, mucokinetics, peptides, anticancer agents, and biologics. Whereas there are excellent nebulizers for the delivery of microgram quantities of many small molecules, efficient and effective aerosol delivery of many of the above agents presents new challenges for aerosol delivery systems. In Phase I, we demonstrated the proof of principal of the components of an aerosol delivery system which addresses the following needs; a) shorter treatment times, b) elimination or at least reduction of the use of excipients c) delivery of fine respirable aerosols without shear-stress-induced molecular degradation d) administration of sparcely soluble agents and e) delivery of surfactant. Using this bench model of SUPRAER we generated large aqueous aerosols which following evaporation and concentration were delivered as respirable concentrated dry power aerosols at a concentration of 5 mg/l. This Phase II we will optimize, construct and test an alpha prototype of SUPRAER(tm), which will deliver 2 to 10 times the dose of active agent per breath than current technologies. The resultant dry power aerosol, of 3 fm aerodynamic diameter will be delivered at inspiratory flow rates of 20-30 l/min. The alpha prototype will be robust, functional, manufacturable, and have patient friendly features. SUPRAER will be used to generate aerosols of surfactant, tobramycin, insulin and mannitol. The performance and output aerosol characteristics will be compared with competitive marketed products with FDA approval. SUPRAER(tm) will decrease the time required for inhalation therapy as well as broaden the range of therapeutic agents that can be successfully administered via the respiratory tract.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is an urgent need for a long-term in vivo glucose-monitoring device for diabetes therapy. Diabetes is currently believed to afflict over 100 million people worldwide and nearly 18 million in the United States. In the U.S. this disorder, along with its associated complications, is ranked as the seventh leading cause of death. Research indicates that these long-term complications can be minimized in diabetics if blood glucose levels are maintained as near normal levels (60-110 mg/dL) as possible, so called \"tight\" glucose control. The integration of continuous glucose monitor readings into an automatic insulin pump control algorithm may substantially increase both the safety and effectiveness of insulin therapy in diabetics. BioTex, Inc. has developed a superior concept of a minimally invasive fluorescence affinity glucose sensor which is one of the most promising long-term glucose-sensing technologies currently being pursued for application in diabetes research and therapy. The ultimate objective of the proposed research is to advance our fluorescence sensor, in preparation for preliminary human trials subsequent to completion of Phase II. To accomplish this challenging goal, we will concentrate our efforts in Phase II on the following tasks: I. BioTex chemists and collaborators Dr.Stephen Massia and Dr.Fred Clubb will design, test, and optimize suitable chemical protocols for covalent attachment of biomimetic layer(s) on outer sensor surface for improved biocompatibility and, hence, extended in vivo sensor functionality in rats. II. BioTex chemists and engineers will perform studies to optimize a pre-sterilization formulation protocol of sensor by freeze-drying/vacuum-packaging. III. BioTex chemists in collaboration with commercial facilities will perform studies to optimize conditions of radiation-based sterilization methods and to validate the efficacy of sterilization. IV. BioTex engineers will design and manufacture a device for sensor delivery, and complete study for sensor retrieval. V. BioTex scientists will collaborate with endocrinologist Dr. Eric Orzceck, MD, in order to guide us towards a feasible sensor design ready for human studies after completion of this project. We believe strongly that both the substantial amount of preliminary work and our team of experts will enable us to successfully accomplish the proposal Phase II objectives. The relevance of the glucose-sensing technology developed by BioTex, Inc. to public health lays in the need to find therapeutic means to minimize or even eliminate the devastating effects of diabetes to human health (especially juvenile Type I diabetes), like blindness, kidney failure, and increased mortality. If successful, the BioTex glucose- sensing technology will in conjunction with an insulin pump improve overall health level of people with diabetes by enabling autonomous blood-sugar control with minimal user intervention. The overall result will be a healthier life for people with diabetes and lower medical costs for diabetes care for the society.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal to build and test a \"Smart Telescope,\" a device for persons with low vision that uses computer vision algorithms to search for, detect and enhance targets such as text and faces to aid in everyday tasks such as travel, navigation and social interactions. The practical, cosmetically acceptable packaging will consist of a miniature camera and visual display discreetly mounted on spectacles or a hat, and a compact computing device and set of controls that fit into a pocket. The Smart Telescope advances today's state of the art in assistive devices for low vision by automatically searching for, detecting and enhancing target objects even when they fill only a small portion of the device's field of view, without the user having to point the device directly or accurately at the target as with optical telescopes. The Smart Telescope is small and lightweight, but large enough for the elderly to handle and control; simple to operate and easy to carry, store, recharge, don and remove. Advanced options are hidden during day-to-day use, but easy to access when necessary. In Phase I, we developed and evaluated a working prototype and received enthusiastic feedback from subjects in our target population. In Phase II we propose to prototype a commercially viable consumer version of the Smart Telescope. The Phase II work plan has four tracks: 1) User interaction and interface design, 2) physical design and configuration, 3) software design and development, and 4) hardware design and development. Smith-Kettlewell's Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center (RERC) will provide expertise for the human factors portions of the project. Blindsight will design and build the device hardware from off-the-shelf components with the help of Bolton Engineering. Low vision experts Drs. Don Fletcher, Melissa Chun and Ian Bailey will work with the RERC to guarantee a practical product for the target audience. The overall aim is to create a commercial version of the proposed device for persons with reduced visual acuity, reduced contrast sensitivity, or other loss of visual function caused by macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye problems, increasing mobility and independence for those with acuity between approximately 20/200 and 20/600. At under $1,000, the total market for such a device is estimated at up to 300,000, i.e., 10% of low vision persons in the United States. The commercial version of the Smart Telescope will significantly increase mobility and independence for persons with visual acuity between approximately 20/200 and 20/600, aiding them in everyday tasks such as travel, navigation, and social interactions. It will advance today's state of the art in assistive devices for low vision by improving on and surpassing the capabilities of the traditional optical telescope, greatly benefiting persons with reduced visual acuity, reduced contrast sensitivity, or other loss of visual function caused by macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye problems.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes progressive joint destruction, deformities and disability. One of the earliest observed features of RA is the development of a new vascular network within the synovium that allows for the delivery of cells and nutrients to the invading pannus. This formation of new blood vessels (also known as angiogenesis) is a highly regulated process under the influence of the host microenvironment and a number of secreted mediators. Many proangiogeneic mediators are expressed in RA. One of these mediators in particular, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) appears to play a critical role in the differentiation of endothelial cells and the development of the vascular system in the synovial lining of the joints and therefore, is a reasonable target for therapeutic intervention in RA patients. Our overall goals are to create a long acting VEGF inhibitor and test its efficacy in animal models of RA. During Phase I, we used the published structural information for soluble VEGF Receptor I (also known as sFlt-1) to rationally design polyethylene glycol (PEG)-sFlt-1 conjugates using cysteine-reactive PEGs. We introduced a new \"free\" cysteine using site-directed mutagenesis in regions of sFlt-1 that were believed to be non-essential for biological activity. The \"free\" cysteine residue served as the site for the covalent modification of the protein using a thiol-reactive PEG. This technology allows for the creation of novel, fully active PEG-Cys-sFlt-1 analogues of defined structure and overcomes the problems of reduced bioactivity and heterogeneity when proteins are modified using standard amine-reactive PEGs. During Phase I we identified sites in sFlt-1 that can be modified without affecting the protein's in vitro bioactivity. We also performed a pharmacokinetic study to verify that PEGylation extends the circulating half-life of sFlt-1. During Phase II, we will develop a cost effective manufacturing process and produce sufficient quantities of PEGylated recombinant sFlt-1 for testing in animal disease models of RA. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes progressive joint destruction, deformities and disability. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) appears to play a critical role in this inflammatory process and therefore, is a reasonable target for therapeutic intervention in RA patients. VEGF inhibitors have been tested in humans and have been shown to delay the progression of the disease. Our overall goal is to create a long acting VEGF inhibitor that can be dosed once a week or once every two weeks.",

Low-cost, reliable, and easy-deployment sensor systems are needed to monitor and control building environmental parameters.  This project will develop an integrated, passive, wireless radio frequency (RF) sensing system to monitor humidity.  The sensing platform and fabrication technology to be developed can be extended to a networked system for monitoring the building environment; by changing sensing materials, various conditions can be monitored, such as temperature, pollutant, flow rate, gases and bioagents.  The system can be embedded into wallpapers because its multilayer thick film structure is low-cost, maintenance-free, and totally passive, and has a very long lifetime.  In Phase I, several wireless humidity sensors were prototyped by employing a planar inductor, a capacitor resonant sensing platform, and various functional materials including porous ceramics.  It was shown that multiple sensors could share a single reader, which would extend proposed sensor applications to multi-point or multi-parameter information sensing.  Phase II will develop wireless sensor systems for commercial applications.  Detailed objectives include developing a production-level prototype for wireless wallpaper humidity and temperature sensors, a readout system for multiple passive sensors, and a wireless sensor network implemented with industry standard protocols.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The wireless passive sensors should be very useful for a remote-query environmental control strategy for increasing occupant comfort and decreasing energy consumption.  A follow-on market also would exist in homeland security, providing protection against potential chemical and biological agent attacks in buildings.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a plan to develop long stroke MEMS deformable mirrors suitable for use in commercial ophthalmic adaptive optics. They will be designed to permit diffraction-limited retinal imaging through dilated pupils in at least 90% of the human population. Electrostatic actuator design and manufacturing processes demonstrated in Phase I research will be used as a foundation for these MEMS-DMs, which will be produced using silicon wafer batch-manufacturing. Based on prior research, it is estimated compensation of aberrations of the eye will require up to 12fm of wavefront compensation (with focus and astigmatism compensated before MEMS-DM correction). Because mirror deformation is doubled in the wavefront by reflection, this will require a DM with at least 6fm of stroke at each actuator. A second goal will be to demonstrate diffraction-limited retinal imaging in human subjects possessing optical aberrations of the eye that encompasses more than 90% of the range found in the population. The long-stroke MEMS deformable mirror will be combined with the optical doubler demonstrated in the Phase I effort to achieve an effective deformable mirror motion of 12fm, corresponding to 24fm of wavefront correction, and will be integrated into a proven adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope design. Adding the optical doubler to the system will allow for the deformable mirror to correct for low order (astigmatic) aberrations. This large stroke, combined with a Badal optometer design, will eliminate the need to use corrective lenses for each subject eye and allow unprecedented in vivo imaging of the human retina. Researchers and clinicians have been unable to see critical features in the human retina due to ocular aberrations that limited imaging resolution. A successful completion of the proposed project will provide the enabling component for better resolution imaging of the human retina than ever before. This improvement in image quality will allow clinicians to detect and diagnose diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration as well as to determine the efficacy of drugs in drug studies.",

The proposed Phase II work will build upon the feasibility study conducted in Phase I. The Phase I effort introduced a novel algorithm that successfully integrated multiview geometry with automated 3D registration to produce realistic visualizations of complex, reconstructed, real-world 3D models with minimal human interaction.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nosocomial (hospital acquired) infections represent one of the most severe problems facing the health care industry. Of the approximately two million hospital acquired infections reported annually in this country, about half are associated with catheters, ureteral stents, central lines and other percutaneous devices that provide a support surface for organisms to track into deeper tissue. A typical infection can cost as much as $47,000 per patient to treat. Although invasive medical devices such as stents and catheters are pre-sterilized and inserted or implanted under the most sterile conditions available; biofilm growth, encrustation, and subsequent infection are the most common mode of failure. Coatings that could render these devices inherently resistant to biofilm formation and encrustation could significantly reduce the incidence of infections and unnecessary illness, allow better use of health care resources, reduce healthcare costs, and save lives. Encrustation results from mineral incorporation into biofilms on device surfaces. These deposits inhibit drainage; are virulent bacterial reservoirs; and increase susceptibility of the local tissues to infection. Antibiotic strategies have proven to be of little value in preventing biofilm formation and encrustation of stents and catheters. One technique for producing antimicrobial surfaces is to apply a coating which is capable of releasing metal ions when exposed to moisture. Antimicrobial silver ions are particularly useful for in vivo use due to the fact that they are not substantially absorbed into the body. In Phase I, Brighton Technologies Group developed and characterized a novel antimicrobial nanocoating (AMNC) based on gas-phase deposition of a silver salt-containing polymer that effectively inhibits biofilm formation for a wide range of microorganisms. Phase II will extend these results to create an antimicrobial surface that will inhibit biofilm formation and encrustation on medical devices such as stents and indwelling catheters through: 1. Developing techniques for depositing these films on urinary devices such as ureteral stents, Foley catheters, and ureteral catheters. 2. Evaluating important AMNC characteristics such as hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, coefficient of friction, adhesion and wear resistance. 3. Developing predictive knowledge of activity and effective lifetime of AMNC's as a function of structure and composition. 4. Initiating in vivo performance and biocompatibility evaluations. Approximately two million hospital-acquired infections are reported annually in the USA, 90,000 of which result in death. Reducing the spread of infectious diseases within healthcare facilities, and in the general community would ultimately translate to saving lives, increasing productivity, and improving the quality of life for millions. Brighton Technologies Group, Inc.'s Antimicrobial Nanocoating is designed to render medical device and hand-contact surfaces self-sterilizing to eliminate some the most common conduits for infection transmission.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral oximetry is an optical method that measures cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO2) continuously and non-invasively at the bedside. Complimentary to pulse oximetry, which only measures arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), cerebral oximetry measures parameters that mostly reflect regional metabolism and the balance of local tissue oxygen supply/demand. Therefore, an accurate cerebral oximeter would have a wide range of applications, both in basic research and clinical settings. However, current cerebral oximeters have yet to achieve their initially expected potential of becoming a routine clinical monitor like pulse oximeters. The main challenge for clinical application of cerebral oximeters has been to demonstrate the     effectiveness of such monitors. The critical issue that needs to be addressed is the     development of algorithms that are able to quantify the optical signals and therefore derive     absolute values of SctO2. More importantly, it is necessary to establish threshold StO2 values     that correlate with patients' clinical outcomes for various clinical situations.  In Phase II validation study of our proof-of-concept prototype cerebral oximeter, we demonstrated that our empirically derived novel algorithm could determine absolute cerebral SctO2 with a high degree of accuracy in the adult human. We hypothesize that our commercial absolute cerebral oximeter will perform similarly for adult humans. The proposed studies will focus on transforming the existing proof-of-concept prototype cerebral oximeter into a commercial product. Furthermore, we will conduct validation and clinical outcome studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our commercial cerebral oximeter. If successful, we will    commercialize the first FDA approved absolute cerebral oximeter, since commercial cerebral     oximeters currently approved by the FDA are for trending only monitoring. In addition, we     anticipate that result from the proposed clinical outcome studies will provide physicians guidance to establish threshold SctO2 values for various clinical situations.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transplantation of islets of Langerhans for the clinical treatment of Type I diabetes has had a resurgence of interest due to results obtained using the \"Edmonton protocol\". However, at this time, procurement of donor pancreases for islet isolation and transplantation is in its infancy. Most pancreases at more remote donor sites are not procured due to justified concerns about post-mortem ischemia during transport to the islet isolation and transplant center. Perfusion/preservation technology has been shown to have a major impact in circumventing ischemic injury in kidney transplantation. This proposal seeks to apply this approach to the preservation and procurement of viable islets for transplantation. The primary objective of this proposal is to use state-of-the-art perfusion technology and new preservation solutions to test the hypothesis that machine perfusion can improve the yield and viability of islets prepared from ischemic pancreases. To this end, a prototype pancreas transporter (PTR) has been designed and constructed in a previous study that demonstrated the feasibility of 24h perfusion preservation at 2-7 degrees C using a porcine model. This exceeds the 16h documented to be the present clinical limits of safe, static cold storage of donor pancreata. Here we propose a complimentary study to address the second important factor for further development of this technology, namely the design and optimization of the perfusate to maximize the yield and viability of isolated islets after hypothermic machine perfusion preservation. More specifically, in the Phase I study a new proprietary solution (Unisol) will be compared with current standard organ preservation solutions (KPS1 and UW Viaspan) for 24h preservation of fresh porcine pancreata. The safety and efficacy of this new technology will be further investigated during a Phase II study in which the design of the solution used to perfuse the pancreas in the PTR will be optimized in four specific aims. The first step will be to use a system of high throughput assays to select cytoprotective additives to be incorporated into the base perfusates. The second step will entail a comparison of pancreas perfusates with the addition of the cytoprotective cocktail for machine preservation of fresh pancreata with no warm ischemia. Then the interaction between cold perfusion time (24 and 48h) and warm ischemia time (up to 60 min) on porcine islet isolation parameters will be evaluated using the optimized perfusate for the definition of the potential clinical scope and technology limits. Finally, human pancreases that are unsuitable for transplantation will be employed for pre-clinical validation of this technology. It is anticipated that the availability of a pancreas transporter and pancreas perfusion protocols will permit utilization of most, if not all, pancreases suitable for transplantation in the U.S. Furthermore, the PTR may permit islet isolation banking for long-term storage. Banking would allow time for better HLA matching of donors to recipients, off-the-shelf availability, and enable quality assurance/control procedures to be conducted prior to transplantation. This research program is supported by collaboration with three major clinical centers interested in validation of this perfusion technology for their future use.         Project Narrative: Insulin-dependent diabetes is one of the major health problems worldwide and there is now a great deal of interest in developing an option for a potential cure by transplantation of islet cells isolated from a donor pancreas. A critical component of this approach is the availability of sufficient high quality islets to reverse diabetes in the patient. This research is focused on the development of new technologies (a perfusion machine and protective solutions) for improving the quality of pancreas preservation to yield larger numbers of high functioning islet cells.",

A new technology for the CBC is proposed, which produces a monolayer of whole blood and uses computer image analysis. The system will be compact and much less expensive than current CBC instrumentation, which is based on multi-channel, multi-detector flow systems. A simple glass disposable slide will be used to prepare and analyze a stained monolayer from a drop of whole blood in seconds, using a novel, new method. The image analysis hardware will use a combination of darkfield and brightfield illumination, and spectral analysis. Software will be developed to acquire and analyze multiple images with different combinations of illumination type and color. Analysis of the images will provide all the conventional components of the Complete Blood Count (CBC) as well as a differential white blood cell count. An assessment of red blood cell and platelet morphology should also be feasible. The new system could be used in the clinical laboratory or directly in doctor's offices, creating a large new market opportunity. Applying the technology to veterinary medicine could expand its sales potential even further. Each year over 1.5 billion Complete Blood Count (CBC) tests are performed in the United States. The CBC is a critical component of patient diagnosis and treatment. There have been no fundamental improvements in the technology used to determine the CBC for over 20 years. This application proposes the development of a novel means of preparing and analyzing blood samples to determine the CBC and white blood cell differential count using computer imaging.",

PhosphoSite is a bioinformatics resource that systematically has collected information from thousands of published reports about specific phosphorylation sites, how they are physiologically regulated, and the biological consequences of these phosphorylation events. PhosphoSite(r) was designed primarily to curate and present information from published literature, which historically focused on one or a few phosphorylation sites; curation and organization of this information was relatively simple. Using tandem mass spectrometric methodologies, the CST Cancer Biology Group and others are discovering thousand of new phosphorylation sites in human cancers which must be processed and uploaded into PhosphoSite(r). We propose to significantly reengineer PhosphoSite(r) to accommodate this abundance of data and to update the interfaces so that users can view and compare sets of phosphorylation sites associated with specific cancers and other diseases.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite the recent completion of the human genome project, an ostensibly more difficult post-genomic challenge will be the functional annotation of all human genes and integration of this information into an operational cell-based model. Unfortunately, this is at present challenging, primarily due to the absence of reliable experimental and bioinformatic toolsets to rapidly delineate and describe gene function en masse. RNA interference (RNAi) has proven to be an extremely potent and versatile experimental tool to specifically reduce expression of targeted genes, allowing for loss-of-function genetic screens in mammalian cells. Despite these successes, high-throughput (HT) RNAi screening is technically challenging and significant limitations in the technology exist. To address these issues, and to expand on previous program funding, we have developed a novel experimental platform to identify functional shRNAs at a genome-wide scale. The ultimate goal of the proposed project is to develop and make available in public domains a genome-wide database of functionally validated (FV) shRNAs with minimum off-target effects and software for prediction of effective shRNAs. Under Phase II, we propose to develop a FV shRNA data set for 20,000 human genes selected from the RefSeq database. In collaboration with our bioinformatics consultants at University of Rochester and University of Utah, we will develop and maintain a FV shRNA database and algorithm for prediction of the most efficient siRNAs. Then, we will extend this program to include the development of databases comprising a genome-wide FV mouse shRNAs without off-target activity. The FV shRNA databases will be used to develop and release as a commercial product FV shRNA libraries cloned into lentiviral vectors. Genetic screens with FV siRNA libraries have the potential to greatly simplify validation of gene function and significantly impact the molecular dissection of human disease mechanisms. These reagents harbor considerable promise to identify new targets for therapeutic intervention, and the development of increasingly relevant paradigms for drug discovery. As a result, we foresee that these toolsets will significantly improve the efficiency, economy, and ease of performing HT RNAi screens, and will provide basic researchers with preferred, cost-effective alternatives to existing commercially available reagents. The ultimate goal of the proposed project is to develop and make commercially available new, powerful research bioinformatics tools: a database of functionally validated, genome-wide human and mouse shRNAs and algorithms for prediction of functional shRNAs. We propose to apply these tools to develop genome-wide functionally validated siRNA libraries designed for high-throughput discovery of novel drug targets. The developed bioinformatics tools and technologies will significantly improve the efficiency of translational research related to molecular dissection of diverse human disease mechanisms, development of new pharmaceuticals, and therefore, have major implications for improving drug discovery research.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prescription dispensing errors at a pharmacy are a problem on a national level, at a rate of about 4 errors per day in a pharmacy filling 250 prescriptions daily. This translates to a gigantic amount of 51 million prescription errors per year with about 3 billion prescriptions being filled. There are as many as 7,000 deaths reported annually in the United States from incorrect prescriptions. To address this problem, Centice proposes to develop a fast, accurate and affordable system for spectroscopically identifying and verifying prescription medicines at the point of sale (heretofore referred to as the Prescription Verification System, or \"PVS\"). Currently, verification is performed manually by way of visual inspection. The pharmacist opens the prescription vial and examines the appearance of the pills. If the pills in the vial appear to visually match those in a reference photograph, the medicine is considered to be verified. There are serious adverse consequences with this current practice such as: Excessive cost of manual verification, High false positive rate due to human error, and Ineffective against counterfeit drugs. The PVS will utilize a new generation of Raman spectroscopic sensor based on multimodal multiplex spectroscopy. The key technology objectives are to develop and optimize the sensor technology required to make the chemical identifications within the parameters allowed by this demanding commercial application. Some of the challenges include identifying the different dosage levels of a prescription drug, reducing the background fluorescence in some drugs. The PVS system has the potential to lower the cost of delivering prescription medicines to consumers as well as improving the efficacy of patient care by reducing human errors and catching dangerous counterfeit medicines at the point of sale.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Centice Corporation has developed a powerful, integrated approach to portable, yet sensitive, spectroscopic detection. Combined with novel optical detection tags based on surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), these two components can be synergized to create a highly multiplexed, handheld, diagnostic immunoassay system. In this grant proposal, as just one illustration of a multiplexed and quantitative rapid test platform, we focus on development of a novel lateral-flow based cardiac immunoassay system. Centice Corporation's multimodal multiplex Raman spectroscopy engine has successfully been applied to benchtop pharmaceutical QA solutions, offering enhanced spectral resolution with unrivaled sensitivity. Traditional spectrometers sacrifice sensitivity for spectral resolution and are not amenable to miniaturization. However, Centice's unique spectroscopic engine, which decouples spectral resolution from optical throughput, offers a technology that can be readily reduced to a handheld form factor and is thus adaptable to portable, point-of-care diagnostic applications. This unique Raman spectroscopy engine is ideally suited to exploit the many features of SERS nanoparticles from Oxonica, Inc. These glass-coated metal nanoparticles loaded with Raman reporter molecules have extraordinary attributes that make them ideal as biological detection tags. For instance, SERS nanotags are highly multiplexable based on excitation from a single laser wavelength, an important consideration for portable diagnostic instrumentation. Indeed, spectral multiplexing avoids the large footprint associated with spatial multiplexing. In general, SERS nanotags are of great benefit to the point-of-care market, since they can be leveraged in a variety of assay systems to create highly sensitive, multiplexed detection of a variety of biological targets. In this grant, a complete handheld, multiplexed, lateral flow immunoassay system for cardiac biomarkers will be developed. Oxonica Inc will leverage its experience in SERS nanotag manufacture and assay development with Centice's expertise in novel Raman spectrometer design and manufacturing, to create a unique diagnostic point-of-care system.        There is an urgent need for easy-to-use, rapid, and cost-effective medical diagnostics for public health clinics, field and point-of-care sites. Centice, Inc. and Oxonica, Inc. plan to jointly develop a novel immunoassay technology platform that can meet the needs of the point-of-care diagnostic market. The development of a handheld reader and associated SERS nanotags open up the capability of significant multiplexing of diagnostic tests in the doctor's office, thus saving costs, speeding diagnosis, and leading to prompt treatment without the long wait for broad spectrum, expensive testing in large clinical laboratories.",

Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has begun to make a significant impact in diagnosis and treatment of these conditions. It has been used in lesion visualization, stent placement and stent monitoring, and has advantages over other modalities in that it is capable of distinguishing various tissue types. A number of visualization methods such as elastography and RF analysis have advanced IVUS, though these require a large bandwidth transducer. Many existing transducers do not have adequate performance, and require acoustic mirrors or are not directed in a way that provides the most clinical significance. In Phase I, TRS Technologies and Penn State University developed a micromachining method to create composite piezoelectrics using single crystals. This PMN-PT material has a very high electromechanical coupling coefficient (k33 > 90%) which provides ultrasound transducers with an inherently wide bandwidth. In the Phase I program, a single element transducer was constructed that exhibited 80% bandwidth with one acoustic matching layer, which is significantly higher than current commercial IVUS transducers. For the Phase II program, TRS proposes to build on these results by constructing an IVUS segmented annular array with broad bandwidth for use in interventional cardiology. This device would provide a three dimensional representation of the arteries, and a forward looking architecture.

        "abstract": "The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop a novel approach for fabrication of ceramic membranes that would provide a significant reduction in fabrication costs.  Membrane filtration is becoming an important process for drinking water treatment.  Much of this growth is due to development of low-cost polymeric membranes that can compete economically with traditional methods of water treatment.  Ceramic membranes can be used to achieve the same level of water quality as provided by polymeric membranes, with several distinct advantages:  ceramic membranes provide higher fluxes, reduced fouling rates, and longer lifetimes with fewer integrity issues.  Historically, ceramic membranes have not been competitive with traditional methods or polymeric membranes due to high manufacturing costs.  Recent developments that offset the high manufacturing costs have allowed ceramics to be competitive with polymerics in some markets.  By developing the proposed innovation, ceramic membrane module cost will be further reduced, giving ceramics\nan advantage over currently employed polymeric membranes.  Increased membrane usage in water treatment will lead to safer drinking water for the 90% of Americans that receive their water from community water systems.  For the water systems that employ ceramic membranes, there will be less cost, maintenance, and concerns of system integrity failures.  Additionally, the technology developed in this program would be applicable to ceramic microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes for all food, beverage, chemicals, pharmaceutical, energy, wastewater, and water applications.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent scientific investigations have shown that many chemicals used in plastics, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, cosmetics, food additives, etc., are endocrine disruptors (EDs). EDs interfere in various ways with hormones such as estrogens to have significant adverse effects on many behavioral and physiological processes. ED effects (e.g. estrogenic or anti-estrogenic) sometimes occur at very low (picomolar to nanomolar) concentrations, especially on fetal or developing mammals (including humans). The prevalence and actions of EDs in our environment warrant the development of valid assay methods. Consequently, various governmental bodies (e.g., EPA, FDA, and ICCVAM) and proactive corporations have explicitly expressed a desire to have in vitro robotic assays for EDs, such as anti-estrogenic activity (anti-EA). However, no robotic anti-EA assay is commercially available. To begin to meet these governmental, scientific and commercial needs, CertiChem (CCi) has completed a Phase I SBIR grant showing that it is feasible to develop an anti- EA robotic assay that would be valid (i.e., reliable, accurate, versatile, rapid, and cost effective) using MCF-7 cells. In this Phase II application, CCi now proposes to develop this robotic assay for anti-EA for commercialization by repeatedly assaying a set of 78 reference test chemicals to confirm the reliability and accuracy of CCi's proposed anti- EA assay. CCi also proposes to demonstrate the versatility of this assay by examining the anti-EA in a set of antioxidants used in foodstuffs and plastics. Finally, CCi proposes to perform HPLC separation assays on some reference test chemicals to confirm that their anti-EA is not due to contamination and to enhance the versatility of this assay for commercial use. Development of a robotic screening assay for anti-EA is commercially, scientifically, and socially important because of the large number of chemicals (>10,000) - much less chemical mixtures - that should now be screened for anti-EA by profit, non-profit, or governmental entities. Development of a robotic assay for anti-EA is desired as part of the mission of NIEHS, EPA and ICCVAM. Recent scientific investigations have shown that many (perhaps over 10,000) chemicals used in common products such as plastics, pesticides, cosmetics, and food additives have estrogenic/anti-estrogenic activities that severely interfere with normal estrogen actions to produce adverse effects on many behavioral, reproductive, and physiological processes in humans. In this Phase II proposal, CertiChem (CCi) proposes to develop a very sensitive and accurate assay to measure anti-estrogenic activity in a set of reference test chemicals and in common consumer products. CCi proposes to use these data and CCi's data on estrogenic activity on many chemicals to identify which chemicals have anti-estrogenic activity and to work with various firms to design consumer products that are free of chemicals that release anti-estrogenic or estrogenic activities.",

This project will further advance and demonstrate the low-temperature technology by producing: a novel research-grade reactor with four special components: a RF plasma source for vertical alignment of free-standing VACNT/VACNF, a pulsed RF power source with tunable frequency in the GHz range for inductive heating of catalytic nanoparticles,.a nonconducting substrate to eliminate substrate Joule heating; and a system for active cooling of the substrate.  The broader impacts anticipated from the proposed low-temperature synthesis approach will result in a novel research-grade reactor and a multiscale simulator for a direct, low-temperature synthesis of VACNTs at pre-selected locations on the surfaces of\ntemperature-sensitive materials.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Retinal vascular leakage or breakdown of the blood-retina barrier (BRB) is an early feature of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and can lead to diabetic macular edema (DME), which is the single greatest cause of vision loss in diabetic patients. Currently, there is no effective drug treatment for DME. Although the pathogenesis of DR is uncertain, over-expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is believed to play a critical role in DME. Targeting VEGF or the VEGF signaling is believed to be a most promising strategy for pharmacological interventions of DME. Therefore, searching for and developing new drugs to block retinal vascular leakage via targeting VEGF or the VEGF receptor (VEGFR) have become a major incentive and research effort for the treatment of DME. Thalidomide and some of its existing analogs have displayed anti-angiogenic activities and have been used for the treatment of several inflammatory diseases and cancer. The application of thalidomide and its existing analogs in the treatment of retinal neovascular disorders is limited due to their weak anti-angiogenic activities. Recently, we have designed and synthesized a series of novel thalidomide analogs. In the Phase I studies, the in vitro assays have shown that three of these analogs, Compounds 1, 2 and 4, have potent anti-angiogenic activities. Moreover, these analogs block the expression of retinal vascular permeability factors, VEGF and hypoxia induced factor-1a (HIF-1a), a major transcription factor up-regulating VEGF expression in diabetic retina. We have evaluated the efficacies of these compounds on retinal vascular leakage and retinal neovascularization (NV) in two independent DR models. The results showed that Compound 4 has significantly more potent effects on reducing retinal vascular leakage when compared with thalidomide and the other two compounds. Based on these results, we hypothesize that Compound 4 is a promising drug candidate for the treatment of DME. The goal of this project is to develop a novel, more effective, less toxic thalidomide analog for clinical trials to treat DR and commercialization. In this Phase II project, we will further investigate its long-term efficacy, pharmacokinetics, toxicities and molecular mechanisms of action, to obtain essential data for FDA approval and commercialization of this new compound. This project has potential to develop a novel drug for treatment of DME. These Phase II studies represent an essential step in developing a new drug.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II application seeks to develop TEACH (Training to Enable & Achieve Culturally Sensitive Healthcare), a low-cost desktop-computer-based product for training culturally sensitive healthcare delivery. TEACH will serve patients from the African-American (and later other ethnic) communities confronting malignancy, as well as the clinicians who treat these patients. TEACH is based on a virtual environment that gives providers a non-threatening but realistic opportunity to practice cultural skills in a controlled manner, guided by well-validated precepts derived from studies of patients' socio-cultural context and expectations. TEACH is innovative in that it utilizes several lines of research in technologies and methods in the rapidly evolving domains of social simulation, cognitive modeling, virtual environments, and intelligent tutoring. Those lines of research are connected with emerging but currently manual methods for assessment and treatment, in the prototype for Phase II, of the African-American breast cancer patient (AABCP). When completed, this research will create a low-cost, easily-distributed, and replicable method for training in cultural competency. In addition, the technology developed here will be directly applicable to treatment of other social groups and disorders. In Phase II, focus group studies and validation studies of the efficacy of the TEACH system, both pre- and post-exposure, form the evaluative core. Data from these empirical feasibility assessment procedures will also be used to refine the TEACH Phase II design and build toward Phase III to create a fully-functional TEACH product that can be directly productized according to our commercialization plan, and whose clinical efficacy can be assessed in a formal Phase II assessment of TEACH to quantify its value to both patients and clinicians. The commercial potential for TEACH arises in large part from the increasing awareness of key distinctive aspects of the care of the AABCP, wherein both biological and socio-cultural factors impinge on our ability to furnish optimal care to a deserving population. This effort will produce a computer-based, game-like product that will provide trainees in house staff programs, including medical and surgical oncology fellows, with a realistic simulation experience of caring for African-American breast cancer patients (AABCP). Stress will be placed particularly on issues of cultural competency. The product will enable users, be they trainee or graduate physicians and other clinicians, to interact with game characters that provide the opportunity to enhance empathic understanding of the lived experience of illness from malignancy, as felt by patients in minority populations. When completed, the research will create a low-cost, easily-distributed and easily-replicated method for assessment and adjunctive management of AABCP.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the technology for reliably manufacturing low attenuation, ultrahigh bandwidth, graded-index, perfluorinated polymer optical fibers (GI-POF) by a low cost continuous extrusion process. Currently there is an unmet need for an easy-to-use, rugged medium that allows the migration of data communications to speeds of 10 Gigabits per second, and beyond, in rapidly growing applications such as data centers, supercomputing and consumer electronics. This project will result in a production quality process for manufacturing plastic fibers having bandwidth equal to the best multimode glass fibers, but with a simple plug-and-clamp installation process, and tolerance of bend radii fivefold tighter than that allowed by glass fibers. The project will address three areas to develop the technology into commercially viable products: 1) Advanced extrusion process development to greatly improve fiber bandwidth distribution and attenuation, while doubling production speed; 2) Investigation to prove-in new\npolymers that can increase the fiber operating temperature up to 85 deg C; 3) Investigation and development of a unique, readily manufactured multi-core fiber design that can offer customers almost unlimited bandwidth, as well as greatly improved attenuation in tight bends.  If successful the production technologies developed in this project will result in the possible recapturing of American leadership in POF manufacturing while stimulating American-based production of the manufacturing capital equipment used in this industry. Similarly, American companies using POF to develop next-generation short-distance communication systems will also benefit, as they will enjoy better access to information and custom products based on GI-POF. The results of this project will help improve the ecosystem for many areas of datacom manufacturing in the US. Also, by enabling a product that makes installation of high-bandwidth cabling much simpler and less expensive, the Phase II project will be of considerable benefit to schools, hospitals, and other institutions which have many needs for high-bandwidth communication, but often do not have large budgets to support such systems. The scientific benefits of the Phase II project are likely to be the simplified and lower-cost construction of massively parallel computing facilities, and increased commercial interest in chemical synthesis techniques for amorphous fluoropolymers and their precursor chemicals.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROBLEM: There are currently over seven million Americans living with dementia and most of them are cared for at home by a loved one. The negative impact of caregiving for someone with dementia has been well documented; caregivers' physical and mental health often declines as they struggle to care for their loved ones. SOLUTION: In response to the National Institute on Aging PA-06-049 (previously PA-04-064), we propose to further develop and evaluate a unique online intervention for informal (unpaid) caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Research has proven that psychoeducational interventions are effective in reducing caregiver stress, depression, and burden; the dynamic nature of the Internet is an ideal way to deliver such an intervention. This project will utilize our expertise in Internet technology, web usability, geriatrics, and health promotion to complete Phase II development of an innovative website for dementia caregivers. APPROACH: The prototype website was developed in Phase I and is available online at DementiaCareCentral.com. When completed, the site will provide dementia caregivers with online, interactive education and care management tools in the form of tailored content, skill-building activities, decision-support tools, peer support, and resources. It will be a centralized, organized, interactive resource unlike any other that currently exists for dementia caregivers. In Phase I we conducted a needs analysis with caregivers and geriatric health professionals and developed the interface and content of the DementiaCareCentral prototype. We also conducted two rounds of usability testing with caregivers to evaluate the website design and content, and developed the assessment instruments to be used in Phase II. In Phase II we will further expand the website content, develop programming needed to enable all interactive tools and features, and test and finalize the website interface design. We will conduct a six-month randomized controlled evaluation with informal dementia caregivers to measure the impact of the website on knowledge, self-efficacy, depression, and caregiver burden. Qualitative feedback and website usage data will also be obtained. BENEFIT: Educating caregivers about dementia and providing tips and tools to assist with caregiving should ultimately improve outcomes for both informal caregivers and their loved ones, including improved quality of caregiver-care recipient interactions, caregiver health and mental health, and care recipient long-term care placement and health status. The website DementiaCareCentral.com is designed to provide education and tips about dementia and caregiving. More specifically, it will help informal (unpaid) dementia caregivers: determine what educational content is best suited to their needs; identify and track symptoms of dementia in their loved ones; make educated decisions about health, caregiving, financial, legal, living and options; learn how to perform practical care skills; locate peer support from and communicate with other caregivers via an expanded social network; identify useful local and national resources. In the long term we expect that DementiaCareCentral.com will improve caregiver knowledge and self-efficacy and decrease caregiver burden and depression, ultimately leading to improved outcomes for both caregivers and their loved ones.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a devastating inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system (CNS). Currently, there are no effective treatments for Primary Progressive forms of MS (PP-MS) and more than half of Relapsing Remitting forms of MS (RR-MS) fail to respond to existing therapies generating a critically unmet medical need. The ultimate goal of this study is to develop a novel therapeutic drug for MS that interferes with the major inflammatory pathways and provides neuroprotection. Our phase I study established proof-of-principle with Cognosci's innovative anti- inflammatory/neuroprotective ApoE-mimetic peptides that significantly ameliorated disease severity, promoted functional recovery, decreased histopathological signs of disease, and reduced the relapse rate in two experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models of MS, even when administered after the onset of disease. We EXCEEDED our aims by identifying a new, more potent analog, COG112, which resulted in nearly 100% remission rate in EAE. This Phase II proposal will capitalize on the success of our previous work to examine the mechanism and relative efficacy of three more potent and more drug-like COG compounds in established models of MS. In specific aims 1 and 2, we will identify the optimal candidate from the three COG compounds in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)- and proteolipid protein (PLP)-induced EAE models mimicking the PP-MS and RR-MS forms of human MS, respectively. In specific aim 3, we will decipher the molecular and pharmacological mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of COG compounds in the following aspects: 1) if COG compounds can shift Th1 response to Th2 in EAE model; 2) how COG compounds affect the function of antigen-presenting cells; and 3) how COG compounds modulate the phosphorylation of MAP kinase JNK, p38 and transcription factor NF-?B. The data generated by this proposal will enable us to select a lead candidate for the treatment of MS. After the project is completed, this lead will be progressed through the safety pharmacology required by the FDA for submission of an IND application. The completion of the project will also deepen our understanding of the disease and confirm that we have identified a novel therapeutic target for MS. Considering the early age of onset, size of the patient population, debilitating nature of this disease, and the startling healthcare costs, the current project to develop a novel therapy for MS has significant personal, social, and economic benefit to MS patients and their families.",

This developed process will permit hundreds of conceptual and preliminary design trade studies to be performed in a matter of only a few days rather than several months. This shorter time is made possible by replacing or reducing currently required experienced analyst interaction (man in the loop) with predefined knowledge based sizing templates for laminate strength and producibility optimization. Innovative virtual structural component definitions that 'float' between automatic HyperSizer to FEA iteration cycles redefine acreage surfaces areas while simultaneously including connecting bonded/bolted joints. The resulting capability will be an open architecture built within the HyperSizerREG commercial software suitable for internally integrating NASA or industry developed specialty discipline analysis codes and externally integrating HyperSizer with NASA larger design systems. This new capability will be unique in that no other commercial or non-commercial tool will have the same level of depth, breadth, accuracy, speed, verification & validation, and software robustness for performing weight prediction and reduction, structural integrity margins-of-safety reporting, and reliability prediction and improvement.",

        "abstract": "A power supply concept capable of operation over 25:1 and 64:1 impedance ranges at full power has been successfully demonstrated in our Phase I effort at efficiencies of 96% and above.  The benefits of electric propulsion systems are highest when an electric thruster can be operated at high efficiencies over wide ranges of thrust and specific impulse.  Hall and ion thruster technologists are close to demonstrating this capability with laboratory and flight model thrusters, and power conversion systems based on the power supply concept demonstrated in our Phase I program will enable wide-ranging operation of these devices.  Although ambitious missions with extreme throttling capabilities would now be possible with the CPE wide ranging power supply (WRPS) design, less ambitious (single throttle point) missions are also well served.  This is because one power supply design could meet the needs of many different single-throttle-point devices without the need to re-design and re-qualify hardware.  We judge that this innovation will save NASA, DoD, and commercial aerospace entities precious non-recurring engineering resources without sacrificing performance.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Columbus NanoWorks (CNW) proposes research leading to the commercialization of custom magnetic nanoparticle reagents for the detection of cancer cells from various sources such as bone marrow and peripheral blood\n. Cell separation is becoming increasingly commonplace for researchers and clinicians who isolate rare cells from complex cell populations to understand how cells function in different environments or to diagnose disease occurrence, recurrence or progressi\non. Complex mixtures and searches for small variations in cell samples require new techniques that provide exquisite sensitivity with high throughput; therefore, advances in cell separation technology must allow the researcher to find low percentage cells \nof interest, as well as purify them to allow for accurate assessment of biological relevance. In Phase I research CNW demonstrated the manufacture of magnetic nanoparticles that were uniform in size within a range of 50 to 70nm, had a ligand density of 2 t\no 5 ug/ml Fe particles and elicited a magnetophoretic mobility of immunomagnetically labeled cells an order of magnitude greater than commercially available magnetic reagents. The aforementioned criteria defining magnetic particles achieved in the Phase I \napplication, allowed the enrichment of 1 tumor cell in 107 total cells with an average recovery of 74.1% of spiked tumor samples, as well as an average 3.21 log10 depletion of contaminating cells in the flow-through magnetic sorter known as the Quadrupole \nMagnetic Sorter (QMS). Phase II research thus calls for the design and commercialization of magnetic reagent kits specific for QMS applications involving cancer cell enrichment. CNW will (1) scale up processing efforts to obtain a 50 fold increase over cur\nrent process techniques; (2) establish procedures and practices which assure consistent control of nanoparticle size and magnetic properties; (3) develop protocols for CNW cell enrichment kits for use in the commercial magnetic flow sorter, QMS; and (4) be\nta testing of protocols using breast cancer patients and head and neck cancer patients. The proposed Phase II end items are customized magnetic reagent kits specific for the QMS system that will allow the enrichment of cancer cells from various blood sourc\nes such as bone marrow and peripheral blood. Specifications of the particles will provide a greater than 70% recovery of desired cells, as well as a 4 log10depletion of contaminating cells. The resultant enriched fraction using CNW nanoparticles in the QMS\n system will provide a quality-purified product for further downstream processing and subsequent molecular analysis. The goal is for CNW customized reagents to become an integral part of gold standard testing in the current pathology repertoire. Columbus N\nanoWorks is a magnetic nanoparticle reagent company that provides reagents for magnetic cell separation. In this application we will develop magnetic reagent kits as commercial reagents for the Quadrupole Magnetic Sorter (QMS) system. In the past, commerci\nal magnetic nanoparticles used in the QMS system have provided sub-par results with respect to purity and recovery of desired cells. Columbus NanoWorks demonstrated in their Phase I application that reagents custom designed for the QMS were able to achieve\n an average 3.21 log10 depletion of contaminating cells as well as an average recovery of 74.1% of tumor cells from control samples. We believe that CNW's custom reagent kits for the QMS system will provide more predictable, reproducible results from sampl\ne to sample.",

The inert membrane withstands harsh thermal and chemical environments and in-line systems remove water in real time. Phase I was very successful both technically and commercially. Using commercial products, we demonstrated rapid 90% removal of water (program goal of 50%) and showed water removal dramatically reduced deleterious acid formation.

        "abstract": "Distillation is a major chemical unit operation and consumer of significant energy.  Often, water or some other intermediate boiling component can become trapped within the distillation column and accumulate.  This causes various operating difficulties such as flooding, slugging, cycling, instability, and off-spec product.  This project will develop a chemically-resistant, non-porous, water-venting membrane technology to improve distillation operating efficiency in systems that are prone to water trapping.  In Phase I, chemically and thermally resistant membrane modules were fabricated and used to separate water from target distillation products.  The membrane process was modeled and simulated, and an economic analysis was performed to quantify the economic and energy value of eliminating the trapped water.  Phase II will demonstrate that the technology:  (1) can be used to significantly reduce the concentration of water in a specific process when water trapping is occurring; (2) has the necessary mechanical strength and chemical resistance to provide stable performance over extended periods of exposure to process materials at the process temperature and pressure; and (3) will provide economic benefits in comparison to other available techniques.   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Water is a ubiquitous substance and is a common cause of component trapping problems in distillation columns.  The membrane technology should enhance the distillation process in many situations when distillation trapping is a major problem.  The membrane technology should have additional value in other distillation applications where removal of water is difficult (e.g., azeotropes).",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In Phase I we exceeded all key objectives. We demonstrated in both pervaporation and vapor separation the combination of high membrane permeation and high membrane separation when evaluating isopropyl alcohol (IPA)-Water separation. Membrane stability, which had been concern of reviewers, was shown to be excellent and far superior to other commercial membranes. CMS membranes were shown to be stable up to 130'C and over the whole compositional operating range. Economic evaluations showed the CMS membranes to have in excess of 80% capital savings compared to existing drying processes. In addition to work on IPA-water, two other pharmaceutical solvents were successfully evaluated. Leaching studies have shown the CMS membranes to be stable. Based on results and commercialization analysis the CMS system is seen as a platform technology. Significant opportunities exist in pharmaceutical solvent recovery enhancing chemical reactions, chemical industry solvent recovery, manufacture of fuel grade ethanol and stabilizing industrial esters. With many opportunities, a large number of industrial and pharmaceutical companies as well as leading researchers have committed to actively participate in this program. This participation will enhance overall chances for commercialization. In Phase II we will first fabricate high flux composite membrane modules. Then we would focus our demonstration on IPA-water systems operating in pervaporation (PV) mode. Focus will be on PV since this is the simplest system for the end user. Once successful basic data on IPA-water in PV is obtained we will expand the evaluation to other pharmaceutical solvents and also evaluating membranes in the vapor separation mode. Additional upgrades will include modeling and system design to enhance overall purification; long term testing plus extended solvent leaching tests; develop enhanced membrane modules using commercial hollow fiber supports; building large skid for field testing and expanding our economic evaluation to show superior performance to alternative drying routes. Throughout this Phase II we will work closely with our industrial partners. This program develops a low cost, simple, process to recover pharmaceutical solvents. This will encourage solvent reuse which is environmentally attractive and cost effective. The process will also keep potential biological contaminants out of the environment.",

At present, there exist no protocols and instruments that are practical for clinical use on a daily basis to assess the benefit of cochlear implants (CIs). The need for such protocols and instruments is increased by the recent advent of bilateral CIs, since the assessment of binaural benefits is time consuming and requires special testing facilities. The primary purpose of the Phase II research is to complete the development, validation, implementation, and norming of a practical assessment protocol and instrument that can quickly provide a standardized outcome assessment of patients with either monolateral or bilateral CIs in the clinician's office, without the need for a sound room or other audiological instrumentation. The protocol will be implemented in a prototype, computerized instrument to be developed during Phase II. A primary focus will be on binaural assessment of patients with bilateral CIs of all types; however, an assessment protocol for monolateral implants of all types will also be developed. The prototype instrument will allow the assessment protocol to be performed either in the sound field with loudspeakers (SF tests) or by direct connection (DC tests) of the instrument's outputs to the auxiliary input(s) of the patient's CI(s). When used for direct-connect testing, the computerized instrument will preprocess the outputs to create monoaurally or binaurally appropriate test signals for each outcome measure. The instrument will be designed to interface with all commercially available CI processors and will utilize novel digital signal processing techniques to create the test signals. The proposed instrument will have a significant impact in the CI field because it will enable the practice of evidence-based medicine in selecting CI candidates and following the outcome of cochlear implantation.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain accounts for almost 80% of all of the office visits to physicians each year (National Center for Health Statistics, 1986; Stucky, Gold, & Zhang, 2001; Winterowd, Beck, & Greuner, 2003) and is a major source of disability, accounting for upwards of 700 million lost work days and $100 billion in health care costs per year (Report of the Commission on Evaluation of Pain, 1986). In addition to physical morbidity and cost issues, psychological symptoms and lowered quality of life are frequent concomitants of chronic pain (Dworkin, Nagasako, Hetzel, & Farrar, 2001; McBeth, Macfarlane, & Silman, 2002). Precise prevalence figures for clinical pain disorders are not available, as different surveys have yielded estimates varying from 7% (Bowsher, Rigge, & Sopp, 1991) to 40% (Brattberg, Thorslund, & Wikman, 1989). Estimates vary by type of pain, ranging from 8% to 45% for low back pain (Girolamo, 1991) and from 2% to 50% for headaches (Stewart, Shechter, & Rasmussen, 1994) and differ even according to the definition of pain, ranging from 3% to 37% (e.g., Von Korff, Deworkin, & Le Resche, 1990). However, a conservative estimate would place the number of Americans with a lingering pain problem at approximately 80 million (National Research Council, 2001; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1996). Despite the enormity of this public health problem, many individuals with chronic pain find it difficult to obtain treatment due to rising health care costs, increasing demand, and a reduction in the availability of multidisciplinary pain programs. Thus, there is a great need for alternative forms of care. The goal of the proposed project is the development of one such alternative, the Pain Self- Management Program (PSMP), a web-based psychoeducational self-help system for adults with chronic pain. The program is based on fundamental cognitive-behavioral principles that have been effectively applied in clinical practice, group interventions, and self-help books. The goal of Phase II is the final development and efficacy testing of the PSMP, which will consist of seven modules, including Program Overview, Understanding Chronic Pain, Profile of Chronic Pain Self-Assessment, Results, and Recommendations, and four Self-Management Modules. In addition, a number of interactive tools will be available for use across the Self-Management Modules. Specific Phase II tasks include final content development and review by several expert groups and software development. Following final beta testing and revision, the efficacy of the PSMP will be examined in a longitudinal study. Approximately 80 million people in the United States suffer from chronic pain. Due to the high costs of health care, increased demand for services, and dwindling access to multidisciplinary treatment programs, the need for alternative, cost-effective interventions is great. The purpose of the proposed project is the development of one such alternative, the Pain Self-Management Program (PSMP), a web-based psychoeducational self-help system for adults with chronic pain. The program is based on fundamental cognitive-behavioral principles that have been effectively applied in clinical practice, group interventions, and self-help books.

Medication compliance monitoring is critical in pharmaceutical clinical trials, geriatrics, and mental health /addiction medicine. The only proven method for accurately determining medication compliance is directly observed therapy where personnel are present during ingestion by the patient. This technique is labor intensive, but effective. In vivo biotelemetry and monitoring is a rapidly growing field that may provide the next critical breakthrough in medical monitoring. This research will focus on the development of these two solutions, namely a UHF resorbable antenna printed on the outside of an existing capsule or pill with or without a chip designed to improve signal to noise ratio and provide ID capability. The antennas will be printed with standard ink-jet technology. A handheld RF communication device will sense the presence of the pill in the GI tract and positively confirm that the medication regimen\nwas followed appropriately.  Electronic pill technology and R&D will help expand the rapidly growing field of in vivo telemetry. The development of biodegradable low power miniature circuits will be an important step to future bio-implantable chips and sensors. Additionally, the field of medication compliance is tremendously important in many areas of medicine. In particular, better compliance monitoring can greatly reduce the costs associated with FDA approval of pharmaceuticals as well as provide dramatically improved data for accurate determination of low probability side effects.",

Millions of ophthalmic procedures are performed annually, most incorporating sutures to close and seal wounds. Yet this method can cause severe complications, can weaken the integrity of the eye and may pose a risk for ocular rupture in the case of blunt trauma. Other techniques to close wounds, including the use of tissue glues or grafting, can be even more problematic. Phase I studies were conducted to measure the biostability of solder formulations, evaluate tissue bonding strategies and compare wound stability as a function of intrachamber pressure in four in vitro models of clinical corneal surgery: radial keratotomy, LASIK flaps, penetrating keratoplasty and cataract excision. The results confirmed that the laser solder approach is superior to standard sutures with no evidence of tissue shrinkage. The strength of the soldered repair was dependent upon reaching a precise temperature set by choice of laser, solder composition and film thickness. Solder biostability is increased by reaction with a standard cross linking reagent. The specific aim for Phase II is to optimize solder processing, laser techniques and surgical outcome in survivor animal surgical models. Task descriptions include preparation of sterile solder under stringent process controls, design and assembly of a compact preclinical laser systems, optimization of a laser hand piece and perform ex vivo and in vivo experiments on a lapine model. Surgical endpoints will include the quality of the wound seal, the extent, if any, of collateral thermal tissue damage, solder stability and biocompatibility. The current methods for closing ocular incisions, similar to other body tissue, require placing sutures to bring tissue edges in apposition. The presence of sutures in the cornea leads to patient discomfort, visual distortions, risk for bacterial proliferation and keratitis. The use of a biological tissue adhesive, with sufficient sealing properties to resist sudden changes in intraocular pressure for a prolonged time, may be of great benefit for the synthesis of corneal wounds, caused either by trauma or induced by surgery.",

        "abstract": "An important aquaculture industry is developing in the Great Lakes region for yellow perch (Perca\nflavescens). The primary problem constraining the expansion of this industry is the high cost of fingerlings,\nwhich represents more than 35% of total operating costs for growout producers. Yellow perch normally\nspawn only once each year and fingerling ponds are only used for 6-8 weeks in the spring to produce one\ncrop of fingerlings annually. The overall objective of our proposed research is to double the productivity of\nyellow perch fingerling ponds by developing a reliable method to spawn yellow perch out-of-season in the\nsummer, thereby allowing for the production of two crops of pond-reared fingerlings per year. This SBIR\nproject is expanding on previous studies funded by NSF and the North Central Regional Aquaculture Center.\nIn Phase I we demonstrated the feasibility of inducing mid-summer, out-of-season spawning using\nphotothemal phase shifting. In Phase II we will conduct out-of-season spawning on a commercial scale,\nevaluate an alternative out-of-season spawning method, and test different mid-summer fry production\ntechniques.",

        "abstract": "Illnesses due to waterborne pathogens are a substantial health risk, as seen in the E. coli O157:H7 outbreaks of 2006 that were traced to fecal contamination of fresh produce irrigation water. Additionally, there is the possibility of deliberate contamination of our water, and hence our food supply, by terrorists. However, water samples are not analyzed directly and rapidly, because sample matrices are too dirty, and because the concentration level of pathogens of interest are usually too low.\nIn Phase I of this USDA SBIR, we demonstrated that a pathogen (E. coli O157:H7) can be concentrated and purified from large water samples for PCR, improving the sensitivity of that subsequent analysis. Two turbulent mixing techniques were evaluated to enhance the pathogen capture.\nThe objective of this Phase II SBIR is to develop a flow cell product to isolate and concentrate target pathogens from large samples or continuous flow of surface and irrigation water and prepare the DNA for real-time PCR detection.\nThe effort involves development of a pathogen concentration flow cell that can handle 10-100 milliliter sample sizes to unrestricted continuous flow. We will also develop assays to utilize the features of the flow cell.\nAnticipated results are flow cells that can process water sample for DNA testing of pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella in 1-2 hours.\nFurther development can expand the number of waterborne pathogens and expand the application to testing of food, drinking water, recreational water, reclaimed water, and to potential bioterrorism agents.",

In particular, more robust and flexible process control technologies must be developed in order to build an intelligent control system that provides fully automated operation, and can adapt to changing process needs and fuel availability.  These technologies must be safe, reliable, and easy to install, maintain, and operate.  This project will design, develop, test, evaluate, benchmark, and bring to production an intelligent control system for controlling the new generation of boilers for energy plants.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of the concept using an innovative Model-Free Adaptive (MFA) control technology.  Phase II will:  (1) refine the boiler models and MFA boiler controllers, (2) enhance the MFA software to allow collaborators to test the MFA technology with their boiler models, and (3) perform on-site testing to demonstrate the ability of the MFA system to control supercritical and circulating-fluidized-bed (CFB) boilers.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  With the quality of fuels degrading, and clean fuels becoming scarce, the MFA control technology should allow conventional fuels, combustible byproducts, and waste fuels to be burnt more efficiently and hence more cleanly.  An effective automatic control system represents the simplest way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from combustion, which translates to a healthier and safer environment.",

The main objective of this project is to investigate the deployment of novel charge-recovery circuitry for the design of an ultra-low-power leading-edge commercial microcontroller core. The resulting charge-recovery core is expected to dissipate 25-30% less power than its conventional counterpart. In conventional circuit design, capacitors are switched abruptly between supply and ground, dissipating all their stored energy as heat across resistive devices. In charge recovery design, on the other hand, capacitors are switched gradually, returning any energy that remains un-dissipated back to the power supply. The significant potential of charge recovery to reduce power consumption has so far remained untapped in the commercial world, primarily due to the lack of support for such a new design style that deviates from established design practices.  The results of the proposed research\nare commercially applicable to the realization of a broad class of computer systems and consumer electronic devices that are subject to power efficiency requirements. Microcontrollers are essential elements of every System-on-Chip (SoC) and typically account for a substantial fraction of overall chip power, since they remain on most of the time. Embedded microcontrollers are key components of semiconductor chips for mobile devices such as cell phones and personal digital assistants. Generating a commercial microcontroller core with substantially reduced power consumption will lead to a broad variety of next-generation computer and communication systems with enhanced features, longer battery life, and improved performance.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Due to the rapidly increasing number of therapeutic humanized monoclonal antibodies being developed and FDA-approved, there is a clear need for improved cell line development to support recombinant therapeutic protein manufacturing. There is a current and projected shortage of worldwide GMP manufacturing capacity for these therapeutic proteins, and approaches for getting more protein from the available bioreactor capacity are deemed critical. Generation of stable high-secreting producer cell lines is a major bottleneck, requiring a 4-10 month process with no guarantee of success. Cloning of cells for high expression of a secreted product (e.g., antibody) is a particular challenge because the secreted product does not remain associated with the cell. The novel laser-enabled analysis and processing (LEAP(tm)) technology platform for high-throughput cell imaging and in situ laser-mediated cell manipulation has been used to develop the Cell Xpress(tm) application to address these market needs. Phase I results demonstrate significantly improved specific antibody secretion rates from LEAP-derived clones, along with an acceleration of the process, as compared to current methods. The goal of Phase II is to build upon Phase I success by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) expand Cell Xpress utility to an additional cell line and therapeutic (non-antibody) protein; (2) extend Cell Xpress into labor-intensive downstream operations; (3) apply Cell Xpress to bioprocess optimization and monitoring; and (4) automate and integrate the Cell Xpress process. Phase II success will result in an automated and broadened Cell Xpress application with large, near-term market potential for biopharmaceutical cell line development as both a commercial fee-for- service and product application on LEAP. In biopharmaceutical manufacturing, over $40 billion worth of therapeutic proteins are produced annually from large-scale culture of recombinant cell lines producing a secreted protein. The number of biopharmaceuticals in clinical development and being FDA approved each year is growing dramatically, resulting in a worldwide shortage of GMP manufacturing capacity for these proteins. Therefore, methods to improve cell line development, the yield of protein within the current bioreactor capacity constraints, and overall cost and efficiency of these processes are highly desirable.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomedical research continues to expand the use of detailed atomic-scale structure in developing a detailed understanding of the molecular basis for life and for disease. Tools for the identification of means for intervention at the molecular level are of paramount importance. Modern nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy continues to be a central technique in the characterization of the structure and dynamics of proteins, nucleic acids and their complexes. Nevertheless, a significant fraction of the proteins that are known through the analysis of the genomic sequence are inaccessible to standard solution NMR methods. This is often because they are too large and therefore tumble too slowly for optimal NMR performance. In addition, initial tests of a high through-put strategy for solving structures by X-ray crystallography or by standard NMR spectroscopy indicate that the vast majority of proteins will simply fail to result in appropriate samples. Clearly, ancillary approaches are going to be required to fully implement a knowledge-based approach to fundamental problems in human health and disease. This proposal seeks to continue the development of a novel approach to using an NMR-based method. The primary idea is to simply arrange for the large protein molecule to tumble as a much smaller protein. This is achieved by encapsulating the protein in a reverse micelle system and dissolving the entire assembly in a low viscosity fluid such as liquid ethane. Protein assemblies as large as 200 kDa can, in principle, be made to tumble with sufficiently short correlation times to allow the full battery of existing triple resonance techniques to be applied, even without benefit of deuteration. Furthermore, proteins that tend to aggregate or even form insoluble precipitates have been successfully encapsulated and proteins that are relatively unstable and therefore incompletely folded in vitro have been forced to fold in the confined space of the reverse micelle. Despite these successful applications, the method has not been generally adopted by the NMR community. The reasons for this are clear: The apparatus necessary for the routine and safe preparation and manipulation of the highly pressurized and flammable samples that are necessary is not commercially available. Progress during Phase I has seen the approach be largely implemented in a specialized laboratory setting and the results obtained thus far provide a tantalizing glimpse of the method's potential. This proposal seeks to refine and extend prototype apparatus and methods developed during Phase I to allow academic and non-academic structural biologists employing NMR spectroscopy to use the approach and thereby gain access to proteins that are not amenable to standard NMR methods or to crystallography. We believe that the method to be fully developed here may provide a break-out technology in a variety of important arenas in structure-based biomedical research. Biomedical research continues to expand the use of detailed atomic-scale structure in developing a detailed understanding of the molecular basis for life and for disease. Tools for the identification of means for intervention at the molecular level are of paramount importance. This proposal seeks to continue the development of a novel approach to structure determination by nuclear magnetic resonance. If successful, this technology could serve as a powerful platform for the rational design of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of an array of human diseases.",

The objective of this project is to develop agricultural mulch films from renewable materials that can be tilled into the soil after harvest and that will sufficiently degrade prior to the following growing season. This new technology will improve production of fruits and vegetables by eliminating the requirement to remove and dispose of agricultural mulch film thereby reducing costs.

The goal of the curriculum is to educate girls and boys about general and gender- specific health and safety risks associated with alcohol consumption. This innovative, gender-specific approach to alcohol prevention differentiates the MSC curriculum from other alcohol prevention tools for adolescents, and provides teachers with classroom implementation techniques, engaging and developmentally appropriate content and multimedia tools to ensure effective use of the curriculum in the classroom. Evidence strongly supports implementing alcohol prevention curricula in middle school, in particular, prevention programs that address the developmental needs of adolescents. MSC will cover the effects of alcohol on the brain and body, decision making, relationships, and risky sexual behaviors in a biologically and developmentally appropriate manner. Once developed, MSC will consist of: (1) a Teacher's Guide with gender-specific instructions and activities; (2) a video program; and (3) an interactive CD-ROM. In Phase II of the project period, formative research will be conducted, including a needs assessment with students, teachers, and experts to finalize content areas and product design. The product development period will be used to complete the Teacher's Guide, video program, and accompanying CD-ROM. Once these components are developed, we will conduct a full-scale outcome evaluation with students and teachers to determine the effectiveness of the MSC program in increasing knowledge and protective attitudes and intentions toward alcohol use. We will also examine the effectiveness of the gender-specific approach to alcohol prevention. Despite recommendations from substance abuse prevention and curriculum development experts, none of the comprehensive substance abuse education programs currently available include gender-specific information about the relationship between alcohol consumption and risky health behavior. MSC will provide this much- needed gender-specific approach to alcohol prevention, providing teachers with instructions for implementing such an approach.

In 2002, only 8.2 percent of the estimated 2.3 million youth who needed addiction treatment received it, leaving an estimated 2.1 million adolescents without assistance (SAMHSA, 2003). Overall, the field lacks research-based, manualized approaches to adolescent substance abuse that can be replicated, evaluated, disseminated, and easily integrated into existing youth treatment programs (Dennis, 2002; Riggs, 2003). Youth LIB will serve this purpose by integrating research-based approaches into a replicable, manualized psychoeducational program that can be easily integrated into existing treatment centers and will specifically meet the developmental needs of adolescents ages 13 to 18 and their families. This developmentally appropriate and culturally sensitive program will contain a facilitator's guide that will include the following sections: (1) an introduction and overview of how to use the program; (2) counselor, participant, and family materials for 12 core client sessions that include motivational engagement techniques to increase adolescent motivation for treatment and adoption of healthy behaviors; and (3) counselor, participant, and family materials for eight supplemental sessions. In Phase I, Danya developed the full content for the facilitator's guide and 12 core treatment sessions, and conducted an Advisory Panel content review and feasibility study with professional stakeholders. In Phase II, we aim to incorporate recommended changes to Youth LIB; develop and incorporate family content into the core psychoeducational sessions; develop content for eight supplemental sessions; conduct an outcome evaluation of Youth LIB to determine curriculum efficacy; and finalize the curriculum based on the results of the pilot evaluation. Given the shortage of research-based psychoeducational curricula for adolescents with substance use problems and their families, Youth LIB should contribute to public health by improving services and outcomes for these youth.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multilevel data are very common in sociological, behavioral and biomedical researches. The data could come from longitudinal community surveys, genetic family studies or spatial-temporal studies to investigate some health outcomes. Typically, the interest focuses on the impact of some treatment intervention. Such data could be very complex when there are multiple levels of data structures. The data might have factors such as community, family, patient and repeated measures over time nested or crossed in each other. For continuous response, hierarchical models such as linear mixed-effects models or latent variable models have been studied and applied. In the analysis, the major interest is to study the impact of specific cause pathway on health outcome. Since the records in each cluster are often correlated, investigator has to adjust the heterogeneity within a cluster of observations or between clusters. Overdispersion is also very common in such data. The major interest of this project is to investigate the analytic methods for continuous and discrete outcomes of the above nature. In this area, typically, people apply generalized linear mixed-effects models GLMM, marginal models or transition models to non-continuous data. The difficulties for such models such as GLMM is that estimation methods often have troubles to achieve unbiasness, consistency and efficiency. We are interested in the development of more robust methods to achieve these goals for continuous and discrete multilevel data with arbitrary dimension. The final result is a software library with flexible multilevel modeling approaches for the analysis of complex multilevel data. The software will be useful to biomedical researchers working on sociological, behavioral and biomedical studies with complex data structures. Manuscripts and course packs will be developed to assist practitioners in applying appropriate methods and the software tool to their studies.",

        "abstract": "Remote sensing of airborne chemicals from industrial or illicit emissions is greatly facilitated by looking for characteristic absorption patterns of mid-infrared (IR) light with wavelengths from 3 to 14 \u00b5m.  The DOE can use this type of remote sensing to monitor and detect effluents from nuclear fuel cycle processes, for example.  At present, there is no robust and reliable way to generate an intense beam of mid-IR light that can be tuned in wavelength to look for these absorptions.  In this project, a high power, tunable, mid-IR laser will be designed and built for use in remote sensing applications.  State-of-the-art quantum cascade laser (QCL) technology will be incorporated in a miniaturized, tunable laser cavity to provide a field-ready, mid-IR light source to enable detection of airborne chemicals.  Phase I developed materials suitable for incorporation in a miniaturized tunable laser cavity.  Tunable near-IR diode laser technologies were extended to the mid-IR to enable design and construction of a miniaturized, tunable, mid-IR laser platform.  Several prototypes were built, which demonstrated pulsed tunable mid-IR lasers.  In Phase II, the platform technology will be extended to achieve the continuous wave (CW) lasers that are necessary for remote sensing.  The laser cavity design and quantum cascade (QC) device coatings will be optimized to allow continuous tuning of the CW lasers.  CW QC devices, throughout the entire mid-IR, will be designed and developed.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Tunable, mid-IR lasers should find commercial applications related to the remote sensing of industrial emissions, stand-off detection of illicit chemicals, and medical breath diagnostics.  In addition, tunable mid-IR lasers should allow new applications in diagnostic imaging to be developed, both for medical and industrial purposes.  At present, no practical technologies are available that allow the creation of tunable IR light for commercial applications.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Develop and evaluate an evidence-based, user friendly, and culturally sensitive training module, \"Dementia Care: Sleep Behavior Disorders\" targeting formal caregivers in nursing homes and assisted living facilities as well as informal (family) caregivers providing care in the home, using DVD/Web DVD technology. AIMS: Translate current evidence based research on sleep disturbances among dementia patients into a comprehensive training module of all-inclusive strategies aimed at improving sleep for nursing home and assisted living caregivers and home based caregivers in Spanish and English versions. Evaluate the usability, cultural acceptability and workplace benefit of both English and Spanish versions of the module. Pilot test the revised module as to the ability to increase knowledge in and impact on both formal and informal caregivers. Evaluate the final product with a large and diverse population. INNOVATION: Translation research of existing research findings (not anecdotal care information) related to sleep behavior disorders of demented individuals into information that can be readily used by a caregiver. An Interactive Training Module: Sleep Behavior Disorders in a DVD/Web DVD format that provides enhanced interactivity and an ability to update training materials. This product re-creates the training program in the Spanish language and culture. OUTCOMES: Effective but inexpensive method of translating the best of dementia care research in the management of sleep behavior disorders in individuals with dementia for the formal or informal bedside caregiver. This quality training will benefit the long term care industry by relieving the burdens of existing workers, facilitating recruitment of new workers, and reducing worker attrition. Better training for coping with sleep behavior disorders extends the ability of families to care for their loved ones in the home, significantly reducing excess patient disability and caregiver stress. COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL: A Market Feasibility Study identifies 6,329,754 total institutional and/or individual buyers including, among others, the following market segments: institutional caregivers, nurses, educational institutions and the lay public. This study projects a first year market penetration rate of 1.5 percent of those markets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELAVENCE: The US government spends over $100 billion a year on AD and, as of 1996, the average lifetime cost of care was $175,000. Alzheimer's disease costs corporate America $33.16 billion a year. The business community is often unaware of its annual expenditures impacted by Alzheimer's disease, primarily because of the popular belief that the disease affects only individuals who have retired from the workforce. That misconception overlooks the millions of currently employed people caring for a family member with the disease. Alzheimer's Cost to U.S. Businesses: Caregiver absenteeism: $ 7.89 billion, Productivity loss: $13.22 billion Replacement of caregivers who leave: $3.59 billion, Continuing insurance for workers on leave and fees to temp agencies: $1.32 billion, Cost of Employee Assistance Programs: $0.0055 billion and Caregiving total: $26.0255 billion. The LightBridge Sleep Behavior Disorders Care Program: (i) improves quality of life for the Alzheimer patient and their care providers, (ii) provides less costly care for longer periods of care for families, local, state and federal agencies, and (iii) is pro-active in its outreach to minority groups such as the Hispanic population. OUTCOMES: Better training for coping with sleep behavior disorders extends the ability of families to care for their loved ones in the home, significantly reducing excess disability and caregiver stress.",

This patented optics using holography will be grafted onto a two- dimensional inspection microscope now sold into the thread spinneret manufacturing industry. This research will seek to demonstrate that the expensive holographic master used in Phase I can be inexpensively mass replicated. Optical microscopy has almost always used refractive primary objectives, and 3D versions of classical refractive microscopes exploit the methods of triangulation, confocal focus accommodation, or interferometry. Here, a new concept into the technology of optical microscopy, primary objective gratings, is introduced. We have demonstrated that if an objective grating is fabricated using holography and is then configured at grazing incidence, it can be used as 3D profilometer. The demonstration microscope will be designed with features to show that it can be sold into the electronics surface mount technology inspection industry, a\nlarger market than spinneret inspection.  This project will demonstrate the 3D capability to inspect solder paste and component insertions of sample circuit boards, and therefore will impact industrial inspection, and will provide robust field units for geology, archeology, anthropology, and paleontology. In medicine, this method has utility in endoscopy, and uses in surgery and dentistry is also foreseen. Generalized biological scientists will also be end users with the introduction of computer image processing, the availability of 3D profiles greatly expedites characterization and pattern recognition, because 3D data is immune to variations in surface shading typical of 2D image processing.",

The project is a competing continuation application that proposes to conduct pre-clinical and clinical studies on the DRW HBsAg rapid test, with the ultimate aim of meeting the requirements for pre-market approval (PMA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The pre-clinical studies will be based on FDA's \"Review criteria for assessment of HBeAg and antibody to HBeAg in vitro diagnostic devices\". Results of the pre-clinical studies will be presented to the FDA for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application that, when approved, will allow the DRW HBsAg Rapid Test to be used in clinical studies. The clinical studies aimed at a PMA submission to the FDA will be carried out at two sites in the U.S. and one site in Italy. Because of the usefulness of the DRW HBsAg rapid test for pre- and post-donation screening in resource-limited settings, additional evaluations will be conducted in India, China, Guinea and Italy.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare, autosomal recessive inherited disease caused by the absence of any of eight different proteins that regulate DNA repair. Affected individuals suffer from bone marrow failure early in life. FA can be effectively treated by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. However, most patients lack a matched related donor, and there is a marked increase in morbidity and mortality following transplant using stem cells from an unrelated source. Discovery Genomics, Inc. (DGI) is developing its Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system as a non- viral vector for gene therapy of FA. The two-component SB system consists of a transposon (inverted repeats flanking a therapeutic gene of interest) and a transposase that catalyzes excision of the transposon at the ends of the IR's and then integration into host cell chromosomal sequence. In Phase I studies, DGI demonstrated the successful loading of transposon DNA and RNA into cultured hematopoietic cells, and then correction of human lymphoblastoid cells deficient in Fanconi anemia complementation group C (FANC-C) by SB-mediated transposition. In this Phase II application, the overall goal is to provide key preclinical data that will be necessary to support the anticipated efficacy of SB-mediated gene therapy for FA. In this regard, there are two key questions that will need to be addressed; (i) What is the effectiveness of SB-mediated FANC gene insertion in the treatment of an animal model of FA? (ii) For the human trial, what is the clinically applicable methodology that will be used for introduction of FANC-encoding transposon DNA into human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC)? There are two Specific Aims: Aim 1. Evaluate Sleeping Beauty transposon-mediated integration and long-term expression of the FANC-C gene in hematopoietic stem cells of FANC-C deficient mice as a model for SB-mediated gene therapy for Fanconi anemia. Aim 2. Evaluate Sleeping Beauty transposon-mediated integration and long-term expression in human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. For both of these Aims, SB transposon DNA and transposase-encoding sequence will be introduced into HSC using Cyto Pulse electroporation technology. Results from these experiments will provide the technical basis for achieving transposon-mediated integration and long-term expression in hematopoietic stem cells, the cell population that will be targeted for FA gene therapy, and will also provide the commercial basis for growth of DGI in the development of FA gene therapy using the SB transposon system. This project describes the development of a non-viral gene transfer method for treatment of Fanconi anemia, a rare disorder of the blood, by Discovery Genomics, Inc. (DGI), a small biotech startup company. Successful treatment of Fanconi anemia using DGI's transposon system is intended to provide proof of principle for the potential application of this technology to the treatment of other disorders of the blood as well.",

This will enable advanced optoelectronic products across multiple markets, from lasers for projection television  to 100GHz integrated electro-optic modulators and switches for optical interconnects and telecommunications. For over 100 years, predominant liquid crystal molecules have been variants on simple rod shapes. This innovation exploits new dimers - a side-by-side pair of conventional rod-shaped FLC molecules connected by a pi-conjugated bridge engineered to be part of a strong NLO chromophore. It is difficult and expensive to build integrated optoelectronic devices using lithium niobate, today's dominant NLO material. Organic poled-polymer NLO materials offer significant advantages for integration, but suffer performance and stability limitations due to being thermodynamically unstable and\nnon-centrosymmetric (required to be NLO active). FLCs are intrinsically non-centrosymmetric and thermodynamically stable, offering an ideal scaffolding for creating high densities of strong, oriented, NLO chromophores. Our Phase II objectives are to develop and demonstrate prototype materials for projection television laser light sources and electro-optic modulation, and to design a product that will be used in projection television lasers.  Commercially, this SBIR Phase II project will advance the scientific and technological understanding of a new class of dimer ferroelectric liquid crystals, and will produce the first commercially significant liquid crystals not based on simple rod-shaped molecules. Consumer products will include higher image quality, lower cost, rear projection televisions and practical, bright, micro-projectors for portable electronics. Integrated electro-optic devices enabled by the NLO materials will help to expand the bandwidth of computer and telecommunication networks, and of interconnects within coming generations of faster computers.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parasitic filarial nematodes causing lymphatic filariasis and river blindness (onchocerciasis), infect over 140 million people with up to one billion at risk in at least 80 countries and territories. Lymphatic filariasis (caused by Wuchereria and Brugia species) creates an enormous health and economic burden within affected areas and is ranked as the second leading cause of long-term disability. In 2000, international groups including the World Health Organization launched an initiative to eliminate lymphatic filariasis by conducting mass drug administrations. Although the compounds available for this program (ivermectin, albendazole, diethylcarbamazine) are effective at killing larvae (microfilariae), the adult reservoir of parasites (macrofilariae) survive and can remain in the body for a decade. In addition, the extreme selective pressure of mass treatment has lead to recent signs of parasite drug resistance. Similar challenges face the campaigns to reduce onchocerciasis with ivermectin. The long-term objective of this project is to develop new compounds with 'macrofilaricidal' activity that are desperately needed to complement the current regimens. During Phase I efforts, bioinformatic filters and functional genomic (RNAi) data from the model nematode Caenorhabitis elegans and the filarial parasite Brugia malayi were utilized to successfully identify and prioritize a small set of molecular targets predicted to be critical for macrofilarial survival. In addition, as a prelude to Phase II research, compounds previously demonstrated to possess nematicidal activity at Divergence were tested against Brugia spp. in vitro, with some compounds showing promising macrofilaricidal effects. In the current research, two well-characterized and essential enzymes from a filarial nematode biosynthetic pathway will be expressed and inhibitors identified through a combination of high-throughput chemical library screening and targeted cheminformatic approaches. The best hits will be evaluated against adult B. malayi and in vitro and assayed for mammalian cytotoxicity and microsomal stability. Finally, the most promising compounds will progress into rodent model trials of lymphatic filariasis. The expected outcome of this work is the identification of lead molecules that demonstrate macrofilaricidal activity within animal models. In collaboration with agencies that have demonstrated a commitment to global health equity (such as the Gates Foundation or WHO), Phase III efforts will focus on the initiation of clinical trials in humans--with the ultimate goal of eliminating the human health burden of filarial diseases. (Relevance to public health) Parasitic nematodes (roundworms) currently infect over 1 billion people globally, causing severe morbidity and considerable economic losses. This project is structured to identify desperately needed drugs to combat filarial nematodes, which constitute the most significant of the human tropical cluster diseases. Filarial parasites cause some of the more pernicious nematode-borne diseases known (elephantiasis and river blindness).",

The ILC will use \u00bfdamping rings,\u00bf and the cost of each damping ring will depend strongly on the speed of these kickers.  This project will investigate two approaches to the development of the solid state kicker driver:  the first will utilize commercially available MOSFETs, and the second will employ Step Recovery Diode (DSRD) technology.  In Phase I, the performances of the HV MOSFET and the DSRD were compared.  Because the latter exhibited pulse lengths of 2-to3 nanoseconds, the DSRD was selected for the final stage of the pulse generator.  Measurements confirmed that HV MOSFET technology \u00bf as opposed to Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) technology \u00bf would be appropriate for generating the 25-nanosecond pump pulses that drive the pulse compression circuitry and the DSRD switch.  In Phase II, the semiconductor processing and packaging methods for the required high-current, high-voltage DSRD diode stacks will be developed.

The baseline ILC approach requires 600 large power supplies and modulators to drive a multiple beam klystron (MBK) operating at 10 MW peak, and then RF power is distributed through a complex network of waveguide components, to power multiple cavities in a parallel topology.  This project will design and assess a single cavity amplifier (SCA) that will drive each accelerating cavity in the ILC.  In Phase I, the latest RF specifications for the ILC were carefully reviewed to establish the requirements for the SCA transmitter.  Numerous microwave amplifier tubes were surveyed to select the best candidate for prototype transmitter testing in Phase II.  High voltage topologies suitable for driving the selected tube were reviewed.  It was determined that a 1.3 GHz Inductive-Output Tube (IOT) could be combined with a proven solid-state switch cathode pulsing circuit to deliver a compact, high performance transmitter.  A preliminary design for the transmitter was completed.  In Phase II, the basic design created in Phase I will be carefully detailed for construction.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oligonucleotide probes and primers are a crucial component of most diagnostic assays used for detection and quantification of genomic material. For a genomic assay to be effective, it must be both highly sensitive and simultaneously produce a low false positive rate. To meet this stringent requirement, probes and primers used in an assay must be both highly sensitive and highly specific. That is, they must have a very high probability of binding to the intended sites on the target nucleic acid (e.g., DNA or RNA), but a very low probability of binding to any other background human or contaminating nucleic acid. While some current tools incorporate advanced methods to design for sensitivity, designing for specificity typically depends on BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool), which is intended for determining sequence similarity and evolutionary relatedness. Hybridization, however, is governed by sequence dependent thermodynamics, NOT by sequence similarity. Thus, BLAST is not appropriate for the task of improving hybridization stringency. For several reasons, the BLAST algorithm fails to identify many candidates for mis-hybridization, representing potential false positives. Thus there is a need to develop an algorithm that combines the efficiency of BLAST with the thermodynamic rules for hybridization. In this Fast Track SBIR application we propose development of a new software tool, ThermoBLAST, to fill this critical technology gap. This objective will be accomplished in three specific aims (aim 1 in Phase I and aims 2 and 3 in Phase II): 1) Develop prototype ThermoBLAST code modules. 2) Integrate component modules into a single application with appropriate GUI. 3) Integrate ThermoBLAST into the automated sequence design algorithms of Visual OMP. ThermoBLAST will be integrated into our OMP (Oligonucleotide Modeling Platform) software resulting in automated design of more specific probes and primers that can be designed more quickly and more economically. ThermoBLAST will allow scientists to develop better assays, while saving time and money, and thus will positively impact the quality of life of a significant segment of humanity. ThermoBLAST will make a major positive contribution to the work of public and private researchers world wide. Scientists who are designing DNA tests to identify or discover the function of important, disease related genes will be able to 'test their tests' in a computer, without having to go through the lengthy lab testing process for each assay. The most difficult DNA-based tests are also the most important. There are very small differences between the genetic code of deadly pathogens and harmless microorganisms. ThermoBLAST will greatly improve the ability of scientists to design DNA probes that yield consistent, positive results, and avoid costly (or deadly) false negative results.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Noise-induced hearing loss remains one of the most common industrial diseases in U.S. The monetary cost of occupational hearing loss is staggering; for example, the cost to the military for compensation for hearing loss as a primary disability only is currently over $630 million per year. The non-monetary costs, in terms of social and physical disability and general quality of life, cannot be easily quantified. This proposal describes an innovative methodology that has the potential to eradicate noise-induced hearing loss from the workplace. The doseBusters USA approach to hearing loss prevention involves the continuous monitoring of personal protected noise exposure; this metric has previously been unavailable to the hearing conservationist, and it is the only quantity that is directly related to the potential of noise-induced hearing loss. Phase 1 of this project involved integrating communication capabilities into the doseBusters hardware. Phase 2 of the project expands on that concept by integrating a talk-through circuit into the dosimeter, and also strives to enhance user-acceptance with the novel integration of the hardware into a 'smart' safety cap. The safety-cap mounted personal exposure measurement system is an elegant solution to two distinct requirements: protected exposure monitoring and enhanced communication at the workplace. Since each worker downloads his noise exposure data on a daily basis, a large amount of data is generated across a typical industrial facility. Phase 2 will also include the development of a web- based database management system that will allow the system to be seamlessly integrated into the workplace without a burden on management. Finally, a six-month field trial of the new safety cap-mounted communication-capable hardware will be performed at an aluminum smelter. All field study personal exposure data will be managed by the web- based system developed in Phase 2. Despite the best efforts of US industry, workers continue to lose their hearing; the current state-of-the-art in occupational hearing conservation is based on a failed paradigm that includes monitoring and recording data that has no correlation with the potential for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The doseBusters USA methodology involves quantifying the risk for NIHL on a daily basis by measuring actual protected noise exposure. The evolution of this technology, including the addition of communication capabilities, the development of an integrated 'smart' safety cap, and the development of an elegant data management system, will enhance user- and management-acceptance.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective is to develop and market a system of three- dimensional radiation dosimetry for radiation therapy treatment quality control. Radiation therapy requires that radiation dose be applied to target sites in the body, while sparing adjacent, healthy tissue. To accomplish this, therapists make use of treatment-planning computers to predict the detailed distribution of radiation dose. There is a need for an independent measurement check on such plans to verify the actual radiation dose delivered by the plan. The potential technological innovation consists of a translucent, colorless, tissue-equivalent gel that develops a stable color in response to and in proportion to radiation dose delivered locally. In Phase I we have demonstrated such a gel, and employed our optical scanner to record the color distribution in three dimensions. We intend to develop this into a marketable product, by addressing the following Specific Aims: A. Further develop our scanning technology by improving the software for data acquisition, analysis and report presentation. B. Further develop our scanning technology by improving the hardware, especially the optics and mechanical drive components. C. Develop a continuous or semi-continuous process for gel production D. Optimize radiation sensitivity, resolution and accuracy of the gel dosimetry system. E. Obtain outside feedback on the dosimeter's utility from the potential medical community. We envision the potential commercial application as a dosimetry service to hospitals and medical centers. . Radiation treatment for cancer and other conditions involves exposing humans to potentially hazardous high energy radiation. This research and development effort will result in a device that will provide therapists with a visual check that the planned pattern of radiation is suitable for the patient. This device will therefore reduce the potential for unwanted and unnecessary radiation doses to the patient. It involves a colorless gel that can be exposed to the planned radiation; the gel develops color, showing the pattern of radiation dose actually delivered.",

        "abstract": "The International Linear Collider (ILC) needs a polarized electron source capable of producing an electron beam with 85% polarization, when illuminated by a circularly polarized laser.  The current design of the ILC polarized electron source is based on a DC gun and a subharmonic buncher, followed downstream by a large, expensive damping ring.  This project will develop an alternative approach in which an L-band, normal-conducting, polarized electron gun of the Plane-Wave-Transformer (PWT) design is used to meet ILC specifications.  In Phase I, detailed numerical simulations and tradeoff studies \u00bf based on vacuum, RF, magnet, beam dynamics, thermal hydraulic, and mechanical considerations \u00bf were used to identify a baseline design for the L-band, PWT photoinjector.  Phase II will entail the detailed mechanical design of a 1.3 GHz, 2-cell PWT gun, followed by the fabrication and assembly of the entire system.  Tests will be performed at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in order to demonstrate:  (1) the generation of a beam with the targeted polarization and an ultra low vertical emittance, and (2) the survivability of the GaAs photocathode needed to produce such a beam.   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The use of an L-band PWT gun as a viable electron source could potentially save ~$100M in ILC construction costs by eliminating the complicated and expensive damping ring.  In other applications, the PWT gun could be used as a high brightness electron injector for linear accelerators, synchrotrons, FELs, and other light sources.  In combination with a high-intensity laser, the PWT gun could serve as a Compton source for producing ultrafast, copious X-rays for applications in biotechnology, medicine, industry, and research.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use Titanium-Tantalum (Ti-TA) alloys, with the objective that these materials will become commercial alloys used in orthopaedic and stinting devices. Ti-30Ta has potential as a highly biocompatible implant alloy with a modulus closer to that of bone (thus mitigating bone shielding), and is potentially less notch-sensitive than standard titanium implant alloys. This project will also demonstrate that advanced powder metallurgy can produce novel titanium alloys that are extremely difficult and prohibitively expensive to produce by other means. Critical material property data of these alloys will be generated that will lead medical device manufacturers to incorporate these alloys into specific devices and to conduct the necessary testing and clinical trials for commercial product release.  The broader impacts from the use of Ti-Ta alloys will enable the development of improved medical devices that will last longer; are less invasive, promote faster patient recovery times and minimize the risk of\nadverse reactions. Advances in orthopedic and cardiovascular products will also significantly reduce short-term and long-term health care costs associated with such medical conditions and surgical procedures. Ti-Ta materials will also offer advantages for non-biomedical applications, in regard to mechanical properties as well as to shape memory and superelastic properties. For example, such materials can be expected to also offer improved properties such as resistance to corrosion, oxidation and high temperatures. Thus, availability of these alloys will be applicable to a wide variety of industrial, consumer and aerospace products in addition to biomedical applications, resulting in significant commercial potential.",

        "abstract": "Lead in household paint and dust is a serious health hazard, as low level lead exposure can result in a number of adverse health effects, especially in children. Onsite and real time detection and quantification of lead in paint/dust are very important to homeowners and certified lead based paint removal professionals.  Toward this end, both field-portable equipment (such as X ray fluorescence instruments and anodic stripping voltammetry) and colorimetric spot test kits (based on sulfide or rhodizonate ion) have been used.  Although the portable instruments generally are reliable, their relatively high costs and use of sophisticated parts (such as the radioactive X ray sources) make them difficult for homeowners and some professionals to use on a routine basis.  On the other hand, although spot tests provide low cost and user friendly alternatives, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) studies show that their reliability is inadequate.\n\nDzymeTech, Inc., proposes to develop a reliable spot test kit that is based on patented and patent pending technologies developed by Dr. Yi Lus group at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).  The technology employs catalytic DNA for lead detection.  Under SBIR Phase I funding from the EPA, DzymeTech has demonstrated the feasibility of using the catalytic DNA-based detection approach for lead in dust in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, interference, precision, stability, and long term storage.  In Phase II, we propose to build and test a prototype of the lead sensor.  The prototype kit will contain all the sensor reagent and components with minimal manual transfer of solution needed.  The prototype kit will be characterized in terms of sensitivity, selectivity and stability, and will be tested by different users (including EPA inspectors and homeowners) for field sample assays.\n   To achieve the objective of developing a reliable, low cost, and user friendly spot test kit, DzymeTech will investigate methods for efficient dust sample collection, lead extraction, and applications of the colorimetric lead sensors under different conditions.  Both simulated and real lead dust samples will be used for the test kit evaluation.  Factors that improve user friendliness, shelf-life, and cost effectiveness of the test kit will be evaluated.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purposes of these Phase I and II projects are to test the feasibility and efficacy of using an interactive multimedia (IM) format for providing comprehensive vocabulary instruction to students with high incidence disabilities (HID). To evaluate the feasibility of this type of instruction software programs will be designed to teach common prefixes, suffixes, and words parts; two research-validated vocabulary learning strategies; and provide multiple opportunities for students to apply their knowledge of word parts and use of learned strategies to high frequency academic vocabulary. Validated instructional principles such as detailed description and multiple levels of practice with feedback will be embedded into each segment of the programs. Segments will include an overview of the strategy, rationale for learning and purpose of using the strategy, detailed descriptions of each steps, video clips of students using the strategy in real testing situations, practice activities, and checks for understanding. To test the efficacy of the programs, revisions to each program will be made based on findings of the feasibility studies. Once revisions are completed, full-blown field tests for each IM program will be completed with approximately 120 middle and high school students with HID. The feasibility and validation studies will focus on (a) usability of the program, (b) student knowledge of the content and skills, (c) student use of the content and skills, (d) social validity of the program, and (e) social validity of the model. This project is relevant to public health because the number of individuals with low literacy skills is substantial. Particularly, many students with high incidence disabilities struggle with various aspects of reading and literacy-related skills. A large number of these students will either drop-out of school or continue to struggle throughout their school careers and into adulthood. Low literacy has been associated with such poor adult outcomes as under- and unemployment, increased criminal activity, and poverty. The empirically validated IM products that will result from this project will address the potentially devastating effects that low literacy can cause in children's lives and in society at large. Since vocabulary development is seen as a bridge between emerging reading skills and comprehension, this project has the potential to help many students expand their literacy skills. The instruction would be used to help them learn common words parts, independently remember meanings of new words, and expand their use of new words, and apply their skills to hundreds of new high-frequency, high-utility words. The instructional programs that will result from this project will be usable as literacy intervention programs based on individual needs. In addition, the proposed programs will serve as a model for the development of future IM programs for individuals with high incidence disabilities.",

EDVOTEK, the applicant organization believes the opportunity provided by this market is significant and will continue to grow; it affords a unique business opportunity for the company and is a logical extension of its current business. The proposed products to be researched in this Phase II SBIR are \"hands- on\" health-related and life science-related experiments designed to stimulate science interest and self-directed student research. In this Phase II project, the company will research twenty stand-alone experiments (\"Science Path Accelerators\" or \"SciPacs(tm)\") or five clusters of four experiments related to a single science concept (Sci4Pacs(tm)). The SciPac(tm) product line will emphasize current biology and technology concepts for middle school and introductory biology students that personally impact students' daily lives; these products will also be specifically designed for home and traditional school use, as well as for community science centers and museums. Science activities in all proposed SciPacs(tm) and Sci4Pacs(tm) will be evaluated for safety, shelf life, and affordability for parents and teachers to incorporate as teaching resources. A new advisory board with established expertise in education assessment will strongly complement the company's existing strength in science education, manufacturing and marketing. Specifically, we will rigorously assess whether the proposed products allow for increased science interest and achievement of National Science Education Standards. As science and technology are pillars of our society that maintain our current standard of life (and that of generations to come), the company strongly believes that \"hands-on\" life science experiments for students ages 10 to 15 will play a significant role in developing interest and comprehension of science, with direct impact on our society. Continued early introduction to science might also stimulate career opportunities for young students that in turn, will have a positive influence on the economic development and public health of our Nation. Page 1 Principal Investigator: Graf, Karen Narrative Our Nation is a highly industrialized society and science-based education is critical to maintain our leadership in the world. With globalization and the inevitable continued export of lower skilled manufacturing jobs, future careers for our citizens will require improved mastery of science and technology. Shortages of scientists and engineers will result in continued high technology job losses to other nations. Early and sustained science education will provide noteworthy societal benefits, including scientifically literate future voters. One can anticipate that continued early introduction to science might also stimulate career opportunities for young science students, which in turn, will have a positive impact on the economic development of our Nation.

This project will develop a more economical, non-cryogenic, and non-membrane means for separating, storing, and releasing pure oxygen for use in coal gasification and oxycombustion.  Not only will nitrogen oxides be eliminated, but also product/waste streams will be more concentrated and easier to separate.  The technology is based on the application of mixed metal oxide materials on novel supports capable of separating oxygen from air.  The materials will possess large surface area, large oxygen storage capacity, and long term stability, and will not contain costly noble metals.  In Phase I, a number of mixed metal oxide materials with large oxygen storage capacities were identified and shown to be capable of releasing large amounts of stored oxygen under ambient pressures and moderate temperatures.  When supported on sintered metal fiber filters, these materials demonstrated improved oxygen production at lower temperatures.  The ability to coat the supports with various ceramics and glass, in order to improve surface area, was demonstrated, and the coatings were shown to be stable up to 700oC.  Phase II will involve optimizing the materials and coating process.  Kinetic data will be obtained for the uptake and release of oxygen from preferred materials.  Using the kinetic data, as well as other information, a bread-board reactor will be designed, fabricated, and tested.   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The cryogenic separation of oxygen is extremely expensive and remains the main obstacle to the commercialization of more environmentally-friendly fossil fuel processes (coal gasification, oxycombustion).

        "abstract": "Polychlorinate biphenyls (PCBs) remain a significant environmental threat even though manufacturing of PCBs was discontinued 30 years ago.  Due to the chemical and thermal stability of PCBs in the environment and the continued use of transformers containing these chemicals, very specific regulations are in place which require quantification of PCBs in all transformer oil.  The Toxic Substance Control Act has mandated that the concentration of PCBs in transformer oil be less than 50 parts per million.  Analysis of PCB concentration is currently performed b SW-846 Method 8082 standard method in an analytical lab using gas chromatography.  This type of analysis is time consuming and costly.  In addition, for this off-site analysis, oil must be removed from the transformer which potentially exposes workers and the environment to PCBs.  Eltron is developing a new portable real-time sensor that can be used onsite to not only quantify with PCBs are present but also determine PCB concentration.\n   In the EPA Phase I SBIR project, Raman Spectroscopy and multivariate analysis were combined to create a rapid in-situ sensor capable a simultaneous detection of PCB concentration and composition within transformer oil.  Regression models were prepared that could detect PCB concentrations as low as 5 ppm and classification models were prepared that could predict the type of Aroclor present in transformer oil.  During the Phase II project, sensor sensitivity will be improved by testing all major transformer oil types and accounting for appropriate interferences.  Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy will be used to lower the sensor detection limit.  Finally, a prototype instrument including user friendly software will be prepared for field testing.\n   The final product of this project will be a real-time sensor that is cost effective, portable, user friendly, and most importantly will prevent the hazardous removal and transportation of contaminated transformer oil for PCB analysis.  The expected instrument capital cost is equivalent to current GC costs ($30K); however, the per sample testing cost will be significantly less than GC methods.  This type of hand-held sensor will find extensive use by electric utilities (Sacramento Municipal Utility District) and hand-held Raman instrument manufacturers (Raman Systems, Inc.).  An expected global market of $119 M is expected for this type of instrument by 2009.",

The long term vision for this technology is that it will become a key environmental science tool to support the development of strategies to prevent arsenic-related disease in individuals and population and to help people liver longer, healthier lives, a key aspect of the mission of NIEHS. We envision this technology also having a role in the international arsenic contamination picture, particularly in countries such as Bangladesh, where over 70% of drinking water wells contain toxic concentrations of arsenic. Specific Aims of the Phase II program will include design and construction of a prototype field-portable analytical system for detection of arsenic in drinking water at concentrations between sub-ppb and many ppm. The performance of the instrument will be characterized in the lab for the effects of real sample issues, including several classes of interferences and environmental variables. Once fully characterized, the prototype will be tested in the field with selected stakeholders in the drinking water distribution system arena. The new prototype technology will be benchmarked against standard analytical laboratory methods and other available field tests, such as colorimetric kits. During Phase I, favorable comparison to standard analytical laboratory analysis has already been obtained on drinking water samples from New Mexico and remediation treatment process water from Nevada. These results provide high confidence that the proposed analytical methodology will be an effective tool to prevent arsenic related disease from drinking water exposure. In the United States and globally, contamination of drinking water by naturally occurring arsenic puts populations at risk of a variety of arsenic-related diseases. The proposed Phase II program will provide a cost- effective and highly accurate way to monitor arsenic in drinking water at the site of the water source.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project will develop a new methodology for parts forecasting for discrete manufacturing. Emcien is developing a software suite to enable a product manager to better manage a configurable manufactured product. This suite includes a method for forecasting the demand for a configurable product at the full configuration level of detail. This means forecasting unique configurations, each with an expected volume. The method depends on extracting customer buying patterns from the sales history for the product. The mathematical algorithms for extracting and representing these patterns, and forecasting using these patterns are the main contributions of the research. The set of parts needed to build a configurable product generally depends on combinations of options, so it is not possible to plan parts requirements from an aggregate forecast. By using a configuration level forecast, it is possible to expand each unique configuration into component parts, and then use the associated volumes to produce a complete parts forecast.  American manufacturers are\nspecializing in complex, configurable, high-end products, as mass produced commodity products move offshore. Allowing customers to customize a product results in significant numbers of alternative product configurations. This variety increases costs in many ways. One important way is the increased difficulty of planning parts requirements. The current practice of basing parts planning on a few popular variants leads to excess inventory of some parts and shortages of others. Excess inventory incurs both holding and obsolescence costs. Shortages can interrupt production and cause both lost sales and quality problems. Emcien has developed a methodology that, among many other benefits, can improve the accuracy of parts planning.",

We will conduct studies to evaluate further the necessary training and background for instructors to use our system appropriately. The commercial potential of our system is high given the large and increasing incidence of children with special needs treated in school environments.

Conventional approaches of using coatings for effective cooling during machining have limited effectiveness, but the proposed approach is claimed to provide a novel method of providing internal cooling mechanism to machine difficult-to-machine (DTM) materials.  If successful, this technology will enable better tool-life during the machining of hard-to-machine materials at finish feeds, which can have tremendous impact for machining of DTM alloys. By requiring minimal coolant use due to effective heat transfer from machining operation, the research will lead to new manufacturing methods with a positive impact on environmental pollution.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Soft x-ray microscopy shows enormous promise as a technique for imaging cellular structures at resolutions well beyond what can be achieved in optical microscopes, and with much simpler sample preparation than is required for electron microscopy. In addition, the lower radiation dose required (compared to electron microscopy) allows tomographic investigation of subcellular structures in three dimensions. Existing synchrotron based microscopes have shown the potential of the soft x-ray microscope as a research tool, but they have the disadvantage of being tied to a massive light source at only a few national laboratories. A suitably bright, compact, low cost light source is the enabling innovation needed to realize a commercial biological soft x-ray microscope. Energetiq has developed a unique light source technology using an electrodeless, inductively coupled plasma to produce light in the soft x-ray range. The Energetiq light source can be used to generate light needed to illuminate and image biological specimens in a soft x-ray microscope. In Phase I Energetiq explored the capability of the light source in the \"water window\" range of wavelengths and determined that an x- ray microscope based on the light source is feasible. A \"proof of principle\" microscope will be constructed in Phase II. Biologists have a need to image whole biological cells both at high resolution and in their hydrated state. Currently available microscopes satisfy one of these requirements but not both. Soft x-ray microscopy in the so-called 'water window' allows resolution to 20nm for fully hydrated cell samples, and can produce 2-D and 3-D tomographic images. The ability to resolve sub cellular structures in hydrated cells, and to create those images in minutes rather than days, could lead to more rapid advances in drug discovery, disease diagnosis, disease treatment and better understanding of the fundamental cellular processes.",

        "abstract": "Effective management of electricity distribution systems requires analysis tools that can estimate the state of the system (the operating condition).  Although state estimation algorithms recently have arisen from research activities, they have yet to be adopted in practice.  Utilities need an easier way to implement these new algorithms, along with tools that can pull together all the data needed for the analysis.  This project will develop a branch-current state estimation algorithm that is suitable for large-scale applications.  The algorithm will be deployed on a large-scale data historian software system, which provides access to a large volume of measurements to support state estimation.  In Phase I, the framework for deploying advanced state and load estimation algorithms to utilities was specified.  A suitable research-grade state estimator was identified, and its interface to the deployment framework was tested.  In Phase II, a configurable mapping to measured data will be developed, and then deployed and tested at an electric utility.   Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The algorithm should allow researchers from universities or industry to develop new modules as add-ons to the industry-leading data historian software for electric utilities, enabling better operation of the electric power distribution system.  In the future, the same basic framework should support additional data collection from automated meters and power quality monitors, thereby leveraging the use of these measurements.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory screening and diagnosis are important in today's health care. Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) constitute major health problems in the US. Mechanical ventilators are used increasingly for life support in patients with serious respiratory illness. Traditional pulmonary function tests (spirometry) are often not adequate to provide the respiratory functional information required by health care professionals. The Airflow Perturbation Device (APD) has undergone significant improvements over several years. APD is simple in concept, employing a rotating wheel in the flow path to change flow by 20-45%, with associated small changes in mouth pressure. From these changes, resistance is calculated. APD is simple in operation, requiring only normal breathing for one minute and is useful in children as well as adults. APD can display resistance changes in real time, and can be modified to measure resistance of ventilated patients and made as portable as a camera. We have used APD it its current implementation to measure average respiratory resistance, as well as separate inspiratory and expiratory values, in nearly 1,500 people. The Phase I clinical data shows that the Standard Deviation (SD) for APD is smaller than IOS on identical measurements. Existing competitive commercial Pulmonary Function Testing (PFT) devices include spirometry, forced oscillation (FO, e.g. IOS), and interrupter (Rint). These either require patients to forcefully exhale (spirometers), or are very expensive and very sensitive to airflow leak (forced oscillation, FO, such as IOS), or require complete interruption of airflow limiting data acquired to only one measurement every 3 breaths (Rint). Three major advantages of APD include a requirement for natural breathing only, relatively less effect from airflow leak than in FO, and it provides an order of magnitude more measurements than Rint. APD can be used by young children, ill adults and in elderly patients. Phase I funding enabled us to considerably advance APD to its current configuration. Pre-Phase I APD weight/cost were 10 pounds/$3,500. APD is now 14.7 ounces/$600, and portable. In Phase II we plan to further reduce its size and cost, improve the flow sensor's accuracy and sensitivity, and add additional capabilities including flow-volume display. To bring APD into commercial production (our long term objective), further refinements are necessary. After that, clinical data must be obtained, and regulatory approval must be sought. The market for the APD is huge, including hospitals, clinics, physician's offices, ambulances, and home care facilities. Because of its size and cost and ease of operation, the APD is an ideal device for home use and for pharmaceutical testing of new drugs. In Phase II we plan to test the device on at least 1,750 individuals at 4 different clinics. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is fourth leading cause of death in the United States; and respiratory screening for Asthma and COPD, and monitoring of therapeutic interventions are important in US health care. Because of its small size, modest cost, ease of operation and sensitivity to small airway function, the proposed device (APD) can effectively and economically screen for respiratory disease, and monitor interventions in patients with COPD and other respiratory disorders. This will improve diagnosis and recognition of therapeutic benefits as well as lower the cost of the health care.",

This means a large large truck can potentially exhibit more than 10 times the energy of a small passenger car and a stopping device must work over this broad range of kinetic energies. Our research has indicated that current vehicle stopping technologies place the user in danger during deployment. ESA has developed a device that is a significant improvement over current technologies in that it is not as sensitive to the kinetic energy of the entire moving vehicle and is deployable from a safe distance. Our innovation is a portable, lightweight, inexpensive device that can be readily deployed and remotely activated by groundbased personnel or from helicopters.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In Phase I of this project, Trellis Bioscience, Inc. has validated a proprietary screening technology for multiplexed characterization of the secreted protein from individual live cells, enabling detection and propagation of rare favorable cells. The technology was applied to murine splenocytes and hybridomas, achieving a specificity (quality) threshold that is markedly higher than is feasible for other antibody screening technologies. The identified clones were too rare for recovery by conventional means lacking the extreme miniaturization of the Trellis approach (100,000 fold reduction). The present Phase II request for funding is to enable extension of the technology from murine hybridomas to two distinctive diversity sources: recombinant antibodies, and recombinant small peptides. Each addresses market needs not satisfied by murine hybridomas. Successful extension to recombinant antibodies will allow the recovery of human derived antibodies against infectious diseases, extending the benefits of vaccination to diseases for which a mass innoculation campaign is impractical or inappropriate. Peptides are of particular interest for targeting intracellular drug targets not amenable to antibody treatment. Extension to these uses requires a substantive increase in throughput of the screening system. Accordingly, Aim 1 is focused on increasing the multiplexing capacity of the assay and improving the efficiency and throughput of the image analysis system, while Aims 2 and 3 are focused on adapting the technology and demonstrating its capabilities in the two fields of interest. Trellis Bioscience is developing a technology that decreases the time and cost required to discover antibody therapeutics, which now represent the fastest growing segment of the pharmaceutical industry. Drugs in this class are being used to treat cancer and inflammatory diseases, as well as infectious disease. A further extension of the technology to peptide therapeutics will allow the efficient development of drugs to treat diseases that are not currently amenable to antibody based approaches.",

Although a Kalman filter has been developed that discriminates the ELM noise from the n=1 RWM, no Kalman filter has been constructed to include RWMs for n>1.  This project will develop a Kalman filter that discriminates non-RWMs (e.g., ELMs) from n>1 RWMs, in addition to the n=1 RWM.  Phase I developed a state-space model that serves as the basis for constructing a Kalman filter that is compatible with n=1 and n>1 RWMs.  During Phase II, a Kalman filter compatible with low-n (e.g., n = 1, 2, and 3) RWMs will be constructed, based on noise characteristics from experimental data, as well as on noise modeling.  Model validation will be performed in real-time experiments, followed by more advanced controller algorithm development.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  An improved Kalman filter would provide ELM-discrimination to n>1 RWMs, as well as to the n=1 RWM.  The algorithm for ELM-noise discrimination from these low-n RWM modes will be conducive to RWM feedback control.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Jaundice occurs in approximately 60% of newborns. When severe, the elevated blood levels of bilirubin (hyperbilirubinemia) associated with jaundice pose a significant risk for neurological damage. Current diagnostic tests for severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia do not correlate well with bilirubin encephalopathy in newborns, contributing to the uncertainty in the management of jaundiced infants. To address this problem, a new bilirubin assay will be developed to determine the plasma concentration of free unconjugated bilirubin (UCB), which is a better indicator of risk for neurological damage. In Phase I of this project, a UCB-specific probe able to detect physiologic and pathophysiologic levels of free UCB (UCBf) in neonatal plasma was produced from a fluorescently labeled mutant of a fatty acid binding protein (FABP). The specific aims of Phase II are to (1) confirm the accuracy of the Phase I UCB probe in neonatal plasma using blood samples from 800 neonates, (2) determine the effects of potential interference from conjugated bilirubin and bilirubin isomers produced during phototherapy, and (3) optimize the assay for clinical use through improvements in the probe properties and assay format. To accomplish the first aim, probe measurements of UCBf will be compared to clinical measurements of total serum bilirubin and peroxidase measurements of UCBf. The second aim will include the enzymatic synthesis of conjugated bilirubin for interference testing and UCBf measurements of samples treated with in vitro and in vivo phototherapy. The third aim will require new versions of the probe that have improved sensitivity, precision, and stability. To increase sensitivity, new libraries of fluorescently labeled FABP mutants that do not bind fatty acids will be generated by combinatorial mutagenesis of select residues within the FABP binding pocket, using the Phase I UCB probe as a template. Precision will be improved by adding a second fluorophore to the UCB probe to create a fluorescence ratio probe. Probe stability will be increased by altering the fluorophore-FABP conjugation chemistry. The third aim will also include the optimization of the UCBf assay for use in a high throughput format to facilitate future Phase III clinical trials to study the correlation between UCBf and bilirubin neurotoxicity. The successful outcome of this study will be a unique assay for UCBf that more accurately gauges the risk of bilirubin-mediated neurological damage in neonates and significantly improves the application of phototherapy for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia. Current diagnostic tests for elevated plasma concentrations of bilirubin do not correlate well with bilirubin encephalopathy in newborns, which contributes to the uncertainty in the management of jaundiced infants. To address this problem, a new bilirubin assay will be developed to determine the plasma concentration of free unconjugated bilirubin, which is a better indicator of risk of neurological damage. Clinical use of this assay would enhance the care of jaundiced infants by reducing unnecessary therapy and improving the identification of infants at risk for bilirubin encephalopathy.",

In order to improve efficiency and maintain reliability, advanced sensors are needed to provide measurements of critical power line parameter to utility operators in real-time.  In addition, next generation sensors must be low-cost to allow widespread deployment.  This project will develop a low-cost optical voltage sensor for deployment on power lines over the full range of distribution and transmission voltages.  The sensor will be comprised of modular sections that can be produced in high volume, using advanced manufacturing techniques to dramatically reduce costs.  Phase I addressed the design of the optical sensor to ensure accurate measurements under all operating conditions.  Exceptional accuracy was demonstrated at lower voltages, with a clear design path shown for extending the concept to 765 kV.  Phase II will develop and implement a full-scale prototype manufacturing process to produce complete modular optical sensors for testing.  The stacked optical modular topology will support a voltage sensor capable of accurate, transient, and real time measurements for transmission applications up to 765 kV.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to demonstrate that speech translation technology can be used to remove language barriers between nurses and non-English-speaking patients in a hospital setting. In Phase I, the hypothesis is that speech translation technology that has been developed for the U.S. military can be adapted for use by nurses to communicate effectively with their non-English-speaking patients. For Phase I, Sehda will create and implement a 2-way speech translation system that will enable nurses at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Francisco to communicate with Spanish speaking patients for five common patient-care activities, including assessing and managing pain. The goal is to use the system with at least 5 nurses and 25 patients for a minimum of 50 nurse-patient encounters and establish a baseline of system accuracy.      Phase I will involve five tasks: (1) Sehda will define the scope of the interactions the system will enable by getting input from nurses through key informant interviews and focus groups. (2) The company will then collect data to model nurse-patient interactions by recording actual nurse-patient interactions in the hospital and by recruiting Spanish speakers to call Sehda's telephone-based data collection system. Sehda will transcribe the recordings and use the data to build language and translation models.  (3) Sehda will then build the speech translation system on its S-MINDS platform. (4) Sehda will monitor the system's performance as nurses use it with their Spanish-speaking patients. During this stage, Sehda will record and transcribe all interactions for later analysis, and nurses and patients will be surveyed on their experiences with the system. (5) At this point, Sehda will isolate the conversation segments and code them for accuracy to objectively assess the system's performance. The company will also evaluate nurse and patient attitudes toward using the speech translation system. The goals for Phase II are to demonstrate that speech translation technology can be more accurate than ad hoc interpreters and as accurate as trained interpreters when used for specific types of interactions and that nurses and patients will adopt the technology as a routine part of patient care. In Phase II, Sehda will add Cantonese to the system and expand the range of nurse activities for which the system can translate. Sehda will conduct a similar set of activities as in Phase I but on a much larger scale-collect speech data, build and test system, monitor system use with patients, and evaluate results. In this phase, Sehda will also be comparing the system's performance with the performance of human interpreters, including professional in-person interpreters, telephone-based interpreters, and ad hoc interpreters such as friends and family of the patient and non-clinical bilingual hospital staff.",

The goal for this Phase II project is to continue to further develop a versatile drug-screening bench-top electroporation platform to address this ubiquitous need of academic and bio/pharmaceutical researchers. Our system - developed solely from the Phase 1 grant -- includes a control interface, with disposable 96-well microfluidic chips, that enables cells to each be controlled, monitored and manipulated individually. This platform also enables real-time electrical and optical monitoring of each cell's response. Three important and widely used applications that our system can uniquely address are: (1) drug safety testing via hERG screening (2) integrated transfection of an ion channel construct and ion channel recordings via patch clamp measurements and (3) intracellular delivery of short interfering RNA (siRNA) for target identification and validation. Awardment of this Phase 2 grant would allow us to continue to further develop our single-cell electroporation platform, making intracellular delivery a well-controlled, highly efficient, and parallel process.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In spite of many seemingly positive trends in U.S. educational settings, many children are still not succeeding in school (Powers, 2005), and school failure is strongly associated with race/ethnicity and SES. School success is a vital protective factor against health risk behaviors in adolescence. Addressing threats to school success in adolescence is imperative, as is working with elementary school children to prevent the development of later health risks. The School Success Profile (SSP) for middle and high school students and the Elementary School Success Profile (ESSP) for 3rd, 4th, and 5th graders are designed to help schools respond appropriately and to students whose school success and healthy development are threatened. This Phase II application seeks funding to build on the successful tasks of Phase I, in which the SSP and ESSP assessments and practice resources were put online and pilot-tested in schools. Three major areas of further development are proposed: (a) implementation of advanced online features of the SSP and ESSP assessment tools and practice resources; (b) development of advanced website features, and (c) a 1-year experimental test of the impact of the product on student outcomes. The long term goal of this SBIR project is to offer, via a state-of-the-art website, everything school staff need to engage in an innovative and proven sequence of assessment and prevention activities. Advanced online features of the assessment instruments and practice resources include an audio option for the online English and Spanish versions of the SSP and the ESSP for Parents, and ongoing updating of content in the Best Practices databases. Audio capability of the surveys will enhance their accessibility to respondents with limited reading proficiency. Advanced website features include features for prospective and current clients. For prospective clients, information on the products, pricing, and funding sources will be available. For current clients, an e-commerce system will be established. E-training modules on all aspects of administration, data interpretation, intervention planning, and evaluation will be available, as well as technical, research, and professional peer support. An advanced search engine function will also be developed to harvest potential changes and additions to the Best Practices database content. An experimental test of the full online ESSP assessment and prevention package will be conducted in Year 2. (Funding for a test of the SSP is being sought separately.) The online ESSP Model of Assessment and Prevention (MAP) includes the assessment tool; a problem-solving process; staff development workshops; and the ESSP Best Practices database. In 5 treatment schools, ESSP teams comprising parents, school staff, and administrators will implement the ESSP MAP for one school year with all low achieving 3rd, 4th and 5th graders. Trajectories of standardized test scores will be used to compare the academic performance of students in treatment and control schools using longitudinal techniques for nested data. Implementation fidelity and sustainability will also be evaluated. The proposed project involves implementation of advanced online SSP and ESSP assessment and Best Practices database features; development of advanced online commercial interface features; and an experimental test of the impact of the ESSP assessment and prevention product on the school outcomes of 3rd, 4th and 5th, grade students. Successful academic and social behavior at school is strongly associated with the avoidance of health risk behaviors in adolescence (including substance abuse, teen parenthood, and violence). Therefore, facilitating the use of the best prevention tools by school staff represents a vital prevention strategy for later public health problems at all school levels.",

The new technology offers diverse capacity to design, manufacture, and self-assemble periodically folded sheet material.  The range of materials includes many customized core materials for laminated panels, cellular habitat walls, structural beams, parabolic reflectors, and efficient truss systems that can be packaged ideally as a roll of sheet material and deployed in space by inflation or passive radiation.  The algebraic linkage conditions on the deployment of a folded structure forms an over-constrained system of equations.  The deployment kinetics are only possible due to engineered relationships between the neighboring facet geometry, and globally requires a uniform angular change in fold extension across the pattern.  This implies that fixing an individual fold angle fixes all of the fold angles in its neighboring region.  If the fold angles are all made rigid, then the entire structure is highly over-constrained and forms a very robust truss system.  The goal is to introduce the technology by demonstrating the diversity of folding architectures that can be directly applied to deployable space structures, and by developing the associated design and simulation software to transfer this know-how to the engineering community.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Commercially available microCT (computed tomography) systems have failed to meet the challenging demands for small animal imaging, beyond the single requirement for good spatial resolution. Specifically, they have failed to take into account that the thousand times smaller volume in mice, compared to humans, is also coupled with ten times faster heart rates, and increased respiratory rates and circulation times. Thus, the currently available systems have been limited to either: (1) in-vivo volume CT, which is primarily useful for co-registration of anatomical and with functional images provided by positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT); or (2) ex-vivo high spatial resolution CT, with sufficient contrast resolution for specimen imaging. However, these commercial systems have all failed to address the significant pre-clinical applications for micro-CT, which require improved tissue contrast, lower dose, and faster acquisition times to allow for dynamic images acquired in small animals and to take full advantage of the use of contrast agents. The goal of this project is to develop a next generation microCT for pre-clinical imaging for drug development and medical research. The system will be designed to provide clinical quality CT images in vivo in mice and rats, with performance specifications optimized to accommodate the demanding requirements of the most critical areas of current medical research. Specifically, the instrument will provide very good spatial resolution, ultra fast frame speeds (< 1 second), and low radiation dose to the subject. This will be achieved utilizing a photon counting mode for x-ray acquisition, instead of the standard current integration mode. The system will be capable of gross energy information and energy binning, and thus will provide \"Color-CT(tm)\" capability, allowing tissue compositional analysis. To accomplish these advances, the system will feature advanced CdTe solid state detectors, coupled to high speed integrated circuits for signal processing, to achieve performance characteristics not currently possible from conventional technologies used by the major CT manufacturers. In Phase-II, a fast dynamic multi-slice Color-CTTM scanner prototype will be developed, employing multiple detector modules in a novel system design incorporating a very fast x-ray source. This new modality, once established in the microCT marketplace, will undoubtedly translate into human CT scanners, and given the current study volumes of clinical CT, the impact that this project imparts to the field of medical imaging will indeed be dramatic.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High dose chemotherapy followed by peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell (PBSC) transplantation is frequently used for treating various hematologic malignancies. To facilitate this process, autologous PBSC are typically collected, cryopreserved and stored for some period of time. Current PBSC cryopreservation requires the use of molar concentrations of the cryoprotectant additive dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Typically, frozen-thawed cells are transplanted back into patients along with DMSO. However, reinfusion of DMSO has long been associated with various adverse events, ranging from skin flushing, headache, fever, dyspnea, abdominal cramping, nausea, and diarrhea to more sever effects such as, hemolysis, cardiovascular symptoms and cerebrovascular ischemia leading to neurological events. These can result in increased morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and increased treatment-related costs. Currently, when removal of DMSO is attempted, the procedures typically involve cell \"washing\" using centrifugation. These methods introduce mechanical forces and osmotic stress causing cell packing/clumping and potential significant cell loss. They also require additional laboratory staff as well, and take between 3 and 4 hours of work per patient, which makes the procedure more expensive and practically difficult for many institutions. Finally, it is difficult to kept the cells in a \"closed\" system during cell washing, which may lead to contamination. It is the goal of this proposal to finalize, build under appropriate design control and test the automated, portable, closed-system diffusion-driven washing device developed in Phase I for use in clearance of DMSO from PBSC, to prevent infusion of DMSO into patients during clinical transplant without loss of cell numbers or cell functionality. In this Phase II research, the device will be evaluated in preclinical and ultimately clinical testing for 510(k) premarket application to the FDA for clearance to market the device in Phase III. Preclinical testing will rely on in vitro flow cytometry and clonogenic ability as well as engraftment in a NOD/SCID mouse model. Clinical testing will include use in up to 20 multiple myeloma patients, pending acceptable preclinical results. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSC) is used to treat many types of diseases, such as lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma, breast cancer, testicular cancer, neuroblastoma and others. These cells are collected, frozen and stored over several periods to ensure enough are available for transplant, and to freeze these cells a compound called dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is added. This DMSO protects the cells during freezing, but can be damaging to cells after they are thawed and can cause complications with transplantation of PBSC. The goal of this research is to produce a device to easily remove DMSO from PBSC before they are transplanted, increasing effectiveness of the cells and reducing potential complications.",

        "abstract": "Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells require high-purity oxygen.  This project will develop a low-cost hydrogen-permeable membrane that provides permeated hydrogen with a high-enough purity for PEM fuel cell usage.  Phase I involved forming a thin palladium alloy on a permeable metallic support, where the alloy film was free of porosity or defects.  A pore-free palladium alloy film was fabricated and demonstrated in a small purifier module.  In Phase II, the supported membrane will be further developed and fully tested in a scaled-up, integrated purifier module.  Specific tasks include determining how thin the membrane can be formed, optimizing the fabrication methods, and determining whether alternative alloys can provide superior results.  Purifier modules will be tested for output and durability in methanol reformers to establish their suitability for commercialization.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The hydrogen separation membranes should enable the broad commercialization of integrated fuel cell systems.  Near-term markets should exist in building reformers for remote power applications, military power generation, and fuel cell transportation systems (hydrogen refueling stations, on-vehicle reformers for public transportation buses).  Furthermore, the purifier itself should find use in other industries as well \u00bf from purification for gas chromatographs to industrial scale applications requiring purified hydrogen.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The catalog of human splice variant mRNAs is believed to be far from complete with many undiscovered isoforms likely to play an important role in health and disease. The current practice of hunting for splice variants by screening cDNA libraries one at a time is both time consuming and expensive. Higher throughput and more cost-effective methods of screening would be helpful in accelerating this important enterprise. The aim of this project is to create a valuable research tool for the rapid identification of alternative splice isoforms. The Library Sampler described in this proposal represents a collection of high-quality cDNA libraries organized in two panels of 384 low-complexity pools that can be used to identify splice variants, polymorphisms and mutants from a broad range of normal tissues, tumors and cancer cell lines. The main advantage of this proposed work is to allow a simple PCR approach to efficiently screen a large diversity of human sources represented by over 9 million cDNA clones. Due to the low complexity of the cDNA pools the PCR products can be sequenced directly and used in sub-cloning experiments, giving the researcher an immediate answer on a set of mRNA isoforms corresponding to the gene of interest. A graphical web interface will be developed using a comprehensive eukaryotic splice variant database to assist scientists with their experimental design, and a set of novel splice isoforms from a list of selected genes will be identified to demonstrate the value of this new discovery tool. The Library Sampler will provide the researcher community with a powerful system to quickly identify all variant transcripts expressed from a single gene. Cataloging all the mRNA isoforms will be fundamental for understanding the complexity of the human proteome, and since many of these variants have been associated with genetic diseases, their discovery will offer new potentials for drug development and molecular diagnostics. In October 2004 the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium reduced the estimated number of human protein-coding genes to only 20,000 to 25,000 genes, a surprisingly low number for our species, suggesting that gene regulation is far more important than gene number. It is well known that most of our genes produce more than one protein by alternative splicing of their primary transcript, but the identification of all these splice variant forms is far from complete. The proposed Library Sampler provides a powerful research tool to rapidly identify these splice isoforms from a broad range of normal tissues, tumors and cancer cell lines, and because many splice isoforms have been associated with human genetic diseases, their discovery will offer new potentials for drug development and molecular diagnostics.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPs) are indicated in the treatment for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psychotic depression and other psychiatric disorders. Their drawback is drug-induced metabolic derangements including weight gain, hyperlipidemia, and diabetic risks. These diabetic metabolic symptoms (DiMS) vary widely between drugs and from patient to patient. We propose to develop a novel product termed \"Physiotype\" to deliver personalized information for each patient on the drug- specific risks among aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone. The Physiotype consists of a multi-gene ensemble of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that, interpreted with a biomathematical algorithm, may explain most of the inter-individual differences in DiMS among the 5 AAPs The proprietary physiogenomics technology and state-of-the-art genotyping laboratories of Genomas will be integrated with the clinical resources of the Institute of Living (Hartford CT) and of the University of Kentucky (Lexington KY), through subcontracts, respectively, to Dr. John Goethe and Dr. Jose de Leon. Our goal in Phase II is to discover SNPs predictive of differences in DiMS side effects between these 5 AAPs and to develop them into predictive diagnostic products for psychiatrists in their practice. We will recruit 200 patients treated by each of the 5 AAPs, characterize their weight and lipid profiles, and obtain their DNA for creation of a clinical registry and DNA repository. We will determine each patient's genotype at 100,000 SNPs covering all ~30,000 genes and also evolutionary conserved regions for a comprehensive, hypothesis-free search for genetic markers of DiMS. In Phase I, the collaborators have already accumulated a registry and DNA repository of 374 AAP-treated patients and their DNA. We have genotyped DNA from olanzapine- and risperidone-treated patients in the repository for an array of 384 SNPs in 222 cardiovascular, metabolic and psychiatric candidate genes and performed physiogenomic predictive modeling. We have discovered novel drug-specific DiMS markers for olanzapine and risperidone including the apolipoprotein E and leptin receptor genes, respectively. We have developed a prototype Physiotype and tested it in an independent psychiatric population. The Physiotype predicted that ~20% of patients have the most weight associated with risperidone and ~80% with olanzapine, which is consistent with known olanzapine average effects, and also pinpoints the greater risperidone-specific risk for many individuals. In Phase III, a prospective randomized trial of all 5 AAPs is planned as part of FDA review of a Physiotype device. The Physiotype will assist psychiatrists to avoid side effects by guiding drug selection for each patient according to innate characteristics unraveled and interpreted directly from the person's own DNA. The proposed program will develop DNA diagnostic products to enhance safety of atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPs) and improve the medical management of schizophrenia and related disorders leading to better outcomes. As of now, the development of AAP side effects is unpredictable, potentially disabling to the patient, and discourages patient compliance. The products will enable DNA- guided medicine: the determination of which AAP is most suitable and the implementation of clinical safeguards, individualized to each patient, using his/her personal genome.",

Currently, however, no clinically available laboratory test can reliably diagnose excessive alcohol use throughout the population or predict the progression of alcohol-induced organ damage. NIAAA has therefore deemed it important to identify more sensitive and informative new biomarkers for chronic alcohol use and alcohol-induced organ damage to facilitate earlier diagnosis and detection of pathologies caused by problematic drinking. Genome Explorations Inc. (GenEx) proposes to use a mouse model system to identify gene expression profiles or \"transcriptomic fingerprints\" in blood cells that act as sensitive and specific indicators of chronic alcohol use and alcohol-induced liver damage. In Phase I of this SBIR application, GenEx will: 1) Develop and apply an experimental treatment for chronic ethanol abuse and alcoholic liver disease using inbred mouse strains commonly used in alcohol and toxicology research; 2) Generate transcriptome data sets for peripheral blood leukocytes from the treated mice using the Affymetrix platform and GeneChip Mouse 430 2.0 microarrays; and 3) Perform advanced data analysis to determine if gene expression profiles (transcriptomic fingerprints) can be identified as specific biomarkers for chronic ethanol exposure and/or the onset of ethanol-induced liver damage. In Phase II, GenEx will expand this analysis to other common inbred mouse strains and across a large genetic reference panel of BXD recombinant inbred mouse strains. Use of these additional strains will provide much greater analytical precision and help to refine potential fingerprints by reducing strain-specific effects. The use of BXD strains will also enable validation of the results by genetic correlational analysis using GenExQTL, a powerful new correlational database developed specifically for NIAAA. The development of transcriptomic biomarkers in these genetically defined mouse strains would provide a powerful tool for alcohol-related research and facilitate the development of new and more effective clinical biomarkers in people.",

The product has numerous applications both commercially, as well as hospital and in-home healthcare applications. Virtually any heat source can be used to initiate the release of sufficient quantities of sterilant. Chemical, temperature and humidity INDICATORS WITHIN the self-sterilizing bag will give a color indication when adequate STERILANT CONDITIONS have been accomplished INSIDE THE BAG by the combination of time and heat. The relatively low cost of the self- sterilizing bag system makes it widely applicable to a number of specialty sterilization applications such as potential anthrax contaminated letters or other biologically infested items. The self-sterilizing bag system is ideal for environments that may not contain potable water for mixing traditional liquid sterilants making it ideally suited for use in the FIELD, MOBILE CLINICS, RURAL AREAS, or THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES.         In summary, the self-sterilizing bag system is a disposable self-contained mini- sterilizer that requires only a small amount of heat to initiate sterilization of the contents of the disposable bag while color indicators tell the user when the sterilization cycle is complete. The self-sterilizing bag system has the potential to have a great impact in worldwide health as an inexpensive infection prevention method.

        "abstract": "Global Technology Connection, Inc., in collaboration with University of Michigan-Dearborn (Vetronics Institute), Auburn University (GPS and Vehicle Dynamics Laboratory), and industrial partner, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control Systems, proposes to develop a prototype hierarchical fault tolerant control architecture for UGVs experiencing mobility failures. The architecture includes modules such as world and UGV modeling through an object-oriented framework, health assessment through novel diagnostic and prognostic algorithms, decision support through goal modification, vehicle path planning, and low-level control reconfiguration.  At the top level of the architecture, the UGV mobility health state is assessed through diagnostic and prognostic failure detection, identification, and prediction system; an object-based world model is constructed describing terrain, obstacles, etc.; and a goal modification module determines appropriate control actions due to UGV mobility failures.  A path planner is then used at the mid-level to generate appropriate UGV mobility trajectories based on the world model and UGV health state.  At the low-level, an adaptive controller continually estimates UGV model parameters to provide robust tracking of the generated path.  The proposed system will provide the remote UGV user with selectable path planning and operating mode options when mobility failures are present allowing for improved situational awareness, prolonged vehicle life, and greater mission success rates.  During Phase II, we will develop a working prototype by first testing the system off-line with data collected from the facilities provided by Auburn University and data provided by our industrial partners for a wheel/hub/motor mobility subsystem.  After sufficient performance has been achieved, Beta testing will commence with on-line integration with the experimental facilities. Technology will be transitioned to commercial applications in Phase III to military Future Combat Systems, NASA future space vehicles, automotive manufacturers, UAV, Emergency Medical Systems, automated farming equipment, etc.",

This is directly applicable to all fluoroscopy. Existing \"flat panel\" x-ray imagers have a dose dependent DQE, such that image quality deteriorates badly at low radiation photon counts, which are still adequate in an x-ray statistical sense to provide clinically useful images. The system approaches \"photon counting\" methods in sensitivity to x-radiation.      It is a conventional x-ray geometry, with an improved detector based on a newly discovered and patented CCD method of operation with an on-chip gain register. The gain register obviates output amplifier noise problems at room temperature which previously limited all prior systems of this generic type. If implemented, the possibility to reduce all fluoroscopy examination low end dose rates by 50 percent or more exists, due to more efficient registering of sparse photon counts. The target application is interventional radiology and cardiac cath labs. The goal is to build a lab model in Phase I and then a clinical device in Phase II. No overheads are charged to the grant, only direct expenses, and a small fee to help cover the cost of space used.

This Phase II project will focus on sub-100nm device manufacturability, device performance testing, and circuit design to develop a set of results which will enable the creation of a 1 Mb demonstration chip. The STT-RAM test chip is needed to prove the technology for customers. The results obtained from this project will include the development of arrays of sub-100nm bits, with the appropriate thermal stability, read/write characteristics and distributions. Also addressed will be the reliability of reading and writing such small devices. The project will develop processes for manufacturing sub-100nm structures. Finally, a simulation of read and write circuitry based on STT-RAM will be produced\nallowing for tape-out of a 1 Mb test chip.  Commercially, as microelectronics scales to smaller sizes and higher speeds, more features are added to typical consumer electronic devices and the demands on memory continues to grow. These demands and the inherent limitations of existing technologies create opportunities for new memory technologies to fill. As a leading candidate for a future universal memory that incorporates all the desired characteristics; non-volatility, high speed, low power, unlimited rewriting capability, extendibility to future semiconductor nodes; STT-RAM is in a strong position to take advantage of these opportunities.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The miniaturization of neuroprosthetic technology has led to an urgent need for insulating coatings that retain their biocompatibility and stability over long periods. Initiated Chemical Vapor Deposition (iCVD) is an attractive alternative to applying polymers using solvent-based techniques such as dip/spray and curing. iCVD has the benefits of thinness, conformality (conforms very well to complex shapes) and high purity. Materials that can be produced include: fluoropolymers, which have excellent resistively and inertness to long-term implantation, and silicones, which have excellent flexibility, adhesion, and biocompatibility. The goal of this work is to combine these characteristics into a composite material that satisfies all of the requirements of chronic implantation in a neurological environment. In Phase I, the feasibility of combining silicones and fluoropolymers was demonstrated using two approaches: (1) a bi-layer comprising silicone as a base layer and fluoropolymer as a surface layer, and (2) a fluorinated silicone copolymer. Coatings were produced, tested for mechanical durability, stability, and resistively, and compared against Parylene-C, a commercially available vapor-deposited coating. Although both approaches performed comparably to Parylene-C in insulating resistance, the bi-layer showed better adhesion to a wide range of substrates and superior soak stability. Based on these results, and the excellent long-term stability exhibited by other iCVD silicone coatings (2+ years under soak without any loss in resistively), the bi-layer structure was selected for further development in Phase II. In Phase II, the range of compositions used in the bi-layer structure will be expanded. The process for producing silicone coatings will be scaled up to allow a multitude of complex, three-dimensional devices to be coated. More rigorous, long-term testing will be performed using real-world device components as substrates, and the performance of GVD's coatings will be compared against state-of-the-art commercial coatings. In addition to mechanical and electrical performance testing, compatibility to nerve cells and tissue will be systematically examined and animal implantation studies performed. Phase II investigations will also address how these new coating materials can be biologically modified to mitigate the brain tissue foreign-body response. The ultimate goal of this work is to achieve single step encapsulation of three-dimensional neural probe arrays and of neural prosthetic assemblies. The development of a stable, durable, biocompatible insulating coating under this Phase II will enable that goal to be achieved. The success of this Phase II will allow GVD to offer to researchers & manufacturers a proven, effective tool for the insulation and encapsulation of neuroprosthetic devices. The coating developed under this work will provide greater flexibility in the design of devices, the choice of materials used, and the minimum dimensions which can be achieved in neuroprosthetic devices. Therapeutically, the coating will perform better when implanted and provide safe and effective protection of devices in chronic applications. The long-term impact will be to de-bottleneck the development of devices and accelerate their proliferation as treatments for neurological disorders.",

Older adults in small residential board and care facilities are at a particularly high risk of fire death and injury because of their characteristics (decreased mobility, dementia, high medication use, sensory losses, and weaker respiratory systems) and environment (residents outnumber the staff; lack of sophisticated fire protection systems, and lack of staff training). Training is critical for owners, operators, and staff of small residential board and care facilities because they are responsible for all facets of fire protection, including inspecting for hazards, buying/testing/maintaining fire protection equipment, developing a fire emergency plan, interacting with the fire inspector and training residents. However, traveling to off-site locations for training is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive because it requires leaving the residents with back-up caregivers. Web technology is currently underutilized despite the great promise that it offers and the enormous need for training that exists. Web-based training can reduce many of the existing barriers for delivering training, allowing providers to complete the program at their own facilities to receive continuing education credits from their state licensing agencies. A comprehensive, interactive web-based fire safety training program will give caregivers the knowledge and skills they need to prevent a fire and to respond correctly in a fire emergency. The program will include interaction, animation, video, graphics and narration to create a media-rich learning environment. The Phase I pilot study demonstrated the effectiveness of a prototype web-based training module on the topic of fire emergency planning. Study participants who completed the training significantly improved their scores from pre- to posttest when compared to a control group. Participants indicated on the course evaluation that the computers were easy to use for training (97%) and that they would like to use computers for future training courses (97%). Phase II will expand the research to include the development of two new web-based training modules on the topics of identifying and eliminating fire hazards and installing, testing, and maintaining fire safety devices. Researchers will evaluate the program in a national field test. This proposed project supports the National Institute on Aging's mission \"to improve the health and well- being of older Americans\".

In Phase II, a full-scale array detector and two modular detector units will be fabricated to cover an energy regime from 3 KeV to 20 KeV.  The detectors will be characterized and compared with currently available detector systems.   Commercial Application and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The multilayer detector should provide 50 times more efficiency in fluorescence detection than state-of-the-art solid-state detectors at intense beamlines, with 2-to-3 times better energy resolution.  The detectors will be commercialized for use at synchrotron sources around the world.  In addition to the synchrotron application, the technology should have application to microanalysis studies that use other types of radiation.",

This renewable source of energy could be tapped to replace more than 7% of the nation\u00bfs imported oil, by using thermoelectric materials to convert this heat into electricity.  However, current thermoelectric materials are not efficient enough to make this conversion process economical.  In Phase I of this project, alternating Si/SiGe Quantum Films were upgraded in performance to yield efficiencies >20% at relatively low temperatures such as a TH of 300EC and TC of 100EC.  Higher efficiencies (greater than 30%) were indicated at the elevated temperatures.  A single crystal Si with very low thermal conductivity was developed, which should greatly limit bypass heat losses.  Thermal stability annealing tests for Si/SiGe at a TH of 300EC exhibited no signs of degradation.  Phase II will fabricate additional films, and   thermal conductivity and efficiency will be determined as a function of temperature.  Different bonding techniques will be pursued for the low temperatures (up to 300EC) versus the higher temperatures (up to 1000EC).    Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should be of use to  industrial users, such as steel mill furnaces and aluminum plants, that have a considerable amount of waste heat at various operating temperatures.  Another potential application would be cars and trucks, where two-thirds of the fuel going into the vehicle ends up as waste heat.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): \"Aging in Place\" is the goal of America's aging population. Yet fires caused by unattended cooking are the leading cause of fire-related injuries and deaths among older adults. Additionally, this concern for the safety of older adults often causes caregivers and family members to remove older adults from their households where they live independently, and place them in institutions or in the extended family's household. This upheaval can have a detrimental impact on the older adult's sense of self-esteem and quality of life, as well as causing a significant financial burden. To improve the health and well being of older Americans, and enable them to enjoy their independence, an innovative safety device will be designed and fabricated that meets the need for a proactive gas cooking appliance shut-off device that prevents fires from occurring rather than simply warning occupants that a fire has started. During Phase I the research effort product operational requirements will be identified and a preliminary product specification established. Product concepts will be developed and a trade-off analysis will identify the best concepts. Finally in Phase I, laboratory research models will be built and tested, which will validate the feasibility of the designs. During the Phase II research effort, a research prototype system will be designed and fabricated. Gas cooking appliance retrofit procedures will be developed, and the prototype will be tested on representative gas cooking appliances. Marketplace demand for an existing product for electric cooking appliances that has been developed and sold by HomeSense Enterprises has been positive. However many prospective customers have expressed a need for a gas-cooking version. The product that will be developed under this program has an exceptionally high probability for commercialization success. As the population ages, and older adults become more concerned with their quality of life in their older years, public health costs in America are spiraling out of control. Living independently is not only more desirable for many older adults, but also more beneficial financially. The costs of maintaining an older adult in their home with intervention services is 20% to 25% that of a supervised environment. Successful completion of this project will allow over 8 million aging adults that use gas-cooking appliances access to a novel product that helps allow them to maintain their independence more safely in their own household environment, and enables them to be part of the emerging senior lifestyle concept of \"Aging in Place\".",

Laser-produced plasma experiments will be conducted to validate and refine the novel high-efficiency, low-debris EUV light source designs developed in our previous work.  Comparisons between experimental data and simulations performed using state-of-the-art simulation tools will facilitate the development of light sources with high 13.5 nm conversion efficiencies.

Superconducting electronics are ideal candidates for these applications, as their speed of operation can easily approach 40 GHz when utilizing small-scale, integrated-circuit fabrication technology.  However, output voltage levels in super-conducting logic gates are too low to be instrumented with conventional electronics for further processing.  This project will develop a low noise Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID)-based amplifier, along with associated cooled semiconducting-based amplifier chips, as an interface between high-speed superconducting processing electronics and room temperature digital processing peripheral electronics.  In Phase I, SQUID amplifiers were integrated with the outputs of a high performance Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) operating close to 24 GHz clock frequency.  The low noise SQUID amplifiers integrated an array of SQUIDs in series utilizing Josephson Transmission Lines (JTLs).  The SQUID stack in each amplifier was followed by a high-gain semiconductor amplifier (which accepts an input of ~2mV and generates an output of ~1V) that can be read by standard semiconductor logic circuits for further processing.  Since bandwidth associated with JTLs is on the order of tens of GHz, the SQUID array amplifier can easily possess switching speeds approaching several tens of pico-seconds.  Phase II will design, develop, and demonstrate a novel differential input version of the SQUID array amplifier, which will increase its gain by a factor of two while maintaining its high bandwidth.  The amplifier chip will be integrated in a cryopackage with a semiconducting-based amplifier to facilitate its instrumentation with room temperature processing electronics.   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A low-noise, high-speed, SQUID amplifier chip should find use in many high-speed digital systems, such as analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital receivers.  Such a SQUID coupled to a large transformer (100 nH) would make an amplifier with sub-pico ampere sensitivity possible for many applications, including non-invasive medical diagnostic instrumentation or the readout of cryogenic detector arrays.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of this project is to exploit the RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism in order to develop therapeutics to treat human disease.  Because the RNAi mechanism is extraordinarily potent in reducing expression of a specific gene, it offers an opportunity to rationally design drugs targeted to individual genes in a disease implicated pathway.  While this paradigm has largely been realized in cell culture using cationic lipids to introduce substrates for the RNAi pathway into mammalian cells, the widespread application of RNAi technology to gene inhibition in animals remains elusive. This is largely due to the poor pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of RNAi based drugs such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs).  We believe that that unmodified siRNA will fail as systemically administered drugs due to the poor PK properties of RNA, in particular insufficient stability in biological fluids such as blood, and suboptimal uptake by tissues and penetration into cells. We intend to overcome these limitations by employing our knowledge of the structure-activity relationships (SAR) of RNAi drugs to design analogs which have the potential to exhibit improved PK properties, yet maintain the high intrinsic potency of the RNAi mechanism.  We will then evaluate these improved designs in preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacology studies in order to assess their ability to serve as leads for the development of robust RNAi based therapeutics. The deliverable from the project is one or more chemically modified RNAi constructs which show superior pharmacokinetics and robust pharmacology in animal models.  Because of our focus on a novel target relevant to cancer chemotherapy, we will also generate therapeutic leads appropriate for pre-clinical drug development activities.  The deliverables from the project will be optimized chemically modified motifs for RNAi drugs which should be widely applicable to the modulation of gene expression in animals as well as a lead siRNA compound targeting Eg5 that will be ready to begin preclinical drug development activities.",

Simulation-facilitated instruction, in which a trainee must successfully master specific tasks in a computer-generated 3D virtual environment embodying visual and interaction characteristics of the real world, provides a solution. Simulation offers learners repeated opportunities to try, fail, and finally succeed, without risk to their human patients while providing consistent, diverse instruction for all students. Though such simulators are now in regular use in surgical residency programs, Dental education has yet to use this clinically proven technology. The goal of this project is to transform how the clinical skills of Dentistry are taught and assessed by developing a broadly deployable simulation-facilitated Dental education system designed to address the needs of educators, students, practitioners and patients in the areas of Oral Medicine, Manual Dexterity, Scaling and Caries Detection. Specific Aims are to: construct an architecture for deployment and visualization of educational content, progress monitoring and report generation; implement an efficient content creation process; build the modules; perform an initial evaluation specific to targeted constituencies to determine whether the interface is suitably intuitive, content is compelling and engaging, and metrics are appropriate; and perform a formal evaluation study to assess whether educational goals of the modules have been met. The system will be built using off-the-shelf hardware and software, wherever practical, and will run on the typical home or office computer using a familiar browser-based display coupled with a haptics feedback interface when appropriate. This will allow the system to more easily be adapted to address future Dental education needs and will minimize fixed costs so that it may reach a large potential user base in the U.S. and worldwide, including underserved populations in rural and urban regions.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goals of this Phase II research proposal focus on the further development of a topical microbicide for vaginal and rectal use from a small group of highly potent pyrimidinedione molecules identified in our Phase I research. Topical microbicides represent an important strategy for preventing the sexual transmission of HIV, the predominant mode by which HIV is transmitted worldwide, especially in the developing world. The specific rationale for the development of the pyrimidinedione series of molecules includes the observation that the compounds exhibit subnanomolar activity against clinical strains of HIV-1 and HIV-2, including subtypes found throughout the world, the compounds inhibit HIV infection and replication through two distinct mechanisms of action, including inhibition of reverse transcription and viral entry, and they display a significantly high level of activity in cervical explant models of sexual transmission. The specific aims of the proposal are constructed to identify our primary lead pyrimidinedione microbicide for clinical development from among a series of highly potent molecules which were selected based on the results of our Phase I microbicide testing. We propose to utilize this agent, either alone or in combination with another microbicide, for advancement to IND submission and clinical trials. The selection criteria used to identify the superior microbicide candidate will be based on an algorithm using established and novel in vitro assays developed to examine compound efficacy, toxicity, stability, and formulation in a microbicide-like environment. These assays will examine the efficacy of the pyrimidinediones alone and in combination with each other or other microbicide compounds against multiple clinical strains of HIV-1 and HIV-2 in the presence of vaginal and seminal simulates in primary and established cell lines hypothesized to represent models of the sexual transmission of HIV. In addition, the efficacy of the pyrimidinediones against other STIs and their toxicity to Lactobacilli and normal human vaginal and cervical cells will also be examined in an environment that mimics that of the vagina at the time of intercourse and HIV transmission. Following in vitro analysis, a lead compound will be advanced to toxicology evaluations in well established animal model systems. These animal models will utilize rabbits and rodents to examine the contact hypersensitivity and adsorption potential of the lead compounds alone and in combination. Additional studies will also be performed using the cervical explant model to confirm the efficacy and lack of toxicity of the candidate microbicide in its formulated state. These assays are designed to address the FDA's points to consider in the preclinical development of anti-infective agents, and are specifically tailored to address the requirements of an effective topical microbicide as defined by the International Working Group on Microbicides. The results of this research will be used as a basis for Phase III preclinical research and the submission of an Investigatory New Drug (IND) application to the FDA for the use of pyrimidinediones as single or combination topical microbicides. In the absence of an effective vaccine to prevent HIV infection, the development of a low cost and effective barrier to the sexual transmission of HIV is one of medicine's most pressing issues in light of the high rates of virus transmission occur in the developing world, especially in women in social settings where the negotiation of condom use is problematic. It has been estimated that a microbicide product that is only 60% effective could prevent millions of new infections by HIV each year. The pyrmidinediones have characteristics that make them superior microbicide candidates, including the fact that they are highly potent inhibitors of HIV infection, inhibit both virus entry and reverse transcription, are highly active in cervical explant models of sexual virus transmission, and they can be easily synthesized at low cost.",

        "abstract": "Aquaculture of shrimp is a multi-billion dollar business worldwide. Infection of shrimp grown by aquaculture with the organism leading to Necrotizing HepatoPancreatitis (NHP) is frequently encountered in North, Central and South America and can lead to devastating economic consequences if not detected early. Current methods for testing require shipping samples to centralized laboratories to perform PCR or histology that is time consuming, expensive and requiring specialized equipment. Rapid testing with a low cost immunoassay device would enable early detection by farmers at the site of aquaculture by permitting monitoring of brood stock as well as cultured shrimp. This could lead to a more rapid response for controlling the infection by allowing intervention before the population becomes lethargic and anorexic and less susceptible to treatment. Such a low cost test would also have applications in monitoring the passage of the infection between wild and cultured shrimp. This Phase II SBIR will focus on completing the development and field evaluation of a cost effective prototype rapid assay for NHP bacterial detection. These studies will be done in close collaboration with expert researchers at the University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ and their collaborators at shrimp farms in Central and South America.

Significant effort has gone into understanding the pathophysiology of the disease process and to investigate potential neuroprotection strategies. The first hours of life have been identified as a critical period during which intervention has the best potential for improving outcome. However, both translational research and clinical care have been limited by the lack of an objective validated tool for real-time bedside evaluation of neurological injury. To address this need, we developed a novel multi-parametric EEG-based index which incorporates both spectral and temporal analysis into a unified measure of neurological injury. This index was evaluated in a piglet model. The tuned algorithm demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 95% respectively to identify poor outcome as defined by histopathology. We then evaluated the index using EEG recordings from the NICU following perinatal asphyxia. Visual interpretation of the signal by a blinded expert as well as the Sarnat score were used as benchmarks. A series of receiver- operator curves were created, and the sensitivity and specificity of the tuned algorithm remained above 80% in all cases. We now intend to pursue a Phase II competing continuation with a single aim: To obtain FDA clearance for Infinite's I-2020 EEG system with CHI/b analysis.

This will test two hypotheses: 1) within the 1st hour of monitoring, the index can assess the severity of neurological injury as defined by the MRI at 7 days of life with greater sensitivity and accuracy than any other currently available measure; and 2) the index measured during the 1st day of life can assess neurodevelopmental outcome. If we are successful, the resultant device will enable stratification of patients for neuroprotection studies as well as for eventual identification of patients who would benefit from therapy. Additionally, it should be noted the proposed monitor will be the first with regulatory clearance for such labeling. This singular endpoint defines successful completion of the project. Neuroprotection is an emerging therapy for treating perinatal asphyxia. However, early identification of patients which can benefit from neuroprotective treatment is limited. This project aims to achieve FDA approval of an EEG based monitoring system that can serve as a clinical research tool to further enhance diagnostic evaluation of neonates post perinatal asphyxia.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): WorkingOnHealth.com/Nutrition (WOH-N) will be a Web-based health risk reduction program focused on nutrition, dietary management, and the role of physical activity in supporting health risk reduction. The negative health and social consequences of poor eating habits and sedentary lifestyles are well documented in the adult population, particularly in relation to certain types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Healthy People 2010 sets worksite-specific objectives for increasing employers' offerings of health promotion activities, and employee participation by 75%. The workplace is an outstanding venue for delivering health risk reduction programs to large populations, quickly and efficiently. With the cost of healthcare rising at an alarming rate, companies are looking for solutions to help lower costs and workplace programs are becoming a central part of an overall corporate strategy. Employers who support employees' to reduce health risks, benefit in terms of reduced absenteeism, reduced insurance costs, fewer incidences of disabling injuries and illnesses, increased productivity and improved morale. The use of a theory driven Web-based resource is a promising way to address the growing problem of poor nutrition among adults, especially when offered in the workplace where healthy lifestyle changes can be promoted and reinforced. Such innovative resources improve availability of information, preserve anonymity, and make it easy for individuals to acquire knowledge and initiate health promoting changes about their nutrition and dietary habits. The development and testing of confidential, online resources available to employers is timely given the obesity epidemic and rising costs of health care. The financial reality is that if obesity-related costs continue to rise at the current unsustainable rates, they will severely strain the US health care system in the not-too-distant future. WOH-N will provide a tailored, interactive, program that will provide validated nutrition information and tailored feedback about personal risk factors in a media rich, interactive environment. WOH-N will combine state-of-the-art knowledge about tailoring health promotion strategies with advances in interactive technology. It will be customizable for specific purchasers and deal with the barriers to health enhancing behavior that are endemic to workplace settings. Phase I results strongly suggest that such a program is not only feasible, but potentially highly effective for employees and cost-effective for employers. By combining: (1) scientifically derived and validated content which is tailored to the individual user; (2) recognition and integration of the workplace context as part of the intervention strategy; and (3) use of state-of-the-art digital media formats and IVR technology to provide a rich, engaging, and flexible users experience, WOH-N will be a unique and cost-effective offering in the field of employee health risk management. A Phase II field trial is planned with a large employer group to test the hypothesis that participants exposed to WOH-N will demonstrate 1) significantly healthier eating and exercise behaviors, 2) lower BMI and blood pressure, and 3)significantly improved nutrition knowledge. Chronic diseases are now the major cause of death and disability worldwide. Conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, cancer and respiratory diseases, now account for 59% of the 57 million deaths annually and 46% of the global burden of disease, and are expected to rise to 73% and 60%, respectively, by 2020 (WHO, 2002). A few, largely preventable, risk factors, such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and obesity account for the majority of the chronic disease burden. Changes in dietary habits and physical activity can have a major impact in reducing the rates of these chronic diseases (WHO, 2004).",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Migraine headache is a common, chronic medical condition characterized by recurrent attacks of pain, disability, emotional distress, and loss of productivity that affects approximately 18% of women and 6.5% of men in the United States, an estimated 28 million Americans. Diagnosis and treatment of migraine is complex. Traditional treatment approaches have met with varied success, tending to \"medicalize\" patients, placing them in a passive role, with limited emphasis on active self-management. Only half of migraineurs are satisfied with their current care, and over 90% wish they could prevent their headaches (Wenzel et al., 2004a). A critical component of effective treatment is engaging the patient in self-management so they can learn how to identify, avoid, and manage headache triggers and engage in other critical headache management behaviors. Accessible help is needed to facilitate patient education and engagement in the adoption of behavioral self-management skills. The Internet is an excellent vehicle for helping migraineurs manage their headaches, but existing migraine Websites don't offer a tailored interactive experience and many are simply long, text-filled pages, offering no audio and limited graphical support. Some profess \"cures\" but offer information of questionable scientific validity. No migraine Websites have been tested to see how much they help patients improve headache management and attain symptom reduction. This proposal calls for the development of an interactive Website called ManageMyMigraine to provide up-to-date information about diagnosis, treatment, and management of migraine headache, designed for consumers. The site will engage users with many unique interactive features like self-assessments with tailored feedback, self-management recommendations that address patient priorities and problems, interactive tools for tracking individualized patient data (triggers, preventive strategies, medication usage, and side effects), and for monitoring progress in reducing headache frequency, managing symptoms, and engaging in preventive efforts. Individual data will be printable so that users can share it with their providers. While tailored interactive Websites are slowly becoming available, no migraine Website currently offers this combination of self-management support; interactive content, features, and tools; and tailored, individualized messaging to engage and support site users. Migraine related disability can be reduced by making behavioral support available in a more timely way for larger numbers of people. A focus on both medical and behavioral intervention, makes ManageMyMigraine a significantly innovative advance in migraine care, and holds the promise of helping migraineurs manage their condition more effectively, avoid disease progression, and reduce the high cost of migraine to individuals and society. Migraine headache is a common yet poorly managed illness and medically unrecognized migraine remains an important public health problem. Accurate recognition and effective treatment of migraine are critical when we consider the prevalence of migraine and the individual and societal costs associated with this disorder. There is a great need to educate the population about behavioral self-management of migraine. ManageMyMigraine, will provide user-tailored, interactive education and tracking tools for helping patients record and organize key clinical data to assist providers in more accurately assessing migraine disability and response to medical treatment. The site will serve as a psych-social adjunct to appropriate medical treatment. A focus on both medical and behavioral intervention, makes ManageMyMigraine a significantly innovative advance in migraine care, and holds the promise of helping migraineurs manage their condition more effectively, avoid disease progression, and reduce the high cost of migraine to individuals and society.",

Ultrasupercritical (USC) coal-fired boilers are being developed to operate with higher steam temperatures and steam pressures.  However, the increasing temperatures and corrosive environment cause more severe oxidation and corrosion in USC boiler components.  New surface modification technology is needed to solve the corrosion problem.  This project will develop an innovative process for forming an ultrafine-grained alloy coating at a competitive cost and will optimize coating materials and structures for high-temperature corrosion and erosion resistance.  Phase I demonstrated a process that is capable of producing a superior coating with nanometer grains, high adherence, and full density.  Extensive experimental tests were performed to evaluate coating performance under corrosion and erosion conditions, and promising coating systems were identified.  Phase II will demonstrate an improved, optimized manufacturing process, evaluate coating characteristics, and determine long-term exposure properties in simulated boiler environments and in field testing.   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardeee:  Potential applications include supercritical and ultrasupercritical boiler components, coal gasification systems, solid oxide fuel cell systems, hot-section components of steam turbines, land-based gas turbine engines and aerocraft engines, and other industry components involved in oxidation and corrosion at elevated temperatures.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Three companies have partnered to develop advanced systems for upper extremity prosthetics control. The combined expertise includes chronic nerve interface technology, bioresistant/biocompatible materials, polymer substrate electronics assembly and packaging, low impedance electrodes, sensory neurophysiology, coding techniques for prosthetic sensation, and advanced control, powered upper extremity prostheses. The specific aim is to improve upper extremity amputee prosthetic dexterity by providing important sensory feedback information beginning with grasp force, and slip detection but ultimately extending to joint angle and other sensory modalities. To accomplish this specific aim, implantable multi-channel peripheral nerve stimulation cuffs to provide prosthetic sensation to amputees will be further developed and marketed. Multi-channel nerve stimulation cuffs allow the input of sensory information with graded activity levels within individual fascicles of the residual median nerve for example. Since individual fascicles of cutaneous afferents are primarily associated with particular areas of the hand, and represented proportional to the importance of the function, the proposed selective stimulation system will provide anatomically appropriate loci of cutaneous perceptions. These implantable devices will have monolithic Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) substrates with integral interconnects and electronics with telemetry of power and data. LCP substrates are a novel, dimensionally stable, biocompatible and bioresistant material. This material can be processed in similar fashion to printed circuit boards and integrated circuits using photolithographic and micromachining methods. Prototype devices that are based on the successful Phase I developmental work will be fabricated thoroughly tested and then evaluated in an animal model. Following successful animal testing, 3 devices will be implanted in volunteer amputee subjects for providing sensory feedback from their instrumented powered arms. Appropriate sensors and feedback control software will be developed and fitted to each prosthesis. Where possible quantitative testing and analyses are planned finishing with independent performance evaluations by an independent occupational therapist. Early marketing to physiology groups will help further develop the technology. Based on results of the preliminary human testing, FDA approval will be obtained, limited sales will begin, and a full clinical test will be planned to further refine, evaluate and deploy the technology. LCP Nerve Cuff Project Narrative This new technology for providing sensory information from a prosthetic limb to the correlate neural pathways will substantially improve the quality of life of amputees by dramatically improving the utility of the prosthesis, improving the \"body image\" of the prosthesis, and may reduce the incidence of phantom pain since the neural pathways will be more normally active. This same technology will find application in re-animation of paralyzed limbs of the spinal cord injured and stroke patients, and restore bladder and bowel function as examples.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop a new process employing the superadiabatic reverse flow reactor to reform hydrogen sulfide into hydrogen with the simultaneous recovery of sulfur. Currently, the seven million tons of hydrogen sulfide produced each year as a byproduct of the reaction of sulfurous compounds with hydrogen are processed by Claus reactors into sulfur while wasting the much more valuable hydrogen content through oxidation. The successful development of the process would provide an economical means of dealing with hydrogen sulfide by retaining hydrogen. The Phase I project obtained the highest hydrogen yield ever achieved by a hydrogen sulfide process without the aid of external energy. Furthermore, the project attested that the reactor operates in regimes that eliminate sulfur dioxide. Building on the positive Phase I results; during this Phase II, a small pilot plant will be built and tested forming the basis for designing the commercial reactor with minimal modification.  The high price of gasoline and\nnatural gas is partly due to the high cost of extracting sulfurous compounds in the crude oil refining process. This desulphurization process uses hydrogen, obtained mostly from natural gas, to react with the organosulphur species to form hydrogen sulfide. A process that can produce hydrogen as well as sulfur from hydrogen sulfide would save the energy industry hundreds of millions dollars per year in addition to decreasing the cost of gasoline, diesel, and natural gas for consumers. In addition, the process will also eliminate millions of tons of acid-rain-causing sulfur dioxide produced during disposal of hydrogen sulfide.",

GPCRs are the single largest family of drug targets in the pharmaceutical industry, yet structural information about them is exceptionally difficult to obtain. The product that will arise from this proposal, the Structure-Activity Relationship Array (SARray), will enable structural interactions of GPCRs with drug candidates and other ligands to be determined at molecular resolution. We have demonstrated the feasibility of constructing SARrays and of using them to obtain useful structural information. We identified the structural determinants of five different CCR5 molecular interactions, including critical amino acids responsible for interacting with a chemokine (RANTES), two monoclonal antibodies (2D7 and 45523), HIV-1 Env (JRFL), and a small- molecule drug (TAK-779). Our results were validated against and agree with published results. The Specific Aims of our Phase 2 proposal are: I. Test the ability of SARray data to predict detailed receptor-ligand interactions II. Develop structure-activity analysis tools and data management software. III. Create SARrays for validated GPCR drug targets The product that results from this proposal will contribute to human health by facilitating the optimization and design of drugs targeted to GPCRs.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the device and market opportunity for in-plane propagation of light in-planar anisotropy magnetic garnet films for high sensitivity, high speed magneto-optic sensors, switches and modulators. Traditional perpendicular propagation devices require perpendicular magnetic fields and magnetization processes. These are limited in speed and sensitivity by the current materials and the energy required to magnetize the garnet in the perpendicular direction. In the plane of the film, there is almost no energetic barrier to domain rotation. In this project, Integrated Photonics, Inc. (IPI) proposes to reduce that barrier to near zero to make devices of unprecedented sensitivity and speed. The goal is to attain pico-tesla field sensitivities in sensors and gigahertz device frequencies. The latter will enable small, low-power magneto-optic light modulators that are truly a disruptive technology by comparison to current large dimension electro-optic technologies. In Phase I, a materials growth and\ncharacterization capability was established and limitations on speed and sensitivity were removed by optimizing material parameters. In Phase II the process will be optimized to achieve the highest optical quality for commercial devices and sensor, switch and modulator devices will be realized in collaboration with customer-partners.  Commercially, in-plane propagation in planar thick film Faraday rotators would enable unique new devices. High speed magneto-optic modulators open the door to system integration architecture for wideband communications and software defined radios. In-plane propagation materials have much higher switching speeds than conventional perpendicular Faraday rotators and as such would permit a magneto-optical approach to packet switching. Reduced costs would permit wide deployment in FTTP. High speed, low field magneto-optic switches are attractive for military applications.  In-plane propagation magnetic field sensors can be optimized to give unprecedented high sensitivity speeds much higher than can be attained with conventional perpendicular propagation. These sensors would have applications such as wheel and turbine rotation, electric power distribution, monitoring, metering and control and battlefield sensors. The electric power application in particular has potential to revolutionize catastrophic failure prevention in the power grid and reduce power costs at a variety of levels by enabling autonomous reconfiguration. The lack of electrical connectors in fiber optic sensors for explosive, flammable and high voltage environments represents a significant improvement in safety. Smart ships and buildings would find utility both for conservation and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-II project continues to address development of a novel packaging method for wafer-scale hermetic packaging of intelligent Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS). Packaging of MEMS along with their requisite electronics is one of the main technical barriers to commercialization of these devices. Packaging methods are often expensive, have long development cycles, and may adversely affect device performance and reliability. In cases where direct media access is required and the MEMS device needs to operate in harsh environments, protecting the electronics from the media provides a huge challenge. The proposed packaging approach consists of extending the MEMS device and etching a deep cavity into the substrate to house the electronics. A wafer-level hermetic bonding method will then be used to cap the electronics while allowing electrical connection between the electronics and the device. This Phase II project will focus on development of hermetic lead transfer using buried metal layers, and expansion of the\npackaging method to include wireless applications. Wired and wireless pressure sensor/electronics testbeds will be fabricated to verify overall system integration and evaluated both internally and by external customers.  The potential commercial value of this Small Business Innovation Research proposal will be in several areas. The most immediate area will be revenue from sale of foundry services for packaging and integration of MEMS and their associated electronics. Through its existing Foundry Services Division, ISSYS will provide a packaging platform for wired and wireless MEMS sensor/electronics subassemblies. The second source of revenue is product sales, where off-the-shelf MEMS pressure sensor subassemblies (wired and wireless) will be sold to customers in various medical and industrial fields. The long-term vision is use of this packaging platform for a variety of MEMS-based devices. According to Yole Development, the worldwide MEMS market is forecast to grow from $5.1 Billion in 2005 to $9.7 Billion in 2010. The main product families in this market are inkjet heads, pressure sensors, microphones, accelerometers, gyroscopes, optical MEMS, microfluidics, RF MEMS and micro-fuel cells. The proposed packaging technology will be highly beneficial to pressure sensors, microphones and microfluidic devices, with a combined market forecast of $2.5 Billion in 2010.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop and commercialize a novel, next-generation photoluminescence (PL)-based, palm-size and miniaturizable dissolved oxygen (DO) sensor. DO sensors are primary monitors of water quality in industrial wastewater treatment. The new sensor is based on a pioneering platform for PL-based biochemical sensors where the excitation source is a pulsed organic light emitting device (OLED) pixel array that is structurally integrated with the sensor component. The individually addressable pixels and the sensor film are fabricated on either side of the glass substrate. The photodetector is behind the OLED array, monitoring the PL passing between the OLED pixels. This uniquely simple structural integration enables multi-sensor fabrication on a single, compact substrate, and should therefore yield field-deployable micro-sensor arrays for simultaneous detection of various analytes.  This sensor has applicability in water quality measurements in wastewater treatment, power, pulp and paper, chemical, food, beverage, brewing, and pharmaceuticals\nplants, fish farms, fresh water, coastlines, and the oceans. Current sensors suffer from key drawbacks that limit their utility and application. Electrochemical sensors require frequent calibration and maintenance, and are typically slow to respond. PL-based sensors are expensive due to intricate design. The proposed sensor will be reliable, require very little maintenance/calibration, and will be inexpensive, with a flexible design and size. The proposed device will be uniquely simple, initially palm-size and eventually micro-size, autonomous, fast, miserly on power consumption, and inexpensive. It will be structurally integrated and will operate in a pulsed PL-lifetime mode, eliminating the need for optical components and frequent calibration.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With nearly one-third of the world's population (2 billion people) infected, tuberculosis (TB) is a major problem for global public health. The WHO estimates that each year 12 million people progress to active TB and 2 million of these people will die (WHO50/50, 2002). The current diagnosis for TB is cumbersome and involves multiple patient visits and tests which include culturing of sputum for 4-8 weeks, sputum microscopy, nucleic acid (NA) based tests and chest X-ray. There is an urgent need for a rapid, easy diagnostic test that could be performed at the public health clinic and give a diagnostic answer while the patient waits for the result. The long-term objective of this project is to develop a \"smartDNA\"-based simple, rapid and inexpensive NA diagnostic test for TB that can be used at the point-of-care (POC). Investigen's \"smartDNA technology\" is an elegant and innovative approach to detect TB NA. smartDNA is isothermal and colorimetric. Currently Investigen's research protocol for smartDNA TB detection is: (1) conventional sputum treatment, (2) sample disruption, (3) sample processing by peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-microparticle capture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) NA, and (4) rapid catalytic 'light-activated' color change of a dye when a second PNA probe binds to complementary NA sequences. The successful development of the smartDNA POC TB detection assay requires six steps: (1) develop detection chemistry and reagents, using off the shelf consumables; (2) improve an in-lab activator/reader instrument; (3) develop simple sputum processing chemistry and reagents, using off the shelf consumables. Steps (4) to (6) translate the first three steps into an integrated LabTop smartDNA detection system with specially designed POC consumables. In this Phase II proposal, we address only the first three steps. The development of an easy to use integrated system with sample preparation and NA detection is our long term goal. The specific aims of this work are to (1) design MTC-specific PNA probes signature sequences; (2) optimize PNA-microparticle conjunction method; (3) identify capture PNAs that specifically capture signature NA sequences in isolated genomic DNA; (4) identify capture PNAs that can capture signature NA sequences from crude cell lysates; (5) identify PNA probes that efficiently promote the \"light-activated\" dye conversion; (6) evaluate the developed system with cells spiked into sputum sediments; (7) evaluate methods for simplification of sputum processing; (8) improve the in-lab smartDNA activator/reader instrument; and (9) test the smartDNA system with patient samples. The rapid and accurate diagnosis of TB is critical to the treatment of the disease and the reduction of the large-scale global public health threat it presents. The smartDNA assay developed during this Phase II project will greatly improve the state of TB diagnosis and treatment, and accordingly, is relevant to the NIH mission of reducing the burden of illness through supporting research for the improved diagnosis, prevention and cure of human diseases. While the United States has been largely successful in detecting, treating and controlling TB, in many countries TB is a serious and growing public health issue; international travel and immigration have increased transmission of the disease. The research to be completed in this project will lead to the development of a point of care TB test that will provide a result at the time of testing; a system that can be used in resource limited settings throughout the world, in clinics and emergency rooms in the United States and potentially even at US borders - greatly aiding the public heath services in the detection, treatment and control of TB.",

The fundamental scientific knowledge gained during Phase 1 will enable the research team to manufacture laser-sensing surfaces reliably. The goal for Phase 1 is to produce, without failure, five laser-sensing surfaces with a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 3:1. The Phase 2 Fast-Track research focuses on demonstrating the reliability, safety, and efficacy of the Safe- laser Pointing System for individuals with Locked-in Syndrome by completing three major tasks. First, the technical team will continue its work by optimizing the laser-sensing surface developed in Phase 1 and producing reliable prototypes for clinical evaluation. Second, we must design a Safe-laser pointer that is lightweight, and easy to wear and point. Third, individuals with Locked-in Syndrome (LIS), their families, and the professionals that care for them will comprehensively evaluate these prototypes over an 18-month clinical study. This evaluation will demonstrate the reliability and safety of the prototypes, and the efficacy of the Safe-laser Pointing System for meeting the assistive technology needs of the underserved LIS population, both from the perspective of training assistive technology use and successfully integrating technology into their lives. The Safe-laser Pointing System is an important, innovative, access method for a wide range of disability etiologies, including cerebral palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, traumatic brain injury, and myasthenia gravis.

During Phase 1 we completed a design of an e-beam system suitable for maintaining air purity for an enclosed four men space station.  The system is compact, light weight and will fit readily in line with an air conditioning duct.  In Phase II, we will detail the design, and build a prototype of the e-beam system.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Iris AO is developing exciting technologies that enable in vivo cellular-level retinal imaging. The cutting-edge adaptive-optics (AO) systems Iris AO develops increases the axial and transverse resolution of retinal images 5 fold. AO is used to correct for the optical aberrations in the eye that drastically reduce the resolution of conventional retinal images. Deformable mirrors (DM), the enabling component in AO systems, correct aberration by changing shape to compensate for the aberrations. This Phase II SBIR is dedicated to building advanced Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) DMs for clinical retinal-imaging systems. Imaging systems with AO exist in but a few cutting edge research laboratories throughout the world. In all of these systems, the most limiting aspect is the DM. These systems use DMs originally designed for telescopes or other applications because these are all that are available. This SBIR will bring DMs specifically designed for retinal imaging into the hands of researchers and then into clinical retinal imaging systems. Developing clinical-ready DMs will bring the benefits of these advanced imaging techniques to the general population. Iris AO's comprehensive expertise from DM manufacturing to building AO retinal-imaging systems for daily use in studying retinal diseases at the cellular-level will drive a revolution in advanced imaging techniques. By bringing AO out of the lab and into the clinical setting, this technology will have profound benefits. Iris AO's goals parallel the NEI mission of gaining a better understanding of visual function and fighting debilitating eye diseases. Iris AO engineers have helped pioneer studies in early disease detection by looking at the retina with the unprecedented resolution afforded by AO. This proposal directly meets objectives laid out in the NEI National Plan by developing a critical component in AO systems that will be used in AO-equipped SLO and OCT systems. This research will develop the DM over two iterations, refining the manufacturing each step of the way. Finite element analysis, performance testing, and failure studies will feed into the design to create robust mirrors. The development will focus on clinically valuable mirrors by meeting the required correction performance and solving practical issues necessary to bring AO into the clinical setting. After the mirror is built and tested in an AO test bed, it will be integrated into an existing AO retinal imaging system to image photoreceptors. This exciting high-performance technology will enable in vivo imaging of cellular structure to be done on the general populace instead of hand-picked research subjects as is the practice today. Research from this SBIR will enable a powerful new tool for early retinal disease detection and better understanding of visual function. The resulting technology puts the ability to observe into the retina at the cellular level into the hands of clinicians, thereby allowing them to see the start of a retinal disease before debilitating damage has been done.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses the need for effective school-wide strategies that improve elementary school climate and ensure that common areas and classrooms are managed in ways that allow all students to be safe and secure. In Phase I, successful group-training materials were developed for school staff, Systematic Supervision: Creating A Safe and Positive Playground. This interactive multimedia training covered the basic techniques of common-area supervision, positive behavior support (PBS), and team-based data analysis and intervention planning for use on school playgrounds by staff. It included compatible behavioral expectation training materials for students - the award-winning video Play by the Rules. In Phase II project, school-wide systematic supervision training will be extended to all other school environments where adult supervision and behavior support are difficult to provide. This training will be formatted for both group (DVD) and individual (interactive web) study. The evaluation of the Phase II product will be conducted using a wait-list control design and the active participation of the Los Angeles Unified School District and the San Francisco Unified School District. The evaluation of the effects of the Phase II training will use direct observations, archival student data (office discipline referrals, etc.), normed and validated measures for staff and students, and program-specific measures to answer three core questions: First, does multimedia training of staff (and students) in specific areas systematic supervision result in an improved school climate? Second, does the training result in increased levels of staff self-efficacy for maintaining order in the public areas of the school? And third, does the training result in improved and adequate mastery of skills concerning the supervision and behavioral strategies presented to staff? In order to answer these questions, the following tasks will be completed: 1) Develop four new training components to be delivered using an Internet-enhanced DVD format -eDVD, 2) Conduct focus groups with school professionals, parents, and students to ensure that program content will be compatible with the school environment and sensitive to the needs of diverse school communities, and 3) Evaluate the Systematic Supervision program with a wait-list control design with 36 schools assigned to intervention or control conditions using measures that describe the school environment and the behavior of administrators, teachers and staff, and students.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women are one of the fastest growing populations being infected with HIV in the United States and face unique challenges when it comes to preventing the spread of the disease. Unlike men, heterosexual transmission accounts for over 75% of all new HIV cases in women. Primary male partners are the chief source of infection. Moreover, the risk of becoming infected with HIV is increased two to five times when infected with another STD. Indeed, two-thirds of new STD infections occur in women. Finally, the primary method to prevent the spread of HIV is the correct and consistent use of the male latex or polyurethane condom. For women this presents a significant challenge because male partner resistance to condoms is an important barrier in heterosexual relationships. The proposed Phase II project will involve expansion and completion of the Safe Sistah prototype program developed during Phase I. This will include enhancing the existing multimedia assets, providing more opportunities to personally tailor the program, and offering it in both Spanish and English. The full program will be guided by three core goals. First, teach users gender-specific prevention skills. Second, emphasize the importance of preventing and treating STDs besides HIV. Finally, enhance feelings of empowerment and gender identity. The effectiveness of the Safe Sistah program will be examined in a rigorous field test. The field test will involve randomly assigning 300 women to receive either the Safe Sistah program or to a treatment as usual condition, assessing participants before, 3-months, and 6-months after their program experience. The primary outcome measure will be self-reported consistent condom use as this has been shown to be effective in reducing sexually transmitted HIV. In addition, the use of alternative risk reducing strategies, mediators of risk reducing behavior, and the presence of STD symptoms will also be assessed. If significant impact of the web-based program is demonstrated, it will be revised and prepared for marketing to STD clinics. This project aims to develop a web-based HIV/STD prevention program for women who have sex with men attending publicly-funded STD clinics. For clinics, this will allow them to provide an empirically validated HIV/STD prevention intervention to their clients without creating additional demands on their already overburdened staff. For women, the skills contained in this program will help them reduce risk behaviors and, ultimately, prevent the spread of HIV/STDs.",

The USDA reports that the current use of two key tools\nfor STS, larvicides and pheromone mating disruption, have serious shortcomings for an area-wide\nprogram. In Phase I ISCA Technologies formulated SPLAT-GM using a long-lasting wax emulsion\nsemiochemical delivery technology (SPLAT) for the controlled release of the synthetic GM\npheromone, racemic disparlure. SPLAT-GM was applied with conventional aerial spray equipment\nin 40-acre plots and shown to promote complete mating disruption of GM for over 10 weeks in the\nfield. SPLAT-GM L, our dual-action formulation for the controlled release of racemic disparlure\nand an organic larvicide, preserved the desired long-lasting pheromone emission characteristic of\nSPLAT-GM and retained larvicidal properties for over 100 days. In Phase II, we will build upon the\nsuccess of Phase I to optimize the slow release formulations, and test single applications of SPLATGM\nand SPLAT-GM L with conventional sprayers early in spring on small (40-acre) and large\n(1000-acre) field trials in the first and second years. If successful, Phase II will result in SPLAT-GM\nfor mating disruption, and SPLAT-GM L for dual-action larval control and mating disruption,\nrepresenting savings to STS (if adopted) of approximately $40/ha or $50 million if used over the\nprevious four years.",

This electrochemical polymerization of biomolecule-friendly conducting polymers was developed and successfully tested to build functional, highly reliable nanosensors. This research will address key technical challenges in automating the fabrication of antibody-functionalized conducting nanowires that are individually addressable and scalable to high-density biosensor arrays for the detection of Huanglongbing (HLB). The resultant nanosensory-arrays will form the base for the development of small, effective, inexpensive, field worthy, autonomous and automated pathogen detection devices. These units will permit the unattended processing of a large number of field samples, thus increasing the temporal and geographical density of data collection, providing superior pathogen and agri-terror detection.  Current disease management techniques typically lack the data collection technologies needed to avert epidemics; diagnostic instruments are\nnot amenable to unattended autonomous operation. Devices currently used are slow, expensive, bulky, and must interface with humans. Consequently, only few pathogen introductions are detected before causing widespread disease or epidemics. This research will increase the efficiency in detection of plant pathogens and agents of disease, allowing for preventative rather than crisis or remedial control actions. The development of this automated system can mitigate the estimated $300 billion loss due to agricultural pests.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our goals in Phases I and II have been completed and showed the feasibility of our approach for assessing brain vascular autoregulatory responses to hypoxic stimuli. Frequency Domain Near-Infrared Spectroscopy offers the advantage of performing safe, non-invasive, transcranial, quantitative, real time measurements of cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation. Our main objective was the launch of this technique in Sleep Medicine Research. The standard diagnostic instrumentation (polysomnography) used in Sleep Medicine gives important information on the functionality of different systems. However, it does not provide the clinician with information on cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics during sleep, that are important factors to determine. The assessment of these parameters, via near infrared spectroscopy, in Obstructive Sleep Apnea sufferers is crucial because of the high prevalence of this affliction and of the significant cardio/cerebrovascular health risk it represents. Although this has been a technical research proposal, we have been excited with the enormous potential of the scientific information we obtained during the few preclinical trials of Phase II of this application. We developed the first commercially available Absolute Near-Infrared Oximeter (OxiplexTS). This is a portable device that may be applied in conjunction with other devices such as the standard polysomnography equipment to monitor the severity of the apneic insult on the brain during overnight testing. This instrumentation may be also applied as a stand alone tool to facilitate cost-effective early detection and screening of morbid cardio/cerebrovascular effects of medical conditions such as Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome. In this Phase III clinical trial we propose to perform the necessary number of clinical studies required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Investigational New Devices and assess performance standards of OxiplexTS related to the FDA approval process. The overall goal of ISS, Inc. is the commercialization of an FDA approved instrument for applications in Sleep Medicine as well as in the broader field of clinical cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diagnostics. The socioeconomic benefit lies in identifying patients at cardiovascular risk. Subsequent timely treatment minimizes costly therapy of the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular sequelae of disorders such as sleep apnea as well as reduces mortality. Our ultimate goal is the FDA approval and the introduction of the Frequency Domain Near-infrared Brain Oximeter (OxiplexTS) in clinical diagnostics for the investigation of brain oxygenation and hemodynamics. The evaluation of brain vascular autoregulatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia enable the assessment of the brain vascular health.

PFB is characterized by skin lesions (e.g. \"razor bumps\"), skin discoloration, and/or irritation. Pseudofolliculitis can affect almost anyone who shaves; however, the disease disproportionately affects African-American and Hispanic males. PFB is especially problematic for military personnel and first-line responders (e.g., police officers, firemen, hazmat and healthcare workers, etc.). These individuals may have open sores or lesions on the face and neck as a result of PFB which makes them more susceptible to infection or chemical and biological agents. The broad long term objectives of this study are to gain FDA approval and commercialize a therapeutic product for the management and treatment of PFB. To meet the objectives of this Phase II SBIR grant proposal, a randomized, placebo-controlled study will be conducted at two study sites. Subjects with PFB who meet eligibility requirements will be enrolled for up to seven weeks. Results will be assessed by the physician and the subject using quantitative and qualitative parameters. Successful outcomes of the proposed studies will advance ISW Group's topical dermatologic formulation along the regulatory approval process leading to commercialization.         The research proposed in the Phase II SBIR application aims to develop an FDA approved topical product for management and treatment of Pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB), a chronic inflammatory skin condition. Pseudofolliculitis barbae affects a large number of individuals who shave; however, it is particularly problematic for African-American and Hispanic males; and Caucasian males to a lesser degree. The development of a safe and effective topical product for PFB is likely to yield applications for other acute and chronic inflammatory skin conditions, thereby, further benefiting society as a whole.",

        "abstract": "This NSF SBIR Phase II project aims to develop and produce a novel suite of algorithms to enhance the performance of thermal imagers, offering real-time solutions in the automotive, surveillance and other segments of the thermal imaging market.  The proposed algorithm is integrated with noise-infested, uncooled microbolometer infrared cameras, elevating their performance and offering manufacturing-cost reductions while adding new features and capabilities. At the heart of the approach is a Scene-Based NonUniformity Correction (SBNUC) algorithm, which works to correct the fixed-pattern noise resulting from nonuniform detector-to-detector responses in the focal-pane array. The novel SBNUC approach relies on exploiting the presence of minute amounts of scene/camera motion in a video sequence, naturally present in almost all applications, to algebraically extract the nonuniformity-noise parameters in a dynamic fashion, without the need for a mechanical shutter, as done conventionally. This approach improves the camera's reliability.  If successfully\ncommercialized, the largest market is in the automotive sector, where the lower cost and improved performance of the device can potentially lead to tens of millions of dollars from new installs of collision-avoidance systems in cars and trucks. The enhanced features and lower costs offered by this technology also offer the potential of expanding the use of thermal imaging in other applications.  In the firefighting market segment, equipping every firefighter with a thermal imager will reduce the number of fatalities due to smoke inhalation, heat, and response efficiency. In security applications, more information will be delivered at a higher level of quality.",

The electron source for the ILC is a laser-driven photocathode, and the primary unproven part of this technology is the development of a laser with the required pulse characteristics and average power.  This project will develop a laser system capable of generating pulse bursts of coherent ~800 nm light with the following characteristics:  (1) ~5 \u00b5J of energy in each pulse, (2) a 3 MHz repetition rate, and (3) 2820 pulses in each individual burst.  The technical approach involves the development of an oscillator-amplifier laser system based on a titanium-doped sapphire in the required wavlength range.  ILC power requirements also dictate the use of a cryogenically-cooled laser medium and 50-100W of \"pump\" light to power the amplifier.  In Phase I, a test bed was constructed to measure single pass gain, mode quality, and energy of a high repetition rate, cw-pumped amplifier laser system at 3 MHz, at repetition rates between 10-250 kHz.

Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The pulsed laser system should provide unprecedented repetition-rate and average-power characteristics for the ILC application.

Kestrel's three dimensional hyperspectral retinal imager concept merges two developing technologies, Fourier Transform hyperspectral imaging technology and Integral Field Spectroscopy. The two technologies allow an imaged region to be spatially sampled in a two dimensional area while retaining the spectral information in each sample. These samples are then processed and reassembled to create a full three dimensional hyperspectral data cube containing two spatial dimensions with full spectral content of the selected area. In Phase 1 Kestrel successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed technology. Phase 2 builds on this success by implementing a prototype of a new retinal imager that can be used to advance the knowledge the mechanisms of retinal diseases and the clinical practice to manage such illnesses. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: Aim 1. Address the effects of fabrication of the Integral Field Unit on the spectral data. Aim 2. Obtain the optimum configuration of the Integral Field Unit for medical applications. Aim 3. Build a prototype of a new kind of fundus imager that can collect complete hyperspectral data cubes in single exposures. Aim 4. Collect a comprehensive database of spectral signatures of retinal features from normal subjects and subjects presenting different degrees of diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. Aim 5. Demonstrate the clinical value of spectral imaging of the retina by determining features in the spectral information that correlate with the current assessment of retinal health status. Applications for this technology exist across a wide range of biomedical imaging. The value of hyperspectral medical imaging and especially its application in ocular uses is slowly gaining recognition. However, the current implementation of these hyperspectral devices limits their transition to wide spread clinical and research in vivo uses because of the techniques employed in collecting a three dimensional data cube are for practical purposes unusable.

Because each person's disability is unique, tuning these devices to each user's strengths and limitations is often critical for success. The software will assess current user performance with an input device and recommend the appropriate configuration for that device. The complete system is known as the Input Device Agent, or IDA. Three main groups of input devices will be supported: keyboards, mice and other pointing devices, and switches. In Phase I, several decision algorithms for configuring input devices were developed and evaluated, demonstrating that they yielded useful recommendations for computer users with physical disabilities. In Phase II, the components of the IDA system will be expanded, enhanced, and evaluated, resulting in at least a beta-level version for the Windows operating system. The specific goals to be achieved are outlined below: 1. Complete a system architecture that defines clear software interfaces between modular components and supports the easy addition of new components to the basic system as they are developed. 2. Design, develop, and evaluate a user interface that meets users' needs for an easy-to-use, powerful, and efficient system. 3. Develop new decision algorithms to support additional input device settings, and improve existing decision algorithms. 4. Evaluate the decision algorithms with a variety of end users for utility and technical quality. The resulting beta version of IDA will then be refined into Version 1.0 and commercialized as a stand-alone software application in Phase III. - Software for Computer Input Devices The proposed IDA software promises to provide real benefits to computer users with disabilities by configuring the computer to the user's needs and providing follow-up to ensure that the interface remains well-suited to the user.

        "abstract": "The purpose of this project is to develop a new line of cold-tolerant, disease-resistant shrimp which will provide distinct commercial advantages to shrimp farmers in non-tropical climates, such as the United States, where colder water temperatures and pathogens restrict shrimp production. Successful development of this novel shrimp line will allow U.S. shrimp farmers to significantly increase production and offset a large trade imbalance due to imported shrimp products.\nDuring Phase I, Kona Bay Marine Resources (Kona Bay) created a new line of shrimp using intraspecific hybridization of two pure-bred lines, the Kona line noted for its cold tolerance and a line resistant to Taura Syndrome Virus (TSV-R line). All three lines (Kona, TSV-R, and Hybrid) were evaluated for growth and survival in cold (~20oC) and warm (~28 oC) water, as well as for resistance to four different isolates of TSV. Results indicate that growth and survival of shrimp from the Hybrid line were greater than growth and survival of shrimp from the Kona and TSV-R lines in cold water. Superior growth and pond survival of shrimp from the Hybrid line were more marked at the lower water temperature, indicating that the Hybrid line is less sensitive to temperature differences. Survival of shrimp from the Hybrid line was approximately the arithmetical mean survival of the Kona and TSV-R lines after TSV exposure. In summary, the Hybrid line created during Phase I research is commercially superior to either pure-bred line in all traits except TSV resistance.\nThe objective of the Phase II proposal is to identify the best strategy for transferring TSV resistance from the TSV-R line to the Hybrid line, and the best strategy to ensure continued improvement in growth, pond survival, and TSV resistance. Two alternative approaches will be evaluated and the preferred strategy will be used to produce postlarvae to conduct on-farm trials at two commercial shrimp farms in the U.S., one in Texas and one in Hawaii.\nLocated in the State of Hawaii, Kona Bay was founded in 1996 and is the worlds leading producer of specific pathogen free (SPF) and specific pathogen resistant (SPR) shrimp broodstock and disease-free clam seed.",

        "abstract": "In current networks, service is initiated at the time of service request.  Upon receipt of a service request, the network checks to determine if capacity is available to satisfy the needs of the service request.  If sufficient capacity is available, service is initiated; if sufficient capacity is not available, the service request is rejected.  This mode of operation introduces problems for some types of scientific users who require network service at a specific data rate at a specific future time and for a specific duration, for example, at the occurrence of some scientific phenomenon.  This project will develop algorithms to perform path generation for scheduled service and will enhance Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling and routing protocols to include time based service.  In Phase I, new scheduling algorithms were formulated using min-plus algebra that will efficiently compute the time based schedule paths.  GMPLS protocol enhancements to support scheduling were specified with respect to both the signaling and routing objects for all applicable GMPLS protocol messages.  Phase II will develop a proof-of-concept prototype that will demonstrate these enhancements in a realistic hardware-software environment.  The proposed modifications to the GMPLS protocols and the infrastructure will be standardized by working with telecommunications carriers and the standards community.   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A portable implementation of the protocols for the LINUX operating system should be of interest to both government and commercial network operators.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Cell culture bioassays are often laborious and imprecise even after substantial development efforts. These bioassays are used broadly in the biotechnology industry to measure protein or vaccine products in development and for lot release. Imprecise assays and slow assay development contribute to slow product development. Common practice in cell culture bioassay ignores statistical and regulatory guidance by failing to utilize proper randomization and not accounting for group effects (i.e.; as caused by multi-channel pipettes). In addition, lack of attention to location effects within the assays, combined with simplistic analyses of assay data, compromise the precision and efficiency of cell culture bioassays. Lansky Consulting LLC will develop a standardized approach to cell culture bioassay using laboratory robots followed by modern statistical analysis. This combination will address the need for randomization, location effects, serial dilution, grouped dilution, and multiple sources of variation in assay response. The work described in this proposal will demonstrate the performance gains associated with: 1) standardized designs (including designs that require robots for randomization), 2) linear and nonlinear mixed split- or strip-plot models for bioassay analysis, and 3) advances in implementation of this modern standardized approach to bioassays. The precision gains from the combined package of modern bioassay methods will be shown to reduce the need for sample replication by an order of magnitude or more. Both simulated data and long-term lab experiments with bioassays will be used. The benefits of these new methods include lower assay costs, rapid application to new assay systems, and easy access to best practices in design, implementation, and analysis. Most importantly, by building a turnkey robotic and analysis bioassay system, this level of assay performance will be made broadly available to the biotechnology industry as well as to non-profit researchers. Project Summary Narrative Bioassays are critical measurement systems for both development and lot release of pharmaceutical protein and vaccine products. Easy access to high performance bioassays will enable faster and better informed development of biotechnology products. Improved bioassay technology will bring unique, important protein and vaccine products to market more quickly to address pressing medical needs.",

Evaluation of thermal pain sensitivity in humans can be useful in describing the potential utility of putative analgesic drugs. The ability to reliably, differentiate pain mediated by the activation of unmyelinated (C) or myelinated (A-delta) nociceptors may also provide allow for more accurate prediction of the efficacy of pain treatments. There is also a potential utility of being able to differentially as certain pain mediated by these two afferent types in establishing a diagnosis for, and following the progress of patients in pain. Thus, it is our overall goal to establish stimulation protocols for use with our unique infrared diode laser that will allow, in humans, for the differential assessment of pain evoked by the activation of these two nociceptor types, and to test these protocols using benchmark pharmacologic agent. Thus, we hypothesize that the infrared diode laser will prove safe and reliable, such that it, and its components will be certifiable for meeting FDA requirements for non-invasive skin heating. To do this, we will determine the stimulus intensity margin between pain threshold measurement and skin damage. In addition, we will insure complete compatibility of the laser with functional magneto-resonance imaging systems and EEG cortical evoked potential recording systems, making any hardware and software adjustments that are necessary. We will also submit the laser and its components for certification as to electrical and magnetic interference and for medical laser safety standards, and make any device changes that are necessary to meet the requirements. We will also insure that the device protocols will allow for accurate and differential assessment of proalgesic and analgesic effects of drugs known to differentially affect C or A-delta nociceptors, including the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin, the A-delta sensitizing solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and the mu opioid analgesic morphine. To do this, we will assess psychophysical and cortical (EEG) responses evoked by brief pulses that activate A-delta nociceptors, or longer pulses that activate C fiber nociceptors.",

This laser will be very useful for new drug discovery and evaluation, as there is currently no commercially available tool of similar capabilities. Evaluation of TRP family proteins can be useful in describing the potential utility of putative analgesic drugs. The ability to selectively (by temperature thresholds), reliably and reproducibly activate TRPs may also provide unique utility in understanding the mechanisms of antagonist action (binding) and provide additional information about mechanisms of interaction of different TRP proteins in cells and nerve tissue. There is also a potential utility of being able to differentially evaluate pain mediated by TRPV1 or TRPV2 proteins in the diagnosis and monitoring of progression of pain patients. Thus, it is our overall goal to establish stimulation protocols for use with a laser stimulator for in vitro and in vivo activation of heat gated ion channels. Laser stimulation is used for selective activation of C and A delta fibers in humans and rats (in our parallel projects), allowing reproducible protocols to test putative analgesic, from cell culture to humans. Thus, we hypothesize that the laser ion channel stimulator will prove safe and reliable action and will meet the FDA requirements for a laser device. To do this, we will develop an additional electronic circuit that allows the blockade of laser emission through the microscope, protecting eyes from any damage. We will also submit the laser and its components for certification of electrical and magnetic interference standards, and make any device changes that are necessary to meet the requirements. In addition, we will develop a protocol of direct temperature measurement of laser-induced temperature and modify the device to allow a tunable rate of heating. We will also insure the compatibility of the laser with calcium imaging and will continue to test the laser with TRPV1 DRG and HEK293 cells in order to study sensitization/desensitization processes. To do this we will apply brief and prolonged laser pulses and capsazepine. We will test the concept of TRP-associated activation of C and A delta fibers by direct laser activation of nerve fibers and application of the TRPV1 and TRPV2 antagonists capsazepine and ruthenium red. In vitro and in vivo protocols of non-invasive repeatable and reproducible activation of heat gated ion channels (TRP) can be useful tool for discovery and developing of analgesics. The ability to reliably, activate TRPV1/TRPV2 proteins in cell cultures and in tissue (in vivo) may also provide more accurate prediction of the efficacy of pain treatments based on TRP's antagonists.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to complete the development a novel technology for collecting and delivering proteins in the brain of freely behaving animals.  The central element of this technology is an implantable, Laser-perforated and Push-pull Perfused (LAPP) microprobe.  As demonstrated in Phase I, the use of these probes has the potential to monitor, for the first time, dynamic changes in the levels of extracellular proteins, such as inflammatory cytokines and polypeptide hormones, over many months and during various behaviors and disease states.  No current technology has this capability.  The information generated with this method should be indispensable for understanding the involvement of proteins in the course of neurological disorders.  Furthermore, it is inherent to the LAPP technology that it allows not only the collection but, simultaneously, the efficient delivery of proteins and other agents into the extracellular space in brain.  As a consequence, LAPP probes will predictably be integrated in future intracranial drug delivery devices for the treatment of otherwise incurable neurological disorders.  The first Specific Aim is to perfect the LAPP microprobes and diversify its shape and capacity, so that it can be used for measurements from both the brain tissue and the subdural space. The second Specific Aim is to further refine the accessory push-pull-pump and protein-harvesting systems that are necessary for the use of the probes. In order to satisfy the needs of a broad range of potential users, two versions of this system will be constructed.  One can be used on the laboratory bench, whereas the other one will be a miniaturized, telemetry-controlled version portable by the experimental animal.  The third Specific Aim is to demonstrate the unique potential of the completed apparatus in an animal experiment.  Namely, the LAPP probes will be implanted in the brain of rats, and changes in the extracellular levels of a class of inflammatory proteins called cytokines will be monitored for a full month, before and after the induction of epileptic seizures.  The LAPP probes will be manufactured at Lenox Laser, the accessory systems will be developed and the animal studies will be conducted at NYU School of Medicine, and the cytokine measurements will be carried out by RayBiotech, Inc.  Neuroscientists, engineers and biochemists will collaborate in order to accomplish the objectives of this enterprise, offering a completely new brain research tool by the end of the project and laying the groundwork for incorporating the developed products in future diagnostic and therapeutic devices.     This project will develop a novel, implantable microprobe that is able to efficiently collect and deliver proteins in brain, allowing scientists to reveal the roles of these molecules in such diseases as epilepsy, stroke or AIDS related dementia.  This information should help to devise new strategies for the diagnosis and therapy of these, and perhaps other, devastating brain disorders.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this work is to transition the development of a ventricular assist system designed to support neonates and small children from animal testing into a single center clinical trial. The 2001 report of the NHLBI) sponsored Task Force on Research in Pediatric Cardiovascular Disease identified the pressing need for novel systems to support children severely compromised by congenital cardiovascular malformations, cardiomyopathies, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, myocardial infarctions and coronary artery aneurysms. The pediatric ventricular assist device under development by Levitronix and its development partner the University of Pittsburgh (UOP) is intended to fulfill the need for acute and temporary cardiac life support (up to 4 weeks) in infants and small children. Our goal will be to extend technology associated with a small-scale paracorporeal MagLev centrifugal blood pump, to create a clinical product for infants and small children. Uniquely, this pump has no seals, bearings or other movable parts that are traditionally associated with thrombus formation or mechanical failure. In Phase I of the project, we demonstrated the soundness of this technology for the pediatric application through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. In Phase II of the project, we optimized pump design to accommodate the hemodynamic conditions typical for the pediatric patient and demonstrated effective hemodynamic performance and biocompatibility in a series of in vivo implants simulating clinically realistic conditions. Acknowledging the importance and clinical need of advancing this technology rapidly into the clinical arena, we propose here a Phase II Continuation to support the completion of the hardware development to its final clinical form, performance of the final series of pre-clinical animal testing using the clinical-form hardware; and, the initiation of clinical trials. Our specific Aims include: Aim 1: Characterize the in vitro hemodynamic properties and hemocompatibility of Levitronix pediatric VAD-cannula system (PediVAS). Aim 2: Determine PediVAS function and biocompatibility in the juvenile ovine model. Aim 3. Conduct preliminary clinical safety and efficacy trials of the Levitronix PediVAS in infants and children with heart failure. In achieving these goals, these results will lead to a novel therapeutic opportunity to improve the care of children with congenital and/or acquired cardiac defects. By achieving the above specific aims, we intend to fabricate fully verified and validated hardware, establish component reliability, and conduct a pilot phase clinical trial. Levitronix has substantial experience in fabricating clinical-use blood pump hardware and meeting regulatory requirements for clinical trial testing. The University of Pittsburgh and Children's Hospital have more than 20 years of experience in the clinical testing and validation of ventricular assist devices for adult and pediatric patients. The research team, consisting of Levitronix and University of Pittsburgh, is thus positioned to conduct the first FDA approved clinical trial of a pediatric VAD. If successful, these results will lead to a novel therapeutic option for the care of children with congenital and/or acquired cardiac defects. 7. Project Narrative The PediVAS system is being developed to address the need to support children with severely compromised heart conditions. The pediatric ventricular assist device is intended to fulfill the need for acute and temporary cardiac life support (up to 4 weeks) in infants and small children.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Particle (proton and ion) beam radiotherapy holds the promise for improving cancer radiation treatment since it delivers energy in a better localized volume than X-ray (photon) therapy, owing to the Bragg peak of energy deposition near the end of an ion track. This increases the proportion of tumor cells to healthy cells that are damaged in radiation therapy. Current and future facilities require detectors to monitor the beam in real time for safety and to verify the dosimetry. This is especially true for facilities performing scanning beam therapy, since they can yield the best treatment results, using intensity modulated particle therapy, and highest patient throughputs but conversely need the best monitoring to ensure safety and proper dosage. We are developing a new scintillator-based detector for monitoring a scanning particle beam as it is used to irradiate the patient. This detector will track the position of the beam with millimeter and microsecond resolution in real-time in order to verify the beam position. In addition the detector will monitor the accumulated dose over a scan in order to validate the treatment. Using a scintillator means that the proton beam is minimally affected and no delicate components are exposed to the beam. The only component in the beam, the scintillator, is inherently robust and should show little aging due to the beam, and is inexpensive to replace, in any event. In Phase I, we tested several scintillators at the Francis H. Burr Proton Therapy Center at Mass. General Hospital (formerly called Northeast Proton Therapy Center or NPTC) and found two with the properties needed for a detector with the required position response, time response, and linearity. In Phase II, we will design and fabricate a working detector that is integrated into that treatment facility with the final scintillator chosen after additional measurements and design considerations. The design will provide the baseline detector that can easily be adapted to other proton and particle centers with some customization. A scanning particle beam facility requires a detector that performs like the one proposed. While many other elements go into a useful facility, this detector is a necessary item that helps produce improved radiation treatments for a wide variety of cancers. In addition to particle radiotherapy, the high resolution offered by robust, scintillator-based detectors also has application to photon radiotherapy. In particular, QA of IMRT treatment plans, which is currently time- consuming and difficult to perform with existing detectors, could be significantly improved using our technology. Part of our Phase II development will be devoted to this application, which can have significant impact on a radiotherapy modality that has a very large market. The proposed research will develop novel medical devices for radiotherapy, both for newer cancer radiation treatment facilities that use scanning particle beams and for more conventional facilities that use high-energy X-rays for IMRT. Intensity modulated radiation therapy requires better diagnostics in order to safely concentrate the radiation dose in the diseased tissue while sparing healthy tissue. The outcome of this research will enable therapists to deliver intensity modulated radiotherapy with greater confidence and patient safety and will also increase patient throughput and hence lower treatment costs. The net result will be improved cancer treatment for more patients.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medication noncompliance is highly problematic in pharmaceutical studies. Without direct observation of pill-taking patterns, investigators - much like clinicians - are often misled by reported adherence, resulting in false interpretation of a protocol's true efficacy. Pill counts fail to reveal timing of intake, lost or hoarded medications, and \"white coat\" compliance before appointments. Applied researchers have relied on recall questionnaires for collecting self-reported summary data and the use of simple paper and pencil diaries for self-monitoring intake in naturalistic contexts. Such retrospectively captured data suffer from autobiographical and recall biases; low frequency of measurement, which may result in poor reliability; and inability to capture fine-grained, process data that may shift and change over time. For pharmaceuticals, improved data quality can lead to rapid time to market for a new therapy, and with it, cost savings and alleviation of suffering. More reliable data collection methods can reduce the period a drug needs to be under evaluation, its digitalization time, and number of specialized personnel before it can be commercialized. Various electronic tools have emerged that provide part of the solution, but none that measure pill-taking in its temporal context for multiple medications at once. This proposal calls for an integrated system that provides passively monitored, real-time data capture in naturalistic settings, and collects responses to study questions, while it also tracks real-time intake of medications. Medication adherence is problematic in pharmaceutical studies. This proposal addresses an integrated system that passively monitors real-time meds-taking in naturalistic settings, collects responses to study questions, communicates usage data via auto-dialed telephone uploads, and wirelessly connects with remote biosensors and uploads their health status data daily.",

        "abstract": "The main purpose of this NASA SBIR Phase II proposal is development of a novel type of high resolving power diffraction gratings based on volume Bragg gratings technology. The key innovation, which was used for creation of these gratings, is based on patented technology of production of high efficiency volume diffractive elements in photo-thermo-refractive (PTR) glass on which OptiGrate has an exclusive license from the University of Central Florida. The significance of the innovation is that volume diffractive gratings in PTR glass have diffraction efficiency more than 95% and resolving power up to 20,000 in spectral range from 400 to 2700 nm. These gratings have 25 mm-long standard aperture with possibility to increase it up to 50 mm with the spectral resolution less than 50 pm. This, to the best of our knowledge, exceeds parameters of all comparable gratings worldwide. Moreover, as a result of Phase I project performance, a combination of high resolution Bragg grating with Fabri-Perot etalon provides additional increasing of spectral selectivity and enables the further increasing of spectral resolution power. This approach will be used for development of narrow band filters for detection of O2 (766 nm), H2O (935 nm), CO2 (1571 nm) and CH4 (1650 nm) with spectral width well below 1 nm (100 ? 200 pm), aperture 25 mm, throughput exceeding 90% in both reflecting and transmitting geometries. An additional task in Phase II would be a development of a scanning technology within a narrow line about 100 pm with resolution in the range from 1 to 10 pm. Aperture 25 mm, selected radiation should be focused to a photoreceiver of about 200 um.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research project addresses an important problem faced by the chemical and drug industries-their requirement to evaluate the DNA damaging potential of ever increasing numbers of new chemical entities in shorter periods of time. This situation presents opportunities for small businesses that are able to provide solutions to these challenges. Our proposal answers industry's need for higher throughput toxicity assessment through the development of an automated in vitro chromosomal damage assay. Chromosome damage will be quantified by flow cytometric micronucleus measurements. Importantly, the methodology that will be developed over the course of this project not only represents a high volume genotoxicant screening system, but also one that can be configured to identify agents which protect against chromosomal damage, i.e. biological response modifiers (BRMs). BRMs provide chemo- or radio-protection benefits that hold great promise in several important arenas, including treatment of cancer patients, protection of our troops during times of war, and for treatment of civilian victims of chemical or radiological terrorist attacks. The proposed Phase II experiments will initially focus on developing the methodologies that will allow us to incorporate automatic liquid handling devices into a miniaturized assay. By eliminating transfer steps and other labor-intensive tasks, the assay will meet the specifications of pharmaceutical and chemical companies that have high volume testing requirements. Once this is established, we, and our collaborators in the pharmaceutical industry, will evaluate a panel of genotoxicants and non-genotoxicants, thereby providing information regarding assay portability, sensitivity, and specificity. Additionally, two other lines of investigation will be undertaken: evaluation of the HepG2 liver cell line; and utilization of the micronucleus scoring assay for the purposes of radioprotectant identification/characterization. Ultimately, optimization and validation of this screening assay will help chemical and drug companies allocate their resources to their most promising candidates, eliminating hazardous entities early in development. Furthermore, by aiding in the identification of next generation BRMs, cancer patients and armed forces will benefit from the availability of chemo- and radio-protectant drugs. Along with recent advancements in the fields of molecular biology, chemistry and medicine comes an ever- increasing number of new and potentially helpful drugs and industrial chemicals. The ability of pharmaceutical and chemical companies to prioritize these agents in terms of safety and efficacy is often hampered by the use of outdated methods and/or technologies. This proposal addresses the stated need for an automated and miniaturized in vitro micronucleus assay designed to rapidly and efficiently detect the chromosome damaging potential of drugs and chemicals. In addition, this assay can be used to investigate agents designed to ameliorate the effects of radiation exposure, e.g. biological response modifiers.",

        "abstract": "In response to recent evidence confirming that anthropogenic CO2 emissions are disturbing the natural carbon cycle and resulting in global warming, DOE has pioneered a Carbon Sequestration Program to capture and store CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions in geological sites.  However, despite initial research that suggested leakage rates would be low, there have been no definite long-term studies.  A recent review of carbon sequestration has identified monitoring, mitigation, and verification (MMV) as a critical component of future activities.  MMV instrumentation must be highly sensitive (< 0.5 ppm CO2), capable of covering a broad area (> 15 square miles), and able to distinguish between leakage of stored CO2 and natural, biological CO2 fluctuations.  This project will employ a patented Off-Axis Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy technology to develop a field-portable gas analyzer for carbon sequestration MMV applications.  The instrument \u00bf which will provide in-situ, highly accurate quantification of CO2 concentration (< 0.5 ppmv), isotope ratio (d13C < 1.0 \u00bf), and CH4 concentration, without calibration \u00bf will be capable of monitoring surface leaks above geological formations and distinguishing between biogenic and injected carbon sources.  Phase I fabricated a carbon isotope ratiometer that accurately measured d13C to better than 1.0 \u00bf and CO2 concentration to better than 0.5 ppmv after only 100 seconds of measurement time.  Moreover, the instrument maintained this high specification over a wide CO2 range (from 300 \u00bf 6000 ppmv) .  In Phase II, three complete gas analyzer systems \u00bf capable of quantifying the carbon isotope ratio (13C/12C) of CO2, the concentration of CO2, and the concentration of CH4 at ambient and subsurface levels \u00bf will be developed.  After thorough testing, the instruments will be deployed and evaluated at a DOE Carbon Sequestration Field Site and at a biological natural carbon sequestration site.   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The carbon isotope ratiometer should find applicability in a variety of markets, including environmental research, industrial process control, and medical diagnostics.  Preliminary estimates suggest annual revenue exceeding $3M/year by 2012.",

        "abstract": "More accurate determination of CO2 in the atmosphere is required to reliably quantify the sources and sinks of carbon in the environment.  Current CO2 analytical instrumentation is relatively large and heavy, and requires significant amounts of electrical power to operate.  As a result, in situ CO2 measurements presently can be recorded only on weight-bearing vehicles (e.g., aircraft) that fly infrequently; as a consequence, measurements with high spatial or temporal resolution cannot be reported.  This project will develop, test, and deploy inexpensive, low-power CO2 sensors (weight < 100 grams) that will be capable of reporting CO2 with an uncertainty of less than 1 ppmv in the troposphere and tropopause.  These instruments, which will be based on absorption spectroscopy techniques, will be designed to report CO2 measurements while onboard balloon sondes over extended periods.  Phase I designed, built, and tested a novel compact CO2 sensor based on absorption spectroscopy.  The instrument demonstrated a measurement precision of 1 ppmv over a range of concentrations typical in ambient air and in industrial processes.  Phase II will develop, test, and deploy several CO2 sensors on board balloons for measurements in the troposphere and tropopause at a DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement site.  The Phase II instrument will weigh about 100 grams and operate on a lightweight battery.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new CO2 sensor should significantly enhance studies of global warming, and facilitate controlled multi-year studies and comparisons between geographically distant field sites.  The instruments will thus help quantify in detail the global carbon cycle on local and large spatial scales and enable atmospheric chemists to generate reliable models of climate change and carbon sequestration.  Commercial applications include atmospheric studies of carbon sources and sinks, industrial process control (chemical and petrochemical refineries), and pollution detection.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a unique solid-state microwave technique capable of reaching ultra-high temperature (up to 2150 deg C) and ultra-fast thermal processing of large wide band gap semiconductor wafers. It is widely recognized that the existing post-implant anneal process is a bottleneck limiting the performance and reliability of wide band gap semiconductor devices. This technique lowers the sheet resistance and surface roughness of the implanted semiconductor, enabling the fabrication of higher performance, more power efficient devices at lower cost. As part of the Phase I research, the microwave annealed samples showed a record low sheet resistance and surface roughness in both p-type and n-type implanted SiC. The Phase II research is to extend microwave-based rapid thermal processing (RTP) to other wide band gap materials such as GaN and to allow for RTP of larger sized wafers. The prototype system will be upgraded from a single-heating-head system to a system with an array of multiple heads and multiple\nsensors. Computer-based automated control will be developed to regulate wafer temperatures uniformity and stability. The research is anticipated to show feasibility of microwave-based RTP in commercial use for large SiC wafers. The technology improves post-implant anneal process to minimize sheet resistance and surface roughness of SiC and GaN, which consequently reduces the device power consumption and lowers the thermal budget. Lower surface roughness improves SiC sub-micron device reliability, consequently improving yield and reducing manufacturing cost.  Commercially, this is an enabler technology that will make better and lower-cost compound semiconductor devices in areas such as power devices, light emitting diodes (LEDs), high temperature and high frequency electronics. The societal and commercial impact of the technology can be enormous. LED technology, for example, can potentially reduce the percentage of energy required for lighting in the U.S. from 22% to 7%, saving $17 billion per year and reduce CO2 emissions by 155 million tons. Manufacturers of LED devices are looking for enabler technologies such as RTP to reach this goal. Recognizing the technological and the commercial significance of the research, Cree, GE Research and ARL are supporting the research effort by providing the technological expertise, test wafers, access to equipment, and other in-kind services.  Furthermore, the technology can be extended to other applications such as RTP of ultra-shallow junction for nano-scale CMOS devices, wafer bonding, MEMS as well as processing of SiC nano-materials.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes is that deficiencies in available DNA polymerases increase costs and limit the rate of DNA sequencing and that thermophilic phage DNA polymerases developed here will substantially improve automated fluorescent sequencing, as well as newer technologies being developed. PyroPhage(tm) DNA Polymerases greatly expand the molecular diversity and biochemical capabilities of available polymerases. Reliance on traditional microbiology approaches has prevented earlier discovery of these phage DNAPs. Hundreds of new PyroPhage DNAP genes have been discovered, ten of which have been expressed. The first of these has demonstrated several characteristics that should significantly improve sequencing sensitivity, reduce gaps, reduce errors and simplify template preparation. These including efficient synthesis through GC rich templates, efficient incorporation of at least two classes of chain terminators, incorporation of fluorescently labeled nucleotides, improved base calling of problematic dinucleotides, high efficiency of synthesis, efficient initiation at nicks, and the ability to use an RNA template. Based on a unique combination of biochemical attributes of the PyroPhage DNAP, we also propose the development of new approaches to Sanger sequencing to further improve throughput and sensitivity. We anticipate that Phase II will result in the development of one PyroPhage DNAP as the next generation enzyme for automate fluorescent sequencing, and three or more PyroPhage DNAPs as improved sequencing reagents for a variety of other platforms. The goal of this project is to reduce the cost and improve the reliability of methods for deciphering genomic sequences by providing a new class of enzymes that perform better in the sequencing reaction. It has been known for years that enzymes derived viruses that infect microbes (phage) have potential to reduce sequencing costs but none of the existing phage enzymes was stable enough to survive the high temperatures of the standard reaction and no means of isolating an appropriate enzyme existed. Using a new approach, this project has discovered hundreds of such enzymes and produced ten. One has been studied in detail and, as expected, it has characteristics that are expected to improve sequencing.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this Phase II proposal is to develop and implement a novel textile surface modification technique to impart a reactive barrier necessary for their use in protective clothing for healthcare workers. Hospital First Receivers represent a new class of responders whose work mission requires a unique protective ensemble. It has been noted under numerous US-EPA Health and Safety Plans, that local hospitals are ill equipped to care for workers who might become contaminated during mass casualty incidents. The challenge to date in selecting appropriate PPE (personal protective equipment) for first receivers is that the marketplace has only offered traditional military or industrial protective clothing (PC), neither of which has been designed for this unique end application. The need is obvious and immediate for a multi-functional garment specifically engineered for the unique challenges present within the medical response environment. The technical challenge involves defining the reduced multi-threat exposure scenario and combining this with the required performance attributes of a \"breathable\" barrier fabric that offers adequate protection to biological, chemical, and even some radiological hazards. Lynntech has developed a novel technology to permanently attach polyoxometalates complexed with silver ions to fabric surfaces. This modified fabric showed high reactivity against chemical warfare agent surrogates, toxic industrial chemicals, pesticides as well as antimicrobial activities against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria. This Phase II SBIR proposal discloses a joint development program between Lynntech and Kappler. A novel approach is described that combines both near-term reactive and established biological barrier technologies to address the uniqueness of this application and the diversity of the exposure scenario. Multi-functional performance attributes will be achieved by immobilizing reactive nano-particles on a non-woven matrix and combining this self-decontaminating component with a moisture permeable breathable membrane that resists penetration by blood and OPIM (other potentially infectious materials). The combined technologies will offer the wearer a next generation protective fabric that offers a broad range of protection from a variety of traditional medical hazards as well as new hazards associated with industrial accidents and terrorist events. In addition, these surface-modified fabrics could be used in chemical-protective clothing for agricultural workers to reduce skin exposure to pesticides as well as protecting military personnel from biological and chemical weapons. These fabrics could also have broad applications as household disinfection and hygiene wipes and could be incorporated into many consumer product applications. Hospital-based first receivers of victims of mass casualty incidents are required to wear protective clothing per OSHA standards. Being thick and heavy, chemical-resistant garments generate tremendous heat stress and physical discomfort to wearers and, after exposure to chemical or biological agents, have to be contained and disposed of immediately. Thus, new, self-decontaminating materials to fabricate protective garments for healthcare workers are urgently needed.",

Since complete proof-of-concept for Lynntech's automated electrochemical chlorine dioxide generator has been provided in the Phase I project, this proposed follow on Phase II effort specifically aims to develop a prototype compact device for automated medical device (endoscopes and surgical instruments) reprocessing. The device proposed herein will be fabricated, automated and tested upon retrofitting to a commercially available automated endoscope reprocessor for reliable operation in consultation with a reputed medical school. We will also perform exhaustive testing of the efficacy of the chlorine dioxide generator for low corrosion disinfection of actual surgical instruments and endoscopes during this Phase II effort. We will showcase our device and its operation to large manufacturers of automated endoscope reprocessors. Based on their input we will gear the technology to be commercially attractive to facilitate commercialization beyond Phase II in collaboration with these manufacturers, through either joint development, spin off company formation or outright licensing scenarios. The development of our low cost, fast acting and safe automated chlorine dioxide generator based automated reprocessor device will enable the production of high performance disinfecting solution for reliable medical instrument reprocessing. This will certainly reduce health professional exposure to toxic chemicals and decrease the cost of medical instrument reprocessing. In addition, the hundreds of thousands of patients who undergo endoscopic or surgical procedures annually will be adequately protected against cross infection through the availability of our automated medical instrument reprocessor.

Over the next 10 years, the number of patients in the U.S. with end stage renal disease is expected to double. Some major causes of kidney dysfunction include hypertension, diabetes, lupus erythematosus, chemotherapy and immuno-suppression therapy. In all these instances, it is essential to have an accurate test of kidney function to determine the most appropriate therapeutic intervention. Preventing or slowing the progression of renal disease through early recognition of impaired renal function will reduce the number of patients with end stage renal disease and also prevent or reduce the need for dialysis and kidney transplantation. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is one of the best indexes of kidney function and it is determined by measuring the disappearance of certain agents from the blood and their appearance in urine. Although commonly used, the accurate estimation of GFR from serum creatinine is unreliable and insensitive as a marker of chronic kidney disease. Conversely, Inulin and radiolabeled Iothalamate provide an accurate measurement of GFR but Inulin is too expensive for common use and Iothalamate is difficult to assay because it requires either iodine-125 radiolabeling or expensive and cumbersome HPLC analysis. This Phase II SBIR proposal describes the development of a small bench-top device that can accurately, rapidly (5 minutes), and conveniently measure \"cold\" (non-radioactively labeled) Iothalamate in blood and urine samples that will render the usage of radioactively labeled Iothalamate and burdensome HPLC assays obsolete. During the Phase I project, Lynntech designed, fabricated, assembled, and tested a breadboard Iothalamate detection system from commercially available, off-the-shelf components. The system demonstrated sufficient sensitivity (< 20 ppm) in plasma and urine and sample analysis was complete in 5 minutes with minimal sample manipulation. The Phase II workplan describes the optimization of the detection method and the design, assembly, and testing of a fully-integrated bench-top device. The performance of the bench-top device will be compared to an HPLC method developed by our collaborator at the Indiana School of Medicine. The Phase II research also includes the identification of disposable components and process automation in the bench-top system. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is one of the best indexes of kidney function and it is determined by measuring the disappearance of certain agents from the blood and their appearance in urine. Currently available methods for determination of GFR markers are either too expensive, difficult to assay or require the use of radio-labeled markers. Lynntech's inexpensive and easy to use system can accurately detect non- radiolabeled GFR markers in plasma and urine which will enable the rapid and convenient determination of GFR.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): eliminating the incidence of bone implant failures in humans. Titanium alloys are widely used as implants because of their excellent mechanical properties and corrosion behavior in the physiological environment. Nevertheless, titanium is a bioinert material with non-bone-bonding ability which leads to an absence of rapid enhanced bone formation following implantation. A recent approach to the design of the next generation of orthopedic implants has centered on matching the unique topography found in the bone tissue. Through Phase I research Lynntech has developed an electrolytic phosphate surface treatment for titanium implants that incorporates a bioactive inorganic phosphate layer in conjunction with providing roughness features that enhance osseointegration. The central aspect of this study was successfully showing the healthy growth and differentiation of osteoblasts directly on a Ti6Al4V alloy implant surface. Therefore the critical failure point of Dental implants - the bone/implant interface zone- is now transformed into a potentially highly stable, long term osseointegrated anchor point. In vitro studies performed during the Phase I research showed that the phosphated titanium surface promoted increased osteoblast formation, and accelerated osteoblast differentiation. Both these processes would act to accelerate osseointegration of implants into bone in vivo. During the Phase I project it was successfully proven that surface characteristics and phosphate content could be modified through changing the electrolytic potential. In addition, corrosion experiments demonstrated that phosphate treated surfaces were protected up to 46 times greater than untreated control samples. In the proposed Phase II work plan, phosphate content on the surface will be optimized to support maximum osseointegration through a series of in vitro studies. In vivo studies will then be used to determine how phosphated implant surfaces promote accelerated osseointegration of implants. During all stages of the proposed Phase II work, Lynntech will involve key clinicians and maintain a working relationship with industrial partners to ensure proper guidance and successful transfer to the commercial arena. The phosphate treatment of implant surfaces could dramatically change how and when Dentists place implants, and begin loading them. This change will more rapidly restore patients to normal function. These findings are even more significant if it is found that phosphating implant surfaces can reduce the rate of implant failure in high-risk patients such as smokers and diabetes sufferers.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aflatoxins are carcinogenic compounds that are produced by Aspergillus molds on diverse agricultural commodities and affect up to 25 percent of the world's food crops. Due to a lack of practical methods to remove and destroy these compounds in food and feed, crops and raw commodities that are contaminated with aflatoxins are most often destroyed or blended with less toxic food and feed material. Exposure of human and animal populations to aflatoxin on a global scale is significant and managed primarily by regulatory survey of contamination levels. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has established action levels of 20 ppb for aflatoxin present in food and 0.5 ppb for aflatoxin M1 (a toxic bovine metabolite) in milk. These limits have been established by the FDA to minimize exposure, not eliminate exposure, to these carcinogens. Despite these control measures, there remains an ongoing need for development of an economically and industrially relevant process for detoxifying aflatoxin-contaminated agricultural products intended for human and animal consumption. Whole grain remediation methods, such as oxidation using gas phase ozone or ammoniation, create undesirable taste and odor residues on the final product by impacting the final product chemically. One alternative would be a two-stage process of removal and destruction of the compound through extraction followed by oxidation. Hexane is used globally as the preferred vegetable oil extraction solvent for processing of cottonseed, corn, and peanuts. The extraction efficiency, cost, and availability of petroleum based solvents are the primary factors that commercial hexane has been chosen to extract edible oil from oil bearing materials since the 1940's. However, the main component of hexane, n-hexane, is now regulated as a Hazardous Air Pollutant (HAP) in the United States and is causing a significant economic impedance to the oilseed processing industry. Acetone has recently been shown to be a technically viable alternative to hexane for vegetable oil extraction because it is less toxic, not a HAP, and requires minimal infrastructure change to existing oil extraction plants, making it an attractive alternative for the oilseed industry in the US and abroad. The Phase I research study determined the feasibility and economics of extracting aflatoxins in corn using a cost competitive and environmentally benign acetone process. This approach demonstrated a 90% reduction of high concentrations of aflatoxin in naturally contaminated corn which was harvested in 2005 in the US. The Phase II study will focus on further isolation of aflatoxin into the soapstock fraction generated in vegetable oil manufacturing, where it can be destroyed using a skid-mounted chemical detoxification device. Phase II will also include a detailed analytical, in vitro and in vivo verification of this detoxification strategy, scale-up to a one ton (2,000 lbs) per 8-hour day process to validate economic viability, test the oxidation prototype in a industrial pilot plant, and generate decontaminated defatted meal and oil for validation in poultry. Aflatoxins are naturally occurring carcinogens that, despite regulation in diverse foods and feedstuffs, remain a health hazard to humans and animals both in the US and worldwide. There are no practical methods to isolate and destroy these toxins in contaminated raw agricultural commodities, forcing food producers and processors to choose between blending with available clean commodities or destroying the contaminated grains or oilseeds. The proposed innovation utilizes a new two-stage process integrated within the existing global industrial infrastructure in oilseed extraction to decontaminate commodities, allowing for safe, market- competitive food fractions and reduced cancer risk.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bacterial contamination of platelets is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality from a transfusion- transmitted infection. Bacterial contamination rates for platelets have been estimated to occur at a frequency of 1 in 2,000 to 1 in 3,000 platelet units. Projected fatalities from these transfusions, based on extrapolation from surveillance and other studies, vary from 15 to over 200 per year. There are several technical approaches for bacterial detection in platelets but none have been widely accepted because they either lack the speed or sensitivity required. Lynntech proposes an innovative, easy-to-operate, quantitative, real-time convective PCR (QC-PCR) thermal cycling bacteria detection system (BDS) to achieve the speed and sensitivity required for platelets testing near the time of release. The QC-PCR based BDS provides random-access nucleic acid testing in one hour, from nucleic acid extraction to amplification and real-time detection. The technology is anticipated to be able to detect a broad range of bacteria in platelets at a detection limit between 102 to 103 CFU per/mL (1 to 10 genomic copies per PCR reaction). Because platelets, especially the pooled random donor whole-blood derived platelets, are processed immediately before release, rapid bacterial detection is needed to test the discrete samples. The system's random-access nucleic acid analysis capability, therefore, meets the critical needs of transfusion services which do not process high numbers of platelets for transfusion simultaneously. Users will not need to wait for completion of other PCR reactions before running more samples. This innovative system will help reduce the delay in processing and release of platelet units that are currently associated with culture based methods. In addition, each test requires only 200 fL of platelets. This will significantly reduce the loss of platelets to culture-based methods which each require 3 to 5 mL of platelets. In short, the implementation of the system will significantly reduce the number of cases of infections and fatalities, improving the patients' quality of life and saving the health care system millions of dollars annually. Also, important is the simplicity of the system which leads to low-cost systems for hospitals and blood banks to purchase. Lynntech's QC-PCR based BDS is the next generation of tool for molecular diagnostics that will enable a non-specialized operator to perform sophisticated biological tests in any setting with greater speed at a lower cost. The QC-PCR technology can be adapted to run virtually any existing and future PCR based clinical diagnostic assays. By significantly simplifying and accelerating testing, the BDS system could allow for molecular diagnostic testing at doctors' offices as well as hospitals in point-of-care format. The system will also be great for resource poor countries. This technology provides an opportunity for better management of the quality of platelet supply affecting millions of Americans annually, specifically for preventing bacterial related infections and sepsis through transfusion of contaminated platelets. The economic impact is also enormous considering the market size and associated savings from prolonging platelet shelf life and improving infection prevention. Once developed, the product can also be expanded for use to detect pathogens in other blood product components. Also, the system will have great commercial potential and medical values in providing rapid, low-cost, easy-to-use in- vitro diagnostics in doctors' offices, clinics, hospitals, and even in countries with poor resources.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic pathogenic fungus that predominantly infects immunocompromised patients. It is the most common cause of infectious pneumonic mortality in HIV patients, organ transplant recipients, and cancer patients. A. fumigatus infection in HIV infected patients is most pertinent due to the exceptionally high mortality rate (>75% die within the first year of infection). Treatment is complicated by the fact that patients are often too fragile for invasive or toxic therapies. The current first-line treatment for aspergillosis is amphotericin B (AMB) but it is both highly nephrotoxic and insoluble. Its nephrotoxicity can be a significant contributing factor to mortality. Thus, AMB presents an array of challenges to its therapeutic application. In response to this problem, we have developed NanoDisks(tm), a novel preparation of lipid and protein for the solubilization and delivery of hydrophobic drugs. NanoDisks are 8 - 15 nm diameter disc-shaped structures composed of a lipid bilayer circumscribed by a stabilizing apolipoprotein or peptide mimetic. When AMB is incorporated into NanoDisks (ND-AMB), we observe a dramatic increase in solubility and reduction in toxicity. In comparison to a leading commercial liposomal formulation of AMB (AmBisome), the minimal inhibitory concentration of ND-AMB against Aspergillus is 25-fold lower and in an animal model of disseminated Candidiasis, ND-AMB is effective at 5-fold lower doses. Because the normal route of Aspergillus infection is through inhalation of conidia, aspergillosis may be most responsive to therapies that are directed to the lung. Phase I results of this SBIR proposal demonstrated that ND-AMB could be lyophilized, milled into powder and reyhydrated without loss of biological activity, complex integrity or AMB toxicity attenuation. Therefore we hypothesize that NanoDisks are capable of effective pulmonary and systemic delivery via inhalation for the treatment of A. fumigatus pulmonary and systemically disseminated infection. We will examine the overall capability of ND-AMB as an inhaled therapy. Specifically, we will characterize ND-AMB's ability to enter the bloodstream after inhalation, its pharmacokinetic distribution, toxicity and efficacy in treating pulmonary and systemic fungal infection in murine model systems. We hope to replicate our success with AMB as a leishmaniasis therapy, wherein we converted AMB from a marginally effective treatment to a potent cure by reformulating AMB into ND-AMB. Results from this study are essential for the development of an improved inhalable AMB-based therapy for the treatment of aspergillosis; a serious health issue for HIV infected patients, wherein median survival is 3 months. With inhalable ND-AMB we believe we will bring to bear an effective cure to a disease, wherein mortality rates are extremely high (> 75%).",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): According to the CDC, each year more than two million U.S. hospital patients contract nosocomial infections, and some 80,000 of them die as a result (Federal Register, 2004). With drug-resistant infections reaching epidemic levels-especially in medical facilities-the nation's researchers and drug developers face a daunting challenge in staying ahead of the threats. One infectious disease that merits much more attention is Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD). CDAD is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in hospital and nursing home patients-especially with the recent characterization of an epidemic C. difficile strain that exhibits increased virulence and antibiotic resistance. Estimates of hospitalized patients who develop CDAD annually in the U.S. range up to 2.2 million. The current conservative estimated range of annual additional cost in the U.S. alone is $1 billion to $3 billion. The extremely high added costs and human suffering caused by CDAD is a national problem that is directly relevant to NIAID, as evidenced by the NIAID-AT-SBIR Phase I funding already received for this project. A new, more-effective CDAD treatment is clearly needed. Ironically, the most common identifiable predisposing factor for CDAD is antibiotic therapy. For this particular infectious disease, the conventional cure is instead the cause-especially with relapses. Clearly, alternative therapies are needed. One such promising option is the use of human monoclonal antibodies (Mabs). Mabs are potentially excellent molecules for prevention and treatment of mucosal infectious diseases such as those caused by C. difficile. Mapp Biopharmaceutical's R&D team-including key expert collaborators-has particular expertise in Mab development and combines that experience with unique, proprietary know-how in employing next-generation Mab manufacturing techniques based on the use of plants. Production of Mabs in plants has the potential to provide a cost-effective alternative to traditional and costly mammalian cell-culture manufacturing. The excellent results obtained by Mapp and its collaborator in Phase I forms the basis for this follow-on Phase II project, focused on moving the candidate Mabs selected during Phase I into pilot manufacturing, formulation, and testing/validation via IND-enabling studies in preparation for human clinical safety trials. That work will be carried out under four Specific Aims involving 1) Mab production using the plant-based system, 2) dose-response experiments, 3) production of Mabs under cGMP, and 4) completion of IND-enabling studies. The overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to develop, validate, and commercialize a human Mab-based product for prevention and/or treatment of CDAD.         Drug-resistant and other difficult-to-treat infections are becoming major epidemics in the nation's hospitals and long-term care facilities. One infectious disease that merits closer attention and an effort to develop improved therapeutics is Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD)-a disease that adds up to $3 billion annually to our medical costs. Mapp Biopharmaceutical's expert R&D team proposes to develop and commercialize a novel, safe, low-cost monoclonal antibody- based treatment for CDAD that will be produced using plants (in place of expensive cell-culture) as a manufacturing system.",

In our Phase 1 application, we sought funding to support a key development step for this class of agents: to achieve a sufficiently high iodine concentration for the purpose of enabling CT imaging in humans with reasonable injection volumes. In this Phase 2 proposal, we seek rapid translation to clinical use of the NCTX platform by studying the ability of NCTX to simultaneously image all regions of the thoracic vasculature (right heart/pulmonary, left heart/aorta and coronary vasculature) using the 3RO procedure. First, we will compare the ability of NCTX (relative to conventional contrast agents) to image thoracic vasculature in a large animal model (sheep). Second, we will acquire key pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicity data required to justify the use of NCTX in humans. While the organ distribution of the liposomes used in NCTX is well understood, our conversations with Venture Capital organizations interested in funding Phase 3 have indicated that these are the 2 key pieces of information required before they would provide Phase 3 funding. The Specific Aims of this Phase 2 application are: 1. Test Detection by NCTX: To compare the detection of (1) catheter-placed pulmonary emboli and (2) artificial coronary artery stenoses by conventional contrast-enhanced CT and NCTX. Specifically, the number of contrast doses and the X-ray dose required for each method will be investigated. Organ distribution of the agents will be measured by CT imaging. 2. Preliminary Toxicity Testing: The filing of an IND (Investigational New Drug) application with the FDA for NCTX will require toxicity and PK testing in one small animal and one large animal model. Mice and Dogs are usually recommended for such testing. In this study, we will study the toxicity in mice. The elimination route, renal toxicity, and hepatic toxicity of the NCTX agent will be studied, and compared to that of conventional contrast agent. The founders of Marval Therapeutics have invented a new class of liposomal nanoparticle contrast agents for Computed Tomography (CT), referred to as NCTX. In our Phase 1 application, we sought funding to support a key development step for this class of agents: to achieve a sufficiently high iodine concentration for the purpose of enabling CT imaging in humans with reasonable injection volumes. Subsequent to successful realization of this technical advance, the sole Specific Aim of the Phase 1 application, we have pursued translational research focused on development of clinical applications for the use of NCTX. While several clinically significant applications were identified, we focused on one particularly compelling indication that is not effectively addressed by current imaging technology: acute chest pain -- a condition that causes 5-8 million patients to present to Emergency Rooms (ER's) every year in the US alone. From a clinical perspective, there are three distinct, life-threatening causes of acute chest pain: pulmonary embolus (PE), myocardial infarction due to coronary insufficiency (MI) and dissecting aortic aneurysm (AD). The diagnosis (or exclusion) of these three entities is complex and frequently requires admission to the hospital and highly invasive testing; however, it has recently been proposed that these 3 entities can be diagnosed non-invasively in the ER using the latest generation of ultrafast, 64-slice multi- detector CT scanners. Even with the latest scanner technology, this \"triple rule-out\" (3RO) procedure is currently very difficult to perform due to the need to accurately image the pulmonary, coronary and aortic circulations, during peak enhancement. The 3RO is the subject of extensive research by both clinicians and scanner manufacturers. In this Phase 2 proposal, we seek rapid translation to clinical use of the NCTX platform by studying the ability of NCTX to simultaneously image all regions of the thoracic vasculature (right heart/pulmonary, left heart/aorta and coronary vasculature) using the 3RO procedure.

There are several aspects of wheelchair use that lead to these conditions. Because wheelchair users are seated, many of the objects they grab or work with are above the level of their shoulder, such as washing dishes or getting items off the grocery store shelf. Some powered wheelchairs have an electric seat elevator that can be used to raise the wheelchair user up. However, there are no manual wheelchairs that offer a seat-elevating feature.

Transfer boards can be used to dramatically reduce physical demand during transfers. However, transfer boards are not very portable, so they are not typically carried on the wheelchair. As a result, transfer boards are not always available when the user needs one. The ErgoChair Smart Manual Wheelchair is a solution to the problem of poor shoulder ergonomics during lifting tasks and transfers. The ErgoChair allows the seat height of a manual wheelchair to be set by the user much like setting the height of an office chair. In addition, there is a lightweight transfer board stowed under the seat. Users can create preset seat heights, allowing them to quickly set the seat to exactly where they want it. This project will involve: 1) developing a proof-of concept prototype and evaluating its effectiveness, 2) refining the design based on focus group feedback and engineering exploration and 3) quantifying the ergonomic benefits of the ErgoChair through a repeated measures biomechanical study. As a result of this project, wheelchair users will be able to dramatically reduce physical demand on their upper limbs during everyday tasks. ErgoChair Smart Manual Wheelchair Relevance to Public Health Manual wheelchair users are at considerable risk of developing upper limb overuse injuries. One preventative measure is to reduce physical demand during wheelchair use. This project will develop innovative technology that will dramatically improve the ergonomics of wheelchair transfers and lifting tasks.",

        "abstract": "The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will support the commercialization of a novel line of high-performance Mayacrom pigments using a lower cost, solid-state, environmentally friendly one-step manufacturing process. The Mayacrom pigments exhibit superior properties compared with many commercially available pigments and may replace environmentally detrimental pigments such as cobalt and cadmium based colorants. The intellectual merit of the proposed work includes the advancement of knowledge of solid-state reactions in the fields of materials science and engineering.  Environmentally, aspects of the proposal include creating a production process that is solvent free, consumes only a modest amount of energy, and releases only water during manufacturing, resulting in no negative ecological impacts.  Broader effects include the fundamental understanding of the solid-state thermodynamics and reaction kinetics that affect the physical and chemical properties of the pigments. Results of the influence of mixing intensity on reaction kinetics\nwill also expand the knowledge for other industrial processes. Other broader impacts include continued collaborative research activities at the minority-based University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) to expand the scientific understanding of these hybrid pigments and publish significant findings.  If successfully commercialized, the one-step manufacturing process will create jobs in the United States and in the under-utilized El Paso, Texas border region.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A novel cannula design is proposed to provide distal perfusion during arterial cannulation. Arterial cannulation is common in several applications of extracorporeal blood processing, such as ArterioVenous Carbon Dioxide Removal (AVCO2R) treatment. AVCO2R is a respiratory treatment that uncouples oxygenation from CO2 removal by utilizing a low-resistance gas exchanger in a simple percutaneous arteriovenous shunt (i.e. pumpless) to achieve near-total extracorporeal removal of CO2 production. As in all extracorporeal applications that require arterial cannulation, complications such as infection and distal ischemia can occur. A unique distal perfusion cannula (DPC) is presented, where a 3-section balloon incorporated at the tip of the cannula acts as a vessel support, as well as a variable flow controller that ensures and regulates distal flow. This design approach allows for the cannula size to be maximized, which minimizes the resistance of the extracorporeal circuit, while ensuring safety for the patient. The DPC described here offers a simple, adjustable solution to femoral cannulation and will hold the key to the adoption and efficacy of AVCO2R, as well as other extracorporeal support therapies. In Phase I, computational techniques and in vitro experiments were used to design the distal perfusion cannula (DPC), and to fully characterize the prototypes. A functional, 3-section balloon prototype has been completed and verified of its ability to optimize both distal and cannula perfusion. The objective of Phase II is to construct a clinical quality DPC, and to verify that the cannula is successful in optimizing distal flow while minimizing complications on an in vivo animal model. At Phase II conclusion, manufacturability of the DPC will be defined, and the long-term functionality of the device will be determined. This grant will result in the development of a novel distal perfusion cannula (DPC) for use in arterial cannulation. The new DPC will optimize the performance of an extracorporeal circuit, while ensuring safety for the patient.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the school nurse is to assure the health and safety of the students in the school(s) she/he oversees. This includes assuring that medications are administered to schoolchildren correctly. New data indicate that about 35% of school nurses are responsible daily for over 5,000 students. Approximately 20 million children attending public schools have chronic health conditions requiring the administration of medications during the school day. Frequently the school nurse must delegate the responsibility of administering medications to schoolchildren to unlicensed assistive personnel (UAPs). Errors in medication administration are 3.1 times more likely when UAPs dispense medications than when nurses carry out this responsibility. Our long-term goal in this project is to provide for the safety and well being of children who receive medications during the school day by reducing the incidence of medication errors. Our hypothesis is that a focused, comprehensive, standardized training tool, with an integrated documentation system, will fill a community need by assisting school nurses in performing their supervisory responsibilities and by reducing the medication error rate by the UAPs who are delegated the task of medication administration. Our project, GETTING IT DONE! / GETTING IT RIGHT! was found to be feasible in Phase I research. In Phase II, we plan to complete the development of the training programs for school nurses and UAPs and to develop an automated documentation system for recording the administration of medications. Since nearly 100% of U.S. schools now have access to high speed Internet connections, both of our programs will be Internet-based. Documentation will be accomplished using PDA technology. A computer, an electronic camera, and up to three PDAs will be provided to the schools during the testing phase of the project. We will compare our documentation program to a commercially available student health program used in the WA state public schools. Development and subsequent marketing of Getting It Right!/Getting It Done! will allow public health and school nurse researchers to track conditions affecting school children and the types of medications being given in schools using the programs.",

        "abstract": "The separation and concentration of bioethanol from fermented biomass by distillation is a highly energy-intensive operation.  In this project, ethanol-selective pervaporation membranes will be developed to perform this separation.  The pervaporation process uses zeolite-polymer (mixed-matrix) membranes that provide ethanol separation factors two-to-three times higher than with distillation.  By using these membranes, the energy consumption of bioethanol separation will be reduced by 30 to 50%.  The construction of the separation plant would provide for further capital cost savings.  In Phase I, mixed-matrix membranes were made and shown to have the permeances and selectivities required to provide significantly improved bioethanol separations.  Membrane production was scaled up to the bench scale.  A small spiralwound module was made and operated successfully.  In Phase II, the membranes will be scaled up to the small industrial scale.  Four-inch diameter modules with a membrane area of 4 m2 will be fabricated, tested, and optimized in the laboratory using pilot-scale equipment.  A pilot plant will then be demonstrated to validate its reliability and efficiency. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The simple flow scheme and low-maintenance operation should make this membrane process particularly applicable to small bioethanol plants such as cellulose-based bioethanol plants.",

Recently, handheld and battery-powered ppb-level VOC photoionization detectors (PID) have become commercially available.  However, the presence of water in the sample air interferes with the detection accuracy in PIDs.\n   This proposal describes the development of a membrane device to remove water vapor from th gas being sent to portable PID-based VOC detectors.  The membrane uses a perfluoro polymer that is water permeable and VOC-rejecting.  The membrane device is compact, lightweight and energy efficient, which makes it convenient to integrate into a portable detection system.\n   To reduce water relative humidity in the air from 100% to 10% while sending 200 mL/min gas to the detector, a membrane with and area of 0.1 m2 is required.  In the Phase I project, membranes with the required permeance and selectivity were prepared and made into bench-scale modules with various configurations and the required membrane area of 0.1 m2.  These modules were evaluated for nitrogen/toluene separation, and the configuration was optimized to achieve better separation performance.  In addition to removing water from air, these modules have been demonstrated to enrich VOC content by 10 to 100 fold in the gas sent to the detector.\n   In Phase II, we will optimize module configurations using more innovative designs for improved water removal performance, and construct a prototype membrane device to deliver to our business partner, RAE Systems, Inc. for testing and evaluation.  Integrating such a membrane device with a handheld ppb-level; VOC detector, such as the ppbRAE Plus detector made by RAE Systems, only adds 30-40% by volume and 100% by weight, which would provide an easily portable system with much improved performance.",

(MSI) is developing a candidate Quartz/Polysiloxane radome solution for the Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC3) system.  This solution is presently in the process of being evaluated for the relevant hypersonic rain erosion environs and full-scale thermal/structural loading.  At this time, it has exceeded all mechanical, thermal, and electrical and cost requirements, however it too has experienced significant material loss during recent full-scale sled tests through a rain field. As a result of these tests, and the modeling research conducted during the Phase I effort, MSI investigated alternative 3D reinforced fiber architectures to address the issue of material loss and or wear.    Phase I results indicate that high shear stresses due to droplet impact precipitated delamination of the 2D laminates, which ultimately lead to tensile failure of the outer fiber layer.  Repeated impacts coupled with aerodynamic shear caused dramatic material loss.  The Phase I effort systematically quantified the erosion event, and ultimately led to the investigation of 3D fiber architectures. This effort will be supported by The University of Delaware's Center for Composite Materials (CCM) with extensive material modeling to determine the loading interaction with the material and different 2D and 3D fiber architectures as well as subscale wear testing to screen and rank candidate materials.",

Current efforts to reduce the effects of HIE by hypothermia (cooling) have been hampered by the lack of a reliable noninvasive method of monitoring the infant's brain temperature during the hypothermic treatment, which lasts about 48 hours. The primary objective of this Phase I feasibility study was to evaluate Passive Microwave Radiometry (PMR) for monitoring intracranial temperature in neonates. The Phase I program has been successfully completed. The significant challenge of the overall program occurs in Phase II involving the integration of the radiometric receivers into the transducers and developing the logic and circuitry required to combine the two radiometric outputs to determine temperature at depth. The goal of the Phase II program is to develop an affordable system for the reliable and continuous monitoring of intracranial temperature in neonates. 7. Project Narrative Two to four of every 1000 babies delivered in the United States experience an obstetrical complication resulting in asphyxial injury to the brain leading to the development of cerebral palsy, mental retardation or even death. Recent clinical studies have shown that hypothermia decreases the injured brain's metabolism and oxygen requirements, and can significantly decrease the chances of physical disability and death. Although promising, hypothermia is an evolving therapy and there is much to learn regarding the optimal degree and duration of hypothermia. Knowledge of exact brain temperature is needed before these important questions can be adequately answered.",

Once the sensors are installed, long wires for power and data must be routed through to a central data collection location where several large off-the-shelf electronic components reside, adding weight, cost and increasing the probably of introducing noise or faults into the testing system.  All of this necessary infrastructure leads to prohibit the use of some types of sensors and limit the total number of sensors used so save on time, cost, complexity and resources.  During the course of this Phase II SBIR research, Metis Design Corporation (MDC) proposes to develop a standardized data acquisition hub for aircraft testing sensors dubbed a \"sensor-logger\".

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant):  This application proposes to continue the work done in our Phase I investigation and further evaluate and refine a promising novel digital technique we have developed at MH Acoustics for reducing wind noise in hearing aids. In Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of our breakthrough concept for wind noise suppression and, using wind tunnel tests, proved the effectiveness of our wind noise suppression algorithm. Based on the promise shown in our Phase I results, we have taken the first steps to commercialize our algorithm by entering into strategic alliances with two leading IC vendors in the cell phone and Bluetooth wireless headset market. Furthermore, we have teamed with Gennum Corporation a leading supplier of DSP chips to the hearing aid industry to introduce our solution to the hearing aid market. A major component of our Phase II proposal is to include clinical trials in support of our business plan. For this work, we will partner with Professor Ruth Bentler of the University of Iowa. Professor Bentler is a recognized expert in the study of the effectiveness of noise reduction schemes in hearing aids. The specific tasks of our Phase II proposal are to: a) Construct a multichannel acoustic database of different environmental wind-noise conditions for testing using the unique calibrated airflow test facility and microphone arrays that were built and verified during Phase I. b) Build test vectors for listening tests to be performed during the clinical trials c) Partner with Professor Ruth Bentler, to perform clinical trials to evaluate and optimize our algorithm from data obtained during the clinical trial. d) Implement our refined and tailored two-channel algorithm in real-time on a commercial hearing aid DSP (Gennum Voyager). e) Create a portable C version of our algorithm to simplify porting our algorithm to a wide range of low power fixed-point DSP's and other processors. f) Demonstrate conclusively in Phase II that the MH Acoustics algorithm is clearly superior in suppressing wind noise in hearing aids for both normal and hearing impaired subjects. Wind-noise is highly disturbing to hearing impaired individuals wearing hearing aids who wish to participate in outdoor conversations where wind is present or during activities such as walking or running. In these situations, wind noise significantly reduces signal-to-noise ratio and, consequently, the intelligibility of speech and sounds is significantly impaired. The objective of this project is to demonstrate the MH Acoustics' multi-microphone wind-noise reduction invention for the digital hearing aids market. MH Acoustics' wind noise reduction technology is unique since it provides instantaneous convergence while maintaining directionality of the microphone array. Current commercial technologies do not provide this feature. MH Acoustics, founded by researchers from Bell Laboratories, is currently successfully commercializing wind noise reduction technology for the mobile headset and handset markets and is working with leading hearing aid device producers to introduce their new technology into the market. This technology will achieve wind noise suppression capability unequaled in the industry.",

        "abstract": "Hundreds of volatile chemicals have been reported as emissions from confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs). These emissions are environmental concerns as a result of their impact on odor and general air quality. Volatiles emission monitoring of CAFOs is largely performed utilizing downwind air samples captured in Tedlar sampling bags. Published studies have indicated that this approach is not appropriate for this application due to the rapid loss of critical semi-volatiles to surface adsorption. Phase I efforts resulted in the identification of an improved material for construction of air sampling bags: metalized FEP (Teflon\u00ae) films. Utilizing odorous p-cresol as the semi-volatile challenge compound, metalized FEP containers consistently resulted in an approximate 3 fold recovery increase relative to Tedlar equivalents. This Phase II project proposes capitalizing on two key features of this material, the relative inertness of the FEP inner surface and outer surface metalization, in the development of an improved and commercially viable air sampling device.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rigorous quantification methods of histological specimens have become a keystone in modern neuroscience such as investigations of neurogenesis, stem cell research, neurotransplantation, neurotoxicology, and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. Methods in current practice are not conducive to high-throughput studies because they are often manual and laborious to perform. There is a noticeable lack of computerized automated 3D quantitative histological analysis tools which can operate on large 3D image volumes. Furthermore, the widespread use of fluorescently labeled tissue sections imposes other limitations, particularly fading of fluorescent dyes, limited availability and tremendous costs of high-end confocal microscopes. We propose to develop a commercial system (Biolucida\") to overcome this unsatisfactory situation. The core of Biolucida will be 3D virtual slides, which are digital representations (in X, Y and Z) of tissue specimens imaged through a microscope at the highest optical resolution. We will develop software for the acquisition, automated quantitative histological analysis, viewing, sharing and archiving of 3D virtual slides. As such, the use of Biolucida will fully surmount the aforementioned limitations. Consequently we expect that the launch of Biolucida will revolutionize the quantitative analysis of fluorescently labeled tissue sections in modern neuroscience.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Supervised group exercise has been shown to be an effective component for improving balance and preventing falls among elders who have suffered falls or exhibit a fear of falling due to frailty. In a Phase I SBIR study, we developed a model for conducting group exercise programs for elders in their homes via video- conferencing, called tele-based group exercise (tele-ex), using a modified, commercial, off-the-shelf videoconferencing device attached to an elder's home television. The tele-ex allowed elders to participate in supervised group exercise classes from their homes, while allowing real-time, two-way instruction, participation, and supervision by an exercise instructor who could simultaneously observe all of the participants in the class. The goals of this SBIR Phase II application are to further refine the video-conferencing device, and to further evaluate the adherence, effectiveness, and quality and satisfaction of the tele-ex program as compared to traditional community-based group exercise (comm-ex) and home-based individual exercise (home-ex) programs. The target population is community-dwelling elders who are at risk for falls. Specific aims for Phase II include: 1. Develop a purpose-built videoconferencing unit for use in the elder's home, with the view of commercialization of the videoconferencing unit, and a service for delivering facilitated home-based exercise programs. 2. Evaluate the adherence to and effectiveness of the tele-exercise program among community-dwelling, fall- risk elders, as compared to comm-ex and home-ex programs. 3. Evaluate the quality of tele-communication and the level of satisfaction of tele-ex technology by community- dwelling elders. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial, involving three groups (a tele-ex group, a comm-ex group, and a home-ex group), each with a 15-week Tai Chi exercise program, and pre- and post-exercise tests. We will test a total of 72 subjects, 24 in each group. We hypothesize that 1) compared to elders in both comm-ex and home-ex groups, elders in the tele-ex group will have a higher exercise adherence rate; and 2) compared to elders in the home-ex group, elders in the tele-ex group will have decreased fear of falling, increased balance and quality of life post exercise. The study aims specifically at one major cause of disability in the elderly population in the U.S: unintentional falls. Participation in regular exercises, such as Tai Chi, has been shown to reduce the risk of falls and fear of falling. With a majority of elders being physically inactive, interactive and supervised exercise programs delivered via videoconferencing to elders' own home television present an attractive way to engage them in regular exercises, leading to improved balance, reduced risk of falls and fall injuries, and independence.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, MicroFab will design and fabricate a prototype ink-jet based protein crystal screening platform (CrystalJet(tm)) with emphasis on membrane proteins that are difficult to crystallize, but critical to cellular function. The prototype platform will perform high-throughput initial protein crystallization screening to identify parameters for subsequent scale-up to diffraction quality crystals. Information for computational and structure based drug development is typically obtained through x-ray diffraction studies of crystallized membrane proteins. However, the crystallization of membrane proteins often fails to produce diffraction quality crystals. Difficulties in crystallizing membrane proteins can be attributed to narrow metastable solubility regions and scarcity of purified protein. A solution to these problems is to decrease protein consumption and narrow the sampling of crystal growth conditions by using smaller screening volumes. Ink-jet dispensing is a technology capable of reliably delivering small volumes ranging from picoliter to microliter, the latter by accretion. The CrystalJet(tm) screening platform will operate in microbatch and vapor diffusion modes to offer experimental flexibility. We will also develop a disposable ink-jet dispenser to address cross contamination issues. A dip-n- sip mode will be developed for the deposition of protein and matching volumes of crystallization/precipitant solution at volumes of 1000 nL, such as oil and well precipitant solutions. The platform will include a plate handler and plate sealer to manipulate and seal crystal-screening plates, environmental control to maintain temperature, humidity and clean air, and a crystal observation and image capture system. A series of screening experiments will be performed using protein standards (e.g., lysozyme, glucose isomerase, thaumatin) and membrane proteins to validate the operation of the CrystalJet(tm) platform. The CrystalJet platform is an automated tool to perform a greater number of protein crystallography screening experiments, while using significantly less protein in comparison to conventional screening systems. Ultimately, this tool will enable faster and more efficient drug target discovery to aid in the development of effective drugs to treat disease.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed phase-II SBIR research is to develop an in-vivo imaging technology based on functional swept-source optical coherence tomography (F-SS-OCT) at 1060nm spectral region that provides both morphological and blood flow information for the diagnosis and management of diabetic retinopathy. The key aims of the Phase-II program are to [1] generate high-speed, high-performance 1060nm swept laser systems, [2] develop 1060nm F-SS-OCT systems and demonstrate structural and Doppler imaging, and [3] demonstrate real-time imaging of choroidal microvasculature. Supported by the combined advantages of deep light penetration, low dispersion, high sensitivity, resolution, and speed, this technology should enable superior functional OCT imaging for various pre-clinical and clinical applications including in-vivo imaging, 3- dimensional mapping, and real-time intrasurgical guidance. Current OCT systems for retinal imaging applications use light sources centered at 820nm. Although high- resolution OCT centered at 820nm provides a clear image of intraretinal layer, its penetration depth is insufficient for imaging the choroidal microvasculature. However, the choroid plays an important role in many ocular diseases, including diabetic retinopathy. Imaging and quantifying choroidal blood flow with functional OCT would provide valuable information in both diagnosing and managing these ocular diseases at earlier stages. It has been shown that 1060nm spectral region provides an optimal wavelength for imaging choroidal morphology and microvasculature due to reduced scattering, higher safe light exposure, and minimal tissue dispersion. Building on the success of Phase-I work, the prototype 1060nm swept laser systems and OCT engines will be developed at Micron Optics based on its core tunable technology platform. The performance criteria of the 1060nm swept laser include a lasing range >70nm with a 3dB range of >50nm, a linewidth of 10mW, and a sweep frequency of 10KHz. The F-SS-OCT system is aimed to provide a hardware- limited imaging depth of 5mm with a resolution of ~10fm, and a sensitivity of ~110dB. The video-rate operation of the F-SS-OCT system will be demonstrated at the Beckman Laser Institute of UC Irvine.",

(MSI) modular, plug and play (PnP) spacecraft avionics architecture. This revolutionary architecture provides a near-term solution to modular, plug and play avionics while distributing power and data management functions on a single circuit allowing rapid interfacing to other satellite avionics such as the GSFC Space Cube.  By integrating the MSI protocol converter technology with the ABET Technologies Digital Current System, MSI can provide a network with standardized attachment nodes that carries data and power on an Intelligent Power/Data Ring (IPDR).The IPDR network, which can host a variety of data protocols, currently implements a high speed SPA-S (SpaceWire) core to support the AFRL PnP efforts. It enables full PnP modularity reducing spacecraft integration and test to a few days.  Since the system is implemented with a common set of nodes for every interface instead of custom cards in a card cage, the hardware costs are dramatically lower as well, only 40-60% of comparable centralized systems. Using commercial Ethernet parts integrated into the existing IPDR node processor and interface boards successful proof of concept testing was performed during Phase I.  The transfer of Ethernet data frames was demonstrated into the IPDR ring via a peripheral Ethernet device, from one IPDR node to another, and finally back out of the ring to the external Ethernet device. Figure 1 shows the setup of the final node-to-node Ethernet communication test. Although this testing verified the fundamental functionality of Ethernet communication on the IPDR ring avionics, there is significant effort remaining to mature this into a flight worthy avionics architecture .  The Phase II will investigate flight parts selection for the nodes, firmware development required to improve bandwidth, and flight qualification and delivery of a Ethernet version of an IPDR node.",

Transgenic mice are increasingly important in research applications as the genetic foundations of many illnesses are being explored. Since genetic effects can be small, data acquisition that is continuous and physiological is becoming very important. Telemetric information from a conscious, normal mouse has led, for example, to the development of a mouse model for preeclampsia (28).  The specific aims of this Phase II effort are: a) miniaturization of the application specific integrated circuit  (ASIC), b. development of pulse position modulation software, c. development of a graphical user interface  (GUI) software, d. development of a high-fidelity pressure sensor sealed to atmosphere, and e. animal  studies in murine rodents.  The circuitry developed in Phase I is suitable for implantation into a rat. In Phase II the circuitry will be miniaturized and the battery will be replaced with an inductively powered capacitor. The prototype device will be implanted into dwarf rats in several studies.  Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) will be used to conserve energy and permit miniaturization. PPM is the modulation of a pulse carrier wherein the value of each instantaneous sample of a modulating wave varies the position in time of a pulse relative to its unpopulated time of occurrence. In other words, the sensor data value that is acquired before transmission starts is sent to the receiver as a time interval between two transmissions pulses. This method of data transmission is the most energy efficient since the transmitter on time is very short.  A graphical user interface will be developed to enable researchers to select the number of mice, period of data acquisition and frequencies desired. Temperature information is necessary for bridge compensation and will be available as another experimental parameter.  A strain gauge pressure transducer completely sealed to atmosphere will permit high-fidelity measurement of arterial pressures. The development effort will seek to eliminate drift. Project Narrative we propose to develop a low mass implantable telemetric solid-state pressure sensor that is smaller than currently available devices, which can be used in small, multiply housed transgenic mice.

However, a safe and effective delivery method for transferring nucleic acids molecules to hepatocytes remains to be perfected. From the Phase I studies, a synthetic peptide that enabled efficient hepatocyte targeted delivery in mice of a variety of proteins, and particles such as liposomes and most importantly, polycation-condensed DNA or siRNA particles was identified. Two properties are important for delivery of nucleic acids complexes: stabilization of nucleic acid particles using glutaraldehyde to cross-link polycations to themselves (termed caging) and PEGylation which shields surface charges. However, since particles are taken up by endocytosis, they must be released from endosome to gain entry to cytoplasm. To facilitate endosomal release, a new endosomolytic polycation developed by Mirus, termed pBAVE, was incorporated in particle formation. We were pleasantly surprised by the ability of these particles to enable functional delivery of siRNA (21-23 bp) and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression cassette (a 443 bp PCR construct). This breakthrough was accomplished by the combined effects of reducing the level of glutaraldehyde cross-linking and administering a separate pBAVE polymer injection for additional endosomal releasing power. However, attaining functional delivery with reduced cross-linking was at the expense of decreased transfection efficiency to hepatocytes due to a reduction in particle stability and delivery efficiency. From our preliminary studies, 40-50% gene knockdown (up to 60-70% in selected animals) can be achieved. Although highly significant, to realize therapeutic benefits, an optimized delivery method will be necessary to achieve 70-80% or higher of knockdown consistently in hepatocytes. The current project, taking advantage of our highly successful preliminary results in obtaining functional RNAi effects in vivo, will focus on optimizing delivery of siRNA and shRNA expression cassette to hepatocytes so that only a single injection is needed to achieve this goal. The first three Specific Aims will optimize complex formation by 1) using Mirus' proprietary acid labile technology to develop reversible cross-linkers that will enhance endosomal release, 2) develop reversible PEGylation molecules for surface charge shielding so that endosomolytic function of pBAVE in caged complex can be reactivated, and 3) incorporate these reagents to form hepatocyte targeted transfection competent complexes. Specific Aim 4 will evaluate the ability of these complexes to enable therapeutic relevant levels of RNAi- mediated knockdown of target gene in normal and diseased mice. Given the immense commercial interest of delivering functional nucleic acids constructs, including RNAi molecules, to normal and diseased liver, successful development of these technologies may potentially revolutionize therapeutic strategies used to treat metabolic diseases, and other disorders specific to hepatocytes including cancer, hepatitis and cirrhosis. The goal of this study is to develop a safe and effective delivery system as a gene therapy tool to transfer nucleic acid molecules to hepatocytes in the liver. A large number of hereditary and acquired diseases can be treated by liver based gene therapy. Successful development of this technology will have great values both as a research tool and as a therapeutic delivery system.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 6. Project Summary/Abstract MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small, non-coding RNAs, approximately 19-23 nucleotides in length, that regulate gene expression by binding to sequences within the 3' untranslated regions of specific target mRNAs; a single miRNA might bind to and regulate as many as 200 diverse targets. Only recently discovered, and thought to be essential for cell proliferation and differentiation, it is clear that abnormalities in miRNA activity contribute to the pathogenesis of human diseases including cancer. Microarrays are ideal for high-throughput analysis of gene expression; however, when analyzing miRNA expression levels this is made difficult by their inherent small size (which provides little sequence for designing microarray capture sequences or attaching label) and the fact that they represent only ~0.01% of the mass of a total RNA sample. Typically, for microarray applications, fluorescent dyes such as Cy(tm)3 and Cy(tm)5 are added to miRNAs using a poly(A) polymerase-based method. Label IT(r) reagents (Mirus Bio) utilize alkylating chemistry to covalently link a detectable marker such as Cy3 and Cy5 directly to nucleic acids. Labeling miRNA samples with the Label IT reagents generates microarray expression profiles that consistently identify miRNAs that the enzymatic labeling methods fail to detect, including potential diagnostic markers documented in various cancers. Expression profiling of miRNAs for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of human diseases is a rapidly expanding field of research that is critically dependent on the successful identification of all miRNA species present in the sample. To determine the number of discrepancies in the miRNA expression profiles generated using Label IT technology and enzymatic labeling methodologies in microarray analyses, miRNA-enriched samples from human tumor/normal cell line pairs will be labeled using chemical and enzymatic methods, hybridized to multiple replicates of at least two different commercial microarrays, and the differences in expression profiles validated by independent methods. To optimize Label IT labeling for clinically relevant samples (where the amount of miRNA may be limiting), a systematic examination of various miRNA enrichment and amplification procedures will be performed using one tumor/normal cell line pair, and will include a determination of the minimum amount of non-amplified material needed to generate representative microarray expression profiles and the development of universal Label IT labeling protocols for processing clinical RNA samples. Furthermore, the Label IT technology will be optimized for microarray miRNA expression profiling of mouse and human cancer specimens. We anticipate that chemical labeling of miRNA from clinical research and diagnostic specimens will offer many critical advantages for accurate expression profiling compared to currently available enzymatic labeling methods. 7. Project Narrative MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small molecules that normally regulate cell growth, but they may cause diseases such as cancer when their expression is altered. Microarrays are a method for looking at the total expression of all genes in a given sample, and these expression profiles of miRNAs in diseased tissues may be used for diagnosis and to suggest treatment options. In contrast to other methods that use enzymes, Label IT(r) reagents chemically label miRNAs for examination by microarrays, resulting in a more accurate and complete expression profile compared to other labeling technologies with clear advantages for clinical research and diagnosis of human diseases.",

Mixing zones are limited regions in water bodies where the initial dilution of point-source wastewater discharge occurs.  Mixing zones are an important component of the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting process within Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) water quality management programs.  In Phase 1 MixZone developed a low cost, rapidly deployable, aerial remote sensing system for monitoring water quality in riverine mixing zones.  Our patent pending platform monitors outfall performance and focuses on temperature as a dilution tracer.  In cooperation with EPA Region 10 and Oregon DEQ, we successfully field demonstrated our system at an industrial discharge site.  We proved the technical feasibility of our remote sensing concept to gather continuous, real time, site scale, geo-reference mixing zone data for NPDES regulatory compliance and ESA habitat assessment.  Alternative aerial remote sensing platforms have limited availability, high costs, and long lead times to schedule deployment.  The cost of our platform will be 1/3 to 1/10 of competing technology.  Our platform can be deployed by 2-3 people with minimal operator training and is suitable for monitoring at fixed locations for longer time periods than is practical for alternative airborne sensors.  In Phase II, we will continue to focus on mixing zones in rivers, where vertical mixing of point sources discharges is rapid but may exhibit long downstream distances for full lateral mixing.  We will develop technology to better aim and control our sensors.  We will identify temperature differentials and associated wastewater types (e.g., process cooling waters, municipal effluents, pulp mill effluents, etc.), outfall configurations (e.g., surface shoreline, submerged single port, multiport diffuser), and ambient conditions that lead to successful monitoring.  We will develop tools for hydrodynamic mixing zone model validation and calibrations.  We will commercialize our platform by demonstrating deployment with industrial sponsors.  We will work with EPA partners on technology verification.  Although our platform detects temperature as a water quality parameter, the potential to model the fate and transport of other discharge constituents may be much more widespread, e.g., shoreline recreational exposure to pathogens from wastewater discharges, determination of spatial extent of contaminated sediment deposits from mining operations, detecting the impacts of contaminated groundwater interactions within in groundwater/surface recharge zones, and analysis of thermal refugia habitat for endangered species management.",

It is clear that future wide availability of smart sensors will significantly reduce the cost and time required to design, repair, or modify sensor systems through modular and re-configurable capability.  The Phase II effort will complete the development of: 1) common sensor interface, (2) microprocessor, (3) wireless interface, (4) signal conditioning and ADC/DAC, and (5) on-board EEPROM for metadata storage and executable software to create powerful, scalable, re-configurable, and reliable distributed test instrument. The transducer senses the physical quantity being measured and converts it into an electrical signal. Then the signal is fed to an A/D converter, and is ready for use by the processor to execute functional transformation based on the sensor characteristics stored in TEDS. In order to maximize the data efficiency, a plug-and-play is required to interface with traditional sensors to enhance their identity and capabilities for data processing and communications.  Virtual sensor test instrumentation is built upon open-system architecture with standardized protocol modules/stacks easily to interface with industry standards and commonly used software such as IEEE 1451, MATLAB, and LabVIEW.",

Because\nadenoviruses replicate on mucosal surfaces, they represent excellent vectors\nthat can be administered both orally and intranasally. The nearly ideal vaccine\nvector for immunization of carnivores against rabies would be the canine\nadenovirus type 2 (CAV 2) virus. The CAV 2 vaccine is a very effective livemodified\nvaccine which has an excellent safety record and which is being used\nworldwide for the routine vaccination of dogs against both CAV 1 and CAV 2.\nAlthough this vaccine is usually administered subcutaneously, it is also effective\nwhen administered orally and may allow for limited animal to animal\ntransmission. Previous phase I efforts demonstrated the initial proof of concept\nthrough successful construction and selection of CAV 2-RVG viruses followed by\nevaluation of safety and protective activity in laboratory animals. In this Phase II\nproject we propose to continue evaluation of the vaccine candidate through\noptimization of virus growth and production of a research viral seed (RVS) stock,\ngenetic and thermal stability studies, in vitro and in vivo safety studies, and safety\nand efficacy studies in target animals. It is likely that CAV2-RVG will be\nimmunogenic by the oral route in target animals resulting protective immunity\nagainst rabies.

Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop bioinformatic solutions that will enable predictions of drug activity and treatment outcome based on clinical data and the results less complex and more broadly available test procedures such as genotyping. The ultimate goal of the proposed phase II effort project is the development of a web-supported database retrieval system that will serve as the foundation for the commercialization of subscription-based products that support the clinical management of HIV/AIDS patients and the development of novel therapeutics. The successful completion of the proposed study will result in the development of a broadly accessible web based tool that will provide clinicians and researchers with broad access to a comprehensive warehouse of HIV data. Access to these data is expected to assist users in the clinical management of HIV/AIDS and the development of novel and effective therapeutics and treatment regimens. The proposed HIV information retrieval system will access Monogram's HIV resistance database that was developed during the phase I effort and currently contains matching phenotypic and genotypic resistance data on more that 76,000 patient viruses. Upon the successful completion of the phase II effort, users will have access to valuable resistance information for patient care and drug discovery research. Under the proposed phase II effort, three specific aims will be addressed. In aim 1, we will develop, test, and implement a commercially available web- supported database query tool with the ability to search the database by genotypic mutation and/or phenotypic susceptibility patterns. In aim 2, we will develop a subscription-based web tool for therapy guidance. In aim 3, we will develop, implement and test database storage and internet-access security. Successful completion of these three specific aims will enable the commercialization of novel web-based products that will have the potential to advance and improve the treatment of HIV/AIDS worldwide.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Experts agree that an effective vaccine against HIV infection will require the induction of potent and broad neutralizing antibody responses. Both the development and clinical evaluation of vaccine candidates requires a sensitive, reproducible and high throughput HIV antibody neutralization assay. Sensitivity and reproducibility are required to confidently measure and assess modest incremental improvements in vaccine design and delivery. High throughput capability is required to accommodate the cost effective and timely evaluation of vaccine candidates in large clinical trials. In addition, a neutralization assay that can be used to evaluate protective immunity in the SIV/macaque model will aid and enable the selection of the most promising candidates for large scale evaluations in human trials. Conventional HIV Antibody Neutralization Assays (i.e. manual PBMC based assays) do not adequately address the current and upcoming demands of heightened HIV vaccine development efforts.         In support of these important objectives, Monogram Biosciences (formerly ViroLogic, Inc.) has developed a sensitive neutralizing antibody assay (PhenoSense HIV Antibody Neutralization Assay) that uses viral pseudotypes that express the envelope proteins of patient-derived isolates (see Phase I final report). This assay allows for the direct measurement of autologous neutralizing titers in patient plasma, provides the ability to screen large panels of monoclonal antibodies for neutralizing activity to relevant primary strains, and allows for the direct comparison of antibody responses elicited by different vaccine immunogens. The assay has also been adapted to evaluate SIV envelope proteins and anti-SIV antibody responses in the macaque model.         In phase II of this project, we intend to optimize the performance and complete the characterization of the Phenosense HIV Antibody Neutralization Assay. The throughput and capacity of this assay will be augmented using custom automation and other scale-up techniques. The sensitivity, reproducibility and robustness of the assay will be evaluated and compared to the conventional PBMC-based method. We will develop informational database systems focused on linking envelope phenotype and sequence analysis. This database will undoubtedly become a useful tool for vaccine design. Monogram Biosciences intends to commercialize the PhenoSense HIV Antibody Neutralization Assay and associated database systems to support the development and clinical evaluation of new vaccine candidates generated in government, academic, and industrial laboratories.",

High throughput biomarker profiling offers the potential to predict drug toxicity to help reduce pipeline attrition. Reaction Biology Corporation has developed extremely low cost nanoliter reaction microarrays to serve markets for ultra high throughput screening (uHTS), large scale IC50 determinations, and selectivity profiling in drug discovery. These reactions are 1000 to 10,000-fold smaller than well plate formats currently used widely in drug discovery. Based on Phase I data demonstrating high sensitivity profiling of cellular antigens, we propose to create microarray products and technologies capable of evaluating drug-induced hepatotoxicity by screening large numbers of cell lysates obtained from cells treated with chemical compounds or their combinations. The following specific aims for Phase II research include: Aim 1 Develop and validate detection protocols for over 30 toxic-biomarkers involved in drug-induced liver toxicity testing. These markers will serve as the basis for the HepTox-chip(r) (hepatocyte toxic biomarkers antibody microarray) and for the Mi-HTS(r) (microarray immunoassay for high throughput screening) service offering. Aim 2 Establish a compound library including common over-the-counter and prescription drugs and test their hepatotoxicity profiles with HepTox-chip(r) and Mi-HTS(r) chip. This aim will be particularly useful for identifying unexpected drug- drug interactions of new chemical entities. Aim 3 Develop the Toxic-Informatics Database (ToxID(r)) by integrating the publicly available information related to biomarkers from Aim 1 in genomic, proteomic and clinic tests with common drugs tested in Aim 2 as a predictive tool for hepatotoxicity. The central goal of the proposed Phase II efforts is to develop two antibody microarray based products, one a marketable and user-friendly microarray chip detecting over 30 protein toxic-biomarkers and the other a service package that RBC provides for analyzing a large number of chemicals effects (e.g. test compound crossed against the OTC/prescription drug library) on hepatocyte toxic biomarker expression. Drug-induced liver toxicity is the major cause of drug-induced death and the principle reason for withdrawal of drugs from the market (Waring, 2003) and Food and Drug Adminstration (FDA) already sees toxicogenomic's potential in proving hypotheses that support safe drug use in humans through a mechanistic understanding of toxicities found in drug-treated animals (Lord & Papoian, 2004). The toxicoproteomic is a relatively new area that could have similar function but with more directed and precisely detection, because monitoring protein expression changes is more relevant than monitoring gene changes (Wetmore & Merrick, 2004; Kikkawa et al, 2006; Yamamoto et al, 2005).",

        "abstract": "This Small Businesss Innovation Reseach (SBIR) project will address a  major technological barrier to producing superior nanocomposites by overcoming the difficulty of dispersing nano-fillers uniformly in a host matrix to derive the maximum surface area advantage. When effective filler dispersion is coupled with improved polymer-clay interactions, a significant technological gap in the field of polymer nanocomposites can be addressed. The company, nanoSEC has licensed, developed, and 'validated' (lab scale) a supercritical fluid-based dispersion (SCFP) technology, that produces significant clay dispersion using a simple, versatile, environmentally friendly process that utilizes the unusual properties of supercritical CO2. During Phase I, the clay dispersion conditions were optimized and showed significant property improvements in the resultant nanocomposites that were appreciably better than those in literature. During Phase II, these technical accomplishments will be translated towards commercial success by: (1) producing and benchmarking pilot-scale\npolystyrene/clay, polyethylene/clay, polypropylene/clay nanocomposites for mechanical and barrier property improvements, with applications in automotive and food packaging industries; (2) scaling up the pilot production process to produce 200 lbs/week of dispersed clay in Year 1, and to produce 1 million lbs/year of polymer-clay nanocomposites (at 10% clay loading) by Year 3; (3) developing specific joint development agreements with business customers for faster adaptation of nanoSEC's technology in actual products.  Commercially, nanoSEC's technology addresses a key need in nanocomposites, which could single-handedly revive the packaging technology applications of nanocomposites. Several companies have expressed strong interest in joint development agreements. Working closely with Wayne State, and end users like Ford, Daimler Chrysler, and GE Plastics will enable nanoSEC to advance both on research and commercial sides to produce a revenue of close to $ 8 million by the end of 2008.

        "abstract": "Solar cells made from a copper-indium-gallium-diselenide (CIGS) absorber layer are more than 100X better at absorbing light than an equivalent absorber layer made from silicon; consequently, CIGS solar cells can be constructed as thin film devices, with less material usage and potentially less cost than conventional silicon-based solar cells.  A thinner absorber layer also results in less cell fragility, providing an opportunity to further reduce costs by reducing the packaging surrounding the solar cell.  Unfortunately, the production of CIGS-based solar cells is not cost effective.  The central challenge in cost-effectively constructing a large-area CIGS-based solar cell is to ensure that the elements of the CIGS layer are within a narrow stoichiometric ratio, as required for the resulting cell or module to be highly efficient.  However, achieving precise stoichiometric composition over relatively large substrate areas is difficult when using traditional vacuum-based deposition processes.  In this project, nanoparticulate CIGS precursor materials will be printed onto low-cost metal foil substrates, and then a rapid thermal processing will be performed to convert the nanoparticulate coating into a CIGS absorber layer.  By locking the appropriate stochiometry into the nanoparticulate precursor material, spatial uniformity will be ensured in the coated layers.  Printing at high speed and high throughout will minimize solar cell cost.  Phase I demonstrated that an efficient solar cell could be coated onto a foil using the new printing technology.  Phase II will construct these foil-based solar cells with increased power conversion efficiency.  The chemical composition of the light-absorbing layer will be modified to improve the optoelectronic performance of the device, and the performance characteristics of the devices will be determined.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Thin-film, low cost, solar cells could be deployed on the roofs of both residential homes and commercial buildings, as well as utility-scale solar power plants.  Such deployment would decrease the current U.S. dependence on foreign energy sources.",

        "abstract": "Solar thermal energy conversion is currently the lowest-cost source for environmentally-friendly, renewable solar energy.  However, to make this technology cost competitive with conventional power generation, capital investment must be reduced through increased component longevity or increased system efficiency.  This project involves the further development of nanostructured, multilayer coating materials for improving the efficiency of solar thermal conversion, reducing its cost, and increasing the longevity of installed capacity.  Phase I demonstrated not only feasibility but also significant progress for the construction of large area nanocomposite reflectors and the fabrication of flexible mirrors.  Phase II will build on these gains to create greatly enhanced reflector/mirror products.  The materials will be applied to large areas with closed or open geometries using environmentally benign techniques.  This is in direct contrast with existing technologies for coating applications (for example, CVD and PVD), which require specialized chambers and nonambient conditions.

This project will develop an innovative class of low-cost sheet molding compound (SMC) bipolar plates consisting of a thin nanocomposite core layer sandwiched between two sheets of flexible graphite (FG).  The nanocomposite core layer imparts desired structural integrity to the plate while the FG sheets contribute to electrical conductivity, flexibility, resistance to corrosion, and gas permeation.  Both the nanocomposite core and the FG sheets each can be very thin (less than 0.125 mm), resulting in ultra-thin bipolar plates and hence fuel cell systems that are more compact and lightweight.  Phase I demonstrated that thin FG-SMC bipolar plates can possess conductivity much higher than 100 S/cm (a DOE target), with area specific conductivity greater than 400 S/cm2 (exceeding another DOE target of 100 S/cm2).  Phase I also demonstrated the feasibility of an SMC fabrication process.  In Phase II, a performance characterization and analysis of the FG-SMC bipolar plates will be conducted to establish product specifications (e.g., the strength, flexibility, electrical conductivity, gas permeation, and corrosion rates of the bipolar plates will be experimentally measured and compared with theoretical predictions), and a pilot-scale apparatus will be constructed.

        "abstract": "Each year, about 15 million vehicles are discarded and processed by recycling companies for extraction of recyclable materials.  While almost all metals are recycled, most non-metallic components of the vehicle (approximately 25% by weight) are not, and are landfilled instead.  Therefore, methods and technologies are needed to enable the recycling of these non-metal materials, especially automobile plastics, in order to conserve resources and reduce energy usage.  This project will develop a new high-speed electronic detection and sorting technology that can:  (1) identify durable automobile plastics as they flow dry in bulk quantities on a conveying system, and (2) sort the plastics into marketable polymer fractions.  This new detection and sorting system will be applied to the recovery and recycling of automotive plastics derived from end-of-life automobile shredder plants.  In Phase I, a bench-scale prototype sensing system was designed, constructed, tested, and evaluated.  Using the prototype system, the feasibility of constructing a high-speed multispectral imaging system, suitable for use in a sorting environment, was established.  Phase II will design, engineer, construct, test, and evaluate a prototype high-speed multispectral imaging system that will be integrated with a materials sorting system for automated identification and sorting of polymers from a mixed-polymer stream of plastics.  The prototype sorting system will be used to demonstrate the sorting of mixed plastics derived from end-of-life automobiles at commercially-viable processing rates.   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new technology should enable an increased ability to recycle used automotive plastics, thereby conserving energy, conserving increasingly limited resources, and reducing the flow of materials to landfills.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): LONG TERM OBJECTIVES AND SPECIFIC AIMS: We aim to restore near conversational rate speech in locked-in individuals. In the Phase 1 study, neural recordings from the speech motor area in a 23 year old locked-in subject implanted with the Neurotrophic Electrode System since December 2004 have yielded neural data that have been mapped to phonemic representations and to imagined and actual movements. In the proposed work, we intend to incorporate sophisticated speech recognition algortithms, such as Artificial Neural Networks and Hidden Markov Models, in order to enable rapid pattern recognition for purposes of a real-time Speech Prosthetic development. In addition, Population Vector Analysis as performed for chronic motor studies may realize a method of converting individual neuronal firings into Phonemic or Articulatory Space for driving a Speech Synthesis Model. An additional patient will be implanted with the electrode system to expand and verify the work achieved with the initial subject. The resulting data will add much to understanding the cortical organization of speech production and accelerate the development of a speech prosthetic for locked-in individuals. The website development for data sharing purposes will be expanded and used by the collaborators and other interested parties.         RELEVANCE OF RESEARCH TO PUBLIC HEALTH: The creation of a Speech Prosthetic Device is much needed by locked-in patients suffering from ALS and brain stem stroke. The substantial research being performed in invasive neuroprosthetic studies is focused on enabling recovery of lost motor functions in paralyzed limbs or providing indirect communication through computer software. This work is helpful to locked-in patients; however, such patients have indicated that real-time spontaneous speech is a much more desirable final application. The purpose of this research is to develop a speech prosthetic device using the Neurotrophic Electrode Human Cortical Recording system with sophisticated pattern recognition models and software.

At present, approximately 95% of all behavioral and psychiatric data collected in dementia clinical trials and research is recorded using paper forms, imposing numerous fundamental inefficiencies and costs. Although computerized utilities exist for various post-acquisition components such as enrollment, scheduling and tracking, all of these require a stage of manual transcription from paper source documents, creating the need for on-site monitoring. No integrated system exists that achieves direct capture of primary data, nor have any of the multitude of interviews and rating scales for AD trials and research been computerized. Moreover, the collective ergonomic requirements for face-to-face administration and multiple forms of data input (e.g. written text, analog scales, check boxes) impose formidable, unresolved technical demands. The project objective is to develop an enterprise class system for comprehensive computerized implementationof interview-based behavioraland psychiatric assessments in clinicaltrials andresearchof new treatments for Alzheimer's disease. The Computerized Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Interview System (CADCIS) will utilize tablet PCs to replace paper forms with full-size, \"smart\" electronic forms in face-to-face clinicalratinginterviews,achieving immediateelectronic capture, thus eliminating subsequent error-pronesteps of manualdatatranscription and transfer (e.g., CaseReport Form creation and management) and costlyon-site data processing. The CADCIS will provide a Master Set (inclusive of > 90% of all current protocols) of established evaluation instruments selected by a steering committee of recognized authorities in the field of AD/dementia research, including the Director of the NIMH-sponsored CATIE-AD consortium and leading members of the NIA-sponsored Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS). Advanced data processing, reporting and management utilities will greatly simplify multicenter research. Integral rater training modules will provide on-demand orientation and certification for all instruments in the master set. Integrated virtual private network and wireless technologies will enable a range of automated data transfer and secure communication functions. The technical utility, acceptability and management capabilities of the system will be established in multicenter studies at leading AD/dementia research centers. The CADCIS will be integrated with a computerized dementia assessment system (CEDAS, currently under development (R43 AG026402-01) that includes widely-applied cognitive assessment instruments such as the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS). Conjunctively, the CADCIS and CDAS will provide a unified solution for comprehensive computerized assessment of AD and related dementias.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices - 'brain pacemakers' - have recently emerged as an exciting novel neurotechnology for treating severe movement disorders, such as Parkinson's Disease and Essential Tremor. Accurate mapping of deep brain regions is necessary to obtain an optimal treatment of DBS with minimal risk to the patient. At present, electrophysiological mapping involves slowly advancing a single-channel microelectrode in small steps in order to record the neural activity in the region of the electrode tip. This process is tedious and time-consuming due to the serial nature of the procedure. The subject of this proposal, the Deep Brain Microelectrode Array (DBMA), is an innovative device that has multiple precisely placed sites along its length which permit simultaneous recording and stimulation at different depths in the brain, leading to more accurate and faster mapping. The DBMA is a modular device that consists of up to 18 recording sites positioned in a bi-linear arrangement such that multiple brain regions spanning 9mm or more may be monitored simultaneously. The basic components of the DBMA are the electrode array and the carrier. The electrode array is a microfabricated device based on polyimide with thin-film metal interconnects and electrode sites. The carrier is comprised of a clinical grade tungsten microelectrode and a polyimide tube. The device has been designed using FDA cleared materials and has the same form factor as a single-channel mapping microelectrode, essentially making it a drop-in replacement for the current device. Specific Aim 1 of Phase II will focus on extending the functionality of the recording array developed in Phase I by adding ring-shaped sites to the device that are suitable for macrostimulation. Manufacturing techniques will be optimized for high volume and clinical device production. Specific Aim 2 will develop a clinical grade multichannel data acquisition and stimulation system for use with the multimodal DBMA. The devices and instrumentation developed and bench tested in Aims 1 and 2 will be validated for use in mapping procedures in animals in Specific Aim 3. The outcome of the project will be a complete deep brain mapping system (i.e., mapping electrodes and instrumentation) ready for pre-clinical evaluation. An animal research version of the system will be ready for commercialization. NeuroNexus, Inc. is leading the project in collaboration with FHC, Inc., the University of Michigan and consultants from the Cleveland Clinic. This multi-disciplinary effort will result in a system positioned to become a key component in the planning and delivery of stereotactic interventions for neurological disorders, which will enable further optimization of current treatments and facilitate new treatments. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices - 'brain pacemakers' - have recently emerged as an exciting novel neurotechnology for treating severe movement disorders, such as Parkinson's Disease and Essential Tremor.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will develop a system both for training efficient handwriting in school children and for scientific testing of hypotheses on handwriting education. Handwriting is the only and most widely learned fine motor skill. The US school system spends $200M per year (our estimate) on handwriting instruction materials. Teachers receive only limited training to teach handwriting and the curriculum permits only limited time for handwriting instruction. Yet, little is known how to improve quality and time efficiently of handwriting instruction. To satisfy the demand for scientific support of handwriting instruction, we are developing the \"WritAlyzeR\" software. This software can work autonomously during the normal lessons of the class. Therefore, the handwriting learning data collected will be more representative than previous automatic handwriting instruction systems where a teacher or experimenter monitors and influences the children. The WritAlyzeR enables researchers to conduct research on handwriting instruction in a very time saving manner. The WritAlyzeR, in combination with our existing MovAlyzeR will form a powerful research tool to test many hypotheses on improving handwriting teaching methods. We will market the WritAlyzeR as a computer-aided instruction system and also provide it as a free extension to all researchers who purchased MovAlyzeR licenses so that many more research groups will be able to find ways to improve handwriting instruction in a concerted effort. This will eventually yield improved handwriting instruction methods for primary school education. The WritAlyzeR uses a simple procedure to teach children handwriting. First the child will see an example of the writing exercise as a real-time movement on the PC display. Subsequently, the student will try to perform the writing movement. The movement will be recorded using a low-cost digitizer made for the educational market for less than $200. A digitizer consists of a small tablet and an electronic pen which enables high-precision (0.01 cm) recording of the position of the pen tip at a high sampling rate (100 Hz), thus accurately capturing movements of the pen tip on and above the tablet. The recorded movement will be processed on the PC and presented on the display in real-time. Color coding of the strokes will show where the child used abnormal forces. In addition, a cumulative fluency score will be presented which increases while the child keeps improving movement fluency. As a reward, the child can play briefly on a novel computer game which requires fluent movements to succeed. In this proposal three of the many possible hypotheses will be tested. Does varying writing size help to obtain optimal hand posture and pen grip and eventually more efficient writing? Does preplanning the target point of each stroke accelerate learning? Does real-time sound feedback during writing indicating dysfluencies help to improve fluency? R44 HD 43576 \"Handwriting Teaching Tool\" 12/23/2005 5:57 PM Narrative Handwriting instruction is needed to produce efficient and legible handwriting. This will remain important since students lacking handwriting proficiency will be disadvantaged in taking lecture notes or writing exams. Teachers have insufficient training and time to teach handwriting and refer many students to occupational therapists taking away time to treat students with motor control problems. As a consequence, after-school handwriting instruction for children is in demand. Illegible or slow handwriting causes too low grades barring students from continued education. Handwriting re-education is also in demand in health care. Illegible handwriting by physicians causes 10% of the prescriptions to be misread causing preventable medication errors.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An innovative system for the transmission and storage of polysomnography data is proposed with the aim of creating a more efficient and globally connected system of sharing, archiving, and remotely accessing sleep studies. The system will include an open file specification, a network transmission protocol, the tools needed to translate existing software approaches into the open standard, and the establishment of a centralized sleep record database with Web 2.0 online collaboration capability and distributed workflow services. The file specification (OpenXDF) is based on XML and has been promoted and beta tested by prominent companies and research facilities in the sleep community. An organization and initiative (OpenXDF Initiative) was created to spearhead a combined effort between researchers, clinicians, and engineers to develop an interchangeable PSG data format that is used on commercially available NPSG acquisition software systems to advance the fields of polysomnography and neurology. The specification is superior to existing open file formats in that it is extensible, heavily biased towards use in a web environment, and capable of being integrated into existing commercial systems. The OpenXDF format will continue to be fine-tuned based on the suggestions received during peer reviews and the feedback compiled from the organization's website. Software development and file conversion tools will be made available to third parties for easy integration of the file format into their existing PSG software architectures. A network transmission protocol will also be developed which will allow access to sleep studies in the OpenXDF format from any computer connected to a TCP/IP network, including the Internet. Patient privacy will be preserved using access controls and strong encryption. Research methods in compression techniques and data interpolation will be employed to assemble the file on the client-end despite network latencies so that sleep studies may be seamlessly reviewed and paged remotely using low cost Internet connections. Research into Web 2.0 scripting technology will aid the development and support of a networked server hosting a database of NPSG studies to subscribed members and allowing online collaboration, open dialog among experts, and the sharing of records, scoring information, and normative PSG data within an online portal. The database and analysis back-end software will be encapsulated by a web-based application linking the records, all registered members, and the scorers with a dynamic graphical interface. The innovative system will encourage open engagement among associates of the sleep community and the vivid sharing of extensive sleep record information over many scorers in real-time. The complete project will be based on advanced development technology and concepts including interpreted languages, ATL, PHP, AJAX, and XML. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The resulting system will improve health care and advance research in sleep medicine due to the increased availability of interchangeable polysomnography data and research tools in the open market. The overall cost burden on hospitals and clinics will be reduced due to a shift in focus from equipment sales involving a large capital investment to a service-based business model with small initial deposits and monthly charges for NPSG database access, review, scoring, and analysis features.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vascular disease is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes, leading to nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, and ischemic disease. Hyperglycemic damage to vascular endothelial cells is a major cause of these vascular complications of diabetes. This endothelial dysfunction is caused by oxidative stress induced by hyperglycemia, resulting in both the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased bioavailability of NO. Hyperglycemia also causes similar oxidative stress in renal mesangial cells, which stimulates the production of TGFa1 and extracellular matrix proteins, leading to matrix expansion, glomerosclerosis, and renal functional impairment. We have developed a novel drug (OX029) for treatment of hyperglycemia-induced endothelial dysfunction and diabetic nephropathy. OX029 is a bifunctional NO-donor/SOD-mimetic which is a derivative of a-lipoic acid. The Phase I study demonstrated that daily i.p. administration of OX029 (30 mg/kg) for 2 months to diabetic streptozotocin-treated (STZ) rats completely prevented surrogate markers for diabetic nephropathy (albuminuria) and endothelial dysfunction (impaired acetylcholine-induced relaxation of precontracted aortas). This is compelling evidence that OX029 may be an effective drug for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy and the vascular complications of diabetes in human. For OX029 to be useful as a drug, however, it must be safe, orally active, and have sustained efficacy over a long period of hyperglycemia. The primary objective of this Phase II study is to determine the long-term efficacy of oral administration of OX029 in preventing diabetic nephropathy and endothelial dysfunction in animal models of type 1 diabetes (STZ-treated rats) and type 2 diabetes (genetically obese db/db mice). This study will determine the efficacy of OX029 to prevent the damaging effects of hyperglycemia, including nephropathy (mesangial matrix expansion, glomerulosclerosis, increase in glomerular basement membrane thickness, increased glomerular TGFa expression and collagen IV deposition, increased urinary excretion of albumin, TGFa, and collagen IV), and loss of endothelium-dependent, nitric-oxide mediated vasodilation. This will require developing scale-up protocols for the large-scale synthesis of 250 grams of OX029, developing a stable formulation for mixture in dietary chow, and determination of an appropriate dosing regimen for administration in the diet. A related objective will be to determine the pharmacokinetic properties of OX029 in rats and mice, and the physiochemical properties of OX029. Additional medicinal chemistry will be done to improve the PK properties of OX029 and extend the plasma half-life of the oral formulation. It is hoped that the successful outcome of these studies will provide the primary data for submission of an IND for subsequent study of OX029 in humans. The long-term objective of this project is the development of an orally active drug (OX029) for diabetics which can prevent or reverse the damaging effects of chronic hyperglycemia on the vasculature and the kidney. Diabetes is the most common cause of kidney failure in the U.S., and there are approximately 150 million Americans living with kidney failure as a result of diabetes. The cost of care for diabetic patients with kidney failure was estimated in 2003 to be $12-15 billion. Neurox has developed a drug, OX029, which was shown in the Phase I SBIR study to prevent kidney damage (nephropathy) in a rat model of diabetes. The Phase II grant will determine if OX029 administered orally can prevent the nephropathy in long-term studies in models of type 1 diabetes (rats) and type 2 diabetes (mice). The goal is to develop OX029 for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy in humans, and significantly reduce the number of diabetic patients that develop kidney failure.",

The commercialized product with disposable tag sensors can replace the jungle of wiring currently used with direct-wired sensors or, for wireless pods, the need to replace batteries frequently. The system provides a patient monitoring capability that is very convenient, highly-cost effective, capable of chronic use, and does not interfere with nearby heart pacers.\nThe ease of application makes this system ideal as a teaching tool for medical students and specialists with both visual waveforms and sound presented to the operator simultaneously. The system will be used in hospitals, clinics, medical offices, and for outpatients in the home.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness in the world. Glaucoma is a complex disease with many underlying causes. Currently, the only effective treatment is reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) to a clinically safe range. A significant portion of individuals with glaucoma will require surgical intervention to stop progressive optic nerve damage. Current surgical options for refractory glaucomas include trabeculectomy and the use of glaucoma drainage implants. Although antimetabolites have improved success rates for trabeculectomy, their use is associated with unpredictable control of flow, hypotony, wound leaks, capsular fibrosis and infection. Glaucoma tube implants have been gaining popularity, but all current commercially available devices are plagued with a fibrotic response that ultimately limits the outflow facility of these devices and prevents lower IOP. In addition, the fibrous capsule increases the risk of motility disturbances and drooping of the eyelid and ultimately limits the filtration life of these glaucoma implants. Attempts to modify the fibrotic response to conventional implants have largely been unsuccessful. There have been recent attempts to develop newer generation glaucoma implants using various biocompatible membranes with limited success. We successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a particular biocompatible membrane with a proven glaucoma tube implant to favorably modulate the fibrotic response at the conclusion of our Phase I SBIR grant. For this Phase II application we propose a unique implant design consisting of a biocompatible material that demonstrates advantageous flow and tissue characteristics in animals and humans. We propose to integrate an existing implant with new material to improve performance. The device will be tested in a rabbit model system, and then in humans. The histology, safety, and effectiveness of the implants will be analyzed in the rabbit study. Thereafter, manufacturing of the final prototype for humans will begin along with the development of a mass manufacturing system for the final product. With improved long-term performance of this implant, use of surgical devices would likely increase significantly. Development of this safe and effective glaucoma drainage device will greatly improve the ability to reduce blindness from this common disorder. This project aims to prevent blindness in glaucoma patients through the development of a new glaucoma drainage device.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this program is to improve the diagnostic sensitivity and especially the specificity of autofluorescence endoscopes by examining additional information on the molecular constituents of the tissue being observed as determined by a fiberoptic Raman probe. The combined instrument will first use autofluorescence imaging to quickly identify areas of tissue which are likely to be dysplastic or cancerous. In a standard bronchoscopy procedure a small sample of tissue from this area would be taken with forceps passed through the narrow biopsy channel of the endoscope. In this program, a fiberoptic Raman probe will first be passed through this biopsy channel and pressed lightly against the suspect area of tissue. A 1-second pulse of narrowband, 830 nm light will be directed onto the tissue through a central fiber and lens assembly at the distal tip of the probe. A long-pass filter in the tip of the probe will block the backscattered 830 nm excitation wavelength but pass the longer wavelength tissue fluorescence and Raman-shifted light into a ring of collection fibers. These collection fibers will carry the scattered light back to a spectrometer which will disperse it into a characteristic Raman \"fingerprint\" spectrum. This spectrum contains many individual peaks corresponding to the concentration of specific molecules in the tissue. The standard biopsy will then be taken from the tissue site and sent to a pathology lab to be examined for evidence of dysplasia or cancer. This program will catalog the measured spectra and correlate them with the results of pathology. Once the catalog of spectra contains samples of normal, dysplastic and cancerous tissue fingerprints it will be possible to begin to predict, in real-time, what the results of pathology will be. A large number of spectra will need to be collected, however, from many different stages of discovered cancers before the predicted results are likely to be reliable. The use of autofluorescence imaging during bronchoscopy procedures has been shown to improve the sensitivity of cancer diagnosis over that which can be achieved by white light observation alone. This means there are few instances where a truly cancerous or dysplastic area of tissue is seen to be normal (a false negative determination of cancer). On the other hand, the method often classifies normal tissue as cancerous (a false positive determination) which leads to an additional risk to the patient from unnecessary biopsies, wasted time during the procedure and additional costs. The additional information from the Raman probe is expected to be able to identify many of these false positive sites as truly normal, increasing the specificity of the tissue characterization. Once the method is proven to be effective it will reduce patient risk, reduce the time required for procedures and reduce the cost of unnecessary biopsies.",

While steady progress has been made in hardware development, lagging has been the availability of a software environment that provides for accurate reconstructions on a fast time scale and versatile phantoms well suited to explore the wide range of complex behavior inherent to neuroactivation. Building on significant progress made during Phase I, we have developed a fast and stable image enhancement scheme that can significantly improve the image accuracy of first order reconstructions. Independently, by adopting principles from liquid crystal technology, we have developed programmable dynamic phantoms that mimic complex hemodynamic events with high accuracy, precision and speed. The proposed investigation will combine these two innovations to allow for the systematic optimization and quantitative examination by which dynamic NIRS imaging can explore complex neurovascular states. These efforts complement a broader seven-year technology development plan that has already produced an imaging system now in use at ten leading national and international research centers. The proposed study considers an in-depth optimization of user controllable factors (e.g., optimal selection of illuminating wavelengths, improvements in accuracy of reconstructred images, fine tuning of the image enhancement scheme) so as to determine the underlying accuracy and stability of the integrated technology as a function of a range of parameters intrinsic to the brain. The end point of these studies will be a ground truth validation of the fidelity and accuracy of the NIRS imaging approach developed by our company. Through careful optimization of the principal system components, we are confident that the combination of new technologies, and innovative improvements to our software environment will lead to the broad acceptance of NIRS imaging as a versatile and accurate neuroimaging tool. The systematic testing and integration of a new image enhancement scheme for functional NIRS imaging and its ground truth validation using an innovative and versatile assessment modality is proposed for the purpose overcoming the key technology barriers preventing the wide acceptance of functional NIRS imaging.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II research project is to develop a more secure encryption key for non-volatile memory. Secure ICs often utilize encryption to protect non-volatile memory contents. A clever engineer can recover the key after decapsulating and probing the semiconductor die. NVE intends to produce an innovative non-volatile spintronic cryptographic key memory that will self-erase without data remanence in the event of tampering and without applied power. The main research objectives of this work involve development of a fully integrated 256-bit embedded tamper resistant magnetic random access memory.  The technology proposed in this Phase II SBIR program is intended to provide a defense against theft of intellectual property and to protect sensitive data stored in an integrated circuit. Identity theft has become a very large issue for society in general and particularly in the more computerized societies. This is more than a problem of economics, as US military systems have also been reversed engineered by both friendly and unfriendly nations to gain access to\nUS weapons capability. The technology proposed under the Phase II program addresses the need to provide a tighter level of security for data stored on integrated circuit (IC) and IC assemblies. Commercially, this provides an extra layer of protection on IC-based assemblies such as smart cards, cash machines etc. In addition, the proposed program would render a system inoperable in the event of physical tamper. This may be a very useful tool in stemming the tide of fraudulent usage, compromises, and reverse engineering of IC-based instruments as well as certain types of identify theft.",

Thus, it is also an increasingly popular, cost-effective survey research environment. Web surveys facilitate health researchers rapidly and efficiently reaching very large numbers of targeted individuals. Web interviews can collect knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to disease prevention, health promotion, and clinical trial and/or health services delivery participation. However, to effectively conduct Internet research requires an easy, intuitive and rapid survey development and deployment tool designed to accommodate complexities of research interviews. Most web- based survey development tools are designed for simple, linear market research and customer satisfaction surveys. Few are designed for the researcher conducting multifaceted research and/or surveillance survey studies and still fewer meet Federal web survey requirements. NOVA's proposed Questionnaire Development System (QDS(tm)) module for Internet administration (QDS-Web(tm)) is such a tool. It uses Windows-based designs to easily generate survey files that meet Federal Web display (Sec. 508) and DHHS/FDA data security/audit trail requirements, an administrator's tool to quickly deploy secure Web-based complex research surveys, and a Web-based database to securely store and manage interviewee responses. Targeted users are researchers conducting behavioral surveys, clinical trials, health services research, and disease surveillance. QDS-Web(tm) supplements NOVA's commercial QDS(tm) Suite, with a growing base of more than 1,500 users worldwide. Phase II involves (1) enhancing code to handle survey control file functionality, including response types, skip patterns, range edits/consistency checks, logic expressions, and randomization algorithms; (2) creating web options allowing user-designed cascading style sheets and Web-based reports; (3) providing Cyrillic, Arabic, and Asian scripting and capability to select character formats (font, style, size); (4) implementing secure data transmission and storage, audit trails, and data transfer to SAS/SPSS using format libraries; (5) providing support for additional databases, middleware languages, and application servers; and (6) developing online documentation. During Phase II, individual and small group evaluations, in-depth qualitative interviews, and standardized usability surveys will be conducted with diverse sets of researchers. Beta testing will evaluate usability and functionality on comprehensiveness of features, ease of survey development/deployment, general usefulness, and overall satisfaction with using the QDS-Web(tm) module. The end product, QDS-Web(tm), as an added module to the QDS(tm) Suite, will be the only U.S.-made survey development integrated product enabling researchers to conduct computer-based surveys in all current modes of data collection from one design specification and securely manage data in one Warehouse Manager. QDS-Web(tm) Interview Administering System Questionnaire Development System Web-based data collection administration module (QDS-Web(tm)) is an added module to NOVA's commercial QDS(tm) Suite that enables public health researchers to conduct knowledge, attitude and behavior data collection for pubic health research and surveillance for general and sensitive health information. While most web-based survey research software is designed for simple, linear market research surveys and only supports web surveying, the QDS(tm) Suite, when including QDS-Web(tm) will permit researchers to easily, quickly, and cost-effectively conduct complex research surveys in all existing modes of survey administration from one integrated set of survey specifications that meet DHHS data transmission and storage security and audit trail requirements for behavioral, health services, and clinical trials research. Web surveying facilitates health researchers reaching large numbers of targeted populations, remote and hidden populations, and otherwise difficult to interview individuals not visiting face-to-face interviewing venues, and individuals not wanting to be personally identified.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is phase I of a FAST TRACK SBIR grant proposal. The primary goal of this study is to generate a novel glioma cell vaccine comprised of six well-characterized allogeneic glioma cell lines in whichTGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 secretion has been abrogated using gene knockout technology. The vaccine generated in this manner will be used to immunize patients with stage IV astrocytoma (glioblastoma multiforme and gliosarcoma) in a Phase II/III clinical trial with the goal of inducing antitumor immunity that leads to clinical responses, to be partially funded by the accompanying phase II grant proposal. By blocking secretion of the immunosuppressive TGF-beta molecules in this manner, we inhibit one of the major mechanisms by which tumor cells evade immune surveillance. Development of an effective therapy for this disease will benefit the approximately 20,000 new patients that develop glial tumors in the United States each year. The milestone for progressing to the phase II SBIR proposal will be successful generation and certification of master and working vaccine cell banks. The first aim of the study is to completely abrogate expression TGF-beta1 andTGF-beta2 by knocking out the paternal and maternal copies for TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 genes in six allogeneic glioma cell lines. Candidate cells chosen from eighteen malignant glioma cell lines carried in the cryopreservation inventory of NovaRx will be transfected with the constructed TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 knockout vectors. Following selection of cells in the presence of designated drugs, the surviving cell colonies will be expanded and characterized to ascertain the correct incorporation of the recombinant unit and expression of glioma-associated antigens. The lack of expression of TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 will be confirmed by Northern and Southern blot analyses, ELISA, and Western blot analyses. Additionally, we will characterize the gene-modified cells by HLA and glial cell marker phenotyping. We are expecting of a stable 100% down-regulation of TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 secretion. The second aim of the study is to generate master and working cell banks of the six allogeneic cell lines generated in Aim 1. The cell banks will be tested for the presence of bacteria, fungi, adventitious viruses, mycoplasma, and endotoxin in order to certify them for use in a Phase II/III clinical trial. Completion of Aims l and 2 serves as a milestone for initiation of the Phase II study. We anticipate that genetic modification of malignant glioma cells to block TGF-beta expression would result in the gene-modified cells becoming more immunogenic and suitable for active tumor immunotherapy.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, most tissue banks use a two step process to sterilize soft tissue allografts. The initial step reduces the bioburden with the second step in sterilization resulting in \"terminal sterilization\". The direct result of Phase 1 funding has been the development of a terminal sterilization technology using supercritical CO2 and a proprietary additive that will allow tissue banks to easily process soft tissue allografts to a sterility assurance level equal to that called for in medical devices (SAL6) in a one step process. Sterilization was confirmed according to the standards in AMI/ISO 11737-1 and 2. The sterilization technology is capable of inactivating a wide variety of microorganisms at concentrations of greater than 106 colony forming units (CFUs) in a half cycle. Utilizing sterilization times as determined from D-value calculations according to the methods of Stumbo-Murphy-Cochran (terminal sterilization at 2.5 hours and overkill at 4 hours) we assessed the affect of our supercritical CO2 process on the biomechanical properties of bone-tendon-bone (BTB) patellar tendon allografts. Biomechanical data obtained revealed no significant difference between the supercritical CO2 sterilized and control group (ANOVA statistical analysis and paired T-testing). The technology developed in Phase 1 will offer an alternative to methods of sterilization of soft tissue allografts used by tissue banks. Musculoskeletal conditions (diseases and disorders) have a tremendous impact on society. In the United States alone, musculoskeletal conditions cost society an estimated $254 billion yearly with 1 out of every 7 Americans reporting a musculoskeletal impairment. Each year, 28.6 million Americans incur a musculoskeletal injury with approximately 7.5 million musculoskeletal procedures performed by physicians. The importance of allograft tissue in the treatment of orthopedic patients has grown rapidly during the last decade. Tendon, ligament and joint injuries represent 45% of the musculoskeletal injuries each year. Tendon injuries are especially common, requiring surgical repair to replace shoulder rotator cuff tendons (51,000/year), achilles tendon (44,000/year), and the patellar tendon (42,000/year) to name a few. Concomitant with the increased demand for tissue has been the increase potential of exposures to pathogens. There is high potential for bacterial or viral contamination of allograft tissue without adequate secondary sterilization processing. Thus, the safety of allograft tissue has become a primary focus for the tissue bank industry, clinicians, and the FDA. Phase II funding will allow us to further optimize the sterilization process by addressing packaging (double packaging and header packs) as recommended by tissue banks and orthopedic surgeons. This packaging will result in a terminally sterilized product ready for direct transfer for transplant.     The importance of allograft material in the treatment of orthopedic patients has grown rapidly during the last decade, which leads to a growing concern for an increased potential of exposure to pathogens. Viral and bacterial contamination of allograft tissue without adequate secondary sterilization processing remains an issue. Thus, the safety of allograft tissue has become a primary focus for the tissue bank industry, clinicians and the FDA. The tissue bank industry and processing centers have invested numerous hours and a large amount of money into methods of processing to achieve a high quality and safe. By providing a one step terminal sterilization process (sterilized grafts in final packaging), our company would be adding value and safety to the processing that occurs in the tissue bank industry. The only two processes capable of terminal sterilization of allografts are ethylene oxide and gamma irradiation which suffer from major drawbacks if used at a concentration to achieve SAL6 thus requiring a two step process to minimize the dosage. Terminal sterilization using our supercritical CO2 process has the potential to add a one step validated terminal sterilization process to tissue banking while decreasing the costs of processing and generating a safer product. Funding for Phase I has allowed us to show the feasibility of supercritical CO2 as a method of overcoming the current limited sterilization options. Funding of phase II will allow us to take the next steps towards successful commercialization by further optimization of packaging design (allowing for a terminally sterilized product of various sizes) and other pathogenic inactivation in soft tissue allografts.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our program is to develop safe and effective techniques to combat tissue damage caused by ischemia. The specific aims of this proposal are to investigate high-energy phosphate contents in human non-healing chronic wounds, to further improve our direct intracellular energy delivery technique, to use this technique in wound treatment, and to study some of the mechanisms by which intracellular energy supply enhances wound healing. Our central hypotheses are that depletion of high energy phosphate contents is the fundamental cause of non-healing chronic wounds; and that direct intracellular delivery of ATP to the wound will improve the microenvironment and substantially enhance the healing process. Results from our Phase I study also found that: 1) tissue biopsies taken from human chronic wounds showed significantly reduced high-energy phosphate contents; 2) intracellular ATP delivery using VitaSolTM substantially increased wound tissue high-energy phosphate contents in a rabbit ear model; and 3) intracellular ATP delivery caused extremely fast granular tissue growth. Using minimally invasive surgical procedures, we have also developed a new rabbit ischemic wound model that has been used successfully, for the first time, in diabetic animals. Results from the Phase I study have proven our basic concept. Three aims will be pursued in this Phase II study: 1. The first testable hypothesis is that wound tissue hypoxia results in decreased high-energy phosphate availability, and this reduction is the major cause of non-healing in chronic wounds. End point: high-energy phosphate contents in various chronic human wounds. 2. The second hypotheses to be tested is that unilamellar lipid vesicles containing encapsulated ATP can be manufactured on a large scale, and further, that these vesicles can be used for wound care with little systemic reactions. End point: a specific formulation of stable, lyophilized unilamellar lipid vesicles containing ATP with good tissue penetration suitable for wound care and a cGMP process capable of producing these vesicles. 3. The third testable hypothesis is that intracellular ATP delivery will increase wound tissue energy levels, induce coordinated upregulation of growth factors and other healing mechanisms to facilitate healing process. End point: tissue high-energy phosphate contents and their relationship with growth factors and healing speed. None of the 3 topics outlined above has been explored in the past. The success of this project and the expanded use of this new intracellular energy delivery technique will likely have a major impact on medicine. It will not only improve care for chronic wounds, but also improve our ability to treat various ischemic conditions, such as shock, stroke, severe trauma, heart attack, spinal cord injury, cardiopulmonary bypass, organ transplant, acute or chronic lung diseases, and many other conditions involving ischemia.

        "abstract": "The international accelerator community is focused on the development of the next electron-positron collider, the International Linear Collider (ILC), which will be based on superconducting radio frequency (RF) technology.  This project will develop a fast ferroelectric tuner for ILC cavities.  The tuner will permit adjustments, during each RF pulse of cavity coupling, to compensate for unavoidable microphonics and Lorentz force detunings, and to reduce the total RF power needed.  As a result, a number of benefits will accrue:  (1) the refrigeration power needed to remove waste heat from the cavities will be reduced, (2) the cavity can remain on resonance at the operating frequency and maintain precise phase, and (3) both the cavity filling and decay times can be shortened.  In Phase I, the design of a coaxial phase shifter for the L-band tuner for ILC cavities was completed.  The design included specifications for a ferroelectric ring and alumina rings, a coaxial impedance transformer, a waveguide-to-coax coupler, thermal considerations, and temperature stabilization requirements.  In Phase II, the L-band coaxial phase shifter for the tuner will be fabricated and tested at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A fast ferroelectric tuner would be needed for each of the 10,000 superconducting cavities of the ILC.  In mass production, a tuner price of $500 should be achieved, yielding a potential market in the range of $5 milliion.  Other applications are envisioned in other accelerators, including industrial machines, increasing the size of the potential market.",

        "abstract": "A rectangular dielelectric wake field electron accelerator would have attributes not found in other wake field accelerators.  These attributes include:  (1) continuous coupling between one channel, in which drive bunches travel, and a second channel, in which accelerated bunches travel, without the need for discrete transfer structures; (2) large step-up or transformer ratio in wake field amplitude in the acceleration channel, as compared to amplitude in the drive channel; and (3) rectangular geometry that affords relative ease in the precision fabrication of dielectric elements, along with improved beam stability.  Together, these factors offer the possibility of achieving high acceleration gradients, as required for a future multi-TeV electron-positron collider.  This project will build a rectangular, two-channel, dielectric wake field accelerator for a proof-of-principal experiment.  First, a scaled-up, X-band bench-test model will be built to assess the effects of wall slots intended to damp higher-order modes.  In Phase I, a five-zone rectangular dielectric wake field accelerator structure was analyzed to select tentative designs for an X-band bench-test prototype.  Although the excitation of higher-order modes led to transverse wake forces similar to those in conventional accelerators, a number of strategies were identified to mitigate this effect.  In Phase II, the X-band bench-test prototype structure will be built and tested to discover if design modifications are needed to account for the influence of wall slots.  Then, an optimized. 80-GHz, two-channel dielectric wake field accelerator module will be built and experimentally tested.  Analyses will be performed to identify a means to minimize the effects of transverse wakes.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The two-beam, rectangular, dielectric wake field accelerator should enable the development of a multi-TeV collider for high-energy physics experiments.  Because hundreds of modules \u00c2\u00bf each of which could have a commercial value of the order of $100,000 \u00c2\u00bf will be needed, the total market could to several tens of millions of dollars.  In addition, the modular design would allow the accelerator to be built for a much lower final energy, as required for applications in medical radiology, industrial processing, and low-energy accelerator research and development.",

The use of oligonucleotides offers advantages such as enhanced specificity and sensitivity, shorter hybridization times as well as a reduction in manufacturing cost when compared to currently available genomic DNA derived probes.  The panel that the company plans to develop will cover 8 chromosomes known to be particularly susceptible to deletions and rearrangements and would allow simultaneous detection of any abnormalities that may be associated with them.  The development of a panel of probes for the detection of genetic abnormalities in preimplantation embryos will increase the success rate of IVF procedures and thus reduce the financial and emotional cost associated with them.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile, a toxigenic, gram-positive anaerobic bacterium, is the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhea. Over the past 15 years there has been a steady increase in the incidence of Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD), a disease that is now epidemic in parts of North America and Europe. Serious morbidity and mortality due to CDAD has increased sharply with the emergence of antibiotifc-resistant, hypervirulent strains in the US and Canada. The primary risk factor for CDAD is the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which disrupt the gut flora and allow overgrowth of toxigenic C. difficile. The most significant disadvantage of current treatments is the high recurrence rate (~20%) following the withdrawal of therapy. OPT-80, a novel macrocyclic antibiotic also known as PAR-101, is being developed for the treatment of this disease. This compound is selective, with potent activity against C. difficle. The selectivity profile of this compound should allow the patient to repopulate the colon with normal flora during the course of treatment and reduce the probability of recurrence. The goal of this proposed work is to further demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of this compound and its major metabolite (OP-1118) by performing toxicology and microbiological studies, some of which will be ancillary studies to the upcoming pivotal trials in CDAD patients. These studies will include (i) microbiological characterization of OP-1118, (ii) in vivo toxicological studies of OPT-80/PAR-101 in Beagle dogs, (iii) examination of possible resistance mechanisms, including reduced uptake and target modifications, in C. difficile to OPT-80/PAR-101, (iv) molecular typing (REA and Rep-PCR) of C. difficile isolates from subjects enrolled in the PAR-101 Phase 2B/3 pivotal trial to demonstrate efficacy on all clonal strains and confirm the low recurrence rate in OPT-80/PAR-101 treated patients, (v) ecological examination (with both traditional culture methods and DGGE and fish analysis) of gut flora following treatment with OPT-80/PAR-101 to establish optimal dosing for narrow spectrum activity and minimize development of drug resistance during treatment, and finally (vi) perform a surveillance study of C. difficile isolates across North America to monitor antibiogram shift of those isolates vs. OPT-80/PAR-101 as well as against current and other potentially effective future CDAD treatments.         Clostridium difficile is an important cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (CDAD) in hospitals and long-term care facilities and has been responsible for major outbreaks of CDAD in North America and Europe. The increase in CDAD has been associated with a significant rise in healthcare costs and excess hospital stays. The microbiological and toxicological studies proposed in this application will provide further support for development of a novel and more selective antibiotic (OPT-80/PAR-101) against C. difficile.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on the use of new technology for the development of a novel wavelength selectable or wavelength tunable laser. Such lasers are central to next-generation photonic technologies and optical networks, and have a wide range of applications including instrumentations, optical sensing, medical, military, imaging, and high bandwidth DWDM optical networks. The company has recently developed a powerful integrated super-high-resolution compact curved diffraction grating (SCG) on InP chip with the highest spectral resolution and the smallest size. Applying to lasers, SCG allows combining the simple-control and high-performance advantage of external cavity laser with the high ruggedness and low-cost advantage of monolithic integration. The Proposed wavelength-selectable or tunable lasers will result in extended tunable laser capabilities, not achievable currently, such as simpler control electronics, direct modulation capability up to 2.5Gb/s, 10Gb.s modulation with integrated modulator, ultra-compact\nlaser module size, lower power consumption, and lower costs via monolithic integration.  The proposed wavelength-selectable or wavelength-tunable SCG lasers will involve a number of new technological approaches such as the high-resolution Integrated Curved Diffraction Grating, Cavity-Grating Frequency Offset detector, and other integrated functionalities (e.g. integrated shutter/amplifier, integrated modulator etc). These are combined capabilities that can only be realized with chip-scale monolithic integrations, and are not available currently. IF successful the proposed solution, a single wavelength selectable SCG laser, will replace the use 40x fixed wavelength DFB lasers to cover the 40 DWDM ITU Wavelength Channels. Thus the proposed solution, WS-SCG laser, will reduce the DWDM laser inventory by 10-40x while having substantially simpler control electronics, more compact module size, lower power consumption, and higher functionalities than those of current tunable lasers, and could be engineered to give higher output and higher spectral purity. The potentially new capabilities of SCG lasers will open up many application areas including: (1)DWDM/CWDM/OCDMA Networks; (2) WDM On Chips; (3) Instrumentations; and (4) Optical sensing and medical equipments. Applications to these areas require wavelength selectable or tunable lasers with higher output, higher spectral purity, wider wavelength tunability, and lower cost.",

Staff training is needed to comply both with OSHA guidelines to protect workers from workplace violence, and OBRA regulations governing nursing assistant education in mental health and social services. Program modules will present 1) a prevention approach for dealing with aggression, 2) specific communication and management techniques for use when a resident is agitated or aggressive, 3) individual and team-based strategies for situations where resident aggression is a threat to the safety of other residents or to staff, 4) techniques for caregiver emotional self-care after an incident has occurred, 5) general information on dementia-care and related issues. An additional password protected module for administrators will explain the cost benefits of effective training and of an organizational culture that promotes a person centered care philosophy to prevent problem behaviors. The interactive multimedia format is particularly well-suited for staff training of this type because it has been shown to be effective (Irvine, Bourgeois, & Ary, 2003), and it is not staff-intensive to implement. Users will move through the program at their own pace, which is a beneficial feature for individuals with limited education or reading ability. The skill-based instructional design will include interactive tutorials. The competency-based instructional design, built around modeling in realistic video vignettes, will advance users when the material is understood, and will automatically review content not initially mastered. Summary printouts of program content for users and documentation of training progress for supervisors will be supplied. The Phase I prototype program showed significant effects in a randomized trial on the Internet. The Phase II product will be developed in Internet and CD-ROM/DVD-ROM formats with a workbook available to facilitate both individual and group usage. It will be evaluated with a large randomized trial (n=300). Professional caregivers in long term care facility are regularly subjected to workplace violence in the form of aggressive resident behaviors. The proposed program will give caregiving staff the skills to recognize and prevent symptoms that often lead to aggressive behaviors. Staff will also gain skills to deal with aggression that does occur in ways to maximize safety of both the resident and the caregiver.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depression is one of the most prevalent mental disorders to afflict adults. It seriously impacts role functioning and typically takes a recurrent course. Although antidepressant medications have proven efficacy and are the most common treatment for depression, up to 70% of adults do not complete the recommended regimen. There is also evidence that cognitive-behavioral therapy in conjunction with medications is more effective than medications alone in preventing depression relapse. This project will develop and evaluate an interactive multimedia intervention aimed at improving regimen adherence and preventing depression relapse for outpatients receiving antidepressants. Empirically validated frameworks will be adapted for self-administration via the Internet or CD/DVD-ROM. The intervention will consist of knowledge- and skills-based modules including: understanding depression, regimen adherence, mood monitoring, behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, interpersonal relations, relaxation, and planning for the future. The competency-based instructional design will be structured for multiple sessions using video- based tutorials, testimonials, and behavior modeling vignettes. Additional browser modules will include depression self-screening, learning to relax, enhancing social skills, and improving communication and problem solving. The online support system will include an electronic bulletin board, personal weekly conferences with an intervention coach, and an ask-an-expert forum. A collaborative care tool will be developed to allow managed care staff to monitor their patients' progress with antidepressant treatment and engagement in the IMM program, as well as provide ongoing support. The intervention will include six target populations: men and women in early, mid and late life. The basic structure of the program will be the same for each target population, but specific content will be customized to each user group. The Phase I prototype, targeted to 18-39 year-old women, provided training on understanding depression, regimen adherence, mood monitoring, and behavioral activation. It was evaluated in a within-subjects design feasibility study. The results showed significant pre to post and pre to follow-up changes in depressive symptomatology, pleasant activity engagement, knowledge, perceived stigma, self-efficacy, and behavioral intentions to use the skills taught. Subjects found the program easy to use and gave it high satisfaction ratings. The fully developed Phase II product will be evaluated in a large randomized trial (N = 270) with a six- month follow-up period to compare change in depressive symptoms as well as depression remission and relapse rates between intervention and control conditions. Subjects will be managed care patients who are undergoing antidepressant treatment via primary care. Major depression has become a critical public health issue given its high prevalence and associated impairments. Although antidepressant medications have proven efficacy and are the most common treatment for depression, nonadherence to antidepressant therapy is a key variable associated with depression relapse and recurrence. Given the evidence that combining cognitive-behavioral therapy with medications is especially efficacious, there is a critical need to develop relapse prevention programs that emphasize antidepressant medication regimen adherence combined with cognitive-behavioral strategies that can be easily implemented and widely disseminated.",

These people live with significant and permanent alterations in social, behavioral, physical, and cognitive functioning. If they are to obtain the services that are necessary to address the effects of TBI, families need to be effective advocates. However, the significant impact of brain injury on families leaves them poorly equipped to advocate for services, especially in this era of shrinking availability of rehabilitation options. This Phase I project successfully developed an interactive multimedia CD-ROM for families affected by TBI, focusing on effective communication skills used to advocate for services to address social behavior in adults with TBI.

Workplace managers and executives can present significant medical savings to an organization through three positive paths of influence: (1) they can provide supportive supervision and positive leadership, a known health protective factor in the work environment; (2) they can model heart healthy life-styles to associates (role modeling); and (3) managers and executives make decisions about whether employees will receive health promotion programs. The Internet program will be designed to enhance positive changes within each of these paths of influence. To appeal to executives, the program integrates and aligns health messages within a business-relevant leadership development program. Program content will draw on the empirical relationship between healthy life-style and known behavioral risks in leaders (stress, social isolation, power motivation). Interactive exercises will feature expert opinions and integrate leadership tips with tools for recognizing/addressing psycho-social risks for cardiovascular disease (CVD). As part of the integration of leadership with health promotion, the program includes a series of e-health modules on stress, diet, nutrition, and active lifestyle that can be used by managers and that managers can provide to workers. A prototype web-site was developed and pilot-tested in Phase I. Executives and managers were interviewed, and provided Internet access along with evaluation instruments to assess potential usefulness of the program. Favorable ratings and extensive evaluation data provide the basis for Phase 2 development of a program designed to train leaders to self-assess risks, select health programs, and utilize strategies to disseminate similar programs for workers. The Phase II research trial entails randomly assigning 150 senior managers within five different organizations (representing different industries) to receive the program or a no-training control condition. Pre-test and follow-up measures will assess outcomes of changes in CVD biometrics (e.g., BMI), health behavior, leadership style (interpersonal effectiveness) and stress. A primary outcome is manager interest and utilization of the e-health modules for themselves and workers. The research design will include a pretest posttest survey of 200 employees of some managers who receive the intervention. Outcome measures for employees will assess the indirect impact of the intervention on employee health, stress, and CVD risk. Accordingly, the study will assess both the direct effect of the intervention on managers (improvements in supportive leadership and health) as well as the indirect effect on workers.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Taste disorders have significant consequences for humans, and these consequences include impaired quality of life, increased health or safety risks from spoiled foods, compromised vocational abilities, and altered food choices and consumption patterns that can adversely impact health or worsen underlying illnesses. At present, no clinical tests for assessing gustatory function in humans are commercially available. The main objective of this proposal is to develop a clinical taste test that is portable, easy to administer, has standardized norms, possesses a long shelf-life, and can be made available to physicians and clinicians at a low cost. This test is based on the novel utilization of cellulose/pullulan-based \"edible film strips\" (EFS) as a vehicle for administering taste stimuli to the oral cavity. Based on the same concept as commercially available strips for freshening the breath, these strips are extremely well suited for use as taste stimuli. They dissolve almost immediately when placed on the tongue, show minimal volatility of released taste stimuli, and provide the possibility of regional testing of the tongue. This proposal concerns the development of three tests for measuring gustatory function: 1) a brief taste test that is suitable for screening purposes; 2) a detection threshold test that will provide a more sensitive assessment of gustatory function; and 3) a multi-quality recognition threshold test that provides both quantitative and qualitative information. Three specific aims are proposed. Specific aim I concerns the development of EFS-based taste tests. This specific aim includes optimization of strip composition for use in examining gustatory function, selection of the appropriate concentrations of taste stimuli in strips, and refinement of the test protocols. The second specific aim concerns development of standardized norms for the three tests by administering them to a large sample population so that age, sex, and smoker-nonsmoker status is considered. These statistical norms will then be used to relate an individual's performance to that of the population in general. Traditional \"sip and spit\" tests will also be administered to a cohort of these subjects to determine the correlation between the two types of taste tests. The third specific aim will evaluate the sensitivity and suitability of EFS-based taste tests in assessing gustatory dysfunction in clinical populations. Test sensitivity in detecting gustatory deficits will be examined by administering taste blockers, e.g., chlorhexidine, to the subjects before testing. Test suitability for use in a clinic will be evaluated by placing the tests in ENT clinics and allowing users to provide feedback. Test validity will be investigated whenever the possibility arises in the clinic. The successful completion of this study will result in the first commercially available taste test for examining gustatory function in humans at both the clinical and basic research level. Taste disorders have significant consequences for humans including impaired quality of life and altered food choices that can adversely impact health. The development of a standardized taste test based upon \"edible films strips\" will greatly improve the means for detecting and quantifying taste disorders in patients and facilitate treatment.",

The objective of the project is to provide improved, cost-effective hardware and practices relative to present buried construction procedures, which do not otherwise allow for future upgrades or replacement of initially installed utility distribution lines.  The BIN would therefore support and encourage present trends for placing new utilities below ground, helping avoid future problems with such installations.  The shortcomings of conventional direct-buried construction methods can lead to road damage or safety problems, including risk of gas or power line hits during reconstruction activities, thereby jeopardizing continuation of the desired trends toward universal below ground facilities.  The BIN may be deployed in a variety of applications, ranging from residential communities to thoroughfares and major roads.  Common applications include road-widening projects (allowing replacement of existing overhead lines by new buried facilities), or any other situation in which open-trenching construction is employed.  The BIN may also be installed in established areas using trenchless construction methods.  The extremely successful Phase I effort, including participation and encouragement by representatives of three major utilities (SBC/AT&T, Comcast, Consumers Energy), demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed network.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite an understanding of the pharmacological basis of cocaine abuse no effective pharmacotherapy has been developed, suggesting that pharmacotherapy may be impractical. An alternative approach is to develop an immunotherapy that directly targets cocaine. To this end, a predominantly human monoclonal antibody (mAb) with a high affinity (Kd = 4 nM) for cocaine and selectivity over cocaine's inactive metabolites has been generated and sequenced. This lead candidate New Molecular Entity (NME), designated 2E2, is designed to be safe for repeated treatments in patients and should confer long-term efficacy for the prevention of relapse in treatment-seeking cocaine abusers. 2E2 is at an advanced stage of pre-clinical development and has met or exceeded key milestone criteria for safety and efficacy. No cross-reactivity was found with an extensive panel of human tissues, a promising indicator of safety in clinical use. In mice the mAb does not cross the blood- brain barrier and sequesters cocaine in the periphery, thereby decreasing the entry of cocaine into the brain. This reduces all of the central effects of cocaine. Consequently, in a rat model of relapse the mAb antagonizes the cocaine-induced reinstatement of self-administration. These effects are positive indicators of efficacy and provide proof-of-concept. The next stage of pre-clinical development is to complete in vivo toxicology testing in animals. However, the inefficient production in cell culture by the current hybridoma is the rate-limiting step in the development of this product. Therefore, the aim of this Phase II Competing Renewal application is to use standard technology to generate a high efficiency scaleable production platform by transfecting the genes coding for both chains of the mAb with high efficiency promoters into Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. A single cell line will be selected that produces, in serum free media, at least 0.25 gm/L of 2E2. The CHO- derived 2E2 must retain its high affinity and specificity for cocaine and its efficacy in animal models. The efficacy of the CHO cell-derived 2E2 will be defined by a long elimination half-life, the potency to prevent cocaine distribution to the brain and the ability to antagonize cocaine-induced reinstatement of self- administration. CHO cell production of 2E2 will be maximized and purification protocols compatible with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) standards will be optimized. Accomplishing these goals will accelerate this lead candidate NME towards clinical trials and will reduce its cost approximately 100-fold, making it commercially viable. /Relevance Cocaine abuse, addiction and dependence represent a major threat to our national public health. However, despite decades of research into pharmacotherapies that target the sites of cocaine's action in the brain, none of these potential treatments for cocaine abuse have been successful. An alternative approach is to use a monoclonal anti-cocaine antibody that directly targets cocaine itself and prevents its rapid entry into the brain. This application details studies that will advance a unique predominantly human sequence anti- cocaine monoclonal antibody towards clinical trials for the prevention of relapse in cocaine abuse.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anthrax Lethal Factor (LF) is a metalloproteinase introduced into the cells of mammalian hosts during infection by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. LF disrupts intracellular signaling pathways mediated by the MAPKKs, resulting in cell toxicity, sepsis, respiratory failure and rapid death. While antibiotic therapy is effective if given in the first 48 h after symptoms appear, it cannot prevent death if initiated after this narrow therapeutic window. Although exposure to this pathogen is limited in nature, the lethality of anthrax spores as a bioterrorism weapon was demonstrated in the 2001 attacks through the US mail. Novel therapeutics capable of inhibiting the toxic effects of LF are needed to combat late-stage disease. Current treatment methods such as antibiotics, vaccines, and biologic therapies in development, suffer from significant drawbacks. Common to each is an inability to protect cells from the direct effects of LF. These therapies are also vulnerable to next generation genetically modified weapons exploiting LF toxicity. Directly targeting LF activity may allow synergy with current therapies and is the only proposed method of anthrax therapy that may provide rescue during late-stage infection. Use of an LF inhibitor has recently been validated in animals as a therapeutic approach. To date, however, no reported LF inhibitors possess the characteristics needed for a drug capable of protecting the general population in the event of a large scale bioterrorism anthrax attack. The current strategy at Hawaii Biotech Inc. (HBI) employs a three tiered screening cascade using assays designed to identify potent LF inhibitors with good PK properties and efficacy in animal models of anthrax infection. Achievement of this goal will require the continued medicinal chemistry optimization of inhibitors discovered at HBI as well as the identification of new lead series. Computational high throughput docking protocols developed at HBI and tailored specifically towards LF will be used to discover new inhibitors as backups to our current leads. In vitro profiling of compounds to assess potency and selectivity for LF along with molecular modeling of lead series will guide potency optimization. A unique panel of LF mutants prepared at HBI will also be used to guide the design and optimization of novel LF inhibitors. The physicochemical properties, PK, and ADMET characteristics of potent inhibitors will be determined to allow selection of the best candidates for in vivo testing. Finally, the efficacy of potential pre-clinical candidates will be demonstrated in established animal models of anthrax infection. The work proposed in this Phase II Renewal will build on HBI's expert knowledge of LF as a drug target with the goal of identifying an orally bioavailable preclinical candidate that demonstrates in vivo efficacy in a post-exposure animal model of anthrax lethal factor intoxication. The 2001 bioterrorism attack which delivered anthrax spores through the US mail resulted in eleven confirmed cases of the disease and led to five deaths. The current lack of an effective treatment for exposure to anthrax makes a repeat this unfortunate tragedy a real possibility. The goal of this research is to identify a drug which will protect the general public from any future acts of bioterrorism using anthrax as a weapon.",

Fabrication processes will be transitioned to injection molding by adapting the micromachined/electroformed molds to the injection process. The research will design the final generations of the printing and fluid transfer pin designs, use silicon micromachining and electroforming to prepare the injection molds for the 96 and 384 pin printheads, design new collimator / printheads for both microarray printing and fluid transfer applications and redesign and scale up the chemical surface treatment process to treat thousands of pins simultaneously. Because the polymer pins can be manufactured so inexpensively compared to current technology, the number of laboratories around\nthe world that can utilize this nanoscale fluid handling will dramatically increase.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For the past eight years, an image-guided liver surgery system has been developed by engineers and clinicians at several academic institutions, including Vanderbilt University and Washington University in St. Louis. In mid-2004, after initial investigations demonstrated that the system could be used in a clinical setting to more effectively treat liver cancer, Pathfinder Therapeutics, Inc. was founded as a medical device corporation to develop commercial, integrated systems for use in image-guided therapy. The primary focus of the company at this time is to take the image-guided liver surgery technology developed in the academic environment and translate it to a commercial setting where it can be specifically used to perform more efficient, accurate procedures and improve patient outcomes. Since its use in neurosurgery over ten years ago, there have always been divergent views of whether image-guided surgery has a place in a particular surgical field until the technology is proven to be effective. In order to successfully market and develop a profitable image-guided liver surgery product, we must convince surgeons that this should be the standard of care in treating several forms of liver cancer. The Phase I portion of this fast-track SBIR details the technical steps that must be completed to create a commercial-quality prototype system that can be replicated for distribution and used in an efficacy clinical trial. The clinical trial detailed in the Phase II portion will demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of image-guidance in treating liver cancer. Our trial will focus on demonstrating improvement in several factors that lead to hepatic failure, including increased residual functional liver volume following tumor resection and decreased patient time spent in the operating room. Through this investigation, we will show that image-guided liver surgery should be the standard of care for liver resection procedures. This claim will allow us to successfully commercialize image-guided liver surgery.",

Methods are needed that permit evaluation of atherosclerotic lesion composition and morphology in vivo. Such methods would enable medical professionals to base treatment decisions on accurate risk assessments, support pre-interventional planning, and facilitate pharmaceutical trials that evaluate drug effects directly on the lesions. The goal of this proposal is to help meet these needs by performing the clinical trials necessary to obtain FDA approval to market our Quantitative Vascular Analysis System (QVAS) for two uses. The first use will employ the unique plaque lesion characterization methods of QVAS to generate a comprehensive risk score indicating whether a patient with carotid stenosis would benefit from surgical intervention such as carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or stenting. This use would allow the clinical guidelines for such interventions developed by the American Heart Association, which currently employ a single quantitative measure (carotid stenosis), to be updated with a more effective predictor of treatment outcome. For the second use, QVAS will generate a 3D visualization of the involved section of the carotid artery for use in pre-intervention treatment planning. This visualization would allow a surgeon to examine the full spatial extent and distribution of the different plaque components in order to select the intervention most likely to produce a positive outcome. We will also bring QVAS into compliance with the DICOM image exchange standard and the Clinical Data Interchange (CDISC) standard, as well as use the results and feedback from the trials to improve the reliability and effectiveness of QVAS. In order to meet this goal, we will continue the strategic relationship with the University of Washington's Vascular Imaging Lab (VIL) that has successfully developed the QVAS product under Phase I and Phase II SBIR grants.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Confusions between drug names that look and sound alike (e.g., Keppra(r) and Kaletra(r), Indocid(r) and Endocet(r)) continue to occur frequently, and each confusion poses a threat to patient safety.2-5 Our long term objective is to design, build, test and continuously improve tools that minimize the harm caused by drug name confusion errors. For a patient to be harmed, an error must occur and it must go undetected until it reaches the patient. Harm is minimized either by preventing the error from occurring in the first place or by rapidly detecting the error so its adverse effects can be mitigated. Both prevention and mitigation efforts have been hindered by the lack of valid, reliable and efficient methods for assessing name confusion error rates. The gold standard for measuring medication error rates is direct observation of the prescribing-dispensing- administering process. This method is valid and reliable but is too time consuming and expensive to be widely used. As a result, many error reduction interventions have been designed, but few have been tested, and their effectiveness is, for the most part, unknown. Similarly, efforts to mitigate the effects of wrong drug errors are virtually non-existent because there has been no accurate and efficient way to detect such errors after they occur. The key to improving both prevention and mitigation of harm is the development of scalable, efficient, valid and reliable methods for detecting these drug name confusion errors. Our short-term goal is to develop and validate an algorithm for detecting drug name confusion errors by analyzing suspicious patterns in real-world prescription drug databases (in our case, integrated electronic medical records from the US Veterans Health Administration). We plan to test the following three hypotheses: 1. Computerized measures of drug name confusability can be used to identify wrong-drug errors in real-world prescription drug databases. 2. The number of errors detected will increase as the predicted probability of confusion increases. 3. The classification performance of the error detection algorithm (i.e., its accuracy, sensitivity and specificity) can be enhanced by applying machine learning techniques and by incorporating additional information from the electronic medical record (e.g., time between refills, diagnosis, lab values, demographics, etc.) To test these hypotheses, we propose studies with the following specific aims: 1. To design and implement an algorithm for the detection of suspicious patterns in prescription drug databases. 2. To test and validate this algorithm using real-world prescription data from the US Veterans Health Administration. 3. To use machine learning techniques to optimize and further validate the performance of the error detection algorithm, incorporating additional information from the electronic medical record. Health care professionals often confuse drug names that look and sound alike. Wrong drug errors occur in hospitals and in community pharmacies and can cause serious harm to patients. Our project seeks to improve patient safety by developing and testing new techniques for detecting wrong drug errors in integrated electronic medical records.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New therapies are desperately needed to relieve patients with Type 1 diabetes from the neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy associated with the current standard of treatment, injected insulin. The recent finding that islet cells can be regenerated in diabetic animals by the peptide hormone Glucagon- like peptide 1 (GLP-1) has raised the exciting possibility of a new approach for a cure. GLP-1 has a very short half life in vivo necessitating the use of potentially immunogenic analogues (exenatide) with extended half lives for evaluation of efficacy. However, 38% of type 2 diabetic patients that used exenatide in clinical trial have developed antibody against this GLP-1 analogue which could potentially limit efficacy of the hormone in the future. In our Phase I project we have succeeded in formulating native GLP-1 in our proprietary nanocarrier (PGC-HC) to extend its circulation half-life more than 200 fold (from ~ 5 min to > 24h) offering the potential to perform islet regeneration studies without the development of neutralizing antibody and with the added potential for targeted delivery to the pancreas. This Phase 2 SBIR proposal is focused on validating the efficacy of long acting native GLP-1 (developed in Phase I) to regenerate beta cells in an animal model of Type 1 diabetes and to bring the formulated native GLP-1 closer to clinical trial. In Aim 1 we propose to scale up synthesis of our nanocarrier in a cGLP-like manner, characterize the formulation and determine its shelf stability. In Aim 2 the acute and chronic maximum tolerated dose of carrier and GLP-1 formulation will be determined in mice prior to the optimization of dosing planned in Aim 3 to maximize diabetes prevention and regeneration of beta cell mass in vivo. Pre-diabetic NOD mice and diabetic NOD mice will be treated with formulated GLP-1 at three different concentrations administered at two different frequencies, with or without an immunosuppressive agent. Blood glucose and C-peptide levels will be monitored during and after treatment. At the end of the study, an IP glucose tolerance test will be done. The C-peptide, hemoglobin 1c and pancreatic insulin content will be determined and tissue histology will be done to determine the integrity of pancreatic function. The envisioned GLP-1 product, being a native peptide and requiring administration only every few days or once a week, would have significant advantages over current GLP-1 analogues recently approved by the FDA and those under development.",

        "abstract": "Ever larger gamma ray detector arrays made from germanium crystals are being used, and will continue to be used, in nuclear physics research.  However, radiation damage limits the time that a germanium detector can be used; for example, an average Gammasphere detector may function in an array for several months before the effects of the radiation damage become intolerable.  Mitigating the effects of radiation damage would significantly improve operation of germanium detector arrays and could greatly reduce the need for annealing detectors in radiation damage environments.  By far, the operating temperature is the most important parameter affecting the degradation of detectors caused by radiation damage.  This project will analyze the effect of temperature reduction well below the ~95K range, where liquid-nitrogen cooled detectors operate, and design viable options to cool complex arrays to much colder temperatures.  Phase I addressed the preliminary complexities of designing and fabricating a mechanically-cooled prototype detector system with the size and cryostat geometry of a Gammasphere detector.  This system was shown to achieve reliable operating temperatures of approximately 50K.  Phase II will develop, fabricate, and test a mechanically-cooled germanium detector system that will be fit into a Gammasphere.  The engineering complexities of multiple system arrays will to be addressed. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The integration of mechanically-cooled, multiple detector systems into complex arrays would reduce the physical size of the array, improve efficiency and longevity, and greatly diminish costs and maintenance of large-array diagnostic detector systems.  The technology should impact the operation of germanium detectors at nuclear physics user facilities like Gammasphere, many of which are DOE supported.",

The Plant Root Characterization System, (PRCS), employs low energy digital x-ray radiography together with specially formulated artificial substrate and container materials in order to provide high resolution x-ray images of plant root structure. This x-ray imaging can be repeated on the same plant at different times in its growth cycle to reveal plant root morphology over time in a non-destructive manner. This innovation has opened new avenues of research for plant scientists interested in root systems.\nThere remain unanswered scientific questions as to the applicability of the device for long-term tree research. The Northern Research Station, (NRS), has a long research history into tree root dynamics and has evaluated and used most state-of-the-art approaches to root measurement and characterization. NRS staff researchers are interested in characterizing the PRCS performance and limitations for tree root research. In Phase I, NCRS and PSC compared Poplar tree seedling growth and root development in both soils and PSCs artificial substrate and container materials. Traditional root system characterization methods, presently used by NCRS, were compared against measures provided by the PRCS. The NCRS and PSC jointly developed results were used to identify viable application domains for the system in forestry research, identify shortcomings in materials and approach that if corrected could enable additional applications in forestry research and identify areas of research where the system should not be applied. Phase II will implement prioritized recommended enhancements and demonstrate the suitability of the device in the commercially and scientifically important area of Poplar phenotype screening. This information will be useful to government, university and industrial researchers interested in enhanced root characterization instrumentation.",

Our Phase 1 results have demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing self-assembled nanoparticles, or colloidal crystals, as an ultrahigh resolution chromatographic medium, and the possibility of performing multilane chromatographic separation in a 2D microfluidic device. We propose to further these efforts to systematically achieve integration of the colloidal crystals into commercializable, fully functional devices with multilane sample injectors, and to demonstrate the level of improvement in the separation and detection of glycoproteins and their tryptic digests using both nanospray and matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. The results of these proposed efforts, if successful, will be prototype products from consumables to systems that dramatically improve the toolbox available not only to practitioners interested in glycoproteins, but also in proteomics in general. The series of products will help transition the proteomics practitioners from their current work flow practice to entirely new device-based commercial products of superior performance and speed. The extent of glycosylation of proteins is broadly important in controlling signal and cell-cell recognition. Glycoproteins serve as biomarkers for disease, including many cancers. For hemoglobin, the extent of glycosylation is correlated with diabetes or prolonged stress. In a drug such as erythropoetin, a multibillion-dollar glycoprotein product used for treatment of various anemias and other conditions remains a major challenge, in the patients may die if the glycosylation in the dose given to them is not correct. The ability to analyze glycosylation levels of proteins, which is lacking, would allow advances in the understanding of this important process and the detection of biomarkers in clinical analysis. This proposal aims to create tools that will be effective and high speed for this analysis.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to conduct further research on the erosion properties of electrode materials under high-current pulsed operation, and demonstrate extended lifetime for a new pulsed lamp, making it economically practical. With increased lifetime, the new lamp can become the industry standard for UV water treatment and enable a new photolytic paint stripping process. Materials used for pulsed power electrodes were originally formulated for continuous or alternating current at low peak current. In Phase I a tungsten composite fabricated with a specific process eroded at one-sixteenth of the erosion of the standard electrode material. Phase II continues the research on this tungsten composite and its fabrication processes to demonstrate low erosion, with the objective of demonstrating increased lamp life that meets requirements for commercialization.  If successful the proposed research will enhance scientific understanding of the erosion of electrode materials under repeated high-current pulsed cycling. New electrode\nmaterials will expand the use of pulsed power and provide better alternatives to thoriated tungsten, which is banned in Europe because of its radioactivity. The primary goal is to enable a new commercial pulsed lamp. The lamp will replace mercury lamps, reducing mercury use and exposure of the public. The lamp also will enable commercial photolytic paint removal, replacing chemical and abrasive techniques that are labor intensive, create dust and debris, and generate toxic byproducts. The photolytic process will provide a lower cost and cleaner method of removing lead paint. This will allow abatement to replace interim measures currently in vogue, and support national goals to eliminate childhood lead poisoning. The commercial market for the new lamp encompasses all of UV water treatment and a wide range of paint removal applications.",

However, current lithotripters produce painful side effects, and the mechanisms of lithotripsy and the causes of the side effects are not fully understood. Electrohydraulic lithotripters (EHL's), which use an underwater spark as a shock wave source, had been the treatment of choice but use has declined because the shocks are inconsistent, cause painful side effects and the electrodes are short lived. Typically, the electrode head wears out during a procedure, and must be replaced before completing the procedure. New types of lithotripters are more consistent and last longer than one procedure, but their clinical outcomes are reduced and side effects are greater. Phase I showed the feasibility of using a wire-initiated sparker to produce consistent and precise shocks, of controlling the shock (for potential improved comminution of kidney stones and reduction in side effects), of lasting for many procedures. The proposed Phase II continues research towards the long-term goal to develop a new commercial EHL that exceeds the clinical outcomes of lithotripters, with reduced side effects, much longer life and lower cost. The specific project objectives are to develop a wire feed system needed to employ wire- initiated sparkers for EHL, demonstrate ultra-long lifetime using the wire-feed, map out the acoustic field of the shock and cavitation in the focal region, conduct research using the sparker's varied shock waveforms to improve comminution of kidney stones and develop a prototype wire-feed sparker for commercialization. A successful project will result in improved clinical results of SWL at reduced cost. Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) is a non-invasive treatment for kidney stones and other ailments. The electrodes in current systems must be replaced during a procedure, and the results are inconsistent, with unpleasant side effects. A successful program will result in a new SWL system with electrodes lasting several procedures, more consistent clinical outcomes, reduced side effects and lower cost.",

Both conditions involve vascular abnormalities, proliferation and leakage of new blood vessels. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a major cause of newborn blindness in premature infants maintained by oxygen supplementation during the postnatal period. This disease involves intense neovascularization of the retina and leads to retinal detachment. Another cause of blindness is corneal neovascularization, which often results from injury and infection in the cornea. Current mammalian models for ocular neovascularization require lengthy, tedious surgical manipulation and do not always result in improved vision; an alternative rapid, less invasive animal model for studying the process of ocular neovascularization and assessing drug effects will facilitate identification of new therapeutics. Using zebra fish, Phase I research developed a micro plate assay for quantifying effects of angiogenic compounds on ocular neovascularization. Phase II research will perform a pilot screen of available commercially compounds and confirm positive \"hits\" identified in conventional animal models. Phase II research will further validate the utility of the zebra fish model for screening drugs for treating debilitating diseases involving neovascularization. By providing a quantitative in vivo assay for assessing drug effects on ocular neovascularization, the proposed zebra fish assay will facilitate development of therapeutic drugs for treating debilitating diseases involving neovascularization.",

Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Dielectric Relaxation Analyzing Gauge (DRAG) that will replace isotope-based gauges for thickness, level, and velocity measurements in materials such as polymers, glasses, and ceramics. The device implements improved time domain dielectric spectrometry. In addition to a simple capacitive probe, it contains a microcontroller-based data acquisition and processing board with digital output. DRAG determines the peak value of dielectric losses in the monitored material, which is proportional to the amount of this material between the electrodes of the capacitive probe; therefore, the signal is similar to the attenuation of radiation in an isotope gauge. The proposed device will not only replace isotope-based industrial gauging devices that consume ~50 kg of isotopes annually, but will have significant advantages such as the capability to simultaneously measure flow rate and/or to distinguish nonuniformity in materials. The project will result in the fabrication of a dielectrometric gauge and a demonstration of how it can replace isotope gauges.",

Current thermal dewatering technologies offers better productivity than mechanical- or physical-property-based techniques; however, they consume large quantities of energy and require extensive space and capital investment, because the entire mass of material to be dewatered must be heated to an elevated temperature.  In many industrial dewatering processes, large-scale energy savings could be achieved if energy could be applied directly to the water, while avoiding the heating of the remaining materials.  This project will investigate such a process \u00c2\u00bf enforced moisture evaporation in a gradient electric field \u00c2\u00bf followed by the removal and condensation of vapor, with the recovery of latent heat that can be returned to the material.  In Phase I, a prototype system was fabricated, and an 80 percent increase in the evaporation rate (the loss of weight per unit of time) was demonstrated.  Phase II will include:  (1) optimization of electrostatically enforced evaporation and latent heat recovery for one of the most energy-consuming applications, paper mills; (2) design of an industrial-scale module prototype; (3) development of fabrication technology for an integrated heat pump (thermoelectric or compression) and heat pipe; and (4) system design of a prototype module for installation in the drying part of a paper machine.  Several modules will be fabricated, tested, and then beta-tested on a pilot paper machine.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should lead to energy savings in dewatering processes used for material drying in the production of paper, food, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, coal, and gases.

        "abstract": "Lighting devices consume 8.3 percent of all energy produced in this country.  Even a small improvement in lighting efficiency will save millions of barrels of oil or similar quantities of other fossil fuels used to produce electrical power.  Organic light emitting devices have striking advantages for general-purpose illumination \u00c2\u00bf they are thin, flat, and lightweight, and also take up very little space.  However, before they can become viable alternatives to conventional luminous sources, their energy efficiency, must be improved.  Today, white organic light emitting devices have an efficiency of only 25-60 lumens per watt, while a lighting efficiency over 100 lumens per watt is needed for significant energy savings.  One of the most significant factors responsible for their low efficiency is internal reflection at the interfaces between layers.  To improve efficiency, this project will fabricate a random surface relief structure between the bases of organic light emitting devices and their active layers.  The multilayer surface relief structure includes a polymer material with a high refractive index, matching that of the electroconductive anode, and a polymer with low refractive index.  Light scattering at the interface between these layers will significantly improve the probability of photons penetrating through the interface.  Phase I demonstrated that the light scattering by this relief enhances photons\u00c2\u00bf probabilities of escaping, thus improving efficiency by factor of 1.5.  In Phase II, a low-cost, roll-to-roll, mass production technology will be developed for fabricating flexible and rigid substrates, which will be fully compatible with subsequent organic light emitting device manufacturing.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Flexible substrates for highly efficient organic light emitting devices should contribute to mass production, reduce costs, and make these devices more attractive to customers.

This product will enable accurate real-time H2O2 measurements over the concentration range of 1-10,000 ppmV.  The product is an adaptation of a portable gas-sensing platform based on Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS) technology.  The sensor will offer a combination of sensitivity, specificity, fast response, dynamic range, linearity, ease of operation and calibration, ruggedness, and portability not available in alternative H2O2 detectors.\n   Compared to other spectroscopic gas analyzers, TDLAS offers the benefit of probing individual spectral lines, rather than spectral bands.  This capability enables distinguishing H2O2 from water, thus overcoming a cross sensitivity that has limited the accuracy of other H2O2 analyzers.  In Phase I, Physical Sciences, Inc. (PSI) acquired the data needed to select the best H2O2 spectral features for these measurements, thereby establishing the feasibility of developing the novel H2O2 sensor.  In Phase II, PSI, working with industrial collaborators, will specify the requirements of a field-worthy sensor, build a prototype, calibrate it, and test it in realistic deployment scenarios.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to develop, validate and commercialize wireless, head mounted, turnkey, EEG/EMG systems with integrated biosensor for rats and mice. A further objective is to develop a 76 fM glucose biosensor for direct measurement of brain glucose levels in rats and mice. The specific aims of this Phase II project are to validate and manufacture a 76 fM glucose biosensor, a tethered EEG/EMG/Biosensor solution for mice and a wireless solution for rats. In addition, a wireless system for mice will be developed. To reach these objectives, Pinnacle Technology, Northwestern University and the University of Kansas are building on past successes in the design of glutamate biosensors, wireless potentiostats for rats, and tethered EEG/EMG systems for mice. These products were developed in separate collaborations and are on the market. Commercial applications include sleep research, behavioral research and drug screening. Technological innovations include biosensor design, turnkey head mount design, advanced electronics design, and advanced low power radio frequency design. The ability to measure glucose from specific brain areas in vivo while simultaneously recording sleep in rodents will give researchers the ability to better examine the functioning of specific sites within the brain during the sleep process as well as leverage the advantages conferred by using rat and mouse models for research. The ability to instantly record glucose levels in a sleeping and awake mouse or rat, and correlate that activity with EEG/EMG, will be valuable to researchers studying sleep and metabolism. The investigation of glucose in a mouse model will open up new avenues of research with genetic mutations available in species such as the NIRKO mouse (brain/neuron-specific insulin receptor knockout) which may have altered glucose responses during sleep and provide clues as to how sleep and metabolism are linked. At least 40 million Americans suffer each year from chronic, long-term sleep disorders and an additional 20 million experience occasional sleeping problems. There are over 70 sleep disorders and sleep difficulties are a common secondary disorder in many diseases. Poor sleep accounts for an estimated $16 Billion in medical costs each year, while the indirect costs of lost productivity and other factors are probably much higher.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Central nervous system (CNS) - targeting drugs, such as antiretrovirals in the treatment of AIDS, need to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in order to reach their therapeutic receptors inside the brain. A critical issue in the treatment of AIDS is that the HIV-1 virus can reside in hard-to-reach sanctuaries in the brain (mainly in macrophage cells). If a candidate molecule does not have the right physical properties to effectively cross the BBB, it cannot realize its therapeutic potential. Our proposal addresses this aspect, with two novel high-throughput assays for CNS drug transport across the BBB. In Phase I of the SBIR we developed a promising brain lipid (BL) parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA), called BL-PAMPA, to predict the kinetic parameters, log PS (permeability-surface area product), measured by the in situ brain perfusion assay in P-glycoprotein deficient [mdr1a(-/-)] \"knockout\" mice. In Phase II, we will commercialize this brain lipid and other proprietary reagents. In Phase II, an additional high-throughput blood-brain barrier related assay based on binding gradients will be developed. The new assay will be used to predict rodent steady-state (pseudo-equilibrium) brain penetration, log BB. In our commercialization effort during the three-year Phase II period, we plan to design, make, and test (a) several proprietary reagent-containing buffers, (b) a special microtiter plate for endothelial cultured cell assays that account for the aqueous boundary layer effects, and (c) a blood brain barrier measuring instrument based on diode array UV spectrophotometry, which would increase the rate of data acquisition about 50 fold over currently available instruments.",

The R-CEL technology, if successfully developed, will enable finer resolution optical lithography postponing the need for more expensive techniques such as electron beam or x-ray lithography. R-CEL technology will help to extend the diffraction limit facing optical lithography by enabling double exposure techniques to be used for pattern definition.  The use of R-CEL with double exposure will increase the capability of optical lithography thus enabling the extension of Moore's Law without the need to switch to more expensive alternatives.  It will also help restore the technological competitiveness of domestic vendors in the lithography industry.   The SBIR project will also advance the understanding of semiconductor nanocrystal characteristics including detailed absorption and recombination processes and the effect of nanocrystal surface conditions on dispersion with polymers.

        "abstract": "Helium-cooled, refractory metal heat sinks are being considered for the divertor sections of several fusion energy reactors.  One type of helium cooling, jet impingement, has shown promise for high heat flux applications.  However, because of the small size of the units (1.5-2 cm), a large number of these heat sinks would be needed for the divertor section of a reactor.  Recently, a mid-size helium-jet-cooled configuration, with good heat flux accommodation potential, has been designed.  The system is comprised of concentric tungsten tubes in a \u00c2\u00bfT-shaped\u00c2\u00bf configuration.  This project will advanced net-shape refractory-metal forming techniques to enable the fabrication of this improved helium cooled tungsten divertor concept.  In Phase I,  impingement-cooled and straight-bore tungsten heat sinks were fabricated and tested.  Preliminary high-heat-flux testing demonstrated that a tungsten heat sink with helium-impingement cooling provided ~20% greater reduction in average surface temperature compared to a straight-bore tungsten heat sink under the same heat flux.  In Phase II, a mid-size helium-impingement-cooled divertor configuration will be developed and fabricated to withstand heat fluxes up to 10 MW/m2.  To determine the Phase II design, initial studies will be conducted to determine trade-offs between ease of fabrication, thermal induced stresses/strains, and thermal performance.  Manufacturing techniques will be optimized and improvements will be thoroughly characterized using metallographic and material properties testing techniques.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Compared to other helium cooling techniques, such as the porous heat exchanger configuration, the jet-impingement cooling method could significantly simplify the fabrication of helium cooled refractory metal heat sinks and improve long term reliability and performance.  In fusion reactors, the technology would allow higher operating temperatures, which could result in increased power conversion efficiency.  The techniques developed to produce the helium-jet-cooled tungsten divertor also should be applicable to such components as x-ray targets, crucibles for semiconductor crystal growth, rocket hardware, and wear and thermal protection coatings.",

Twenty million people in the United States are unable to speak an effective level of the English language to understand simple medicine instructions. This Limited English Proficient (LEP) population represents 1 of every 15 people in the United States. This population is expected to increase 40% over the next 20 years. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) estimates that medication errors account for about 7,000 deaths annually and costs approximately $2 billion for the nation as a whole. Medication errors were also found to account for over 700,000 injuries each year. Language barrier has been found to be a significant cause of some of these deaths and injuries. During Phase I we developed an innovative system for professional pharmacists to generate medicine instructions in a foreign language, provide these instructions to LEP patients in both written and verbal form, and demonstrate proper techniques for medication use. During Phase II we will expand upon this system by incorporating 6 foreign languages (Spanish, Korean, Mandarin, Russian, Vietnamese, and Arabic), adding the top 300 prescriptions to our medicine database, creating 50 new medicine demonstrations, and developing a system to enable access to these instructions from any remote computer through the Internet. The goal of this Phase II grant application is to develop a commercial, technology-based, time-saving solution to help every pharmacist articulate and visually demonstrate medications instructions to their patients regardless of language barrier. This solution has the potential to significantly reduce medication errors and health disparity due to language barriers as well as low health literacy, while reducing cost of healthcare delivery in the United States.",

        "abstract": "Petroleum is finite and as world economies develop it will be increasingly expensive.  Consequently, crude oils containing contaminants including mercury and sulfur will be processed.  The resulting extensive pollution along with concerns over climate change make it highly desirable to find alternative sources of plastics as a means of pollution prevention.  Plastic water bottles in California are filling up available dumping space and when released into the ocean cause environmental problems.  Finally, during the production of foamed plastic articles, significant quantities of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are generated.  The purpose of this multi phase SBIR research project is to develop and commercialize next generation bioplastics using nanotechnology to address these ecological concerns.  We expect the resulting green plastics to compete on a price/performance basis.\n   PLA is a bioplastic made from corn but available from any fermentable biomass resource, including plentiful cellulosics.  Life cycle analysis shows multiple environmental benefits over petroleum-based plastics.  However, the property window of PLA is limited the heat distortion temperature (HDT) is too low.  In Phase I, University expertise developed under previous EPA STAR funding was exploited to develop nanocomposite technology the successfully overcame the HDT limitation.  Presently polystyrene is largely used for these applications and foamed with 3-5 weight percent hydrocarbons.  PLA can be foamed with carbon dioxide so the new technology has the additional benefit of displacing at lest 1 million pounds per year of VOCs.  Because of the clear commercialization potential of the nanotechnology, a commercialization agreement with the Sealed Air Corporation (SAC)  a $4 billion/year in sales multinational  was reached and will provide rapid commercialization if the technical milestones of this Phase II project are met.  An immediate commercial application is in solid and foamed trays; projections suggest an annual consumption of 15-20 million lbs/year with an annual sales volume of approximately $20 million.\n   To meet the full suite of requirements on solid and foamed trays, additional material property targets have been identified in conjunction with SAC; meeting these requirements constitutes the basis of the Phase II work plan.  When successfully met, a commercialization option will be exercised at the end of the first year and co-funded by a $100,000 SAC investment.  This will enable an expanded work plan culminating in the production of solid and foamed trays prototypes using an industrially relevant pilot scale production line in place at the SAC development laboratories in Duncan, SC.",

The enzymatic reagent is extremely unstable, but our Phase I studies have demonstrated the feasibility of converting the unstable liquid reagent format to a relatively stable solid-phase test strip format. In the proposed Phase II studies, the specific aims are (1) improve the room temperature storage stability of the test strips to at least 12 months, (2) scale-up the test strip production process, (3) develop a point-of-care digital reader for a hospital setting, and (4) evaluate the performance of the GHB assay system and prepare for clinical trials in Phase III. Upon the successful completion of the Phase II studies, we expect to have a urine test strip available for hospital emergency rooms that has an assay time of two minutes, has a detection limit of at least 0.05 mg/mL GHB, and the bluish-purple color of the developed test strip can be read by a small digital reader that has the capability transferring its data to a hospital data management computer. The proposed GHB test strip will also be room temperature stable for at least 12 months-eliminating the need for any special storage conditions. The production process for manufacturing these test strips will also be developed to allow a production speed of over 500 test strips per run. The higher manufacturing rate will buildup test strip inventory necessary for clinical trials in Phase III. /Relevance The project is being undertaken due to an urgent need for a diagnostic kit that can rapidly detect gamma- hydroxybutyrate in bodily fluids. Emergency room physicians have need of a reliable and rapid assay for evaluating patients that arrive in a comatose state. Currently, the only available methods are GC/MS and CAT scan, which are expensive and require 1-4 hours to perform.

The system should be suitable for both high throughput, parallel purification of proteins on the laboratory scale, as well as process-scale purification of pharmaceutical proteins. This technology was developed as a result of NIH-funded studies on the prodomain- mediated folding reaction of the Bacillus protease subtilisin. The two fundamental components of this system are: 1) A highly engineered protease (psub) which hydrolyzes specific substrates in response to a fluoride trigger; 2) The high affinity interaction between psub and an engineered version of its prodomain (protag). This components are combined to create a purification system in which immobilized psub is used both as the binding molecule for affinity purification of protagged fusion proteins and as the processing protease for protag removal. The four experimental aims are: 1) Engineer site-directed immobilization of psub; 2) Optimize large scale production and purification of psub; 3) Create and test high-throughput methods for protein purification, quantitation and analysis; 4) Identify second generation psubs with refined chemical triggers. Recombinant proteins are frequently fused with other proteins or peptides to facilitate expression and purification. The tags provide a temporary hook for affinity purification, but ultimately must be processed by a site-specific protease. Tag removal, however, is frequently inefficient and sometimes problematic. The technical innovation of the system is the integration of tag removal into the purification process. This provides simplicity and efficiency that isn't available in any other system. The technology should benefit anyone purifying proteins but the impact on structural genomics efforts which rely on parallel processing of samples should be particularly great.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A general-purpose turnkey drug nanoparticle generator (DNG) is planned to be developed in this project. An immediate application of such a particle generator is to test new inhalable drugs in animal models. Most animal models for inhalation therapy, like mice and hamsters, are much smaller than humans and their respiratory tracts are also small. Their respirable particle size range is less than 500 nm with deposition efficiency increasing consistently down to a few tens of nm. The present device operates in this size range and is ideally suited for delivery of drugs to the deep lung of animal models. DNG generates a high concentration (>107 particles/ml) of fine particles, so it is easy to deposit drugs in microgram quantities in animals' lungs. This would enable meaningful efficacy and safety studies with a number of candidate drugs for inhalation therapy.     In Phase I project, we demonstrated the feasibility of DNG concept based on high-frequency ultrasonic nebulization of drug solutions followed by diffusion drying. A prototype was built and extensively tested. It was used for preliminary animal exposure experiments that demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of delivering a chemopreventive agent difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) to A/J mice in adequate quantities by inhalation. Phase II project is aimed at building a turnkey version of DNG that would deliver drug particles reliably and in a repeatable manner. This device is planned to be used for studies on biodistribution of inhaled drugs (DFMO and docetaxel) in A/J mice as a function of particle size. Docetaxel will be studied because it is a chemotherapeutic agent that is a candidate for inhalation therapy of adenocarcinoma. Further, DNG will be used for delivering radioactive particles to A/J mice, in order to determine the penetration of the drug into the peripheral regions of the lung as a function of particle size.     The DNG technology is also promising for delivery of fine mist to human lungs through a ventilator and for generation of fine dry powder for medical applications.     This project is directly relevant to the treatment of the cancer of deep lung (adenocarcinoma) using inhalation therapy. It provides a drug nanoparticle generator that is essential to inhalation studies using small animals. The project plan includes deposition and biodistribution studies relevant to inhalation delivery of a chemopreventive and a chemotherapeutic drug, which would be followed by safety and efficacy studies in a future project and would pave the way to clinical trials for these inhalable drugs.",

Electrospraying and high-frequency ultrasonic nebulization are shown to generate desired particles in 50 - 500 nm range. These airborne particles were delivered to the eye of a pig model and resulted in satisfactory deposition kinetics. Based on the above particle-generation technologies, it is proposed to build an automated turnkey drug nanoparticle generator, which would be ready for use in ophthalmology operating rooms. Proposed Phase II project also covers extensive animal studies to determine the safety and efficacy of certain drugs, when delivered in the form of aerosols. The anti-proliferative drug 5-FU will be tested in combination with low molecular weight heparin. This combination drug will be delivered to PVR models of rabbits, which will be monitored for 10 weeks after the treatment. A PVR grading scale developed at the University of MN will be used to record the effectiveness of the above treatment for different dose levels. Safety of the treatment will be established on the basis of retinal imaging, electroretinography and histopathology. Besides the safety and efficacy study with 5-FU, efficacy of a highly potent drug, Mitomycin C (with or without heparin), will also be examined using the above PVR models. It is anticipated that the proposed treatment would be ready for clinical trials by the end of the Phase II project. This project deals with the treatment of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), or the growth of scar tissues that cause retinal detachment and hence, the failure of retinal re-attachment surgery. A drug nanoparticle generator would be provided that would enable effective delivery of anti-proliferative agents to the retina. Efficacy and safety studies will be undertaken using a rabbit model of PVR. We expect to be ready for clinical trials by the end of this project.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With a projected 55,170 deaths in the United States in 2006, colorectal cancer is second only to lung cancer as the most deadly. Patients with operable, but somewhat advanced, disease (stages II-III) are either observed only or treated with adjuvant therapy to reduce the chances of recurrence after surgery. Although chemotherapy is standard in stage II-III rectal and stage III colon cancer patients, the benefits are restricted to a relatively small fraction of patients. Adjuvant treatment of stage II colon cancer patients is particularly controversial due to the very small benefit in this group. Unfortunately, the prognostic power of simple clinicopathologic data is insufficient to identify high-risk stage II colon cancer patients--or low-risk rectal or stage III colon cancer patients. This proposal describes development of an individualized test based on the status of multiple molecular markers in the patient's tumor to provide an accurate prediction of the risk of recurrence. The molecular markers were carefully selected to provide broad coverage over a range of biological pathways with established prognostic potential. They will be analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in >600 stage II colorectal cancer patients. Pathologists will score up to 22 markers, as will an automated digital image analysis system for maximal objectivity. Statistical pattern recognition methods will then be used on the data to select a subset of the markers and clinicopathologic features that, when combined with an optimized machine learning algorithm, will produce an accurate model that predicts recurrence. Measuring proteins directly in tumor sections with IHC is arguably one the most relevant strategies available to assess patient prognosis and is widely accepted in the pathology community. Unlike IHC, competing methods like gene expression cannot directly assess protein levels or localization, and it is very difficult or impossible to distinguish normal from tumor cells in the homogenized tissue mixtures that are assayed. Furthermore, unlike most previous related studies, the informatic analyses proposed here include robust, powerful methods to discover complex interactions between markers--maximizing performance--while avoiding overfitting--maximizing the potential for generalizability. The proposed application of advanced quantitative scoring (for objective analysis) and cutting-edge informatics (for complex marker interaction elucidation) to the tried and true IHC protein staining technology is a highly innovative approach to the development of cancer prognostics. The ultimate product will consist of a panel of assays for the relevant molecular markers and the associated prognostic algorithm that predicts recurrence. Colorectal cancer patients and their oncologists will be able to use the results to guide their treatment decisions, resulting in positive impacts on life expectancy and quality of life. With the help of their oncologist, patients with newly diagnosed stage I-III colorectal cancer must decide whether to endure the potentially serious side effects of chemotherapy after surgery in the hopes of preventing a recurrence. However, the benefit of chemotherapy is restricted to a relatively small fraction of these patients, and the predictive ability of current clinical guidelines is relatively crude. The goal of this study is to develop an individualized test that will more accurately predict risk of recurrence based on advanced mathematical analysis of the status of multiple molecular markers within the patient's tumor. It should lead to improvements in both survival and quality of life for colorectal cancer patients.",

Androgen ablation provides first-line therapy of metastatic disease, but essentially all tumors become hormone refractory and then rapidly progress. The only approved non-palliative therapy for hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) provides only a modest survival benefit with substantial side effects. Thus, there is an urgent need for novel therapies for prostate cancer. Although notably chemoresistant, prostate cancer may be susceptible to immune therapies based on its metastasis to sites within the immune system and the relatively small size of metastatic lesions. We have developed a novel alphavirus-based vaccine that encodes prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), the hallmark cell-surface marker of prostate cancer. PSMA is abundantly and preferentially expressed in prostate cancer with limited extraprostatic expression. Furthermore, PSMA expression increases with disease progression and is highest in metastatic, hormone-refractory cases. We deliver PSMA to the immune system using a non-replicating Vaccine Replicon Particle (VRP) based on the alphavirus Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus (VEE). Alphavirus technology offers a number of potency and safety advantages over other gene-delivery systems, including an ability to break tolerance to self- antigens in animals. In the Phase I SBIR FLAIR project, PSMA-VRP elicited potent and durable cellular and humoral responses to PSMA in mice. PSMA-VRP also elicited cytotoxic T lymphocytes that potently and specifically killed PSMA+ target cells, and the product has demonstrated encouraging safety and biodistribution profiles in GLP-compliant safety studies. Overall, PSMA-VRP has demonstrated clear advantages over other vaccine strategies. Here, we propose to advance PSMA-VRP into human testing as the first application of alphavirus VRP technology in oncology. The overall goal of this Phase II project is to conduct the first-in-man trial of PSMA- VRP in patients with HRPC. We will complete critical preclinical studies and prepare documents required to secure regulatory approval for human testing. The phase 1 clinical trial will evaluate the tolerability, immunogenicity and preliminary anti-tumor effects of escalating doses of PSMA-VRP. Immune responses will be measured using sensitive SOP-driven immunomonitoring methods adapted from those successfully used in our preclinical studies. This project will provide fundamental insight into the potential therapeutic utility both of a novel alphavirus vaccine delivery technology and of PSMA as a target for active immunotherapy of prostate cancer. Success in the project would provide initial proof-of-concept for this innovative therapy for advanced prostate cancer.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most common cancer of men in the United States with an expected 234,460 new cases and 27,350 deaths in 2006. Recurrent disease can be controlled temporarily with androgen ablation. However, almost all prostate carcinomas become hormone refractory and then rapidly progress. Hormone- refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) is notably chemoresistant. The only approved chemotherapy (docetaxel in combination with prednisone) provides a modest survival benefit; therefore, novel, targeted therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) combine the molecular targeting of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) with the chemotherapeutic properties of a potent cytotoxic drug and hold great promise as targeted cancer therapies. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is the prototypic cell-surface marker of prostate cancer. PSMA is an integral, non-shed membrane protein that is expressed abundantly in nearly all prostatic carcinomas. PSMA expression increases with disease progression and is highest in HRPC. In addition, PSMA internalizes rapidly upon mAb binding, thus facilitating the introduction of chemotherapeutic drugs into the cytosol. Given its limited expression in normal tissues, PSMA represents a compelling target for ADC therapy of prostate cancer. In the Phase I project, we demonstrated compelling preclinical proof-of-concept for a novel ADC comprising a high-affinity, fully human PSMA mAb linked to a potent auristatin drug via a conditionally labile dipeptide linker, an emerging technology being developed in collaboration with Seattle Genetics, Inc. PSMA ADC eliminated PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cells with picomolar potency and nearly 1000-fold selectivity in vitro via antimitotic mechanisms. In a stringent xenograft model of HRPC, well-tolerated doses of PSMA ADC controlled established human tumors resulting in a 9-fold improvement in median survival and complete remission in some animals. The potent and selective antitumor activity of PSMA ADC in vitro and in vivo provides strong rationale for accelerated development of this promising approach in the Phase II project. In the Phase II project, we seek to complete definitive preclinical safety and pharmacology studies to support human testing of this new agent. We first will develop and scale-up procedures for manufacturing and testing a toxicology lot of PSMA ADC. In a second aim, we will perform IND-enabling toxicology studies in a relevant non-human primate species. In parallel, we will perform confirmatory xenograft efficacy studies of the product manufactured using the scaled-up process. Success in the Phase II project is defined as demonstrating favorable preclinical safety and activity profiles to support human testing of a promising molecularly targeted therapy for HRPC. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer of men in the United States and represents the second leading cause of cancer death. Localized prostate cancer typically is treated with surgery and/or radiation, and recurrent disease can be controlled temporarily with androgen ablation. However, almost all prostate carcinomas eventually become hormone refractory and then rapidly progress. Hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) has proven to be largely resistant to conventional chemotherapy. With the exception of palliative care, the only approved chemotherapy for HRPC is docetaxel in combination with prednisone, and this treatment provides a modest (2.4 month) increase in survival. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new, molecularly-targeted therapies for all stages of disease, but most critically for hormone-refractory and metastatic tumors.",

However, if detected and treated early, more than 95% of breast cancer patients will survive. Current method for breast cancer detection relies heavily on X-ray mammography, which produces many false positive findings. These false positive readings cause substantial mental anguish in patients and in many cases, costly and painful biopsies. A full 80% of all biopies uncover only benign masses and calcifications at an estimated annual cost of 2.5 billion dollars.

Thus detectors with ample field of view to contain the entire breast without translation can be employed and very close detector pair spacing can be used without resolution degradation. Our proposed camera offers markedly increased sensitivity and resolution with substantially reduced cost compared to crystal-based PEM cameras under development.

        "abstract": "Physical separation technologies use a tremendous amount of energy in the processing industries.  In particular, vibrating machines are used for dewatering, screening, sizing, mixing, compacting, and conveying.  Although vibrating machines are not the single most energy intensive step in a processing plant, they are often a major bottleneck in the process, and improvements would offer tremendous potential for both energy savings and production enhancements.  Additionally, in processing plants, vibrating machines are among the most costly in maintenance and worker health and safety.  This project will develop technology to significantly reduce energy usage and maintenance costs in vibration-based physical separation systems, while noticeably improving efficiency, effectiveness, capacity, and worker health and safety.  The approach is based on the use of miniaturized intelligent engines, which use an advanced sensory system to continuously monitor the process and make appropriate adjustments to improve production.  Phase I developed a full scale, single-panel laboratory prototype with one-fourth of the full load capacity.  The total power consumption for the manually-controlled prototype was measured to be less than 40 W for operation above idle \u00c2\u00bf 82% less power consumption than conventional systems.  Phase II will design and fabricate a full-scale multiple panel prototype with 100% load capacity.  In order to provide full automation, self monitoring, and self adjustment, an advanced controller software will be developed and integrated into the system.  The prototype will be tested and evaluated under both dry and wet conditions in the field.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new vibration machines should provide significant energy savings (50 to 75%) compared to conventional machines.  Other benefits would include enhanced throughput (10%), reduction in maintenance cost (50%), and immeasurable improvement in worker health and safety.  Target markets include processing industries such as mining, sand and gravel, oil/gas, food, biomass, aggregates, agricultural, and pharmaceutical.

This predictive capability comes at high computational cost, which restricts their use to key classes of problems where simpler empirical methods fail, such as making and breaking chemical bonds in reactions, or providing the first principles input to calibrate empirical force fields. This proposal aims to significantly enhance the performance of the most widely used electronic structure methods, such as second order perturbation theory, density functional theory, novel hybrids of the two, and some more advanced correlation methods. The opportunity is to gain a speedup of between 5 and 10 or more by developing dual basis approximations, a promising perturbative approach whose feasibility was established in the preliminary research. Its capabilities will be fully developed to permit force evaluation in addition to energies themselves. Other complementary algorithms that accelerate large-basis calculations on large molecules will also be formulated and implemented. This project aims to improve the efficiency of the most-widely used quantum chemistry models, namely density-functional theory and second-order perturbation theory.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Long-Term Objective: The duration of hospitalization, commonly known as length of stay (LOS), is a major determinant of hospital costs. The marked variation in LOS between hospitals for groups of patients with similar illnesses suggests there is room for improved efficiency. Our long-term objective is to create a software application linked to the hospital information system to enable hospitals to enhance their efficiency. The major innovation in this proposal is the use of severity of illness, type of surgical procedure, and perioperative complications to predict LOS, which can then be used for shorter-term bed management, longer-term projection of bed capacity and personnel, and compare LOS across providers.         Specific Aims: The specific aims of this proposal are to construct, test, and evaluate a software module, the Surgical Bed Management System (SBMS), which will: 1) Use predicted LOS to manage admissions and discharges within a hospital; 2) Use predicted and actual LOS of a historical cohort of admissions (e.g., previous fiscal year) in a simulation model for strategic planning of bed capacity needs (e.g., the next fiscal year); and 3) Adjust LOS for severity of illness, comorbidity, and surgical procedure so that this measure of efficiency may be credibly compared across physicians and hospitals.         Research Design and Methods: The SBMS will be a web-based software module linked to the hospital information system that facilitates gathering the necessary patient- and hospital-level data from the hospital's health information system and by direct data entry. The SBMS will estimate each patient's predicted LOS on admission and again shortly following surgery, and will aggregate and present this information as an electronic Predicted Bed-Occupancy Board for use in planning near-term admissions. Additionally, the SBMS will use hospital-specific- historical data in a simulation exercise to forecast long-term bed needs, and will compute risk- adjusted LOS for use in comparing efficiency with other hospitals.         This is a two and one-half-year proposal, in which we propose to design and program prototypes, and secure user feedback in first year. We will implement SBMS and train users at the University of Michigan Hospital and conduct alpha testing during months 7 - 15, followed by use for all inpatient general and vascular surgery during months 16 - 30. We will then follow the same steps in a second hospital, Newton-Wellesley. During months 25 - 30, we will collect and analyze data from both hospitals to assess our outcomes.         The primary outcome will be the change in risk-adjusted LOS during the last six months of implementation in the two test hospitals compared with the six months immediately preceding implementation. Secondary outcomes will be user satisfaction assessed with a survey instrument and an assessment of marketability based on structured interviews with key hospital leadership personnel.",

Certain unique attributes of the Quantum AI Tutors make them potentially very well suited for full accessibility to the blind, as well as individuals with other print-related disabilities, using Internet- capable screen reader technology. The potential technological innovation is the development of the first advanced AI chemistry tutoring technology that has accessibility built into its framework design. Important Phase II objectives include:  Continued progress on chemistry-specific accessibility issues. Completion of full accessibility support in AI framework itself. Implementation of Braille support for chemical formulas and equations. Investigation of chemistry-specific pedagogical issues for blind students. Extension to accessible science assessment for blind/VI students, building on AI assessment technology currently under development by Quantum in other projects. Special education is a particular challenge for assessment within the No Child Left Behind legislation. Preparation for success in Phase III has already been undertaken by involving partners that are important commercially as well as technically, such as the National Federation of the Blind and the American Printing House for the Blind (APH). In addition, Quantum has long-term partnerships with McGraw-Hill and Holt, Rinehart and Winston, two of the country's leading educational publishers, as well as two additional commercial agreements with major science education supply companies, Science Kit & Boreal Laboratories and Sargent-Welch. Chemistry comprises the majority of the content standard for physical science in the National Science Education Standards, and yet is one of the most neglected areas in terms of quality educational software, in general, and is a particularly acute problem for the blind and visually impaired. Through recent federally-supported research, Quantum Simulations, Inc. has successfully developed, tested and brought to the classroom the very first artificial intelligence (AI) tutoring systems for chemistry. The goal of the present research is to bring the full power and benefit of this cutting-edge new educational technology to students who are blind and visually impaired using Internet-capable screen access technology.",

RTLS is an important and rapidly growing segment within the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) industry. In today's world of just-in-time commerce, Supply Chain Management (SCM) requires inexpensive real-time location data to improve efficiency and maintain competitiveness. Established technologies like the Global Positioning System (GPS), UltraWideBand (UWB), and traditional time-of-flight ranging have proven unable to perform satisfactorily within complicated, real-world, indoor propagation environments.  The anticipated result of this research effort will be a pilot installation of a NFER tracking system in a warehouse. It is predicted that: RTLS and wireless LAN technologies, combined with innovative applications, will fundamentally change the way businesses manage and track\nhigh-value assets. Accelerated development of a technology that can meet this market need will bolster the American economy and increase American competitiveness.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several recent initiatives have emphasized the importance of developing and testing new technologies to measure patient-reported outcomes (PRO). PRO measures for asthma can be substantially improved using item response theory (IRT), and competing objectives of more practical and more precise assessments can be achieved over a wide range of severity levels using computerized adaptive testing (CAT), which matches questionnaire items to each patient's level. If more available, such information could complement asthma management plans, enhance patient-caregiver communication, and improve clinical decision-making. Among the limiting factors is the impracticality (respondent burden) of today's HRQOL measures. Short-forms (e.g., SF-36(r), AQLQ) are more practical, however, \"ceiling\" and \"floor\" effects limit their ranges and they lack the precision to detect changes in individual patient scores. In Phase I, we developed and piloted a prototype Internet-based assessment (ASTHMA-CAT) that combines asthma impact, asthma control, and generic HRQOL measures in one \"seamless\" administration, and displays results in tandem in a single user-friendly aggregate (or group-level) report. Results from a pilot test of the ASTHMA-CAT showed that the dynamic assessment achieved almost as precise score estimation with far less respondent burden than the full-length survey, and discriminated well between mild, moderate, and severe asthma. Patients and providers positively evaluated the ASTHMA-CAT assessment and report. The aims for Phase II are to: (1) evaluate items from our current asthma bank for psychometric performance and clinical relevance, and calibrate item enhancements by collecting and analyzing responses from large samples of adults varying in asthma severity; (2) build a completely functional and comprehensive ASTHMA-CAT system with centralized data capture, scoring, and \"real time\" feedback reports, and evaluate its psychometric performance through data simulation studies; (3) conduct a longitudinal prospective field study of the ASTHMA-CAT to demonstrate its responsiveness, reliability, and construct validity; and to document the comparability of differing modes of administration (e.g., paper and pencil, tablet PC, Internet); (4) evaluate the ASTHMA-CAT's potential for use in remote self- management; and (5) foster the ASTHMA-CAT's integration into clinical practice through comprehensive documentation and development of educational materials. The goal of this effort is an efficient, less burdensome asthma PRO monitoring system with demonstrated evidence of its administrative feasibility, reliability, validity, and responsiveness. If successful, the ASTHMA-CAT system will offer streamlined data capture, processing, and \"real time\" reporting features; will produce valid and comparable scores across multiple modes of administration; and will provide useful interpretation guidelines to facilitate its routine application in care management. Public Heath Relevance: The ASTHMA-CAT will provide a comprehensive and precise, yet practical, patient-based assessment valid for routine monitoring of asthma impact, asthma control, and generic HRQOL outcomes across a variety of settings. It will yield meaningful and useful results to inform clinical decision-making and improve care management.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project will construct a detector with the capabilities of broadband imaging in the far infrared to terahertz band. The far infrared (FIR) to terahertz (THz) band of the electromagnetic spectrum has recently opened up with the proliferation of sources in this regime. However, the detector systems available on the market for this spectral region are currently expensive and inflexible. The research is centered on the study of a specific material that will convert the thermal imprint of incoming THz radiation into a visible, wavelength dependent signature that is analyzable by a detector and specialized software. A scanning system based on this detector combined with a tunable source will be designed for use as a security/inspection system. The research will incorporate this detector, capable of imaging a wide spectrum of FIR-THz radiation sources with sensitivities better than current technologies at a fraction of the cost, into a scanner system that can scan small parcels, bags and humans to identify\nhazardous materials or contraband.  As researchers and industries increasingly exploit this previously inaccessible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, the need for a better imaging diagnostic tool becomes ever more important. A less-expensive, more sensitive imaging detector of FIR-THz sources is necessary before real-world applications, such as in medicine, become widespread. The realization of this particular application will impact the security and non-destructive testing markets.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A clinical need exists for the development of accurate and efficient dose calculation methods for clinical treatment planning in external beam radiotherapy. Due to recent advances in image guided localization techniques and the development of more precise beam delivery methods such as Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), the potential exists to substantially reduce margins and improve dose conformity. However, most dose calculation methods in clinical use today employ approximations that limit their accuracy and scope of use, especially with narrow beams in the presence of heterogeneities. As a result, industry is moving rapidly towards the clinical adoption of Monte Carlo. However, Monte Carlo calculations are time consuming, limiting their effectiveness for clinical treatment planning. In the Phase I research, a novel deterministic dose calculation method, which solves the differential form of the governing transport equations for neutral and charged particles, was validated against Monte Carlo for patient specific prostate and head- and-neck cases. The results indicated that the proposed approach is as accurate as Monte Carlo, and can provide higher spatial precision. Similarly, the proposed approach was shown to be much faster than Monte Carlo, which can translate to improved accuracy in a clinical setting. In Phase II, a commercially viable dose calculation system will be developed which can be integrated into clinical treatment planning systems, with multi-fold performance gains over the Phase I prototype. Validation cases will be performed by M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, using both experimental data and retrospective patient plans. By providing a combination of speed and accuracy superior to existing clinical dose calculation methods, the Phase II product has the potential to improve quality of care for the approximately 650,000 patients receiving photon beam radiotherapy each year in the U.S., and for many more worldwide. In addition, since the Phase II product is based on first principles numerical methods, it can ultimately be adapted to other radiotherapy modalities. By providing physicians with more accurate dose assessments, the Phase II research has the potential to improve the quality of care for the 650,000 people receiving external beam radiotherapy in the United States each year. Through generally applicable algorithms, the resulting product can ultimately be migrated towards clinical treatment planning for other radiotherapy modalities.",

However, the efficiencies of the BHJ devices must show additional improvement before widespread commercialization can occur, and such improvements will require new materials.  Therefore, this project will combine a new class of fullerene derivatives, which can be used as n-type organic semiconductors, with existing p-type conducting polymers to produce thin film OPV devices with superior performance to existing devices.  Phase I developed two new synthetic strategies, which resulted in two new classes of fullerene derivatives, both suitable for OPV.  In Phase II, the new synthetic methods will be used to produce the fullerene derivatives, and devices based on the new fullerenes will be optimized.

        "abstract": "Sulfuric acid, which is used primarly in the manufacture of phosphate fertilizers, is produced in greater volume than any other industrial chemical.  Sulfuric acid is made by first burning sulfur to produce SO2, reacting the SO2 over a catalyst to produce SO3, and then absorbing the SO3 into water to produce the acid.  Conversion in the catalytic process is limited by equilibrium \u00c2\u00bf if the process can be operated at a lower temperature, the conversion of SO2 to SO3 could be increased.  TDA has developed a novel low temperature catalyst for the oxidation of sulfur dioxide for sulfuric acid manufacture.  This project will demonstrate the effectiveness of a new catalyst operates at temperatures 50-80\u00c2\u00b0C lower than commercial catalysts, thereby providing greater per-pass conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide.  Phase I synthesized and tested a series of catalysts and compared their activity with several commercially available catalysts.  The new catalyst significantly outperformed the commercial catalysts at the lower temperatures and was stable in a preliminary lifetime test.  An economic analysis indicated that the slightly increased cost of the new catalyst would be more than offset by its benefits.  In Phase II, the catalyst will be further improved by examining both the composition and preparation method.  In order to ensure good catalyst lifetime, an automated test system, which can run unattended for weeks at a time, will be designed and built.  Test data will first be used to provide feedback to the catalyst optimiztion task, and then to test the catalyst\u00c2\u00bfs durability.  Finally, we will determine the cost of manufacturing the catalyst followed by an economic analysis of using the catalyst for sulfuric acid manufacturing.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A low temperature sulfur dioxide oxidation catalyst should substantially lower energy use in sulfuric acid manufacture while increasing throughput and lowering sulfur emissions.  Increasing the conversion rate would reduce the amount of feedstock used, increase the energy efficiency of the sulfuric acid plant, and significantly lower sulfur emissions.",

Biocides can now be added as a component during the plastic manufacturing process to make it inherently resistant to microbial attack. PVC is a widely used plastic that requires antimicrobial protection in many applications, as it is often used near water (swimming pool liners and shower curtains) or in areas where sterile or clean surfaces are critical (flooring for hospitals or kitchens and bathrooms). PVC is currently protected from microbial attack by arsenic compounds or organic biocides that migrate slowly out of the protected material. Arsenic-based biocides are under increasing regulatory pressure, and an alternative would be welcomed by the industry. Unfortunately, current non-arsenic (organic) biocides leach out of PVC, contaminating the environment and allowing fungi to attack the PVC. TDA Research, (TDA) proposes to increase the permanence of biocides designed to disperse in PVC. Nanoparticle-based biocides\nwould not migrate out of the thermoplastics, prolonging product lifetimes.

The plan is to develop nonarsenic, non-migratory biocides for PVC.  Commercially, the proposed project will improve help eliminate the use of arsenic containing biocides; biocides which are particularly harmful because they persist in the environment. Despite their known dangers and the desire of manufacturers to discontinue their use, arsenic containing formulations continue to be used in several applications where the alternative organic biocides do not provide the needed long term protection. Further, the use of our technology will decrease the release of the organic biocides into the environment as well, keeping them in the polymer where they are needed.",

Unfortunately, these processes suffer problems, it is very difficult to remove the expensive catalyst from the reaction mixture and the reactions used to make active ingredients in the pharmaceutical industry have typically been carried out as batch reactions.

The cost of establishing and maintaining vascular access in dialysis patients is a staggering $45,000 per patient per annum. The frequency of puncture often leads to complications, such as uncontrollable bleeding after dialysis needle removal, with 70% of patients annually requiring two or more corrective surgical procedures to maintain access. To address the bleeding problem, Rocky Mountain Biosystems, Inc. is developing an activated adhesive technology called FastSeal which is designed to produce a fluid-tight seal in needle tracts. FastSeal uses a focused, high-frequency alternating magnetic field, to affect localized heating of a novel biocompatible adhesive and achieve an immediate seal. FastSeal can be used successfully in wet, dry and pressurized environments, and is designed to be very economical. The technology developed through this research is already leading to additional clinical applications for effectively managing wound closure in a variety of procedures, including vascular access closure, sealing tissue after lung volume reduction and lobectomy, and in cartilage rebuilding and reshaping. The focus of Phase Il will be to develop the adhesive and applicator into a clinical system for sealing the needle tract and the site of venous access, whether synthetic or vascular. This clinical system will be tested in an in vitro skin puncture and an in vivo porcine model, to prepare for human clinical trials and commercialization in Phase III. The proposed tissue fusion device to stop Post-Hemodialysis bleeding would provide tremendous benefit both commercially and societally, in that, it would expedite the dialysis treatment process by rapidly sealing the access site-a treatment that normally takes 10-20 minutes. Thus, it would allow patients to return to normal routine more quickly, and considerably cut dialysis cost due to staffing burden and lengthy treatment times.",

However, the inherent heterogeneity of those assembled systems \u00c2\u00bf different operating systems, system libraries, compilers, etc. \u00c2\u00bf pose a significant challenge to researchers who wish to run their applications on any available grid resource.  In Phase I, a large scale nuclear physics application from Brookhaven National Laboratory  was packaged in a virtual machine format.  The virtual machine was then run on a virtual grid provided by Argonne National Laboratory.  Although Phase I proved the capabilities of virtual grid computing, the overall process required several manual steps and was closely tied to the virtual grid environment provided by Argonne.  In Phase II the project will automate the manual steps in the current process, allowing researchers to go directly from application packaging to job submission on the virtual grid.  Applications packaged as virtual machines will be able to \u00c2\u00bfcontextualize\u00c2\u00bf themselves based on information provided by the grid environment, allowing a single, generic application image to be run anywhere on the virtual grid.  Finally, application environments will be enhanced to measure and track their resource consumption so that they can report resource usage back to the grid environment.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  This new model of computing should provide users with greater flexibility in their distributed computing infrastructure, while increasing the utilization of those same resources.  Users would be able to rapidly promote applications from development to production by reducing the amount of testing required to validate applications across multiple production platforms.  Also, users would be able to quickly respond to changes in application demand by deploying more application images to available virtual infrastructure.",

However, RF guns using thermionic cathodes are not able to supply the high-phase-space densities required.  Amorphous silicon shows great promise as a negative-electron-affinity (NEA), visible-wavelength photocathode suitable for RF gun systems.  The advantages of amorphous silicon include a high degree of immunity to charged particle flux, low thermal emittance, bandgap tunability when grown as a germanium alloy, and low production cost.  Phase I involved measurements on amorphous silicon to determine activation procedure, photoresponse, and neutral and charged particle interactions.  Amorphous silicon surface preparation as well as in vacuo treatment was established to achieve negative electron affinity performance.  Photoresponse was measured as a function of wavelength and lifetime.  In Phase II, amorphous silicon photoemitter quality will be improved by using RF plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).  Characteristics relevant to RF gun operation, including emission angle and current density, will be measured.  Other features important for RF gun use, including substrate diffusion blocking, will be optimized.  The increased quality will lead to improvements in electron diffusion length and thereby the yield.

Alongside with traditional collision induced dissociation (CID), this instrument will feature a novel fragmentation technique based on the interaction of peptide ions with a flow of metastable atoms or molecules. This new fragmentation technique will cleave different peptide backbone bonds than CID with less dependence on peptide composition and preserve labile posttranslational modifications. Incorporating both techniques in one high performance Q-TOF mass spectrometer will allow using these instruments for high throughput proteomics applications. Proteomics studies biological processes by the systematic analysis of the proteins expressed in a cell or tissue.

This project will expand the range of ligands synthesized in Phase I specifically designed to enhance the encapsulation of nanocrystals currently being developed for commercialization in the rapidly growing light emitting diodes, displays, planar infrared amplifiers and photovoltaic markets. In Phase I, the company developed a significant competitive advantage by increasing nanocrystal loading to unprecedented levels with uniform distribution and little or no loss of performance. Further competitive advantages over current encapsulating polymers such as silicones, epoxies, and polycarbonates are Tg's above 250 0C, optical clarity at 800, 1330 and 1550 nm, and no free radicals or by-products during polymerization. This encapsulating performance creates an excellent competitive advantage since it meets a critical enabling need in the\nfield of nanophotonics. The technical objectives for this project are 1) Synthesize 7 new functionalized polymers 2) Work with nanocrystal and device manufacturers to commercialize new nanocrystal composites for the markets shown above 3) Down select and scale up the best materials for commercialization. The Tetramer team has over 50 years of successful specialty polymer commercialization.  If successful the results of this project will enhance scientific and technical knowledge in the very active field of quantum dot and rare earth doped inorganic nanocrystals. In particular, the interaction between the unique functionalized PFCB polymers and the nanocrystal surface will provide new fundamental technical insights for the origins of performance of these materials in LED's, displays, infrared amplifiers, and photovoltaic devices. Improvement of devices in these markets has the potential for strong societal and commercial impact. For example, light emitting diodes replacing incandescent lighting alone could decrease national energy consumption by 29%, while more efficient, lower cost solar cells would reduce the US dependence on foreign oil. Use of these new encapsulating materials will enable new device designs for these high priority markets. This in turn will lead to improved cost performance therefore accelerating commercialization and the subsequent societal benefits of reduced energy usage and improved communications.",

Symptoms of rejection vary depending upon the organ but a biopsy of the transplant is normally required to ascertain that rejection is indeed happening. Biopsies are painful, introduce the possibility of infection, and require subsequent microscopic inspection of the biopsy tissue for lymphocytes. Acute rejection occurs through several mechanisms, but is dominated by multiplication of T cells which attach to HLA antigens on the donor cells and kill them. It is possible to identify the presence of these T cell lymphocytes in the transplanted organ by non-invasive biomagnetic techniques using introduced magnetic nanoparticles specifically targeted to lymphocytes by antibodies, such as CD8+, which attach to their ligand receptors. Sensitive SQUID magnetic sensors can detect the presence of small amounts of these labeled cells by magnetizing the nanoparticles and subsequent measurement of their remanence fields.

In Phase II, we will develop a hydrogen and carbon dioxide (H2-CO2) sensor array for simultaneously detecting transcutaneous H2 and CO2 levels. Measurement of the transcutaneous gases will be used for detecting possible acidosis and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). The specific objectives of this Phase II project are {1} to design a standalone, self-contained sensor reader and {2} to miniaturize and repackage the new sensor reader into a watch-like device. We will also {3} continue to fabricate and improve the titania H2 sensing elements, as well as {4-5} fabricate and improve the performance of a nanoporous CuO-WO3 film for CO2 sensing. Upon completing the sensing elements, we will {6} develop an algorithm to determine the actual transcutaneous H2 and CO2 levels based on the sensor responses. To test the performance of the sensor system, we will first {7} correlate the transcutaneous H2 levels to exhaled breath H2 and the transcutaneous CO2 to blood CO2. We will then {8} measure the transcutaneous H2 and CO2 on preterm and full term infants with documented NEC/acidosis and suspected NEC/acidosis. Finally, we will {9} measure the transcutaneous gases on the test subjects with confirmed NEC/acidosis during the treatment and recovery phases. This Phase II project will involve scientists and engineers from SentechBiomed Corporation and James Kendig, M.D., of the Penn State Children's Hospital at Hershey Medical Center.

Dr. Kendig at the Hershey Medical Center will conduct clinical research to evaluate the performance of the sensor and collect crucial clinical data for analysis. The outcome of this work is a noninvasive, real time sensor system for detecting certain diseases that can be diagnosed by monitoring the variation in excreted transcutaneous gases.

This is extremely important knowledge for biowarfare agents (BWA) and other common diseases of high public health concern especially for the safe and effective development of new vaccines and immunotherapeutic drugs. Further, new computational tools to help transform volumes of raw genomic/proteomic and physiologic data to actionable knowledge will help guide and accelerate researchers' investigations for new vaccines, adjuvants, and immunotherapeutic drugs. This is relevant, not only to biodefense, but for many other pathogens and diseases -- especially in studies where it is important to eventually predict human response from animal models. Phase I produced excellent results in demonstrating that our computational tools based on dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) can be used to discover mechanistic processes and model the host immune response to BWAs and others infectious diseases. As in Phase I, our Phase II computational tools will be based on the statistical/probabilistic power of DBNs which we plan to expand to enable and validate for multi-conditional comparative studies leading to mechanistic discovery and creation of predictive immune response models. These models are derived from the time-course patterns of genes, proteins and physiologic factors which we call the host's \"biosignature\". An innovation of our computational approach is the ability to include time-course data (gene, protein, and physiologic data) fused with prior biological knowledge (i.e. regulatory pathways, gene-gene/protein-protein relations, gene homologies, functional ontologies, etc.) which we believe significantly advances the discovery of novel immunologic components and the creation of mechanistic-based immune response models. The Phase II goals are to: 1) implement an innovative multi-conditional comparative computational methodology designed to enable the discovery of underlying host-pathogen genetic mechanisms, and 2) the validation of our mechanistic discovery and modeling methodology on a select set of pathogens (B. melitensis (Brucellosis), B. anthracis (anthrax), Coccidioides immitis (Valley fever), and Influenza) and vaccines (genetically engineered and attenuated). The investigation of new vaccines and drugs are producing huge volumes of \"raw\" immunologic genomic, proteomic and physiological response data. This \"raw\" data must be transformed into actionable knowledge to guide and accelerate researchers' investigations for new vaccines, adjuvants, and immunotherapeutic drugs. Seralogix's new computational methods for identifying genetically regulated host immune response will significantly aid in advancing our understanding of the molecular targets and immunologic mechanisms critical to robust defense against pathogenic microbes. This is relevant, not only to biodefense, but for many other pathogens and diseases -- especially in studies where it is important to eventually predict human response from animal models. Seralogix believes that such tools will be capable of discovering novel immunologic mechanism and thus have significant commercial potential.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to develop targeted probes for imaging receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tumor angiogenesis. Overexpressed VEGF receptors play the crucial role in the onset and progression of tumor angiogenesis and therefore, these receptors are the primary targets of tremendous efforts to develop inhibitors of angiogenesis. However, these receptors are not being used as biomarkers in prescribing or monitoring anti-angiogenic therapy, because there are no non-invasive methods for assessment of their prevalence. Thus, non-invasive imaging of VEGF receptors addresses unmet clinical needs and might lead to evidence-based selection of patient for anti-angiogenic therapy, and design of personalized treatment regiments. In addition, since VEGF receptors are reportedly overexpressed in tumor and contiguous host vasculature at the onset of malignant growth, VEGF receptor imaging might be used for early diagnostics and discrimination between benign and malignant lesions. In Phase I of this project we have developed novel VEGF-based probes for near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of VEGF receptors that are suitable for clinical development. Site-specific conjugation of contrast agents to appropriately designed VEGF yielded probes that bind to VEGF receptors on endothelial cells as effectively as parental VEGF. We established that our VEGF-based probes undergo receptor-mediated internalization and accumulate in tumor and host endothelial cells overexpressing VEGF receptors. Importantly, using inactivated VEGF-based probes that lost the ability to bind to VEGF receptors, we evaluated a contribution of non-specific mechanisms to probe accumulation in tumor vasculature. Our targeted imaging probes are based on a novel single-chain (sc) VEGF that provides fora significant improvement in expression, refolding, and purification, relative to a conventional VEGF with two subunits linked via disulfide bonds. Site-specific conjugation of contrast agents to scVEGF via our proprietary humanized cysteine containig tag (Cys-tag) ensures homogeneity of the imaging probes. Taking together, our Phase I results open the road to clinical development of VEGF-based probes for selective and specific imaging of VEGF receptors in tumor vasculature. In Phase II, we will establish safety of scVEGF-based probes, develop scalable GLP production of conjugates and characterize utility of these probes for predicting/monitoring responses to a specific inhibitor of VEGF receptors and for early diagnostic of malignant lung lesions. We expect that Phase II results will establish scVEGF-based imaging probes as viable candidates for clinical development. In Phase II of this project we will undertake crucial steps in pre-clinical development of novel targeted probes for molecular imaging of specific receptors that play crucial role in the onset and growth of tumor vasculature and are the primary targets for therapeutic development. Results obtained in the Phase I of this project established 1) feasibility of constructing targeted probes, using a novel proprietary technology, and 2) feasibility of obtaining early and dynamic information about the status of these receptors. Thus, clinical development of these targeted imaging probes open new opportunities for evidence-based selection of patients for specific therapeutic treatments, timely monitoring responses to anti-cancer therapies, for early cancer diagnostics, and discrimination between benign and malignant lesions.",

Ongoing research using the ActiveStep treadmill completed in Phase I/Phase II, has demonstrated that a treadmill-based perturbation tool for tripping and slipping has demonstrated a positive effect on the biomechanical performance of older adults subject to laboratory induced trip and slip disturbances. The proposed ActiveStep system provides the enabling technology for large- scale application of clinically relevant fall prediction and prevention training. Use of ActiveStep is hypothesized to reduce the incidence of falls, the leading cause of injury deaths among people over 65 years old. The Principal Objective of this NIH Phase II Competing Renewal SBIR project is to continue and complete product development efforts for and clinical validation of ActiveStep, a treadmill- based rehabilitation device for fall prevention training and fall risk assessment for older adults. The design goals are to reduce the cost of goods for manufacturing and to meet electrical and mechanical safety requirements and life-cycle testing that are included in national and international standards for commercial exercise equipment. At the same time, we propose to continue pre-market approval clinical studies for required regulatory pathways to assess the efficacy of our fall assessment algorithm and our fall prevention training protocol. The proposed ActiveStep system provides the enabling technology for large-scale application of clinically relevant fall prediction and prevention training. Use of ActiveStep is hypothesized to reduce the incidence of falls, the leading cause of injury deaths among people over 65 years old. Hip fractures account for about 60% of fracture related hospitalizations with 90% of hip fractures resulting from falls. Recent research using a novel quasi-prospective study design indicates that lower extremity strength and power and measures of static and quasi-static balance do not predict risk of trip-related falls by older adults. In contrast, existing research has shown that repeated exposures to a slip or trip distance can reduce the probability of falling. If technically and economically feasible, ActiveStep will help reduce the health care costs associated with the treatment and rehabilitation of injuries sustained during a fall.",

Currently used rapid thermal processing (RTP) systems result in substantial dopant profile broadening because of their relatively large time constants. The development of a novel Hybrid Rapid Thermal Process (HRTP) system which combines the advantages of RTP and laser annealing will be accomplished through this project. The advantages of HRTP anneals was demonstrated in the Phase I of the project. In the Phase II project extensive thermal simulation studies will be performed to understand, optimize and scale up the process.  Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP) systems are a critical part of semiconductor manufacturing operations and are used to form gate oxides, silicides and annealed ion implanted dopants for formation of ultra-shallow junctions. The market-size for these applications exceeds $500 M/year. With the rapid miniaturization of the devices, there is a strong need to develop higher ramp rate and higher\ntemperature annealing systems to achieve the formation of ultra-shallow junctions. The proposed HRTP system is expected to fill this niche. The HRTP system can also be usedin thermal annealing of wide band gap semiconductors such as GaN and SiC as they require extremely high temperature, which cannot be achieved by traditional systems.",

However, such empirically supported treatment (EST) programs are not as widely implemented in mental care as desirable. This gap undermines the positive impact that psychosocial treatments can have for children, and may ultimately reduce the value society will place on psychosocial treatment for mental health problems. About 13% of all school-age children have anxiety and 6% mood disorders. The long term goal of the current project, therefore, is to increase the likelihood that children receive ESTs for the mental health problems. To this end, the specific aims of the proposed Phase II work will be fully developed and make ready for commercial dissemination three products for which prototypes already exist from R&D completed in phase I. the central product is the Children's Emotional Disorders Effective Treatment Archive (CEDETA), which consists of complete kits for of all material required to implant (e.g., manual, workbooks) and evaluate each included EST. Treatments included in CEDETA were identified through a comprehensive scientific literature search and extensive evaluation by an independent Expert Panel in phase I. Access to 17 EST programs was secured in phase I, and a prototype kit for one CEDETA program was constructed and favorably evaluated by consumers. The specific aim for phase II is to make all materials for each EST program in CEDETA ready for commercial distribution by the end of the grant period. These kits will be marketed and sold to mental health practitioners, clinics, and systems. The other two products enhance the use of CEDETA by (1) facilitating the selection of the right treatment for a mental health practitioner's needs, through an online search procedure; and (2) providing professional continuing education (CE) training to the implementation of EST. specific phase II aims are to make these two ancillary products ready for commercial distribution by the end of the grant period.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the rapid development and deployment of high-performance computer and sensor technologies, digital imaging has come to its primetime and has replaced traditional film-based systems as the most widely used technology for medical image acquisition, processing, archiving, and communication. While digital imaging offers many great advantages over its analog counterpart, the success of the Internet and cost-effective digital recording has made it possible to create, replicate, transmit, and distribute digital content in an effortless way. The vulnerability to unauthorized use and alteration associated with easy access to the digital content of medical images now raises serious concerns. Protection of patient privacy and enforcement of data security for digital medical records has thus become increasingly important as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Standards mandate health institutions to protect health information against unauthorized use or disclosure. The goal of this project is to complete the development of novel lossless digital watermarking techniques for data security and integrity of medical images. Existing digital watermarking products only provide lossy watermarking solutions that are primarily used in the entertainment industry for copyright protection of digital music, pictures and DVDs. These products are inapplicable to medical images because the lossy operation causes permanent alteration to the digital image content after watermarking. On the other hand, current DICOM standards used in clinical applications encode patient information separately and append it to the image as a header. There are reported cases where digital clinical images become separated from their DICOM headers and therefore have HIPAA implications. For clinical research, sometimes images must be anonymized by altering the DICOM headers to lessen the HIPAA impact and to reduce bias from knowing patient information in the analysis of the images. Hence there is clearly a need for an effective tool that would enable medical image watermarking with the patient information and the records such as the institution and accession number to allow tracking the image back to its source. To our knowledge, no commercial product exists at present time that provides such a tool. To address the need and seize the emerging market opportunity, the proposed project seeks to develop innovative techniques and products that will uniquely offer lossless watermarking solutions to medical imaging applications. Our approach is to make the usage, archiving, and communication of medical images much more secure and protectable, by embedding imperceptible watermarks into the images. These watermarks remain present after copying, network/Internet transmission, and even some alteration, and they can be retrieved when needed. Important information, such as patient identification, physician signatures, diagnostic specification and user history, can all be encrypted and encoded into the watermarks along with the image authentication code. Yet the original image can still be perfectly recovered from the watermarked image upon decoding. Hence the new technology will enable clinicians and researchers to protect effectively both patient privacy and the authenticity of their image data. During the Phase 1 project, we developed methods and software to achieve lossless region-of-interest (ROI) watermarking of medical images. We evaluated the new methods using several data sets of monochrome medical images from cytogenetic and radiology applications, based on the criteria of (1) imperceptibility, (2) capacity, and (3) robustness of the embedded watermarks. Test results show that the lossless ROI watermarking approach works very well and clearly exceeds the Phase 1 feasibility criteria. In the Phase 2 project we will complete the development of the proposed technology. We will refine the lossless ROI watermarking by optimizing several system parameters. We will extend the methodology to support lossless ubiquitous watermarking of medical images. We will also incorporate encryption functions and color transformations in the system to provide additional security for patient information and the support for color image watermarking. We will evaluate the resulting algorithms and software for a variety of medical imaging applications including radiology, pathology and cytogenetics. We will beta test the new technology in the clinical environment and optimize the technology as end-user input and feedbacks are gathered. Once fully developed and qualified, this new technology will be patented and incorporated into future IRIS (ADIR's parent company) in-vitro diagnostic imaging products. It also will be made commercially available through licensing agreements and partnerships with manufacturers of medical imaging systems and companies of general image processing and publishing software products. Finally, we will seek DICOM and JPEG2000 adoption and standardization for broader application and dissemination. This project develops innovative software techniques that will offer currently unavailable lossless watermarking solutions to medical imaging applications. The approach is to make the usage, archiving, and communication of medical images much more secure and protectable, by embedding imperceptible watermarks into the images. These watermarks remain present after copying, network/Internet transmission, or even some alteration, and can be retrieved when needed. Important information such as patient identification, physician signatures, diagnostic specification and user history can all be encrypted and encoded into the watermarks along with the image authentication code. Yet the original image can still be perfectly recovered from the watermarked image upon decoding. Hence the new technology will enable clinicians and researchers to effectively protect the patient privacy and integrity of their image data.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will evaluate the clinical efficacy and cost savings benefits from use of an endotracheal tube (ETT) position and patency monitoring system through a prospective, randomized, controlled trial conducted at multiple clinical centers. The two years, two phase study will enroll up to 270 subjects that include neonates, children, and adults who require intubation for extended ventilatory assistance. The system operation is based on an acoustic pulse-echo technique that non-invasively probes ETTs with sound and uses the returning echoes to determine the tube's position within the patient and provide quantitative information regarding tube patency. Phase I will verify safety and feasibility in approximately 50 subjects by programming the device to continuously collect ETT position and function data while the subject is mechanically ventilated, but blinding the research team to these data. Normal \"standard of care\" procedures will be used to maintain proper ETT function (e.g. routine chest x-rays to confirm ETT position, suctioning). Measurable results from these procedures will be compared to the data recorded on the device to determine consistency. Adverse events will be analyzed to determine if any were device related. If the results meet the safety and feasibility endpoints, Phase II will be initiated. Phase II will consist of a prospective, 1:1 randomized study of approximately 220 subjects in which the device will be used as a primary means to monitoring ETT location and function. Device data will be collected in addition to the standard of care measures performed on each subject. The primary hypothesis being investigated in this study is that use of this device will decrease the overall respiratory adverse event rate associated with mechanical ventilation. Secondarily, the data will be analyzed to determine if this device reduces adverse events associated with ETT position or function and predicts ETT-related adverse events prior to their occurrence. SonarMed's intelligent endotracheal tube (ETT) monitoring system has the potential to establish a new paradigm in the standard of care for airway management. It will enable clinicians to move from the current reactive approach that provides corrective action only in response to indirect indications of ETT complications (patient in respiratory distress), towards a more proactive methodology where immediate notification of high risk ETT conditions (ETT on verge of extubation) can be used to anticipate and thereby prevent adverse events.",

Entomopathogenic nematodes are environmentally friendly biocontrol agents that can suppress a wide variety of economically important insect pests including white grubs, root weevils, and clearwing moth borers. Commercialization of these nematodes, however, has not reached its potential. Our challenge is to overcome two critical barriers: 1) excessive production costs, and 2) variable efficacy in field applications.\nIn vivo production technology is a well-suited approach for small businesses to produce quality nematode products. The costs of producing in vivo however, are high relative to in vitro approaches due to the expense of insect hosts and labor. In response, we propose developing a completely automated processes including production of improved insect host media, host inoculation, nematode harvest and packaging. The project is focused on producing nematodes in mealworms. In Phase I, we determined the basic requirements for mechanized production and established feasibility of the process. The next steps (in Phase II) will be to refine and further optimize nutritional aspects of insect and nematode production, development of scaled up prototypes for mechanization, and expanded pest control efficacy testing.\nThis research will lead to development of a powerful biocontrol technology for suppression of arthropod pests. Nematode production costs will decrease and product utility will be expanded in various crops. Once proven successful, the system can be adapted to use with other insect hosts or production of other microbial or arthropod biocontrol agents, the potential is vast.",

The chemical sonde is based upon low power vertical cavity lasers, compact optical cells, and noise-lowering data analysis algorithms. Water vapor is the most important radiative gas in the atmosphere, but accurate measurements of it in the upper troposphere and lower stratsophere are limited to custom, one-of-a-kind instruments. Methane is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas, photochemically breaks down into water vapor in the stratosphere, and is a useful tracer for troposphere-stratosphere exchange. In combination, the water vapor and methane balloon based sensor offers more accurate insight into atmospheric chemistry (e.g. recovery of the ozone layer), atmospheric dynamics, and the Earth's radiative budget.  Improved data on water vapor and methane in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere will help to better understand and predict how climate will\nchange in the future. The costs of action and inaction on climate change are expected to be large, and it is imperative that society implement policies that maximize environmental protection while minimizing economic costs.

        "abstract": "Controlled chemical doping of magnesium diboride (MgB2) has been shown to substantially improve superconducting properties to the levels required for high field magnets.  However, consistent dopant concentrations and homogeneity are difficult to accomplish through the usual route of solid state reaction and diffusion.  Furthermore, a high quality source of doped boron needs to be established to advance the state of the art and to ultimately commercialize MgB2 superconductors.  This project will prepare carbon-doped boron powders suitable for the fabrication of high performance MgB2 conductors.  In Phase I, a gas-phase plasma synthesis method was investigated for producing doped-boron nanopowders suitable for use in commercially viable MgB2 superconductor wire.  Boron powder, doped with carbon and titanium, was converted to MgB2 superconducting pellets and multifilament powder-in-tube (PIT) wires, and superconducting properties were measured.  The effect of certain parameters (such as dopant level, powder particle size, and wire processing temperature) on the superconducting properties was determined.  The carbon-doped MgB2 was fabricated into 19-filament wires and yielded an upper critical magnetic field of 37T, equal to the highest values yet attained for bulk MgB2 materials.  In Phase II, carbon, titanium, and silicon carbide will be investigated as dopants and optimum compositions will be defined.  The effect of powder particle size, purity, dopant concentration, and chemical homogeneity on the superconducting properties of MgB2 will be determined.  Fundamental plasma processing parameters for the optimal synthesis of the boron nanopowders will be developed.   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Chemically doped MgB2 superconducting magnets should perform at least as well as NbTi and Nb3Sn in high field magnetic fields, with an improvement in terms of operating temperature.  MgB2 should thus become an effective material for high magnetic field applications, such as for particle accelerators, confined fusion, and medical MRI devices.  Cheaper and more efficient medical MRI devices could lower examination costs and detect potential health problems earlier.",

Combustion control systems can be based on non-intrusive in-situ measurement using passive optical probes that measure spectrally-resolved radiation from specific molecular products (H2O, CO, and CO2) in the hot flow field.  Concentrations and temperatures can be directly determined from the observed spectral structure.

Flow field characterization is achieved using a large number of measurements over multiple lines of sight through the flow.  The proposed Phase II research lays the scientific ground work for active control systems for a range of multi-burner combustors, including turbine engines, boilers, and process burners.\nThese applications represent more than 50% of the global fossil energy usage; thus improvements in efficiency can have a major economic and societal impact.

Neuropathic pain syndromes are for the most part resistant to traditional analgesic treatments with NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or opiate medications (eg, morphine, codeine). Furthermore, most therapeutics currently used to treat neuropathic pain, including some antidepressants (eg, amitriptyline) and anticonvulsants (eg, gabapentin), were not specifically developed for that purpose, and show efficacy in only a fraction of the patients. We have been exploring a series of new and proprietary acetaminophen analogs, in which the lead compound (SCP-1) and it's active metabolite (SCP-123) show a favorable safety profile and are active in rodent models of neuropathic pain. In the first year under this Phase II SBIR translational research project, we will evaluate both an oral solid and an intravenous (iv) solution of SCP-123 in three models of neuropathic pain and compare them to gabapentin. We will also evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of these two formulations. When these evaluations are complete, we will analyze the data and choose one of the formulations as a clinical candidate. In the second and third year of this grant we will conduct the preclinical studies (on the chosen formulation) that are necessary for an Investigative New Drug (IND) application to the FDA. At the end of the third year of this grant project, we will write and assemble the IND package and submit it to the FDA. If the FDA accepts the IND application, we will shortly thereafter begin the Phase I human clinical of SCP-123 Chronically, medically resistant pain is one of the most significant health problems in our country and affects more than 50 million Americans.

The objective of this project is to create new statistical methods and software that expand the scope of spatial-regression methods and analyzable datasets. The new methods and software will provide the research community with important tools to better understand spatial aspects of human behavior and their effect on health. The project will derive and statistically analyze generalized method of moments (GMM) and instrumental variable (IV) estimation methods for important classes of cross-sectional and panel-data spatial- regression models for which maximum likelihood (ML) estimators cannot be formulated, or where their statistical properties have not yet been formally established. The project will also implement those methods in the widely used statistical software program Stata, paying particular attention to user friendliness, numerical efficiency, and the ability to handle large datasets. Cross-sectional units are often heterogeneous. Phase I of the project considered an important cross- sectional spatial model allowing for heteroskedasticity of unknown form in the innovations. The Phase I project derived the statistical properties of a new GMM/IV estimation method for this model. Analytic and simulation results showed that the GMM/IV estimation method can be successfully applied in this situation, whereas the standard ML methods cannot. The results also demonstrated that the GMM/IV estimators can be computed in signficantly less time than comparable ML estimators. The model considered by the Phase I project belongs to a class of spatial models often referred to as Cliff-Ord models. Previous estimation methods for Cliff-Ord models have focused mostly on models for cross-sectional data. Extensions of Cliff-Ord models to panel-data are sparse. Also, these extensions only consider random-effects specifications, and do not allow for spillovers in the endogenous variables, or for time dynamics, and hence these models may not be appropriate in many applications. The Phase II project has two general aims. First, it will develop new GMM/IV estimators, complete with asymptotic distribution theory, for more general panel-data spatial-regression models which allow for fixed effects; spillovers in the endogenous variables, exogenous variables, and disturbances; time dynamics; and systems formulations. The new GMM/IV estimators will handle cases in which either ML estimators cannot be properly formulated or the estimation theory for ML estimators is currently known. Second, it will implement the estimation methods in Stata to make them readily available to the research community, and develop tools that reduce the computational cost of estimation to accommodate large datasets. This project will have substantial broad impacts by facilitating sound empirical analysis of topics in health and other fields by developing and implementing in Stata estimation methods that incorporate spatial (cross-sectional) dependencies and interactions. The tools will help us better understand the spatial aspects of human behavior and their effects on health, including the spread of disease, which will benefit society through better public health policy and planning.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Addressing Market Needs The in-vivo MR imaging of rats and mice is widely used for modeling human cancers and developing cancer treatment drugs. An investigation into MR imaging techniques suitable for the early detection of cancer, together with its diagnosis and treatment, has shown the need for improved sensitivity, increased throughput and higher spatial and temporal resolution, in fact resolution approaching the practical resolution limits set by water diffusion and physiological motion. This clearly points to the need for higher magnetic fields. Difficult siting requirements and high magnet costs associated with such technology represent a strong barrier to investigators' access to an advanced imaging instrument of such a kind. Research in this area would greatly benefit from an increase in the number of high field MR platforms to study a larger number of genetically engineered mice as well as mice with viable human tumor models.     Product Description The decision to develop and manufacture an advanced self-shielded, 14.1 T, 160 mm i.d. superconducting MRI magnet with a 1.2 m long room temperature bore can be justified because of applications that will be enabled and the need to demonstrate technology. It is the most convenient bore size for installing high performance gradients for small animal imaging and it will demonstrate technologies that can lay the foundation for manufacturing compact and economical MRI superconducting magnets operating at fields of 12 T to 20 T.     Innovation impact The development of Stern's novel approach to magnet design and fabrication opens the door for fulfilling the market need for more compact and affordable high-field self-shielded MRI magnets. Furthermore, because this industry segment comprises very few suppliers, the emergence of a new competitor is expected to lead to further improvements in their performance and economy. Funding of the Phase II program will provide an opportunity for Stern to achieve milestones critical to its business development in serving the bio-medical market. Demonstration of its \"enabling technologies\" applied in an operational high-field MR platform would be a most valuable result of the project. The existence of a tangible \"proof of concept\" is expected to provide Stern with the momentum to generate the funding necessary for developing commercial products, both for animal and human MR magnets. The expected installation of the proof of concept model will be an added valuable contribution to the bio-medical research community. In Phase III, one of Stern's business goals will be to transfer its novel technologies to even larger magnets and, eventually, to human research and clinical MRI platforms. This transfer constitutes the company's main expansion scenario. This process will also establish a competitive US manufacturer of high-field MR magnet systems.",

The use of acoustic stethoscope has a number of highly undesirable side effects including withdrawal response, flinching, apnea, hypoxemia, change in sleep state, and possibility of contamination. During Phase I a prototype non-contact optical stethoscope, capable of recording good quality heart and lung sounds was developed. The non-contact stethoscope is based on a standard technique of interferometry with a novel fiber optic design. The fiber optic design avoids the use of glass components - mirrors, lenses, splitters, and prisms - and yields a light, rugged and inexpensive interferometer.  The non-contact optical stethoscope based on the fiber optic interferometer could greatly improve the quality of care for neonates, burn victims,\nimmuno-suppressed patients, and in those cases where direct contact should be avoided. A laser interferometer based on a novel fiber optic design has been developed. The interferometer based on fiber optics is light, inexpensive, and rugged as it does not require component alignment.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many diseases are still without an effective treatment today, and others have evolved resistances requiring new therapeutic agents to be developed. In the effort to develop discovery candidates for medical applications, an important observation is that the vast majority of useful drugs contain one or several chiral centers. Since the wrong enantiomer can cause harmful side effects, very high enantiomeric purity of therapeutics is essential for safe and effective treatment. Thus, both producing enantiomerically pure formulations and testing for enantiomeric purity are critical. Unfortunately, both of these activities remain significant challenges, even with the current \"state of the art\" analytical instrumentation. The proposed work intends to develop a next-generation chiral analytical technique that is suitable for non-contact, rapid, accurate, and highly sensitive screening of chiral samples. This approach utilizes several experimentally simple, but scientifically sophisticated techniques from \"state of the art\" optics research first developed for nonlinear-optical spectroscopy, but which we now apply to simple polarimetry. The method transforms the detection of optical rotation into a dual-beam technique that utilizes the advantages of differential signal detection. In addition, the Faraday effect is utilized using a sinusoidally varying magnetic field on the sample, optical-heterodyne detection by modulating the laser source, and double modulation phase-sensitive detection. The addition of optical heterodyning decreases the observed background noise in the system by moving the signals of interest to frequencies where electronic pickup and optical noise in the system do not contribute (analogous to double-beam-double-modulation detection in laser absorption spectrometry). By observing analytical signals in electronically quiet regions, additional electronic gain can be applied prior to the analog-to-digital converter further improving system sensitivity. We call this set of techniques and the resulting device the Magneto-Optical Phase Enantiomeric Detector-Optical Rotation (MOPED). In the effort to discover and develop pharmaceutical candidates, one must consider that the vast majority of useful drugs have two or more potential geometrical forms. As the wrong geometrical form can cause harmful side effects, very high purity of therapeutics is essential for safe and effective treatment. The proposed work intends to develop a next-generation analytical technique that is suitable for non-contact, rapid, accurate, and highly sensitive screening of chiral geometries.",

        "abstract": "Tabletop plasma laser accelerators require bunched electron beams as inputs.  An ideal source for this bunched beam would be a free electron laser that operates at terahertz frequencies.  The addition of a terahertz waveguide to the free electron laser would permit efficient bunching with low input power.  Therefore, this project will develop, test, and build two bunching undulator systems with THz waveguides, ancillary magnets, and fully turn-key operation.  Phase I showed that microbunching undulators in the THz range are technically feasible and can be built in a cost effective way.  In particular, Phase I involved a magnetic analysis of the microbunching undulator, an analysis of THZ waveguide impact on undulator design, and an engineering design analysis of the microbunching undulator.  Phase II will:  (1) refine the magnetic analysis based on engineering details; (2) engineer, design, and build two undulators, chicanes and THz waveguides for future research; and (3) test both the short and long THz waveguides with the 60 cm and 2 meter microbunching undulators.  These tests will entail performing beam propagation measurements and comparing resonant FEL amplification with theoretical predictions.   Commercial Application and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The new free electron laser would be a source of high-power terahertz radiation with many applications including future DOE accelerators, the U.S. Navy, and the Department of Homeland Security.  There are no commercial suppliers of these microbunching free electron lasers.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue engineering (TE) is poised to make an enormous impact on the range of therapeutic options for treatment of life-threatening conditions that afflict millions of Americans. To date, however, no marketed TE product has proven to be commercially successful. One of the primary factors contributing to this lack of profitability is the need for aseptic processing at all steps. Unlike traditional pharmaceutical and biotechnology products, engineered tissues and cell-based therapies must be processed aseptically throughout their manufacture. For this reason, these therapies come with extremely high facility and production costs. New, innovative approaches for aseptic processing and scale-up are required before cell- based therapies can become accessible to patients in the US health care system. Stratatech Corporation has approval from the FDA to begin Phase I/I I clinical trials with StrataGraft(tm), a human skin substitute tissue based on Stratatech's patented NIKS(tm) human keratinocyte cell line. In addition, Stratatech is developing a pipeline of genetically enhanced living skin products (ExpressGraft(tm)) for use in the chronic, non-healing diabetic, venous stasis, and decubitus skin wound markets. This Fast Track proposal is designed to develop a closed, aseptic manufacturing process for these innovative products which will greatly reduce production costs and increase patient safety. In Phase I we will address the issue of closed, aseptic keratinocyte culture and scale-up as well as the PHS and FDA concerns regarding xenotransplantation. We will determine parameters for cryopreservation of NIKS(tm) keratinocytes in sterile bag format. We will then thaw and propagate these preserved NIKS(tm) cells in closed cell factories without the aid of murine feeder cells. Finally, we will scale-up methods for NIKS(tm) culture to enable harvest and passage at a sufficient scale for full scale commercial manufacture. In Phase II we will extend these results by developing methods for production of StrataGraft(tm) skin tissue in closed tissue growth chambers. We will construct prototype chambers and test their ability to produce skin tissue in batch and perfusion modes with on-line process monitoring. Then, we will design an optimized second-generation tissue growth chamber which would also function as the final storage container. RELEVANCE: This proposal will develop innovative closed, aseptic processing methods for the manufacture of engineered living human skin substitute products, StrataGraft(tm) and ExpressGraft(tm) skin tissue, in development at Stratatech Corporation. By manufacturing these products in a closed, aseptic fashion without the need for mouse feeder cells, we will bring these breakthrough therapies to millions of Americans afflicted with chronic, non-healing diabetic, venous stasis, and pressure ulcers.",

The final product will integrate the program into exercise prescription software and create a web site that will contain over 1200 animated rehabilitation exercises. The therapist can choose the exercises from a menu and send a link to the patient where they can access the animated exercises via an internet link on their computer. An alternative CD-ROM based version of the program will be developed for patients who do not have Internet access. These 1200 exercises will give therapists the ability to use this system with patients who are receiving outpatient treatment for most orthopedic conditions. The web based animated exercise delivery system will draw from the extensive experience of the development team in exercise software development, motion capture technology and the development of web site applications. A beta version of the program will be provided to 30 physical therapy clinics for evaluation with patients who are being treated for musculo-skeletal problems. Efficacy of the program will be evaluated by randomizing patients to usual care or the animated exercise system, and comparing pre- and post measures of exercise performance, attitudes, behavioral intentions, self-efficacy, compliance and consumer satisfaction. Therapist will also provide evaluative data on the program design and functionality.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project is intended to develop a new process for manufacturing tantalum (Ta) metal fibers for use in producing tantalum capacitors, and advance this process to the stage of commercialization. This technology, which has been demonstrated in Phase I, could lead to capacitor products having higher performance and greater volumetric efficiency than any currently available. The use of fibers in place of metal powder allows the production of thin anode bodies leading to improved packing options and component performance. The innovation underlying the technology is bundle drawing of Ta filaments in a copper matrix. A composite consisting of Ta filaments in a copper matrix is drawn is a series of reduction steps until the filaments are less than about 10 microns in diameter. The drawn wire is rolled to produce ribbon-type filaments that are 1 micron or less in thickness. The copper composite matrix is chemically dissolved without attacking the Ta to produce metallic Ta high surface area, ribbon-fibers. The fibers are\nformed into thin mats, which are sintered to produce porous metal strips from which high surface area capacitor anodes are made. A significant aspect of this approach is that fiber morphology can be varied over a wide of fiber thicknesses unlike powder. This allows the morphology of the fibers to be optimized for the particular voltage rating and use requirements in order to maximize the performance of the capacitor.  Commercially, nearly all medical, automotive, military and many consumer electronic devices utilize Ta electrolytic capacitors due to their outstanding performance, reliability and volumetric efficiency. Solid electrolytic capacitors are currently made from Ta metal powder.  Several million pounds per year of Ta powder are consumed in manufacturing Ta capacitors for these applications. The trend in electronics is toward high powder components and increased miniaturization. Combined with the need to lower materials and manufacturing costs, these considerations have created an opportunity for new method of producing solid electrolytic capacitors. Fiber metal technology has the potential to both lower manufacturing costs, improve capacitor performance, and improve packaging options, which could enable the development of new product that are either currently very difficult or very expensive to make using current technology base on metal powder.",

Each will solve an important problem for researchers that use exciting new ultrashort-laser-pulse techniques for imaging, micro-machining, surgery, telecommunications, chemical-reaction control, time-domain spectroscopy, and many other applications. Such applications work best with the shortest pulse - but currently operate with much longer ones because such pulses naturally lengthen as they pass through the many optical components on the way to their final destination. Pulse compressors, which use four prisms (or two prisms and a mirror), solve this problem, but they are unwieldy and have a tendency to introduce other distortions, making them difficult to commercialize.

The pulse compressor\nwill greatly benefit multi-photon microscopy - in use in over 1000 biological labs worldwide, and where it will significantly improve image sensitivity and resolution. Micromachining efforts and new ophthalmologic surgical techniques that now use ultrashort pulses also require the shortest possible pulses.

Conventional glass-fiber MCP technology has reached its fundamental limits in spatial and temporal resolution, fixed pattern noise, high count rate capabilities, thermal performance, yield and reproducibility, stability and lifetime. This is a unique approach based on nanoporous ceramics, which allows reaching ultra-high sub-micron resolution. Due their ceramic nature, the proposed s-MCPs are capable of processing temperatures up to 1000 degrees celsius, enabling direct integration of advanced photocathodes for expanded spectral range and sensitivity, and are also expected to have greater lifetime than those produced with existing methods. In addition ceramic s-MCPs can be produced at a much lower cost than glass MCPs. A robust ceramic structure with the required dimensions and resistance has been developed. The remaimimg challenge is\nto fabricate functional s-MCP prototypes from this structural material, along with validation of s-MCP performance.  The expected result of the proposed work is a manufacturing technology for production of commercially viable sub-microchannel plate intensifiers with better performance, longer lifetime and lower cost.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Articular repair following injury or degeneration represents a major clinical problem, with treatment modalities being limited and joint replacement being regarded as appropriate only for the older patient. Limitations in the development of novel technologies for the treatment of articular cartilage defects involve provision of a mechanically functional implant, its fixation within the defect site, and adherence to surrounding host articular cartilage and subchondral bone. The device proposed in this project is intended to overcome these major technical hurdles. The objective is to develop a chondral repair device for articular cartilage, using a hydrogel-fiber composite, formed in vivo, and adhered to the surrounding host articular cartilage. We have recently made two significant technological advances, which together provide an opportunity to develop a new, potentially minimally invasive, approach to articular repair. We have developed an acellular hydrogel-fiber composite material with mechanical properties including compressive modulus, permeability and tensile modulus that are in the range of normal adult human articular cartilage. In addition, we have a technology which causes covalent bonds to be formed between hydrogel polymer and collagen and other proteins of cartilage, providing a mechanism for stable interaction between the hydrogel-fiber implant and the surrounding host articular cartilage. The hypothesis is that an acellular composite construct (a) with mechanical properties similar to native articular cartilage can be formed, (b) adhered to native articular cartilage, and (c) provide a functional articular repair at the time of implantation. The Phase I project has successfully demonstrated the potential for this technology to lead to effective repair in vivo. The objective of the Phase II project is to demonstrate effectiveness and safety of the technology. Specific Aim 1. Complete development of the construct-adhesion technology to reduce the time required to provide the adhesive properties and polymerization of the hydrogel-scaffold construct. Specific Aim 2. Determine the effectiveness of the technology in vivo. Specific Aim 3. Determine the biocompatibility of the technology per ISO 10933. Expected Outcome. When used in vivo, the technology is expected to successfully repair articular defects in the knee, and to show good biocompatibility. If the studies are successful, the results will be used to support a submission to the FDA for initiation of a clinical trial leading to market device approval (PMA). The successful outcome of this project will be the development of a hydrogel-fiber composite construct with the demonstrated safety and effectiveness to repair articular cartilage defects. The results obtained will provide the data necessary for a regulatory submission to the FDA to market the product.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microarrays offer the potential to profile genetic alterations in a highly multiplexed format, but have suffered from sub-optimal specificity of target capture. Array technologies which improve the specificity of target capture will be of commercial value by allowing the manufacture of arrays with superior performance characteristics. We propose to develop a novel  Snap-To-It  array technology that consists of arrayed PNA and DNA probes that are conformationally constrained by an intra-molecular chelate. Binding to target results in the chelate dissociation and the probe  snapping to  the target nucleic acid in what is an all-or-none mechanism. Consistent with previous, solution phase, thermodynamic studies using  Snap-To-It  probes, we hypothesize that constrained probes immobilized on an array will exhibit superior target specificity compared to unconstrained probes. The proposed chelate motifs are easily introduced into arrays using existing standard array synthesis methods with only a few additional process steps. Further, chelate binding is orthogonal to Watson-Crick pairing, and thus will not interfere with target hybridization. Phase I demonstrated feasibility of  Snap-To-It  probes and set the stage to move into an intensive Phase II program involving the development and testing of prototype Snap-To-It arrays for cancer analysis.         DNA probes in solution and in high-throughput microarrays are invaluable tools used in areas from clinical diagnostics to fundamental research. The Snap-To-It probe technology we propose will produce microarrays with superior performance characteristics.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 6) Project Summary/Abstract The work proposed under this project is the development of a low cost, high fidelity virtual reality forklift safety trainer. There are over 1 million forklifts in operation in the United Sta\ntes, and an estimated 2 million operators (6 million including part time operators). Annually, in this country, there are over 100,000 injuries involving forklifts and every three days someone is killed in a forklift accident. Further, 1 out of every 6 wor\nkplace accidents involves a forklift. Forklifts are by far the most dangerous industrial vehicle currently in operation, and the tremendous health and safety impact of their operation is felt by everyone, including operators, floor workers, managers, custo\nmers in big box retail, and random passers-by. Experts agree that better safety training is the solution to this alarming rate of injury and fatality. This project aims to deliver a low cost, hands-on, active OSHA-compliant virtual reality safety trainer t\nhat allows trainees to operate a virtual forklift in hazardous conditions. The trainer, which employs an inexpensive video game steering wheel and joysticks to accurately simulate the controls of a forklift, is a revolutionary improvement over current trai\nning media, which includes video tapes and workbooks, both passive forms of instruction. The broad goal of this project is to reduce the injury and fatality rate in forklift use by reducing the number of accidents. OSHA already requires forklift safety tra\nining for all operators, and this goal can be accomplished by giving them a comprehensive, hands- on experience of operating a forklift in hazardous situations, in the same way the military employs flight simulation to train its pilots. The goal will be ac\nhieved by employing sophisticated virtual reality and vehicle dynamics algorithms that allow for the scaling of virtual reality technology from expensive supercomputers to commodity office PCs. Tactus has pioneered this effort by taking advantage of the en\normous computing and graphics power available on today's average desktop computer, along with the inexpensive video game hardware currently on the market, driven by the video game industry. The result of this project will be a radically improved forklift s\nafety training platform that will be the first ever mass marketed virtual reality based simulation. 7) Project Narrative (Relevance) Safe industrial machine operation affects everyone in the United States, and accidents and injuries are not limited to mach\nine operators. Forklifts, are by far the most dangerous industrial vehicles in use today, due to their high number (over 1 million) and high accident rate (1 in 6 industrial accidents affects a forklift, and there are over 100,000 injuries and 100-200 fata\nlities each year in the United States due to forklift accidents). Forklifts injure workers, pedestrians, shoppers, delivery people, and even random passers-by (joggers, for example), and their safe operation directly and indirectly constitutes a major publ\nic health issue.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heat produces analgesia through recognized physiologic mechanisms including stimulation of thermal receptors that inhibit nociception via the gate-control theory, by increasing blood flow, and by reducing muscular spasm. Similarly transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulators (TENS) reduce pain by electrically \"blocking\" pain impulses via gating of nociception. Phase I created an innovative battery operated heating device that optimized the interaction with recognized heat pathways to increase analgesic effectiveness. A control unit connected to small heating pads allowed precise management of variables such as maximum temperature of the heating pad, rate of temperature rise, and depth and duration of heating cycles. Phase I hypothesized that activation of two separate afferent \"gating\" pathways, c-fiber dependent thermo-receptor from heat and deep tissue large diameter A-beta primary afferents from TENS would produce more analgesia than either heat or TENS used separately. We further hypothesized that heat alone would be as effective as TENS alone in providing pain relief. In phase I, both hypotheses were supported in a randomized controlled clinical trial. Commercialization was advanced through the filing of patents and successful completion of the NIH Commercialization Assistance Program (CAP). Phase II will create a smaller, more user-friendly device and several types of heating elements that allow treatment of separate areas of the body, and test two hypotheses. The first hypotheses is that the higher temperature and cyclic heat supplied by the study device will be preferred to that of the low level steady heat supplied by a commercially available device, Thermacare (Procter & Gamble). It is thought that the study device will produce stronger stimulation of thermal receptors than that produced by low-level chemical heating pads. The second trial determines if the device, when added to TENS will improve pain and function in a long-term study of patients with chronic low back pain. The second hypothesis is that heat will increase the effectiveness of TENS as compared to TENS alone in a long-term randomized trial that uses both self-rating of pain and functional outcomes as endpoints. This study will parallel a classic TENS study by Deyo et al. published in 1990 in the New England Journal of Medicine. This will be tested in a separate clinical trial. Finally, we will pursue commercialization of the device through contacts made in the NIH-Commercialization Assistance Program.",

Antibiotics treat infection and often result in symptomatic relief, but do not target inflammatory parameters such as middle ear effusion (MEE), which can cause hearing loss and other complications. No therapies directly target middle ear inflammation. Targeted Gene Delivery, Inc. has identified and characterized a peptide (peptide P13) that interferes with intracellular pro-inflammatory signaling and cell activation that results from the interaction of pathogen products with immune cells. Data generated during the Phase II study demonstrated a dramatic reduction in middle ear inflammation in a murine model using heat- inactivated S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae injected simultaneously with peptide treatment. The purpose of this Phase II Competing Renewal proposal will be to generate pre-clinical efficacy and toxicity data to support an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to use peptide P13 as an anti-inflammatory therapy in AOM. We will examine peptide P13 efficacy in a clinically relevant model using viable bacteria and delayed peptide treatment.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sepsis is a disease with increasing morbidity and mortality that results from an uncontrolled inflammatory immune response initiated by the interaction of bacteria or bacterial components with host Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Bacterial-induced sepsis is associated with production of proinflammatory cytokines, expression of cell adhesion molecules, tissue damage, and in some cases death. Lipopolysaccaride (LPS) has been identified as a critical bacterial component in the pathogenesis of gram-negative sepsis. Current treatments focus on antibiotics for controlling infection and intensive care support for associated multi-organ failure. New treatment options are needed that address the unregulated inflammatory immune response. The A52R protein from vaccinia virus has been reported to inhibit production of proinflammatory cytokines in response to cell activation by a variety of TLR ligands. The protein was demonstrated to bind to intracellular signaling proteins common to TLRs. We have recently identified and characterized a peptide, termed P13, derived from the A52R protein, with similar properties as the parent protein. Studies conducted during the Phase I portion of this project demonstrated that peptide P13, i) inhibited the in vitro secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by endothelial cells and hepatocytes in response to LPS, ii) functioned in vivo to significantly reduce LPS-induced production of inflammatory mediators in the serum, and iii) enhanced survival in mice injected with LPS. The current Phase II SBIR proposal will expand these Phase I studies and define parameters for optimizing treatment with peptide P13 (specific aim #1), and provide a detailed assessment of the efficacy of peptide P13 in limiting inflammation and enhancing survival in endotoxin-induced sepsis (specific aim #2) and polymicrobial sepsis (specific aim #3). Establishing the efficacy of peptide P13 in both models of sepsis will provide a critical evaluation of the therapeutic potential of peptide P13.        New treatment options are needed for patients with bacterial-induced sepsis, a disease with increasing morbidity and mortality. We have identified a novel anti-inflammatory peptide that has demonstrated feasibility to limit inflammation and disease development in an animal model of sepsis. Our current studies will provide a critical evaluation of the therapeutic potential of this peptide as a new treatment strategy for sepsis.",

        "abstract": "Hyperspectral sensor systems are currently under consideration for applications related to monitoring the nuclear fuel cycle and other signatures of interest to the nonproliferation community.  These applications include the detection of camouflaged and concealed targets, gas plume detection and identification, and terrain classification.  Unfortunately, many of the data exploitation tools are not user-friendly and do not fully exploit all the spectral data available.  For example, hyperspectral data from different frequency bands are analyzed separately.  This project will develop technology to allow the analysis of the full spectrum, thereby increasing the probability of proper identification and reducing false alarms.  During Phase I, the requirements were analyzed and several segmentation techniques \u00c2\u00bf Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF) \u00c2\u00bf were implemented.  In addition, the extension of the current Microcorder-rule-based spectral identification algorithm to the long wave infrared (LWIR) was investigated using data collected simultaneously by visible-near-infrared/short-wave-infrared (VNIR/SWIR) and LWIR hyperspectral sensors.  In Phase II, software tools for the full spectrum analysis of hyperspectral data will be developed.  Besides ICA and NNMF, other full-spectrum, compatible analysis techniques will be implemented.  Specifically, the current Microcorder algorithm will be extended to the LWIR, so that rules for spectral matching can be applied over the full spectrum from VNIR to LWIR. These tools will be integrated into a user-friendly analysis package with other existing software, and delivered with the software components level for integration into DOE hyperspectral analysis packages.   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The software package should find application in the detection of contaminants, military target detection, and exploration geology.  With respect to the detection of contaminants, bringing together the reflection and thermal bands would offer the possibility of discriminating against false alarm sources.  For geological remote sensing, the technology could overcome the restrictions of using only the reflection-dominated portions of the spectrum, in which certain key minerals of economic importance are missed.",

A novel electron cooling section, a key component of the proposed RHIC luminosity upgrade, requires the acceleration of high-charge electron bunches with low emittance and energy spread.  A promising candidate for the electron source is the recently developed concept of a high quantum efficiency photoinjector with a diamond amplifier. However, no code is available to use for investigating such a photoinjector via computer simulations.  This project will develop numerical algorithms for the generation and transport of secondary electrons through diamond amplifiers in strong electric fields.  These algorithms will be implemented in an existing parallel three-dimensional (3D) particle-in-cell (PIC) code and then tested against experimental data.  Phase I implemented Monte Carlo models for the generation and transport of secondary electrons in diamond.  The simulation results were in agreement with published data on the number of secondary electrons generated over time.  It also was demonstrated that the code can be effectively used to simulate an electron gun of interest to RHIC.  Phase II will implement additional code to model inelastic scattering from phonons and impurities, and electron emission from diamond surfaces with negative affinity layers.  The simulation results will be verified with published theoretical/computational results and validated with available experimental data.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A code for simulating diamond amplifiers in electron photo injectors should directly benefit scientists working to design high-current electron accelerators required for cooling high-energy ion beams at the RHIC.  These capabilities will also benefit an existing PIC code that is already commercially distributed, thus increasing its potential for generating further commercial revenue.",

Although scientists use computer modeling to understand accelerators, it is difficult to achieve sufficiently accurate models of superconducting RF cavities, especially models that include cavity misalignment.  This project will combine maps of superconducting RF cavity fields (generated using a self- consistent electromagnetic calculation) with an existing particle tracking code.  The existing particle tracking code will then be capable of modeling modern accelerators, including the effects of misalignments.  In Phase I, a cavity with relevance to the International Linear Collider (ILC) was modeled using a detailed electromagnetics code, a tool for converting the detailed electromagnetic results into a map appropriate for particle tracking codes was developed, and the map was tested in a particle tracking code for ILC- relevant geometry.  Phase II will develop:  (1) a full-featured, stand-alone software library from the map generation tool, (2) interfaces with the library to electromagnetic and mapping codes, and (3) a catalog of results for cavity maps of various misalignments and higher-order mode levels.  Then, the coupled electromagnetic and mapping codes will be used to study the effects of misalignments and higher-order modes on beam dynamics in ILC- relevant structures.

        "abstract": "The next-generation particle accelerator for nuclear physics research likely will involve high-energy electron-ion collisions.  A promising candidate for the cost-efficient acceleration of high-charge electron bunches is the non-scaling fixed-field alternating gradient (FFAG) synchrotron. Existing numerical codes include only some of the key effects required for the accurate design and evaluation of non-scaling FFAG accelerators.  Therefore, this project will augment an existing code for tracking the acceleration of charged particles.  The existing code already includes special features required to handle large rectangular dipole magnets without a well-defined synchronous trajectory.  Additions to this code will include generalized magnetic fringe-field models and the self-fields of the electrons.  Phase I developed a simple, three-dimensional fringe-field model for rectangular magnets that have a horizontal gradient in the dipole field.  An optimal approach for adding space-charge effects was identified, and a simple two-dimensional model was implemented.  The enhanced code was used to simulate an existing accelerator design.  Phase II will extend the simple 3D magnet model to more general magnets, including curved magnets.  A fully-parallel 3D space-charge model will be implemented and the tracking operations will be parallelized.  The resulting code will be used for detailed parameter scans of possible designs for non-scaling FFAGs, and will include misalignment effects, magnet mispowerings, multipole errors, fringe fields, and space-charge.

During Phase I, the research team demonstrated that an interactive multimedia language learning tool was an effective way to acquire proficiency in a foreign language. Phase II development aims to elaborate the software in three target languages - Chinese, Russian, and Spanish - for comprehensive testing in New York area hospitals and medical education institutions. Criteria for evaluation include qualitative data based on healthcare professionals' acquisition of target language skills, as well as their qualitative feedback throughout the course of their studies. In light of the significant and growing LEP populations in America, health institutions and their personnel face an increasing need for language- and culture-based solutions to effectively communicate with the patients they serve. Despite legislation to overcome these obstacles, language assistance to LEP patients remains inadequate, a reality that is felt by both patients in their low levels of satisfaction with their healthcare and providers in compromised care and inflated costs due to miscommunication. Currently, there is a lack of medical-context language resources available to healthcare providers, in spite of their overwhelming interest to better serve their patients. By using healthcare- focused language study software to acquire skills in the languages spoken by their LEP patients, providers will improve communication with their patients, and thus effectively respond to their needs and make better-informed decisions. In turn, patients will be more satisfied with their care due to increased knowledge of the system, and will be more empowered to maintain healthy lives.",

Transfer Devices, Inc. is the pioneer, and has significant intellectual property, in transfer lithography. The product driver for this application is the MxL (molecular transfer lithography) template. It is a consumable, one-time-per-use item that forms patterns by bonding patterned resist layers onto a substrate surface, with subsequent water dissolution of the template. MxL is a non-imprint, non-photolithography process that solves the defect propagation problem of contract printing, and is applied for large area, conformal printing at low costs and high throughput. The proposal seeks to optimize the replication of MxL templates, and coordination with an advanced adaptive alignment system, to achieve unprecedented overlay and high resolution patterning for high throughput next generation lithography of integrated circuits and photonic devices. The reason for the success\nof the proposed solution is a technologically superior solution of that of alternative approaches by combining low-cost, environmentally friendly processing with defect free conformal printing over large areas at high throughput rates. MxL (molecular transfer lithography) is a patent protected unique process using a water dissolvable sacrificial polymer template. This advanced process is coordinated with an adaptive alignment scheme to produce state-of-the-art registration with sub-50 nm features at sub-20 nm placement capability.  Commercially, the proposed process and technological solution will significantly advanced the capability to manufacture nano-technological devices for a wide range of applications including integrated circuits, solar wafers, displays, data storage, MEMS, as well as emerging areas in photonics, high brightness LED's, optoelectronics, life sciences, and nanotechnology.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hydrocephalic shunt dysfunction diagnosis is one of the most complicated and time consuming aspects of treating hydrocephalic infants and young children, since preverbal children cannot describe such critical symptoms as persistent headaches. One must instead rely on observable symptoms that often resemble those of common childhood illnesses. As a result, suspected shunt dysfunction often requires emergency room admission with invasive, costly and often inconclusive diagnostic tests, yet it is estimated that the shunt is actually working properly two out of three visits. From an engineering perspective, a properly functioning drainage shunt should function as drainage tubing with a physician-selected pressure/flow characteristic. One could greatly improve outcomes and reduce patient/parental stress if doctors could non-invasively measure shunt tubing CSF flow over a range of posture-induced pressures to confirm the desired pressure/flow relationship, as an adjunct to assessing shunt patency and shunt under/overdrainage. Transonic Systems, Vygon Neuro and the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin will address this need by developing flow sensor modules that can be connected to standard shunt tubing sets. One version is an implantable, transcutaneously-powered/measured flow sensor module that is chronically spliced into standard shunt tubing exterior to the skull. A second version is an extracorporeal flow sensor that be connected to standard shunt and extra-ventricular drain tubing, and that can be used as a diagnostic tool during shunt revisions, or as a real-time monitoring tool to measure patient CSF flow during post-surgical recovery. These modules will measure dynamic shunt volumetric flow by sending transit-time ultrasonic pulses through the module wall. This extra-luminar design ensures that transducers never contact CSF, and that the module can be integrated with existing shunt systems. Phase-I bench/in-vivo studies validated the flow monitor's innovative concept, extraordinary flow resolution and adequate accuracy. These results will drive a Phase-II program to develop a fully implantable unit suitable for animal validation and initial clinical studies. More than 125,000 US citizens suffer from hydrocephalus - a condition demanding lifelong treatment using implanted shunt systems to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Shunt dysfunction is a common occurrence - with 15,000 USA inpatient admissions per year at an average cost of $28,500 per admission, at a cost of $427.5M per annum. Children are at particular risk for shunt problems, with 25-40% of first implantations failing within a year. Currently there is no objective method for quickly and easily diagnosing shunt dysfunction - and the proposed research aims to develop the first implantable shunt flow sensor that can perform this analysis in both pediatric and adult hydrocephalus patients.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In many aspects the rat is a better animal model than the mouse for functional genomic studies. The physiology and drug metabolism of rats and humans are more similar than that of mice and humans. The rat is larger than the mouse, making many studies easier to perform and sampling more accurate. The recent completion of the Brown Norway rat genome improves further the potential of the rat as an excellent organism for studying human diseases. Unfortunately, many genetic manipulation techniques available in the mouse such as random mutagenesis with a gene trap (both retroviral-based and non-retroviral-based), gene knock- outs, gene knock-ins, and conditional mutations have not been possible in the rat because there is no way to effectively harvest and culture rat embryonic stem cells. Existing methods for producing gene deletions in rats, including cloning and chemical mutation, are inefficient and not practical. This deficiency leads to a severe bottleneck in our ability to create rat models of human disease. The product that will arise from this proposal will be rats with single gene knockouts for use as models of human disease in research and drug discovery (MutaRat Animal Models). Transposagen has developed a novel technology, based on human L1 retrotransposons, to generate animals with a high rate of random gene mutations in germ cells.In MutaRats, mutagenesis will occur in sperm and oocytes and some offspring will contain single gene disruptions. These offspring can be used to establish authentic gene knockout rat lines. In Phase I we successfully developed and characterized MutaMice, generating 22 potential founders.We have subsequently developed similar \"mutator\" founder rats (MutaRats), and in Phase II, we intend to characterize these rats, and use them to generate rats with stable, singe gene deletions (gene knockout MutaRat Animal Models). Specific aim 1 isto screen existing MutaRatfounder lines to determine the line with the highest frequency of mutation. This line will then be bred to establish a breeding colony that can be used to obtain single gene knockout rats in Specific Aim 2. We do not intend to characterize the phenotypes of these lines, nor to establish breeding colonies of individual knockout rat linesas part of this proposal, but instead to establish a sperm bank comprising sequenced insertional gene disruptions, the MutaRat Germ Line Resource. In Specific Aim 3 we will develop the MutaRat Germ Line Resourceof cryopreserved sperm from rats with single gene knockouts. We estimate that we will have a sperm bank with at least 100 different gene knockouts by the endof this project in December, 2008. This MutaRat Germ Line Resource will be the only technology capable of creating and rapidly mapping random gene knockouts in rats. Knockout ratswill be provided to the academic community in accordance with the NIH policy on sharing of model organisms for biomedical research and will be distributed by the National Rat Resource and Research Center. In Phase III, we will establish a distribution partnership with an existing laboratory animal company to market, establish and validate (as necessary), and distribute these lines, and others as they are developed. The innovation of this proposal is the use of a novel retrotransposon technology to create the only system able to rapidly create and map insertional deletions in the rat and other mammals. This technology is expected to offer significant advantages in cost and speed when compared with existing mutagenesis systems available in mice, and to generate novel gene knockout models that have not previously been available in any vertebrate. Transposagen's MutaRat Animal Models will contribute to human health by providing new vertebrate models of disease for studying pathogenesis and for discovery and development of pharmaceutical compounds.",

To increase the speech recognition accuracy, four techniques are employed: 1) Spellation where the users have to speak and partially spell the words as they dictate, 2) VoiceTap which requires that, for each character, the user says that character and the following character in the alphabet, 3) Voice Predict where the user has to say the word and input the first character of the word using the keyboard or VoiceTap, and 4) multi-modal speech to text, where the user speaks and uses the keyboard simultaneously. The research effort will focus on developing modules that allow speech to be dictated using a combination of whole words and spelled words.  The outcome of the proposed research has significant commercial\npotential.

Titania (TiO2) has a refractive index of 2.68 and the admixture of TiO2 with a polymer would result in an increase of the refractive index. The well-known problem of excessive optical scattering will be overcome by proper use of surfactants and an encapsulation structure that employs thin films, with a thickness that is less than the average distance between scattering events.  If successful the development of a new high-index encapsulant will have a tremendous impact on SSL technology because virtually all SSL devices made of inorganic semiconductors are packaged and encapsulated.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With recent unsettling events foreshadowing an increased sense of urgency, NIAID has targeted research and development of therapeutics, vaccines, adjuvants/immunostimulants, and diagnostics for smallpox (variola). TSRL was granted a Phase I SBIR to explore prodrug strategies to increase the oral availability of potential anti-smallpox drugs. Strategies that can improve the oral bioavailability of approved drugs as well as potential drug candidates will facilitate the development of more effective antiviral agents and reduce undesirable outcomes such as drug toxicity, poor patient compliance, and high costs. The long-term goal of this project for biodefense is to improve the oral absorption of potent, but poorly absorbed anti-pox agents by designing prodrugs targeted to transporters expressed in human intestine and able to be activated by endogenous esterases or amidases that release the absorbed drug in vivo from its prodrug form. For this project, we established collaborations with Prof. Charles McKenna (prodrug design and synthesis) at the University of Southern California and Prof. John Drach (virological studies) at the University of Michigan. The work in the Phase I project focused chiefly on prodrugs of cyclic cidofovir (cHPMPC), a broad spectrum antiviral compound with potent activity against variola and other orthopox viruses, but of limited value in a smallpox epidemic due to its very low oral bioavailability. We demonstrated that dipeptide prodrugs of cHPMPC, which were first discovered in Prof. McKenna's laboratory, have great potential for oral delivery. Our results from an animal oral bioavailability model indicate that absorption of the first generation of dipeptide prodrugs is up to an order of magnitude greater than that of the parent drug cHPMPC, and that a significant fraction of the absorbed prodrug is converted to drug in vivo. In this Phase II SBIR proposal, we have devised a synthetic strategy and SAR plan to optimize the bioavailability of this new class of prodrug. We have formed a collaborative network of researchers and specialists that will allow us to systematically test a diverse library of novel cHPMPC dipeptide conjugates for stability, transport, drug oral bioavailability, and efficacy in accepted animal models. The compound or compounds showing the best oral absorption and efficacy will be manufactured following GMP requirements and tested for toxicity. The combined portfolio of pharmacokinetic, metabolism, manufacturing and toxicological data will be used in support of an IND and future clinical testing.        The long term objective of this project is to make new oral drugs for the treatment of small pox. The expertise needed to succeed in this project will be provided by personnel at TSRL, Inc. in collaboration with Dr. John Drach, an expert in the area of antiviral drugs at the University of Michigan, and Dr. Charles Mckenna at the University of Southern California, who is well experienced at organic and medicinal chemistry of phosphorous containing compounds.",

        "abstract": "Currently, ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), which generally are lighter and more thermally stable than their metallic counterparts, are under evaluation for use in industrial gas turbine engines.  The use of CMC could permit higher operating temperatures and reduced cooling, thereby contributing to higher fuel efficiency and lower NOx and CO emissions.  State-of-the-art oxide-based composites require a thermal protection system (TPS) coating to mitigate the thermal gradients endured by the material during exposure.  However, this coating can delaminate or erode, leading to exposure of the underlying composite, which contains a mullite-based fiber that is prone to attack in a moist combustion environment.  This project will develop a non-silica-containing composite with a TPS that is integral and fabricated in situ.  This oxide-based composite design will be resistant to environmental attack on the hot side, and will support a low thermal gradient on the cold side to minimize thermal stresses.  In Phase I, a compositionally graded oxide matrix composite was exposed in a simulated combustion environment for 100 hours.  The results provided a clear direction for Phase II, in which two different composite design options will be evaluated.  The optimal design will be down-selected based on mechanical and thermal property data.  Subscale components of the functionally graded composite material will be fabricated and tested in a subscale test facility, and then a full-scale component will be fabricated and tested.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The functionally graded oxide matrix composite should resist degradation in the moisture-containing combustion environments that exist in high temperature gas turbine engines, providing significant economic and environmental benefits.  The market for industrial gas turbine engine applications is expected to grow over the next decade, due to the closing of aging coal plants and the need for increased global power demands, particularly in Asia.  The materials also would have potential use in propulsion-related applications in the industrial, military, and commercial sectors.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project concerns Ultrapure Water (UPW), the life blood of the semiconductor industry. The proposed instrument seeks to satisfy the ITRS requirements on two counts: 1. full flow inspection, and 2. detection of sub-100nm liquid-borne particles. 1. A typical semiconductor fab uses about 3 million gallons of UPW every day, and the ITRS, in its attempt to conserve the precious resource, water, mandates that 90% of UPW be recycled/reused by 2010. The recycled UPW loop will need full flow monitoring, which the proposed Particle Scout will do. 2. The purity of UPW directly affects the chip yield, because the final operation on wafers is UPW rinse and any contaminants present in the UPW contaminate the wafers it rinses. As the industry moves to sub-100 nm nodes the ITRS particle detection requirements fall to sub-50 nm. Particle Scout for monitoring in real-time the particulate purity of recycled UPW for use in Semiconductor processing successfully overcomes a critical technological barrier facing the IC manufacturing\nindustry today. Beyond IC manufacturing industry it will find applications in all enterprises where UPW is used: Power generation, Nuclear Reactors, Pharmaceutical industry, Biotechnology, Space exploration, and processing of Advanced high purity chemicals.",

        "abstract": "In 2001, lighting was estimated to consume 8.2 quads (approximately 762 TWh), or about 22% of the total electricity generated in the U.S.  New, high-efficiency, solid-state light sources, such as light emitting diodes (LEDS) and organic LEDs (OLEDs), are needed to help reduce the ever increasing demand for energy.  In particular, OLEDs represent a potentially inexpensive diffuse source that could compete directly with conventional incandescent light sources.  However, improvements in the overall efficiency of these devices will be required before they become commercially viable.  This project will develop novel, high-efficiency OLED fixtures to replace short lifetime 12 lm/W incandescent sources, and hence reduce overall energy consumption in the U.S.  In Phase I, a white OLED, containing only two emitters, was demonstrated with an efficacy of 34 lm/W at a forward luminance of 800 cd/m2.  The device had a CIE = (0.38, 0.37), a color rendering index (CRI) of 71, and a correlated color temperature of 3,900 K.  Phase II will demonstrate white OLEDs that will have a CRI greater than75 and an efficacy of 60 lm/W at 1,000 cd/m2.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The technology should permit  OLEDs to become cost effective in general lighting applications.  Today, OLED technology is the leading emerging technology for flat panel displays (FPDs), with recent product introductions in cell phones.  Many of these same features should make OLED technology of great interest to the solid-state lighting community.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objectives of this proposed Phase II SBIR project are to refine the SurinateTM disposable valved intraurethral catheter to make it easier for the patient to operate, more reliable and easier to insert and extract than the prototype that was tested in the Phase I SBIR feasibility study. The effectiveness and safety of the refined design will be demonstrated in a pilot clinical study. Surinate(tm) is intended to treat chronic male urinary retention (such as that caused by spinal cord injury and neurological diseases) and acute male urinary retention (such as that caused by prostrate hypertrophy). The valved catheter is controllable by the patient and will be an innovative treatment alternative for users of Foley and intermittent catheters, allowing patients the freedom to urinate at their convenience, thereby improving the quality of life for an estimated 375,000 men who must deal with chronic urinary retention due to spinal cord injury (SCI), late-stage multiple sclerosis, and other neurological conditions. Despite improvements in medical care, these patients continue to experience significant morbidity related to their urinary tracts. Much of this morbidity is due to the limitations of indwelling, intermittent and external catheter technology, which has not significantly improved in decades. Surinate(tm) offers many of the benefits of intermittent catheterization, but should be much easier to use and cause significantly fewer urinary tract problems. The Surinate(tm) valved catheter is designed to be easily inserted into the urethra without surgery, extracted easily, and replaced every 28 days. The Phase I feasibility study demonstrated that the valve was mechanically reliable, and that the valved catheter could be inserted successfully without surgery and remained stable in the urethra. Although there were a tolerable number of adverse events, none was serious or unanticipated. Improvements are intended to make the insertion procedure simpler; the valved catheter easier for the patient to operate; increase flow rate; and simplify removal using the extraction tool. The objectives of the Phase II effort are to: (1) develop and manufacture prototype units; (2) conduct design verification testing to demonstrate that desired performance characteristics have been achieved with the prototypes; (3) transfer manufacturing of the Surinate(tm) devices to an FDA- approved contract manufacturer that meets ISO 13485 standards, (4) perform laboratory verification testing of the manufactured devices at Urovalve, Inc., (5) Finalize Case Report Forms and Informed Consent ; obtain approval from FDA for an Investigational Device Exemption and Institutional Review Board approval to conduct the human clinical under the protocol that has been written in collaboration with the Boston VA Healthcare System and (6) conduct the Phase II pilot clinical to demonstrate safe and effective operation of all components in both clinical and home-use settings. Up to 40 male veterans with SCI will be screened to have 20 patients complete a crossover study to compare the effectiveness and safety of the Surinate(tm) disposable intraurethral valved-catheter to intermittent catheterization during a 30 day period (14 days using each device). RESEACH & RELATED: Other Project Information Item 7: Project Narrative The Surinate(tm) catheter system will bring dramatic improvement to the health and qualify of life for many individuals who suffer urinary retention, including those due to spinal cord injury. No devices currently available or known to be in development for patients who suffer urinary retention combine the utility, ease of use, and health benefits and cost effectiveness of SurinateTM. The SurinateTM catheterization system offers solutions to the problems of quality of life, urinary tract infections, and substantial reliance on healthcare workers associated with the existing catheters. Neither urologists nor patients consider currently available devices to be satisfactory to the patients' comfort, cost of care, or medical performance.",

The distributed feedback lasers currently used in 10 Gigabit Ethernet transceivers are fabricated using an expensive, low-yield, epitaxial re-growth process. The drawbacks of this method are the high cost of the capital equipment and of the manufacturing process. In addition, the lower yields encountered with the multiple regrowths required to fabricate complex photonic circuits make cost-effective integrated photonic components difficult to achieve. A novel laser diode design and high-yield manufacturing method that will enable the fabrication of low-cost wavelength-selective and tunable laser diodes for optical communications has been developed. This research will refine the design and fabricate both discrete and integrated devices for 10 Gigabit Ethernet applications.  The major scientific and technical benefit of this work is an improved method for fabricating lasers and other\noptoelectronic devices. The work should also result in arrays of novel, wavelength selectable lasers suitable for use in high-speed data communications applications. The main societal impact will be the increased availability of low-cost, high-speed data communications, which is a significant contributor to economic development. Making lower cost lasers will enable a significant reduction in the cost of transceivers, which will increase the rate at which high speed Ethernet penetrates the data network.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The development of a small animal model to study human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection would significantly facilitate studies of disease pathogenesis, as well as vaccine and anti-viral drug development and testing. However, HIV-1 replication is subjected to a number of species-specific restrictions at the level of cellular entry and/or post-entry. To date, no satisfactory small animal model for HIV-1 infection has been identified. The cotton rat has been a superb model for human infectious diseases. This animal is susceptible to an extraordinary spectrum of human pathogens, particularly viruses. Inspired by these observations, we have cloned and characterized a battery of more than 270 cotton rat genes of immunological and inflammatory importance, and reagents for their detection have been developed. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) was shown to infect cotton rats and infectious virus was transmitted from animal to animal by blood with low efficiency. In new studies developed during the Phase I of this SBIR, we have demonstrated that cotton rat cells expressing human co-receptors for HIV-1 (hCD4 with hCXCR4 or hCD4 with hCCR5) support HIV-1 infection (by kinetic experiments that measured the production of p24gag in cotton rat infected cells) and DNA integration (by cloning experiments that isolated chimeric DNA containing HIV-1 DNA sequences linked to cotton rat DNA sequences from infected cotton rat cells). Furthermore, we have shown that cotton rat cells are able to produce infective particles that can infect fresh human PBMCs. The data presented in our Progress Report indicate that the main blockage for HIV replication in cotton rat cells occurs during viral entrance and that it could be circumvented by the expression of HIV-1 co-receptors. Due to our success in demonstrating the feasibility of the model in vitro during phase I, our goal in phase II is to produce line(s) of transgenic cotton rats expressing hCD4 with hCXCR4 and hCD4 with hCCR5 molecules and test them for their infectivity to HIV-1. An HIV-1-permissive cotton rat could be widely used by the research community. The hypothesis to be tested is that cotton rats (S. hispidus) after engineered to produce HIV-1 co-receptors will be permissive to productive HIV-1 infection. We will test our hypothesis by producing lines of transgenic animals expressing hCD4 with hCCR5 and hCD4 with hCXCR4. Finaly, we will Test these transgenic lines of cotton rats in infection protocols using HIV-1. At the completion of the work proposed for phase II of this SBIR, we will have produced several lines of transgenic cotton rat expressing human co-receptors for HIV-1. Most importantly, we will have characterized these lines of animals in ex vivo and in vivo experiments An estimated 5 million people became infected with HIV worldwide in 2003, and as many as 3 million died from AIDS, according to the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). The total number of infected people worldwide is estimated at 40 million (and 600 new infections per hour). Preventive vaccine and prophylactic therapies against HIV infection and more efficient drugs for AIDS are not only urgently needed but they are also scientifically possible. However, one of the major obstacles in translational HIV research rests in the absence of inexpensive and efficient pre-clinical trial models. This is reflected in the fact that the 30 vaccine candidates that are currently being tested in clinical trials in 21 countries (only 2 have advanced to clinical phase III efficacy trials) are very similar to each other with nearly all based on only one hypothesis (protection by eliciting a cell mediated immune response), while other strong alternative hypotheses have been largely neglected (vaccines that induce neutralizing antibodies and live attenuated vaccines) due to monetary and logistic impediment to test a greater number of candidates in preclinical settings. Thus, several potential vaccines and therapeutics turn out to be buried in laboratory notebooks because the institutions where they were developed cannot afford to continue with non-human primate trials. The lack of a small animal model for HIV infection that can be used for screening a larger variety of candidates in preclinical studies is one of the most evident obstacles to speed up the process of developing HIV vaccines and AIDS therapies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Americans are living longer and driving more. Furthermore, older adults are more prone to crashes than any other age group except inexperienced drivers. However, a recent and growing body of literature has demonstrated that older drivers at risk for crashing can be identified with a brief screening battery and once identified, cognitive skills important for safe driving can be improved. In particular, Speed of Processing, as measured by the UFOV(r) test, is highly predictive of future crash involvement. In addition, improvements in visual processing speed have been shown to directly improve on-the-road driving performance, thereby enhancing and preserving mobility in later life. Traditionally, such improvements in visual processing speed have been achieved through training on a set of computer exercises with the guidance of a certified trainer. The purpose of this Fast Track application is to develop and validate an enhanced self-administered interactive variation of these validated training techniques. Therefore the specific aims of this Fast Track application are: Phase 1: 1) Develop an enhanced self-administered interactive version of Speed of Processing training for use by individuals who demonstrate elevated crash risk during a Fitness to Drive assessment currently being used by State Farm Insurance Company in Alabama. 2) Evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of this training software through an interactive focus group process to achieve acceptability, and a laboratory based test to demonstrate effectiveness of the new software relative to the trainer guided method. 3) Establish the mechanisms for a large-scale evaluation of the training product. Phase II: Conduct a state-wide evaluation of the training product in Alabama. To this end, we will continue to work with State Farm to assist us in evaluating the new training product on a large sample (minimum N=1000) of adults aged 75 and older with high-risk status. Specifically we will 1) examine the proportion of individuals achieving low-risk status post-training and 2) examine the effectiveness of the training in lowering crash risk and insurance claims, relative to a) individuals who are low-risk at baseline, b) individuals who are high risk at baseline but decline to undergo training, as well as by c) comparing crash occurrence. Relevance: The public health benefits of this project are clear. By developing a method for older adults to improve the cognitive skills important for safe driving without the help of a trainer, the cost of implementing such training on a broad scale can be reduced, availability of training increased, and long term safety, mobility, and quality of life improved.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcoholism and alcohol abuse are the most common forms of drug abuse and effect about 8% of the U.S. population at a cost of approximately $184 billion a year. Current treatment generally consists of psychosocial therapies aimed at rehabilitation and reducing alcohol-associated problems and pharmacotherapy with a limited number of approved drugs. While current treatment can be effective in reducing alcohol consumption, it is estimated that 40-70% of patients return to excessive drinking within a year after treatment. This is partly due to the modest effectiveness of currently approved medications and their side effects, which contribute to poor compliance with their use. Clearly, there is a need to develop more effective drugs. A large body of preclinical data available through studies of mice deficient in PKC_epsilon and rats treated with a peptide inhibitor of PKC_epsilon provides a strong case for development of PKC_epsilon inhibitors to reduce alcohol self-administration and pain associated with alcoholic polyneuropathy. In addition, evidence indicates that PKC_epsilon inhibitors could be useful for the treatment of anxiety, which is commonly associated with alcoholism and may contribute to excessive drinking. This proposal is focused on the preclinical development of a novel class of small organic compounds that act as inhibitors of the enzyme PKC_epsilon. Currently, there are no selective inhibitors of PKC_epsilon that can be administered systemically and cross the blood-brain barrier. Based on combined multi-property computational modeling and wet-lab verification in our Phase I SBIR study, a water soluble small organic molecule, VMD-C620 was identified as an effective and relatively selective \"allosteric\" PKC_epsilon inhibitor acting reversibly and noncompetitively with ATP and substrate. VMD-C620 was also shown to be efficacious in an experimental animal model of alcoholic polyneuropathy and exhibited high specificity when assayed against related kinases, including the highly related PKC_epsilon. Its distinctive molecular scaffold is very amenable to modification and optimization by medicinal and computational chemistries. These unique properties make VMD-C620 an excellent candidate to be further derived, optimized and developed for the potential treatment of alcohol use disorders. The project proposed here is to develop more potent derivatives of VMD-C620 and study them in preclinical pharmacokinetic and animal disease models relevant to alcohol use disorders. This work will form the basis for future studies, which will complete preclinical development to allow testing of a novel PKC_epsilon inhibitor in humans as a new and improved agent for treatment of alcohol use disorders.",

The device will be most useful for newly or completely blind individuals, especially in unfamiliar, hazardous, or unsanitary environments. Based on an innovative infrared distance-sensing technology, the proposed Feel-Beyond-Fingers device has several significant advantages that make it unique among solutions for blind users. The Phase l project began with a Focus Group activity at subcontractor Arizona Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired (ACBVI). A proof of concept device was fabricated and tested after detailed packaging and electronics design. Visually impaired participants used the device in simulated everyday scenarios at ACBVI. The participants showed a high level of enthusiasm for the device. In Phase II, the completed SBIR project will result in a device whose effectiveness has been evaluated by users in everyday life, over an extended period of time. Commercialization will produce an attractively priced product that will enable enhanced participation in a wider range of social, vocational, and educational activities. The proposed Feel Beyond Fingers (FBF) device provides an important function that is of interest to a significant portion of the blind and visually impaired population, which currently numbers about 3 million individuals. The proposed device would be of greatest interest to the totally blind, who lack most visual cues about the immediate environment. This is estimated to be about 200,000 people in the U.S. In agreement with previous data, the Phase I user evaluations found that these users face significant issues in locating small and large objects, getting around in social situations, and avoiding inadvertent contact with objects in the environment. The low cost of the production device will also make the technology accessible to a much wider range of people than higher-cost object detection and range-finding technologies.",

        "abstract": "Synchrotron radiation (SR) has become a widespread tool across a broad spectrum of forefront science.  However, with advances in the brightness of synchrotron radiation sources, a wide gap has developed between the ability of these sources to deliver high photon fluxes and the ability of detectors to measure the resulting photon, electron, or ion signals.  In a number of cases, expensive beamlines are limited by the lack of suitable fast X-ray imaging systems.  This project will develop a radiation-hard, sub-nsec, pixelated, thinned (10 \u00c2\u00b5m), monolithic, Si avalanche photodiode (APD) array as an SR detector for time-resolved photon counting measurements of spatial intensity distributions.  In Phase I, prototype back-illuminated APDs of varying thickness and pixel dimension were fabricated using silicon-on-insulator (SOI) silicon wafers engineered for high gain, low dark current, and low excess noise avalanche gain.  Using the results of detailed modeling and simulation, the design of the APD array was optimized and used to procure SOI wafers, which were custom engineered with electrically activated dopants.  A 100 x 100 mm2 pixel architecture (including low noise amplifier, two-level discriminator, and two user-enabled 16-bit counters) was designed.  A fully functional prototype will be fabricated in Phase II.   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  In addition to synchrotron X-ray science, highly-efficient, back-illuminated APD detectors should have a wide variety of applications in astronomy, fluorescence microscopy, electron microscopy, semiconductor test, soft X-ray spectroscopy, hybrid image intensifier tubes, DNA sequencing, laser radar (LADAR) assisted autonomous navigation, and cruise control.",

        "abstract": "Leveraging the successful Phase I SBIR program, a 24-month effort is proposed to optimize and demonstrate a high thermoelectric Figure-of-Merit (ZT) nanocrystal quantum dot (NQD) thermoelectric (TE) material, which will  have thermal efficiency properties far better than traditional bulk thermoelectric materials. In the proposed work, a series of TE devices will be fabricated from solidified NQD films formed from colloidally synthesized NQDs using consolidation and second phase precipitation. The increase of ZT, is dependent on quantum confinement of electrons and holes, as well as the phonon dynamics and transport of the materials. If the size of a semiconductor is smaller than the mean free path of phonons and larger than that of electrons or holes, one can reduce thermal conductivity by boundary scattering without affecting electrical transport. Although charge transport in thermoelectricity is almost monoenergetic (energy levels within a few kT around the Fermi energy), heat transport by phonons is broadband over the Brillouin zone. The significance of the opportunity is the ability to colloidally-manufacture, high performance, conformal, thin film TE materials, free from the lattice and other constraints of MBE growth.",

To prevent morbidity, such as brain damage, from metabolic diseases such as phenylketonuria or congenital hypothyroidism, it is critical that the screening results be obtained in a timely fashion. A persistent and well-documented problem for the newborn screening programs has been the arrival of inadequate blood card samples at the testing laboratories. These result in expensive recall testing and introduce a dangerous delay in the diagnosis of disease. This project will develop an imaging based system for the evaluation of blood cards to determine if they are adequate. Use of such a system at a birthing center will allow for the immediate correction of the problem, saving health care dollars and preventing any unnecessary delay in the diagnosis of important metabolic diseases. This project will result the development of a simple and economically advantageous computer based system for point of care use to determine if newborn screening blood sample cards are adequate for testing. This will allow for the immediate correction of inadequate cards prior to being sent to the lab for testing and while the newborn is still at the birthing center. The goal is to reduce dangerous delays in testing that can lead to avoidable morbidity and mortality associated with late diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obstructive sleep apnea affects about 3-4% of the population including children. There is considerable associated morbidity and mortality. In particular there is a strong association with hypertension and cardiac disease. Daytime somnolence leads to increased traffic accidents and decreased worker production. The key diagnostic testing for this condition is overnight sleep testing or nocturnal polysomnography. Despite the seriousness of this medical condition about 80% of those afflicted are undiagnosed. This is due, in part, to the expense and lack of availability of standard polysomnography. This has lead to a great deal of interest in the development of portable testing systems that provide economical, readily available and accurate testing for obstructive sleep apnea at home. We propose a single type of sensor based monitoring system that would provide a reliable and simple to use unit that should allow for economical and efficient home testing. Although we propose the use of a single sensor to allow for a simple to use system, we incorporate data analysis methods that will allow for the recovery of four independent metrics for prediction of obstructive sleep apnea. This should allow for a more accurate testing system than current portable systems. Since the proposed system will correct the major problems with portable sleep testing instruments (practical, mechanical and provide multiple metrics for diagnostic accuracy), we anticipate that this project would result in a successful commercial product. This project will result the development of a simple to use, at-home technology for the diagnosis of sleep apnea. This is important since sleep apnea is a common and serious disorder afflicting 3-4% of the population and contributes significantly to heart disease and stroke. Sleep apnea also is implicated in a tremendous cost from work related problems and car accidents. Despite this nearly 90-95% of sleep apnea patients are not diagnosed, in part, due to the expense and difficulty of providing laboratory sleep studies.",

The trace element analyzer can be used in research clinic settings where patients undergo study and treatment for major diseases. Abnormal levels of bio-essential metals (iron, copper, zinc) as well as toxic, non- essential trace elements (mercury, lead, cadmium, arsenic) are known to be associated with many health disorders such as cancer, cognitive impairment, and neurological symptoms. The involvement of metals is well established in most neurodegenerative pathologies. For example, excess serum copper is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, and Wilson's disease. Brain iron accumulation is associated with several neurological disorders, some rare like aceruloplasminemia, and others common such as AD and Parkinson's disease (PD). In spite of their recognized importance, metals are not routinely monitored or tracked in the body. This is due in large part to the difficulty and expense of trace metal measurements in body fluids. Laboratories certified for such measurements are limited in number and regional in distribution.

The applicability for such a machine is vast and includes testing lead levels in children, screening for mercury poisoning, assessing iron levels in patients with iron- overload disease (e.g., hemochromatosis, pantothenate kinase II deficiency), monitoring patients undergoing chelation therapy, and conducting a heavy metal screen for people with dementia or other neurodegenerative diseases.",

The rapid progression of symptoms and potentially devastating effect of these diseases necessitate early recognition and immediate treatment. The large number of potential organisms involved, the fact that some infections are self-limiting while others may have potentially fatal outcome, complicates diagnosis and treatment. The goal of the proposed work is to develop an assay that will simultaneously detect all the common meningitis and encephalitis pathogens typically seen in a medical facility in the US. The potential pathogens will be amplified in a multiplexed PCR from a single cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) sample and detected on an array containing pathogen-specific probes that fluoresce on hybridization. In Phase I we have shown that a Pleiades probe immobilized to a hydrogel electronic NanoChip array cartridge fluoresces when hybridized to its complementary amplified target with signal to background ratios significantly better than any comparable immobilized probe. It was shown that the immobilized probe could distinguish between match, single-mismatch and double-mismatched amplified targets. In Phase II the common meningitis and encephalitis pathogens responsible for disease in the US will be identified. Primer pairs will be developed for amplification of each meningitis and encephalitis target, multiplexed to allow the detection of each target in a single CSF amplified sample. The proposed Phase II work will allow the simultaneous detection of about 90% of the pathogens typically seen in a US medical facility in contrast to about 45% of the organisms currently confirmed clinically. The proposed meningitis and encephalitis panel will be the first available in a clinical laboratory to assist diagnosis and treatment.         The goal of the proposed Phase II project is to develop an array for the rapid detection of the common pathogens involved in meningitis and encephalitis in the US. This will enable the rapid differentiate of organisms that cause self-limiting disease from those with potentially fatal outcome.",

        "abstract": "This Phase II Small Business Innovation Research project will deliver an innovative hydrogen passivation technique for improving manufacturability and performance of HgCdTe infrared detectors. Photon-Assisted Hydrogenation (PAH) causes the substrate to be hydrogenated by simultaneous exposure to hydrogen gas and ultra-violet (UV) light which allows hydrogen to diffuse into and become a permanent part of the substrate. In Phase I the feasibility of PAH for the fabrication of high-performance near-infrared HgCdTe avalanche photodiode (APD) arrays on large-area silicon wafers was demonstrated. In Phase II PAH will be optimized for fabrication of HgCdTe infrared sensors from a variety of sources.  The PAH process will not only create a new product line of high-performance HgCdTe/Si-based APDs, but may also provide a means to effect significantly higher yields, and thus lower costs for all manufacturers of HgCdTe-based detectors. PAH technology will enable all HgCdTe infrared device manufacturers to grow on Silicon wafers, significantly reducing the cost of these\nhigh value systems, and making them more generally available for a broad range of currently unaffordable applications, including civil transport, aviation, medical and robotic vision systems. Derivatives of the this technique may be applied to the manufacture of a variety of other optoelectronic semiconductor devices requiring passivation to mitigate defects.",

This project will develop a novel, low-cost, hydrogen membrane with improved durability for the production of high-purity hydrogen from coal-derived syngas.  The use of such membranes in water-gas-shift membrane reactors for hydrogen generation from coal offer the advantages of: (1) generating more hydrogen in a single shift reactor, (2) simplifying or completely eliminating downstream hydrogen separation and purification processes, and (3) producing a high-pressure carbon dioxide-rich stream that can be sequestered to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  This project will develop hydrogen permeable membranes that possess high hydrogen permeability, high hydrogen selectivity, high tolerance to impurities, and low materials cost.  The membrane technology will be applicable to coal-derived syngas streams that contain sulfur and halides.  In Phase I, defect-free metal membranes with thicknesses less than 100 microns were fabricated. The permeabilities of the membranes were measured in the presence of hydrogen and common coal-derived syngas impurities.  Stable membrane performance in the presence of these impurities was demosntrated.  In Phase II, additional membrane compositions will be prepared and evaluated, membrane fabrication techniques will be scaled up to produce membranes sized for practical applications, and a water gas shift membrane reactor operating on coalderived syngas will be designed and demonstrated. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The membrane should find immediate application in water-gas shift reactors for high-purity hydrogen generation from coal and other sulfur-containing fuels, such as diesel and jet fuel.  This application would enable lower-cost hydrogen production for the Hydrogen Economy.  The technology also should be applicable to hydrogen production from other fossil fuels; as a consequence, it would offer significant potential to improve the Nation\u00c2\u00bfs energy security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In an effort to meet the current and projected needs for increased reliance on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in clinical diagnoses, this Phase I - Phase II Fast Track proposal addresses the specific aim of providing an open-access, low-field, high- resolution imaging system targeted for physicians' offices, small clinics and imaging centers. Building on recent developments of magnesium diboride (MgB2) superconductor wire by Hyper Tech, the recent advances in high temperature superconductor RF receiver coils and lower cost pulsed-tube cryocoolers, an enhanced point-of-care MRI imaging system can be developed for an examination room type environment, thereby enabling a much larger number of patient conditions to be scheduled at MRI imaging centers without the need for building large shielded rooms and while freeing up the large magnet units for more complex studies. By using a superconducting magnet and high temperature superconducting RF coils for improved signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), a dc magnet can be developed that will significantly expand the imaging capability of the current MagneVu permanent magnet (PM) based MRI while maintaining a low-cost alternative for select medical conditions, which are now dependent on the large magnet imaging at much higher capital and operating costs. Building on the model of an open- access geometry and an inhomogeneous magnetic field, the envisaged MRI system will be developed in three phases. Phase I will address the overall feasibility issues and delineate the specific requirements for the MgB2 based superconducting magnet using the technical experience gained from the existing PM based MagneVu system. A conceptual and preliminary design for the envisaged MRI will result. In Phase II, the magnet detail design will be completed and magnet and ancillary systems fabricated or procured. In parallel, the balance of the imaging system will be designed and/or modified from existing hardware and software and procured as necessary. At the end of Phase II, a completed prototype system will be available for preliminary tests. The proposed research will enable patients to be seen and diagnosed at point-of-care in local doctors' offices and clinics in a timelier manner This will enable earlier diagnosis of medical conditions so that treatment can begin sooner and be monitored more closely than currently possible. Lower cost imaging equipment will translate into increased usage and wider availability, thus better patient care at a lower cost.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a Fast-Track proposal to develop a multispectral optical tomography small-animal imaging system for use by the biomedical and pharmaceutical research communities. It will combine the experience CRI has acquired in multispectral, planar small-animal imaging (through its development of the Maestro(tm) system) with novel hyperspectral optical tomography algorithms and will be realized using a unique optical design. The primary aim of this proposal is to refine 3-dimensional (3D) localization of point and extended fluorescent sources within small animals. Tomographic approaches are essential for achieving truly quantitative, depth- resolved imaging. Partners in this project include leaders in optical design, algorithmic development, dye chemistry, advanced small-animal models of disease, and directors of animal imaging facilities. Key properties include: 1) the use of a spectrally tunable filter with unmatched flexibility for multiplexed fluorophore signal detection in the presence of significant autofluorescence; 2) a novel optic that enables multi- view detection; 3) a customized multispectral fluorescent label strategy; and 4) no requirement for camera or subject movement, compression of the subject between glass plates, or submersion of the subject in index- and scatter-matching fluids. Phase I will accomplish: construction of a first-generation instrument with off-the-shelf optics; radiometric characterization; surface profilometry, and confirmation via simulation that the instrument will accomplish 3D reconstructions with a resolution of 2 millimeters or better. Phase II will be dedicated to building a second- generation version of the instrument with custom, high-efficiency optics, and will add a variety of important algorithmic, computational and reagent components for optimal performance, with an emphasis on quantitative validation. The system will be deployed at several animal imaging facilities. A variety of animal models of disease, including metastatic breast cancer, pulmonary, cardiac and vascular disease will be studied and the performance of the Maestro-3D compared to competing optical and non-optical imaging modalities. In addition, CRI will work on methods to accelerate time consuming tomographic reconstructions. Finally, easy-to-use software for control, display, quantitation and integration into laboratory information systems will be developed.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute liver failure (ALF) constitutes a challenge to clinicians and scientists alike. Commonly associated with the alcohol-acetaminophen syndrome, its clinical course is unpredictable and polarizing, with death as the outcome in a large percentage of cases. Given the lack of specific therapy, organ transplantation is the only clinically effective strategy. Consequently, the field is ripe for translational studies that identify and develop new therapeutic strategies that attenuate hepatocyte death, promote hepatic regeneration and improve outcome. In a best-case scenario, such therapeutics will accelerate liver regeneration and preclude the need for transplantation; in the most severe cases, they will serve as a \"hepatic bridge\" until transplantation. Significant evidence suggests that scatter factor / hepatocyte growth factor (SF/HGF), exerts direct hepatoprotective effects and can potentially be used as a therapeutic in ALF. However, the feasibility of using this growth factor in the form of gene or protein therapy is compounded by numerous logistical issues. Low molecular weight compounds that mimic the activity of SF/HGF could overcome these logistical difficulties and provide effective therapy. Based on the 3-dimensional structure of the ATP-binding site of the SF/HGF receptor c-Met's tyrosine kinase domain and using a product discovery engine combining rational drug design with preclinical biology, we have identified SF/HGF-like small molecules centered around a phthalazin-1 (2H)- one scaffold. Ang 1170, the lead member within this class, activates the SF/HGF receptor c-Met and has recapitulated the bioactivity of SF/HGF in every assay tested to date. Proof-of-principle studies conducted under our Phase I program indicate that Ang 1170 activates the hepatocyte SF/HGF/c-Met pathway, attenuates oxidative stress-induced hepatocyte death and accelerates regeneration in partially hepatectomized marginal livers. In a mammalian model of ALF, Ang 1170 systemic pretreatment reduces mortality, and attenuates hepatic injury. Of potentially significant clinical relevance is our preliminary findings that delayed treatment with Ang 1170, attenuates hepatocyte death, stimulates liver regeneration, decreases mortality and attenuates liver dysfunction in ALF. Importantly, Ang 1170 is therapeutic in the failing marginal liver. Pilot safety studies suggest that Ang 1170 treatment is safe and well-tolerated. Supported by separate funding, a formal and comprehensive set of regulatory studies profiling the genotoxicology, toxicology and safety pharmacology of Ang 1170 is underway. The present Phase II application, designed to complete the preclinical characterization of Ang 1170, will explore fully its therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models of ALF; a panel of acute, in vivo repeat dose, dose-escalating safety studies in two species will complement these efficacy studies. Successful completion of the proposed regulatory studies will support an Investigational New Drug application to Food and Drug Administration; approval of this application will allow the first clinical studies of our SF/HGF mimetic, Ang 1170. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute liver failure remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. A small molecule hepatocyte growth factor mimetic that is hepatoprotective and hepatoregenerative is of tremendous clinical benefit.",

CyberCoach will increase the amount of communication among the end user (person with a memory deficit), rehabilitation professional(s), concerned family/friends, and employer. The primary user interface is speech, with the CyberCoach using synthesized or recorded speech output and speech recognition for input. A standard computer serves as the base unit (Hub) and standard cell phones, picture/text phones, PDA phones, or Tablet/Laptop computers can serve as the user's remote units (Terminals). Using this approach, a large variety of information channels and media are made available. CyberCoach serves as a communication hub, originating or relaying information to other appropriate participants. When used with a PDA phone or some other computer-based Terminal, CyberCoach will not replace, but rather augment cognitive prosthetic \"reminder\" programs already available. The global positioning system will be exploited for use as well as an innovative memory prosthetic that provides assistance recalling information. Utilization of new speech server technology will make this a very affordable alternative. In Phase II, the system will be further developed, subjected to user tests with non-disabled and memory-disabled subjects. To determine its efficacy, the resulting system will be subjected to a larger test involving the targeted population in actual employment and independent-living settings. The proposed approach offers an exciting, cost-effective, and affordable new approach for helping a variety of disabled users with memory/cognitive deficiencies obtain/retain meaningful employment and live independently. In addition, by living independently and securing meaningful employment, the users of this technology are likely to experience an improved sense of independence and self-worth. Also, the user, user's family, and supporting government agencies will benefit because of the reduced emotional and financial burden of supporting the user when unemployed or in a more institutional setting.",

Neuroskill(tm) is a device for assessment and monitoring of fine motor control in patients with neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and stroke. In Phase II, the prototype of the device was designed, built and successfully tested on Parkinson's patients in the pilot experimental studies on measuring the effects of the levodopa treatment on motor fluctuations, and on detecting of the ipsilateral motor control impairment in patients with hemispheric stroke and subsequent monitoring of their improvement during rehabilitation. The device consists of an instrumented pen with imbedded two-axis micro-accelerometer and pressure sensor, electronics interface unit for digitizing input data for computer analysis, and a special software package for analysis of handwriting micro-dynamics. Specifically, during the continuing Phase II effort, we plan to include a wireless communication interface between the pen and a computer, develop an alternative configuration with the digitized graphical pad as a medium for capturing handwriting dynamic information, include a voice communication option for navigating the tests, and ensure the device meets medical equipment quality standards at minimal cost. Software upgrades will improve user friendliness, integrate new algorithms to optimize the code, modify the software to include additional utility features, such as effective graphical interface for rapid clinical review, and will port the research code into an FDA- approvable code base. An extended experimental study with Parkinson's disease patients on effect of the levodopa medication on motor fluctuations will be conducted to demonstrate sensitivity and efficacy of the device. All necessary steps to prepare application for 510(k) clearance will be completed. There is a compelling need to develop quick, objective and sensitive tests of motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease, and the proposed device addresses this necessity and can become a valuable clinical marker in PD. The current project will result in an FDA-cleared product that can be widely used to increase the accuracy of early of Parkinson's disease diagnosis, monitoring acute and long-term effects of therapeutic treatment and optimization of the post-operative DBS adjustment procedures. The proposed device will bring both health care benefits and cost reduction associated with treatment of Parkinson's disease and related disorders. It will provide the clinician an easy tool for monitoring the patients and will help in designing the best regimen of medications in order to achieve the maximal improvement in the patient's condition while alleviating the severe motor fluctuations as a side effect of the treatment. The device option of remote monitoring the patients in the convenience of their home or workplace will also create more comfort for the patient, as well as let them avoid extra travel to the doctor's office.",

A total of 11% of these end up in failures, costing billions of dollars to the economy in terms of health-care costs and lost productivity, besides immense pain to the patients. According to a government report, the most common complication related to implant failures is their loosening. Therefore, the significance of research that can lead to a permanently anchored Dental implant product is immense. It is the surface of an implant that remains in direct contact with the host tissue, and therefore it plays a critical role in determining biocompatibility and induction of bioactivity on implant surface. A technique of surface modification that can biomimetically induce osteogenic activities between implant surface and the surrounding tissue is the desperate need at present to bring a true integration at bone-implant interface. After the successful completion of the Phase 2 of this research on identification of an optimum osteogenic coating and its scale up with assured quality control and validation of standard operating procedure on the procedure to create the coating on Ti implants, the product will be made ready to be brought to the market place after an approval from FDA.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a need to be able to quantify tissue perfusion for the purpose of assessing the viability of ischemic tissue such as wounds and flaps. For wound care in diabetes, early detection of angiogenesis compromise is an important determinant of salvage. This reduces cost, reduces risk of amputation, and increases patient satisfaction. Approximately 10% of all flaps require revision with a salvage rate of approximately 85%. Effective monitoring flaps would provide early warning of possible complications for flap surgery and allow earlier intervention. Currently subjective visual observation is still commonly used to identify the improvement and assessment of grafts and wounds. An imager based on the spatial analysis of laser speckle will be developed as a standalone unit. This method employs spatial averaging of the dynamic events to obtain a global picture of the velocity image from one exposure. Images obtained from the same scene at different exposures can be used to improve accuracy of the velocity values. It allows acquisition of full-field perfusion images in real time. The short exposure time reduces the effects of motion artifacts. W with an increasingly high percentage of obesity in the U.S. population, more diabetic cases have emerged. The proposed laser speckle imager provides real-time noninvasive monitoring of tissue viability in patients undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy and/or surgery. It can reduce the financial costs and physical demands on the medical staff associated with the revision of skin grafts and by determining the effectiveness of continued HBO treatment. Its commercial marketability and application will become more apparent after the clinical trial. The scientific, technical, and clinical knowledge gained from this project can be utilized to improve protocols for hyperbaric oxygen therapy, reducing both costs and time of treatment. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a total of 20.8 million people or 7% of the U.S. population have diabetes. The estimated diabetes cost in the U.S. in 2002 was $132 billion, about 11% of the total health care expenditure. This project is designed to develop an advanced, noncontact, and noninvasive optical imager to provide real-time, quantitative measurements of blood velocities in the selected wound areas of diabetic patients.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Americans suffer from chronic wounds associated with diabetic, pressure and venous stasis ulcers. In many cases, chronic wounds can take years to heal, have a high recurrence rate and will result in amputations for 54,000 patients annually. It is estimated that 2.2 million patients in the United States have chronic ulcers that don't respond to conventional therapies. Angiotensin peptides have been shown to effectively promote wound healing in preclinical studies undertaken at US Biotest, Inc. in collaboration with scientists at USC KECK School of Medicine. In a Phase II SBIR grant, US Biotest developed USB001 (NorLeu3-A(1-7) in 2% HEC and preservatives), an angiotensin peptide formulation appropriate for clinical study. USB001 was found to be stable, safe for topical use and more effective than Regranex in facilitating wound healing in diabetic mice. Much of this data was reviewed during a pre-IND meeting with the FDA when US Biotest's clinical development plan was approved for IND filing. In addition, US Biotest identified treatment responsive genes and two potential molecular mechanisms of action for NorLeu3-A(1-7) in wound healing. Building upon the foundation established in our Phase II SBIR grant and our IND (approved by FDA on July 11, 2006), US Biotest is submitting a competing continuation to initiate clinical trials for evaluation of USB001's safety and efficacy sufficient to establish proof of concept. In Specific Aim 1, we will conduct a Phase I safety study in normal volunteers (N=9) and measure toxicokinetic and pharmacokinetic samples in our LC/MS/MS assay for NorLeu3-A(1- 7). In Specific Aim 2, we will manufacture sterile USB001 and conduct a Phase II dose response study in diabetic patients with chronic ulcers (3 groups of 25 study subjects per group). In Specific Aim 3, we will complete preclinical safety studies required to initiate Phase III clinical studies. Angiotensin Analogs to Treat Wound Healing Diabetes is an illness that plagues an estimated 20 million individuals in the United States (National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse, 2005). Complications of diabetes include chronic skin ulcers that often lead to amputation and loss of life due to persistent wound infection. US Biotest's lead compound, NorLeu3-A(1-7), has been shown in pre-clinical studies to be significantly more effective than Regranex, the only FDA-approved drug for healing diabetic ulcers. This competing continuation of our Phase II SBIR will allow US Biotest to conduct Phase I and II studies of clinical efficacy. Development of a successful treatment for diabetic ulcers will preserve and improve quality of life as well as reduce health care costs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexually active adolescents have the highest rates of STD of any age group. The WSTDtv project addresses the need for a readily available, developmentally appropriate, engaging, and effective HIV/STD awareness and prevention curriculum for schools. By combining multimedia activities, web-based resources, and electronic and print teacher support tools and strategies, WSTDtv will deliver a set of activities from which adolescents are able to learn facts and science about HIV/STD, ways to deal with pressures and influences related to sexual activity in their daily lives, and the skills necessary to reduce their level of risk. Phase 1 developed a significant prototype CD-ROM, web site, and teacher's guide. The preliminary CD-ROM is of commercial quality, as exhibited by the multiple industry awards it received, even in its prototype form. In a pre-post pilot evaluation (n=41), the interactive activities were found to significantly increase adolescent knowledge, to affect targeted attitudes in the desired direction, and to significantly exceed target usability, interest, and usefulness benchmarks. In an evaluation of the teacher's guide, web site, and CD-ROM by middle school teachers (n=17), the teachers were overwhelmingly positive about the product. These results are noteable, even more so considering they were obtained with a Phase 1 prototype which, while extensive, was limited in the number and range of activities, the scope of content, and the opportunities for direct training in and practice with risk-reducing and interpersonal skills. In Phase 2, existing modules will be refined and expanded. New modules on STD facts, risk factors, and prevention skills building will be produced. The web site will be enhanced to include search mechanisms and additional content directly linked to individual modules. Mechanisms for teacher-friendly online \"booster\" modules and inter-class collaboration will be created, including login architecture, web conferencing, online voting, and other features. The teachers guide will be extended and additional teacher support tools designed. Phase 2 will be evaluated through six stages of focus groups, through in-depth review by a nationally recognized advisory panel, and through a randomized controlled product evaluation. Also during Phase 2, marketing and distribution plans and agreements will be finalized. The 2005 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that 46.8% of high school students had had sexual intercourse during their life and that 33.9% of them had engaged in sexual intercourse with one or more persons during the three months preceding the survey. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimates there are 19 million new cases of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) in the United States each year and that almost half of them occur in 15 to 24 year olds (2004). There is little doubt that teens are sexually active and that many of them are engaging in unsafe sexual practices. Schools are an ideal venue for health promotion and disease prevention programs, and most adolescents receive at least a minimum amount of sexuality or HIV education; however, in general it is believed that STD/HIV curricula are not as effective as they could be (Kirby,2002). Interactive media offers new ways for delivering STD/HIV prevention content-ways that can be attractive to both teachers and students. A readily available, research-based, and theory driven set of innovative and engaging interactive activities, tools, and resources should be very well-received by students, teachers, schools, and local educational authorities and will fill an important gap in public health education. Intended to address this gap, the effort proposed herein describes the development of WSTDtv - an STD/HIV curriculum for use by teachers in middle school and early secondary school classrooms.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The scientific research proposed, the determination of pre-clinical stability, pharmacokinetics and toxicology testing of Maas BiolAB's proprietary cyclosporin intrathecal formulation, Mitogard(tm), will allow the company to file for Investigational New Drug (IND) approval with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and begin human clinical trials for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mitogard(tm) is designed for delivery into the intrathecal space. Cyclosporin does not readily cross the blood brain barrier, thus intrathecal delivery is needed to reach affected areas of the brain and spinal cord. Though cyclosporin is an FDA approved active ingredient and its safety profile is known to the FDA, both the Mitogard(tm) formulation and proposed intrathecal route of administration are new requiring further stability and toxicology studies. Cyclosporin is a powerful neuroprotectant, separate from its traditional role as an immunosuppressant, and has shown efficacy in pre-clinical models of ALS, making it a promising candidate to reduce the burden of the disease and extend the life of ALS patients. GMP stability data will be gathered over two years, toward confirmation of product shelf life. SBIR Phase I (year one) testing will confirm the purity and concentration of cyclosporin in the formulation and stability will be measured up to 12 months (with up to 24 month measurements in Phase II of the fast-track proposal). Potency testing will be performed using a HPLC assay following the chromatography guidelines of the USP NF monograph on injectable cyclosporin. Rodent and sheep toxicology tests will ensure that Mitogard(tm) can be safely administered intrathecally. Maas BiolAB and Northern Biomedical Research have planned dose escalation studies via lumbar puncture in both the rodent and sheep to determine the maximal and optimal safe dosing ranges of Mitogard(tm), and will include the histology of the spinal cord and brain. These will be followed by GLP 28 day rodent and 90 day sheep continuous pump infusion studies. These toxicology studies will provide data to enable an IND first for lumbar bolus injection into the intrathecal space, followed by a second IND for continuous infusion via implanted drug delivery pump. Progression from first lumbar puncture to second pump delivery safety studies will satisfy FDA requirements of drug delivery progression. This translational research will bring cyclosporin, which is a powerful broad-spectrum neuroprotectant drug in animal models, from animal testing to approval for human clinical trials. If cyclosporin is found to be an effective neuroprotectant in humans, it could reduce suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease). This research will allow the FDA to assess the safety and stability of cyclosporin in treating ALS and to give permission to start the first human ALS trials.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A new approach for detecting pathogenic bacteria in platelet concentrates rapidly is proposed. Technically, the approach is based on an unconventional implementation of impedance sensing to monitor cellular metabolic responses with exceptional sensitivity and stability. This enables the detection of small numbers of viable aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in near-real time without the need for grown cultures significantly reducing the time from sample collection to detection results by several days compared to currently in use methods. Feasibility of the approach was successfully demonstrated as part of the Phase I investigation with representative Gram-negative and Gram-positive species commonly implicated in platelet- associated bacterial sepsis. In addition, the ability to make decisive measurements in short time enables the bacterial testing of platelets just prior to transfusion ensuring the safety of the patient and potentially extending platelets shelf life. The proposed Phase II effort focuses on the development of a prototype instrument and testing of contaminated platelets in a realistic setting. The described approach may also be applicable to the detection of bacteria in other blood products. Bacterial contamination is detected in approximately one of every 2000 units of platelets and is implicated as the cause of severe or fatal sepsis in an estimated 150 patients per year in the United States. The proposed rapid test will enable the detection of viable contaminant bacteria in platelet supplies in near-real time both insuring their safe use and extending their useable life-span.",

CPSI research strategy focuses on understanding and manipulating the cell survival and cell death pathways activated in response to various stressors. Recently, we have recognized that it is not adequate to merely address stress response issues during isolated events of cell processing, as has been the focus in the past, but in fact a more comprehensive and strategy involving process integration and cellular conditioning is necessary. CPSI intends to apply this novel strategic approach to develop new methodologies to improve the quality (integrity and function) of human lung cells (hLC) and tissues beyond those typically realized today.  Investigations conducted under this research project will utilize cDNA microarrays, proteomic profiling, and viability and functional analysis to define the stress response pathways activated in hLC during common pre-transplant manipulation and processing.  It is the intent of these studies to provide a better understanding of the unique responses of hLC to ex vivo manipulation and utilize these data to develop new methodologies for cell processing.  These developments should have an impact not only on the quality and availability of lung tissue samples, but also enable expanded utilization in areas such as in vitro study as well cell and tissue transplants.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Primary carcinoma of the lung is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. A test that detects early-stage disease could potentially reduce the number of deaths. A breath test for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was sensitive and specific for primary lung cancer in two multicenter clinical studies. A third multicenter study confirmed these findings in cancer-free controls with a negative spiral CT of chest and patients with tissue-confirmed primary lung cancer. In a study of 451 subjects, a two-minute breath test for VOC biomarkers of lung cancer combined with fuzzy logic analysis of data predicted all TNM stages of disease with 84.6% sensitivity, 80.0% specificity and 0.88 area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Predictive accuracy was not affected by TNM stage of primary lung cancer, age, sex, or tobacco smoking. Biological basis of the breath test: Breath markers of primary lung cancer appear to emanate from other tissues, not from the tumor itself. Volatile products of oxidative stress are generated in all tissues of the body and excreted in the breath as alkanes and methylated alkanes. In patients with lung cancer, these VOCs may undergo accelerated catabolism, so that their altered abundance in breath provides a biomarker of disease. Alkanes and their metabolites are metabolized rapidly by high risk cytochrome P450 phenotypes (e.g., CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP2E1) whose activity is induced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in tobacco smoke. This may explain why the breath test was abnormal in early (TNM stage I) disease, because induction of high risk cytochrome P450 phenotypes precedes the onset of neoplasia. Reason for the research: The clinical findings require confirmation in an additional clinical study in order for the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) to award the breath test pre-marketing approval. Experimental plans: We will perform a cross-sectional multicenter study to validate the methodology and the predictive algorithm that were previously developed. Breath tests will be performed in 400 anonymized subjects in order to compare cancer-free controls (with a negative spiral CT of chest) to patients with tissue-confirmed primary lung cancer. This will be a blinded study: breath samples will be analyzed at two independent laboratories blinded to the diagnosis, and a Data and Safety Monitoring Board will collate the predictions of the breath tests with the clinical diagnoses in order to determine the accuracy of the test. Long term aims: a. Scientific: To validate the previous clinical findings. b. Commercial: To obtain FDA pre-marketing approval (PMA) of the test in order to market it. Importance of the research: In clinical practice, the breath test could provide a safe and non-invasive ancillary test for primary detection of lung cancer. Its high negative predictive value (NPV) (>99%) could dependably exclude lung cancer in cancer-free normals. The breath test for biomarkers of lung cancer could provide a valuable new test that is inherently safe, non- invasive, and rational. Breath testing could potentially reduce the costs of early detection of lung cancer, and reduce the number of patients exposed to radiation from spiral CT of chest. Early, safe and cost-effective detection of lung cancer could potentially reduce the number of lives lost to the disease. We will perform a validation study of the breath test for biomarkers of lung cancer in order to obtain pre-marketing approval from the Food & Drug Administration. This breath test is inherently safe, non-invasive, and rational; it could reduce the costs of early detection of lung cancer, and reduce the number of patients exposed to radiation from spiral CT of chest.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This research program will conduct a randomized, controlled, multi-site clinical trial of novel investigative therapeutic technology and methods for treating chronic pain in patients refractory to prior treatment modalities to: training the patients to control their chronic pain using real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI). This work is the logical extension toward the FDA regulatory process of a successful, ongoing technology-transfer effort that has brought rtfMRI from the research setting into the clinical setting and that has demonstrated positive results in treating chronic pain patients. These investigations further the NIH mission by advancing understanding of distributed brain mechanisms of pain and by definitively testing a novel therapeutic modality for alleviating a condition which is responsible for substantial human suffering and healthcare cost. We have hypothesized that it is possible to train chronic pain patients to control activation in the brain's pain processing areas using rtfMRI, thereby leading to decreased pain. Multiple experiments now support that both experimentally-induced pain and chronic pain in patients can be significantly decreased using this methodology. We will use rtfMRI technology to train chronic pain patients to control activation in the brain's pain system, specifically in a region in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) involved in pain perception and control. Previous work from a number of groups has now established that human subjects can learn to control brain activation using rtfMRI. Studies funded through the Phase II grant upon which this application is based have successfully demonstrated that control over brain activation achieved using rtfMRI-based training can lead to control over pain in both healthy subjects and chronic pain patients. Healthy subjects who received training guided by rtfMRI learned increased control over pain perception during a nociceptive stimulus. This control over pain was statistically significantly greater than for several different control subject groups that did not receive rtfMRI training. Chronic pain patients were also able to produce decreases in their pain using rtfMRI-based training greater than controls. An initial clinical trial in chronic pain patients who were trained using rtfMRI over six weeks has demonstrated that long-term decreases in chronic pain can be achieved. The purpose of the newly-created NIH SBIR Phase II Competitive Renewal grant process is to provide continued funding support for promising, NIH-funded technology projects that will incur substantial costs to move through clinical trials supporting the FDA regulatory process. This application proposes a definitive clinical trial of this technology for treating chronic refractory pain patients using rtfMRI in preparation for FDA approval. Clinical trials of pain therapeutics are necessarily large because there is large variability in pain symptoms; small trials often waste resources because they don't have adequate power. This trial will be conducted at leading fMRI research centers (Stanford, MIT, and Omneuron) with similar size to other pain therapeutics trials (N=72 per group, 36 per sub-group), and including a blind, randomized placebo control.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term goal of this project is to develop an intelligent prosthetic foot that reduces the energy consumption of walking in amputees. Commercial prostheses use passive mechanisms to provide articulation, cushioning against heel impact, and elastic energy return; yet the energetic cost of amputee walking is high. Currently the most sophisticated prostheses are intelligent knees, which improve gait by actively controlling braking of the knee. Based on recent laboratory results, we propose that controlled energy storage and release could significantly improve the efficiency of a prosthetic foot. Such a foot would store elastic energy after the foot strikes the ground, as in current products. But instead of returning energy spontaneously, active control would capture that energy with a latch mechanism, and release it later in the gait cycle, coinciding with the push-off phase of able-bodied walking. The proposed mechanism will be microprocessor-controlled, and will require battery power mainly to actuate a latch rather than to actively power gait. This low power demand means that the prosthesis will be able to operate for hours at a time using lightweight batteries. Phase II of this project will develop a prototype prosthesis, and experimentally test the conceptual feasibility of intelligently controlled energy release. We intend to develop this concept into a commercial prosthesis with greater energy return and comfort than conventional designs, in a compact and lightweight package. The proposed research has three Specific Aims: design and fabrication, testing on able-bodied subjects, and testing on transtibial (below-knee) amputees. (1.) The design component consists of developing a lightweight and compact, computer-controlled mechanism for controlling and then returning mechanical energy to the user. (2.) We will test the device on able-bodied subjects, to compare the metabolic energy that they expend during walking. Able-bodied subjects will be used to monitor the differences between the prototype device, conventional prostheses, and able-bodied walking. (3.) We will also test the device on the target population of transtibial amputees. We will provide subjects with long-term loans of the prototype device so that they can practice walking and become familiar with it. We will then compare their energy demand when walking on their own prosthesis, with a high performance conventional prosthesis, and with the prototype device. We will test whether controlled energy storage reduces the metabolic demand for walking, which serves as an objective measure of the device's efficacy. Relevance: This research addresses the public health problem of reduced mobility in lower-limb amputees using prosthetic feet. These amputees walk at lower speed, high energy cost, and with lower range and comfort than able-bodied individuals. The proposed controlled energy storage prosthetic foot is intended to provide measurable improvements in these aspects of mobility. This project seeks to reduce the energetic demand of walking in lower limb amputees, for whom walking with a prosthesis is more fatiguing than for able-bodied persons. The project will develop a prosthetic foot with an ability to efficiently store energy that is normally dissipated in conventional prostheses, and then to return that energy to power walking, in order to reduce the effort of walking for amputees.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Arterial spin labeling (ASL) has proven its ability to non-invasively measure cerebral blood flow (CBF). However, widespread use of this promising technique has been prevented by its long acquisition time due to the inherently image low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Recently, it has been shown that the use of 3D instead of 2D 'single-shot' sub-second imaging sequences greatly improve SNR and slice coverage of the brain. The new generation of MRI scanners equipped with improved magnetic gradient systems, phased array multi-channel receiver systems and high magnetic field strengths (3T and 4T) greatly enhance the performance of the ASL pulse sequences. Clinical use of state-of-the-art ASL techniques is very limited since no major MR scanner manufacturer supports this type of perfusion imaging, with currently no commercial ASL products available on any MRI scanners. We are proposing the development of a family of highly efficient 3D MRI pulse sequences for perfusion imaging using ASL and CPMG spin echo pulse sequences, gradient-and-spin-echo (GRASE). This pulse sequence set will consist of single-shot (one set of repeatedly refocused signals) and multi-shot acquisitions using advanced variants of ASL blood labeling preparation schemes. The sequences will be designed and implemented on a 1.5T MR scanner equipped with a 40 mT/m high performance gradients. The new imaging sequences will be ported to 3T and 4T high field scanners at different universities, Washington University, University of Pennsylvania, University of California San Francisco and Harvard where the new imaging technology will undergo further optimization and testing. The availability of these highly efficient pulse sequences to researchers and clinicians will give the capability to perform 3D perfusion imaging of the whole brain at conventional high resolution 256 x 256 matrix images and to perform time averaged sub-second 3D perfusion maps which differentiate different vascular territories. The resulting quantitative measures of blood perfusion will be useful for studies of neurodegenerative diseases, drug trials and identifying perfusion abnormalities in stroke and cerebrovascular disease.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a SBIR Fast-Track application to address two currently unmet needs. These are for a quantitative theoretical understanding of DNA multiplex hybridization reactions; and a general design methodology for developing rapid, reliable, multiplex genotyping assays. First, in a broader sense there is presently a void in theoretical understanding of DNA multiplex hybridization. For example, current analytical understanding of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the multiplex microarray hybridization process is minimal. Plans in Phase I include development and implementation of our theoretical multiplex analytical methods, and experimentally demonstrate feasibility of using temperature dependent kinetics to discriminate a perfect match duplex from one containing a single base pair mismatch, i.e. SNP, on a microarray. If feasibility can be established, the first part of Phase II is focused on quantitative evaluation of essential experimental parameters, and further parameterization of the theoretical model. This will establish a solid and more rigorous analytical basis for understanding DNA multiplex hybridization reactions. This theoretical foundation will immediately enable more insightful design, more accurate analysis, and greatly expanded and enhanced predictive capabilities for novel and improved design of microarray based assays. This analytical foundation will also support development and applications of novel diagnostic microarray formats that incorporate and utilize time and temperature as key assay parameters. In the second part of Phase II, to demonstrate capability and immediate utility of our analytical process, we will design, build, test and validate a rapid genotyping panel test for 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms in eight genes that have been associated with Adult Macular Degeneration, a leading cause of age related vision loss. The developed process can be generally applied to the design of multiplex genotyping assays for the detection of virtually any SNP panel for any standard microarray platform.

Project Narrative The goal of this SBIR Fast-Track project is to develop new and powerful analytical tools that will be parameterized and implemented to provide capabilities of quantitative modeling of the temperature dependence of DNA multiplex hybridization kinetics on a microarrray. The developed tools will be readily applicable to address prescient needs in custom diagnostic assay design. A demonstration of the developed technology will be a rapid and cheap genotyping assay for detection of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that may be associated with Adult Macular Degeneration, a genetic disease responsible for nearly 50% of age related vision loss in developed countries.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol use disorders (alcohol abuse and alcohol dependency) are among the most prevalent mental disorders worldwide and and are associated with substantial personal and societal costs Both acute and chronic consumption of alcohol have been shown to place individuals at risk for health problems including alcohol dependence, increased risks for neural disorders, cardiovascular disease, cancers, and liver injury. Lohocla Research Corporation has developed, through rational design, a novel, patent-protected new chemical entity assigned the acronym DCUKA. DCUKA simultaneously targets two neurochemical processes influencing alcohol intake. Our preclinical studies demonstrate that DCUKA reduces alcohol withdrawal hyperexcitability, is neuroprotective, reduces anxiety, reduces relapse drinking and lessens overall alcohol intake. Lohocla intends to position DCUKA not just for the treatment of alcohol dependence (as current treatments do), but also for individuals who are drinking alcohol at hazardous/harmful levels and wish to reduce them to safer levels. In order for Lohocla to begin testing DCUKA in humans, specific FDA-required pharmacokinetic and toxicological preclinical investigations must be completed. The following studies will be accomplished during funding of this application: (1) Further establish the effectiveness of DCUKA in reducing alcohol intake in non-dependent animals; (2) Develop a sensitive assay based on mass spectrometry detection for assaying DCUKA in blood and tissues; (3) ascertain in vivo oral pharmacokinetics and in vitro metabolism of DCUKA in liver microsomes; and (4) toxicology and safety studies in rats (acute and multiple dose tolerance, genetic toxicity, chronic toxicity, acute CNS safety). Completion of these studies will allow Lohocla research to file for an exploratory IND and, thereby, position DCUKA for an IND application.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Differentiating acute coronary syndrome (ACS) from noncardiac chest pain is the primary diagnostic challenge for clinicians in the emergency department. Studies of myocardial perfusion imaging have demonstrated important information for risk- stratifying stable post-ACS patients. However, this method is of limited value in patients with prior history of coronary heart disease (CAD), since these patients will often have abnormal resting perfusion patterns precluding the ability to differentiate old infarcts from new ischemic events. 99m Tc-glucarate does not detect old heart attacks, and thus, should provide an advantage in the specificity for imaging suspected ACS patients with previous CAD. 99m Tc-glucarate has been in development as a radiopharmaceutical diagnostic imaging agent for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarct (AMI) for more than a decade. Previously the agent was thought to be specific for necrotic myocardium or MI. However, more recent preclinical studies suggested that 99m Tc-glucarate uptake is increased in the setting of ischemia, even in the absence of necrosis. This expanded specificity has led to the hypothesis that this imaging agent could be used to accurately assess the presence of ACS in the chest-pain patient with equivocal diagnosis. The broad aim of the proposed phase II clinical trial is to demonstrate that the nuclear imaging product candidate, 99mTc-glucarate, can be used in the diagnosis of ACS in chest pain patients with prior history of coronary heart disease in the setting of the emergency department. The accuracy of diagnosis of ACS in the emergency department with 99mTc-glucarate will be obtained by comparison to the clinical discharge diagnosis. Specific aims of the proposal are: 1. Conduct a multi-site clinical trial of cardiac imaging with 99mTc-glucarate in 100 chest pain patients suspected of ACS, but with no obvious signs of MI and having prior coronary artery disease. 2. Determine the accuracy of 99m Tc-glucarate imaging compared to standard clinical discharge diagnosis. Results from this research could provide a technological advancement in definitive diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome in patients with know coronary heart disease. This should not only lead to early diagnosis and triage of these patients but also should lead to better health care resource management.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Addiction is a critical issue for our society and involves complex brain processes in which sensory stimulation and interaction with the environment are key factors for its understanding and treatment. This project proposes to develop a comprehensive family of hardware products for evoking intense sensory and experiential interaction during brain imaging studies. In particular the project will assess how the quality of the sensory experience and interaction affects brain pathways involved in craving and addiction. Specialized stimulation and control hardware will be engineered and used in fMRI studies to evaluate the added benefit of the technology. The effort involves integrating advanced technology for stimulus presentation, leading edge immersive VR technology, and fMRI based brain imaging. It will provide a comprehensive family of hardware products that can be used together or independently during fMRI studies and potentially during the course of drug abuse treatment efforts. The proposed fMRI peripheral hardware includes: 1) a stereo projector system to increase the sense of immersion; 2) an integrated dataglove with force and tactile feedback enabling grasping studies with virtual objects; 3) an odor delivery system capable of presenting multiple odors to a subject; 4) a taste delivery system capable of providing multiple tastes directly to the tongue; 5) an auditory stimulus delivery system with active noise cancellation to dramatically attenuate scanner noise; 6) a gamepad controller with joystick and buttons enabling control movement and responses during VR studies inside or outside of an MRI scanner. In addition to preliminary testing with subjects during fMRI studies of all the hardware to substantiate its effects, a comparative fMRI study with smokers will test the ability of the hardware to deliver sensory augmented VR simulations that are an improvement over the more traditional use of static images in craving studies. The business and marketing plan are conservative and based on the successful model Psychology Software Tools Inc (PST) has used in past niche market product development and marketing. The staff includes leaders in computerized experimentation, brain imaging and fMRI addiction research who have a history of working with university researchers to provide market leading technology in experimental control (E- Prime is used by over 10,000 researchers) and functional imaging systems (IFIS is installed at over 200 MRI sites). The business plan builds on the past track record that has resulted in every SBIR phase II research program being transitioned into a market leading technology with over three million dollars of commercial sales within five years. Future research by many investigators would utilize the developed technology to advance understanding of brain processes involving addiction and cognition and provide a profitable income stream to continue innovation in the growing research interface of brain, cognition and addiction. This project will conduct the scientific research and development necessary to provide a comprehensive family of hardware products for effectively and reliably evoking intense sensory and experimental interaction during fMRI brain imaging. Future scientific research efforts made possible or furthered by the availability of these tools will advance the understanding of the brain processes related to addictive behavior and cognition. This understanding will be used to assess and treat key societal substance abuse problems which have become a plague upon the health of our nation, affecting millions of individuals and defying current solutions.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project entails the design and building of polarization independent, fiberdized, wavelength selective switches using patent pending EO-waveguide micro-ring technology developed and demonstrated as a result of work carried out under Phase I. The approach is electro-optic, rather than thermo-optic, and operates with negligible power consumption (< 30 microwatts per ring demonstrated in phase I), fast switching (< 100 microseconds demonstrated), larger index modulation (dn > 0.01 demonstrated, more possible) and importantly, will enable active polarization dependent loss (PDL) compensation. This will replace thermo-optically tuned ring resonators, which have provided only limited tunability (dn/dt =~ 1.5 x 10-5/oC), slower tuning times (> 3 milliseconds typical), high polarization dependency (no active PDL compensation possible), and are prohibitively power consumptive ( ~~ 0.5 Watts per ring).  In the last century the low power transistor replaced the power hungry vacuum tube, thereby ushering in the age of\nintegrated electronics. In a similar fashion, low-power LC-waveguides have the potential to replace high-power thermo-optics (providing a power savings of >10,000), thereby opening up applications and markets for integrated optics. In phase II we will transition our phase I feasibility demonstration into a fully functioning and packaged prototype. As computing power and bandwidth continue to grow (e.g., streaming media), low-cost electro-optical filtering and switching systems will be required to satisfy pending fiber-to-the-home and last mile deployment needs. Since 2002, United States and European deployment of long-haul dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) systems have been almost entirely constructed from reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (ROADM). A typical deployed system works by reading incoming optical signals and converting them to electrical signals, which can then be routed. Conversion back to optical is performed by an array of tunable lasers. This brute force method, while providing useful performance, is cost prohibitive for small network deployment. According to Infonetics, a leading market research firm, the ROADM-enabled equipment market size nearly reached $600 million in 2005, tripling earlier forecasts. Over all growth will be determined by affordability and reliability of ROADMs technology, especially within the metro and access space. The technology outlined in this proposal if successful will contribute a new and inherently agile all optical solution by reducing cost while maintaining performance and reliability. In addition to ROADMs, the voltage tunable micro-rings will enable a wide array of useful devices, ranging from spectral filters, to optical cross-connects, to routers, to name only a few.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis remains a major challenge to the maintenance of health and quality of life in an aging population. Among the most promising and least exploited therapeutic interventions are those treatments designed to increase bone density. The selection and validation of targets that can be manipulated to achieve this anabolic effect depends on an increasing amount of information relating to bone formation. Progenra has completed the construction and validation for high throughput screening of an assay for Praja1, an E3 ligase responsible for proteasomal degradation of Dlxin-1/MAGE-D1, a coactivator of the transcriptional activator Dlx5. Dlx5 is associated with programmed bone formation. Thus, selective inhibitors of this E3 ligase are hypothesized to increase bone density. Collections of small molecules, as well as plant and marine organism extracts from the NCI, will be screened to find potent and selective inhibitors of Praja1 activity. Lead compounds will be identified from among the hits, and fractionation of active extracts will be guided by the assay, to identify active principles. Among the novel pure compounds arising from this effort, the best will be chosen for evaluation in cultured cell assays for their effects on Praja1-related inhibition of transcription associated with bone formation. Compounds that pass screening and secondary assay evaluation will be considered for animal model evaluation after Phase II. Osteoporosis remains a major challenge to the maintenance of health and quality of life in an aging population; the most sought after treatments are those which will build up bone mass instead of merely preventing further bone loss. Progenra has developed a technology that will permit the discovery of compounds that can work in this fashion; the company proposed to look for new osteoporosis drugs in collections of pure compounds and natural products extracts from plants and marine organisms. The latter have been good sources of highly effective drugs in the past (taxol, statins, etc).",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations in the ubiquitin E3 ligase component pVHL are observed in 100% of patients with the autosomal dominant von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) and predisposes individuals to a variety of tumors including clear cell carcinomas of the kidneys. Furthermore, mutations in pVHL are observed in 50-80% of patients with the more common sporadic renal clear cell carcinoma. Following the clinical success of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, ubiquitin pathway enzymes have been considered attractive targets to screen for inhibitors more selective than bortezomib thereby achieving an improved therapeutic index. Two related deubquitinating enzymes -- VDU1, now called USP33, and VDU2, now called USP20 -- are substrates of the pVHL E3 ligase complex and hence are implicated in carcinogenesis. The tight regulation of USP20 and USP33 protein levels by the tumor suppressor pVHL support the hypothesis that USP20 and USP33 proteins play a role in carcinogenesis. Approximately two years ago, in a phase I grant application it was proposed to establish an assay to screen USP33 (VDU1) isopeptidase activity using a reporter enzyme that required a free N terminus for catalytic activity. Subsequently, recombinant USP33 was purified and a high throughput assay for screening for inhibitors was established, fulfilling the main objective of the phase I grant (see phase I final report). In this phase II application the related deubiquitinase VDU2 (USP20) will be purified and the isopeptidase assay will be utilized to screen multiple libraries of compounds to identify inhibitors of USP33 and USP20. The hits will be confirmed by additional secondary assays to establish the specificity and efficacy of the inhibitors. Following lead optimization, initial preclinical evaluation will be performed. The identification of specific inhibitors of USP33 and/ or USP20 is the first step in the development of novel targeted therapies for pVHL mutant tumors. Such targeted therapies are predicted to be efficacious in the treatment of multiple malignancies such as renal clear cell carcinomas. In a Phase I SBIR grant funded project, Progenra, Inc developed an assay that can be used to find compounds that block an enzyme called VDU1 (or USP33), which is related to certain kidney cancers. In Phase II, it is proposed to use this assay to screen a large number of compounds to find the best candidates for a drug that can treat kidney cancer by blocking this enzyme or its relative, VDU2 (now called USP20). In the proposed work plan for Phase II, USP20 will be purified, and both USP20 and USP33 will be put into the screen to find compounds that are strong blockers of the enzymes (one or the other, or both). Finding powerful inhibitors of VDU1 or VDU2 is the first step along the pathway to develop new cancer drugs.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Inovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project applies a new sensor principle to develop commercial High-Throughput Screening (HTS) systems for drug-development applications. The advantages of the Guided-Mode Resonance (GMR) sensor concept for such applications reside in its inherent physical characteristics including polarization diversity, materials independence, choice of spectral regions, angular-addressing flexibility, and associated compact system configurations. These properties enable tag-free sensor technology with high sensitivity, high accuracy, and multi-parameter detection. A major objective is the development and verification of GMR-sensor HTS commercial system prototypes in standard formats. Integrated analysis software will present data on biomolecular binding events, including background density and molecular accumulation dynamics, to the user. An additional main thrust is the development of attachment chemistry and methods for sensor activation where a set of protocols and processes for example measurands will be optimized\nto maximize detection sensitivity. Finally, by applying transmission sensor formats with shaped input light beams and integrated detector matrices, the next-generation compact system designs for massively parallel screening of drug compounds will be provided.  This research project will stimulate progress in drug discovery. Guided-mode resonance sensors operate without chemical tags permitting observation and study of unperturbed biochemical processes, as no foreign substance is introduced. Therefore, these sensors provide enhanced understanding of chemical and biomolecular reactions and may lead to advances in chemical process development and drug discovery and design. Moreover, this class of biosensors has other potential applications including medical diagnostics, proteomics, genomics, environmental monitoring, and homeland security. Application of this technology to microfluidics, lab-on-a-chip, and wireless integrated sensors for homeland security and environmental monitoring may provide new tools for accurate and cost-effective detection of biotoxins, explosives, and hazardous materials.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Zebrafish have a remarkable capacity for cellular regeneration and are amenable to mutational genetic screens. Accordingly, a transgenic zebrafish system that facilitates the removal of specific cell types and the detection of regenerative \"replacement\" cells has been developed.  This inducible ablation platform, termed ZAP (zebrafish ablation-reporter protein), is based on the principle of cytotoxic pro-drug conversion and can be targeted to any genetically definable cell type. Transgenic expression of ZAPs can therefore be used to model any degenerative condition linked to the loss of specific cells or tissues. ZAPs consist of a pro-drug converting enzyme fused to a fluorescent reporter. The pro-drug converting enzyme converts otherwise innocuous substances into cellular toxins, facilitating inducible elimination of ZAP-expressing cells. The fluorescent reporter allows the presence or absence of targeted cell types to be tracked in living fish. Thus, the ZAP platform provides a means to discovering genetic pathways that regulate the regeneration of specific cell types from discrete adult stem cell populations.  Proposed is the creation of a set of transgenic zebrafish lines designed to promote maximum flexibility regarding where, when, how much, and what color ZAPs are expressed. The Gal4-UAS system is employed as a modular component that separates transgene expression into elements conferring timing and location (Gal4-expressing \"activator\" lines) from elements specifying amount and type of transgene product produced (UAS:reporter \"effector\" lines). By mating different Gal4 and UAS lines, any expression pattern can be conferred to any reporter/effector gene. An enhancer trap approach, based on Tol2-mediated transposition, will be used to create a series of ~500 Gal4-expressing transgenic lines that allow specific cell types to be targeted. A complimentary series of UAS lines will facilitate control over ZAP expression levels and choice of fluorescent reporter color. Collectively then, these models will promote insight into the development, function, and regeneration of specific cell types. Accordingly, the transgenic lines generated will be characterized in detail and distributed to the larger research community. The short-term goal is to foster elucidation of the molecular mechanisms regulating adult stem cell niches within the regenerative biology research community. The long-term goal of this project is to promote the development of regenerative therapies capable of reversing the debilitating effects of degenerative conditions that plague humankind.",
