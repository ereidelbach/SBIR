        "abstract": "Bone marrow transplant (BMT) is an extraordinarily rapidly growing field, and the number of transplants in the U. S. is expected to grow from a current rate of 15,000 per year to over 100,000 per year by 1995. This rapid expansion is due to the diversity in the types of bone marrow transplantation procedures and the number of clinical procedures that can be benefitted by a BMT. Major limiting factors in BMT therapy is the high cell number that is needed for reingraftment, traumatic procedure needed for cell aspiration, and the poor capability to handle cells ex vivo. Cells are basically frozen during ex vivo storage. Thus, significant need exists for the development of ex vivo hematopoietic cell expansion technologies. We have developed cell culture conditions under which human hematopoietic cells expand ex vivo. Based on this discovery, we wish to develop clinically useful systems to improve BMT procedures. The first step in the development of a clinical-scale system is to make small hematopoietic bioreactor systems that mimic and successfully reproduce the expansive cell culture conditions. We will develop and optimize such a prototype hematopoietic bioreactor system with Phase I funding. If Phase I goals are successfully met, we will pursue a Phase II study to develop clinically useful prototypes.",

Although temporary circulatory support in pediatric patients is being performed with ECMO or centrifugal pumps, no dedicated pulsatile VAD have been developed for pediatric application. The proposed pediatric VAD addresses this need with the goal of developing an inexpensive pulsatile device. The device is tubular in construction with integrally formed inflow valve, pump chamber, and outflow valve. The valves and pumps are actuated pneumatically. The designed stroke volume is under 10cc suitable for neonates and infants weighing up to 10kg. The device is designed to have minimal surface area and is small in size to minimize hemodilution, heat loss and bleeding complications. Phase I study will focus on in vitro and in vivo characterization of the device. The Phase II study will focus on system development leading to an easy to use device with no need for continuous attention by a perfusionist or an intensivist.",

        "abstract": "Intelligent processing of battlefield sensor data information provides substantial force-multiplying benefits. The timely and cost-effective leveraging of information provides a significant advantage over adversaries who do not possess comparable information processing capabilities. Among these capabilities is the ability to detect patterns and trends in sampled data. Automated discovery of causal or deterministic behavior in sampled data provides a model of the underlying system that produces the data. Such a model can then be used to interpolate or forecast the behavior of the system under a variety of operating conditions. The ability to accurately model sampled data has a wide variety of high-payoff avioncs, electronic warfare, and other military applications. This proposal presents two existing methodologies for finding causality or patterns in data. Pattern Theory provides a framework for analytically determining the degree of \"pattern-ness\" of an existing function. It has been extended to the Decomposed Function Cardinality (DFC) and Function Extrapolation by Re-composing Decompositions (FERD) methodologies, which can produce a minimal functional description from a sample data set [27]. The Abductive Information Modeler\" is a numeric machine learning algorithm suited to modeling data of a continuous nature. It has been used to solve many complex problems in the defense and commercial arenas. Areas of commonality and complementary differences are described. An approach for integrating these technologies is presented. Finally, existing and potential future applications of FERD and AIM are presented.",

        "abstract": "Active Control eXperts, Inc. (ACX) proposes to apply its expertise in actuator and control system design to high force, high bandwidth machine tool position control applications. ACX proposes to develop novel hybrid linear actuators which can operate at high loads (greater than 1000 lbs.) at high bandwidths (in excess of 200 Hz), and at high displacements (0.018 inches). This innovative solid-state hydraulic actuator is well suited to machine tool applications. These highly efficient actuators are designed to reduce driving voltages and permit higher displacements compared with other actuators of similar size and weight. Further, these actuators can be easily instrumented to provide important response measurements such as collocated displacement and loading. This data can be fed back to the actuator in an internal servo loop to improve system accuracy and reliability. Solid-state actuators will be designed, built and tested in Phase I to demonstrate feasibility of the concept. One of the prototype actuators also will be instrumented and internal servo loop designs to enhance the accuracy and repeatability of the actuator will be designed and implemented. A set of appropriate machine tool applications also will be identified as part of the Phase I work, as will actuator instrumentation and controller designs for the identified machine tool applications. In a Phase II demonstration the prototype will be integrated into an actual machine tool application. Anticipated Benefits: Solid-state hydraulic actuators with forces of approximately 1000 pounds, displacements of 0.018 inches, and bandwidths of approximately 200 Hz have a multitude of applications, including its intended use as a machine tool precision position control mechanism. Further, through scaling, the actuator can be used for motion control and vibration suppression applications in robotics, printing press operations, and other high static and dynamic load and high bandwidth precision applications.",

We set a long term goal of 20 to 50 Watts of cw or ultra-high pulse rate mode locked UV output. The UV output will initially be at pre-set wavelength, and will be tunable with further development. Conversion efficiency from green to wavelength diverse UV outputs of up to 50% appear possible. The novel non-linear optical converter features an OPO in tandem with a mixing crystal. In comparison to other ring type converter geometries, the proposed configuration appears to have significant practical advantages in the area of optical/mechanical stability and control. Phase I examines analytically and experimentally the power conversion limitations of a fixed frequency UV output ring non-linear optical converter. Though ultimately driven by a diode pumped solid state laser, initial experiments will use conventional Nd drive lasers. In Phase I, a streat of cw-mode locked pulses drives the converter. To evaluate pure cw pumping and output, experiments and analysis will examine lowering the cavity losses and ring threshold. Phase I defines the design of development experiments as well as a more capable converter packate built in Phase II. The effort will have a strong synergy with other Aculight efforts, and compliments activities at the Air Force Phillips Laboratory in exploring analogous techniques for other wavelengths.",

Foveal scotomas also interfere with normal control of eye reations and saccades. Feasibility is tested for using electronic image shifting from scotomatous foveal retina to intact peripheral retina, as a con\\mpensation for central field losses. A scotoma simulator already developed by the PI will safely duplicate and experimentally control scotoma size, shape, and position. Visual images projecting around the fovea, are masked in real-time, by feeding eye position signals into a computer controlled visual display, safely creating the appearance of a scotoma. A image shift system consists of copying the visual image covered by the scotoma, and re-displaying that image at an eccentric viewing position on peripheral retina. Feasibility tests use two criteria: 1) the effectiveness of image shifting in compensating for performance losses due to foveal scotoma, and 2) the occurrence and effect of abnormal eye movements created by image shifting. Independent variables include the shift image size, scotoma size, selection of peripheral viewing site, and synchrony of shifing with eye movements.

        "abstract": "A target angle estimation technique making effective use of the spatial degrees of freedom of an adaptive array radar system has been developed by ASI and demonstrated to yield unbiased and efficient angle estimates in near-main beam jammer environments. The program objective of progressing towards a feasibility demonstration includes optimizing system designs including the detection and post-detection angle estimation functions for specific long wavelength low observable adaptive array airborne and ground-based radar systems. For the airborne (STAP) radars, the designs will include effective cancellation of both direct side lobe and near-main lobe jamming and the terrain scatter jamming, ground clutter. The simulation models developed in the Phase I program will be designed for use during the Phase II program with field-acquired, multiple-channel data as inputs. For low target elevation angles, adaptive array radar angle estimation techniques specifically designed to mitigate the target multipath degradation effects - and based on two ASI proprietary approaches - will be further developed and evaluated. Candidate DoD radar test beds for use during a Phase II program have been identified and provide the basis for a detailed Phase II plan to be developed.",

        "abstract": "Automated Dynamics Corporation (ADC) proposes to extend the use of the thermoplastic composite in-situ consolidation process beyond fabrication of cylinders to open-section structural components. The thermoplastic in-situ consolidation process is an emerging out- of-autoclave processing technology that has been demonstrated by ADC and others to provide low cost, high performance cylindrical structures. Given the non-isothermal characteristics of the in- situ consolidation process, asymmetrical thermal stresses through- the-thickness of the composite laminate are developed during fabrication which manifests themselves in the form of warping in the case of an open-section geometry. The objective of the proposed Phase I effort is to 1) develop an understanding of the factors contributing to the warping phenomenon, 2) identify approaches by which warping can be eliminated or controlled to acceptable levels, and 3) demonstrate viability of proposed approaches in limited fabrication trials. If successful, the proposed effort will provide a low cost, out-of-autoclave process for the fabrication of large, thermoplastic composite wingskins and fuselage components.",

A chemical recycling process is proposed that will allow the components of these waste materials to be converted to valuable hydrocarbons, fillers and fibers that can then be reused or sold. The proposed chemical recycling process is a low-temperature, catalytic method that breaks polymers down into low molecular weight fractions of the starting prepolymer material. Fibers and fillers my be separated from the liquid hydrocarbons and reused in secondary applications. The hydrocarbons may be refined and used as chemicals, fuels, or polymer precursors. Initial feasibility studies have shown that the conversion process is applicable to a wide variety of commodity plastics. The proposed Phase I program is to determine the applicability of the conversion process to high-temperature polymers used as composite matrices including epoxies, bismaleimides, phenolics, and engineering thermoplastics and to identify the conversion products.

        "abstract": "A modified engine cycle based on the early intake valve closing of the Miller or the Adkinson cycle is proposed to meet the needs of the future Military Advanced Diesel Engine. The concpet involves the principle of short, effective compression with long expansion ratio to provide high brake thermal efficiency. This concept is executed by a variable timing rotary valve placed before the standard intake poppet valve. Easy starting can be had by reverting the rotary valve in phase with the conventional intake valve timing. The rotary valve and the variable timing mechanism are the only additional equipment needed to fulfill the requirements of this engine cycle. Thus, a low cost, simple and reliable high output engine can be achieved. The concept can also be used on a gasoline reciprocating engine. Since the effective compression ratio is low, the compression temperature is lower, resulting in an ideal natural gas engine, or low NOx emission engine as well. The modified Miller cycle engine can be insulated with proper ceramic coating and low specific heat rejection of 12 but/bhp-hr can be achieved. High temperature components and tribology will be incorporated in the cylinder liner, piston ring and piston area.",

Diamondlike nanocomposites constitute a new class of materials that exhibit unique combinations of technologically interesting properties including high adhesion to vertually any substrate (including metals, crystalline and glass dielectrics, plastics), excellent chemical and diffusion barrier properties, good hardness, high elasticity and flexibility, high wear reasistance, very high thermal-shock resistance, extememly low frictioncoefficient, controllable electrical properties, controllable refractive index, and good thermal stability expecially in oxygen-free environments. In earlier research, coated specimens survived a nine-month exposure to the corrosive environment at the bottom of the black sea with no degradation in structure or properties. These coatings are deposited at low temperature (300-500K), and the size of the substrate is limited only by chamber diameter (currently a substrateof maximum size 760 mm can be coated). Both interior and exterior surfaces can be coated. Additionally, the few micron thick films can be continuously graded in composition and hence properties tailored from the interface to the bulk, to attai9n high adhesion and desirable thermal conductivity in the same coating. The possibility of structural reinforcement of the substrate material also exists. Phase I work will be devoted to comparative evaluation of technology alternatives, empirical confirmation of the protective properties of the DLN especially for naval weapon applications, and development of a detailed technical design approach for a manufacturing technology.",

The composition of DBLN coatings can be controlled to provide a wide range of tailorable properties including mechanical, optical and electrical behavior. DLN exhibit excellent adhesion to a wide variety of substrates with minimal interface layer thickness, and minimal intrinsic stress. The proposed approach takes advantage of the tailorable properites of this hard, thin film coating that consists of an amorphous quartzlike and diamondlike structure doped with controlled quantities of metals.

A significant opportunity exists to dramatically improve detector fabrication and performance by employing thin film pyroelectric materials for the detector element. While encouraging pyroelectric properties have been reported in several ferroelectric materials, PbTiO3 is advantageous because of its high pyroelectric coefficient (40-90 nC/cm2.K at 297K), high Curie temperature (490 degrees C), mechanical and chemical resistance. PbTiO3 can be deposited in thin film form. However, unless thermal mass is minimized, pyroelectric sensitivity is severely reduced.

Although these materials have good thermal shock resistivity compared to other structural refractories, their thermal shock resistance is not good enough for monolithic plasma containment devices. A new approach will be used to improve the thermal shock resistance of these two materials. The approach is to prepare fibrous monoliths. In the fibrous monolith approach a cellular structure is produced that will allow stress delocalization and redistribution on a microstructural level. The fibrous monolith consists of a cellular net work of the primary material separated by an interface material. The interface material must be lubricous to allow sliding of the cells of the primary material. Localized stress concentrations can not be transferred across the interfaces. The interface also allows crack deflection fracture mechanisms to further improve reliability.",

Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy can be effectively utilized to meet this need. As an example, Advanced Fuel Research, Inc. (AFR) has successfully employed simultaneous FT-IR reflection and emission spectroscopy to measure the sheet resistance of shallow junctions and the surface temperature during an anneal at elevated temperature (up to 950oC) on a 2 sec time scale. This project will develop the technology for microelectronics fabrication with on-line wafer-by-wafer characterization by FT-IR, and automated real-time process control. The objective of this Phase I project is to develop a contactless technology based on FT-IR emission and transmission spectroscopy to monitor SiO2 film production. The project will employ advanced FT-IR components developed specifically for process monitoring and proprietary software which measures film composition as well as thickness with imporved accuracy compared to present methods. This technique is also intended to monitor the presence of mechanical stress as well as substrate temperature. The proposed technology can be applied to improve both wafer quality, and yields for the production of epitaxial silicon, silicon oxide, silicon nitride, and polycrystalline silicon. In addition, FT-IR instrumentation, capable of real-time monitoring has extensive commercial potential for safety, health, and environmental applications (e.g., continuous emission monitoring, ambient air monitoring, and other process monitoring applications). This project will be led by the joint venture of AFR and ON-Line Technologies, Inc. (ON-Tech). Texas Instruments, Inc. (TI) will be a subcontractor. Phase I will prove the feasibility of data collection during the production of SiO2 films by Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) in a Rapid Thermal Processor (RTP). On-Tech will design an FT-IR measurement system. TI will fabricate calibrations samples. AFR will measure the ex-situ film characteristics, and develop the analysis method and software.

        "abstract": "We propose development of a 'smart' optical preprocessor that installs as an integral part of the light gathering optics of first- or second-generation forward looking infrared imaging systems (FLIRs). This optical preprocessor is based on an advanced-art imaging acousto-optic tunable filter (aka, A-O filter). These newly-configured A-O filters are programmable to seek out specific spectral features of any potential target, at video rates, with throughputs approaching 100%, and with diffraction-limited clarity. One device can be made to operate from the UV to the mid IR. This versatility far surpasses any other spectral imaging approach. Every object has (or can be given in painting) a unique IR optical signature. In our concept, emblems or 'flags' are painted on friendly targets giving unique IR signatures but still camouflaged in the visible spectrum. These paints are modified formulations of camouflage coatings. Two example approaches are deuterated-modified and IR laser dye-modified polyurethane camouflage paints. Deuterated-modification shifts the IR absorption bands around 3.4 um while IR laser dyes will provide intense absorption lines in the near IR 90.7-1.1 um). Non-friendly targets, of course, can also be directly acquired and identified using the same optical preprocessor hardware. Once their IR spectral signatures are known, camouflaged targets used by foes can be isolated from background clutter. In other missions, objects such as vegetation types (i.e. coca plants) or vapor cloud hazards (e.g., chemical, biological or carcinogenic) can also be identified through their optical signature.",

However, the actual energy product achieved in the laboratory is ~50 M Oe and the best commercial magnets exhibit only ~45 MG Oe. The inability to fabricate magnets with energy products close to 64 MG Oe is caused in part by 1) an imperfect grain alignment and 2) the presence of a large amount of non-magnetic secondary phases. We have conceived a novel processing technique that would dramaticlaly reduce the amount of secondary phases and at the same time improve the grain alignment. We propose to build a magnet fabrication facility that would enable us to realize magnets with energy products close to the theoretical limit. The proposed method reduces the number of steps in production and it is therefore expected that the overall production costs would remain competitive despite the need for stringent process control. We also propose to design and construct a few prototype electromechanical devices using the high energy magnets.",

In DoD applications, the proposed microsensor can be used for monitoring temperature exposure of personnel, food, and medical supplies in the field.

One laser pulse must be transmitted and received for each pixel in the image and considerable processing is required to register the different pixels and assure a coherent two-dimensional image. In addiition the mechanical scanner is complex, decreases reliability and can be adversely affected by high accelerations. The staring, multiple-pixel, imaging, ladar receiver proposed herein, called the Laser Radar Focal Plane Array (LR-FPA) is an important, necessary and innovative advance over existing systems. The benefits resulting from a multiple-pixel receiver include: (1) Covering a large field of view (FOV) with a single pulse. (2) No mechanical scanner is required in many applications. (3) A high laser pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is not required. (4) Pixels are always registered, without processing.",

        "abstract": "This proposal concerns the development of procedures and software for implementing the Dynamic Flowgraph Methodology (DFM), a methodological approach to modeling and analyzing software-based control systems for the purpose of reliability/safety assessment and verification. Using DFM, models representing causal and timing relationships between software functions, interfacing hardware and external system parameters are analyzed to produce \"timed\" fault trees which relate the values of system variables at discrete points in time. The development of dynamic, multi-valued (non- binary) fault trees represents a significant technical advancement in system safety and reliability analysis. These fault trees explicitly identify the causal and timing effects leading to system events of interest. This information can then be used to eliminate system faults resulting from combinations of software logic errors, hardware failures and environmental conditions. The use of the tools developed by this research, instead of traditional testing and verification techniques, will enable NASA and its contractors to save large amounts of effort and economic resources when demonstrating the safety of digital systems and software.",

These systems must meet stringent requirements in the areas of: (1) dispatchability, or operational readiness to support missions; (2) dependability, or the ability to perform critical functions correctly during the duration of the mission; and (3) responsiveness, or the ability to deliver computing services at rates sufficient to meet time-critical processing deadlines. Automated tools are needed to evaluate the implications of complex design alternatives in these areas of system effectiveness. Phase I research will determine the feasibility of an automated tool set for integrated evaluation of fault-tolerant avionics system reliability and performance. The tool set will consist of separate design capture, design translation, and design evaluation capabilities. Quantitative measures of effectiveness that will be produced by the tool set include system maintainability and availability, probability of avionics system failure during missions of given duration, and critical function response times and resource utilizations. Capabilities provided by existing automated tools, including the START tool for integrated reliability and performance analysis, as well as other reliability prediction tools such as HARP, SHARPE, and ARAM, will provide a starting point for the tool set specification to be developed in Phase I.",

        "abstract": "The field training of Reserve Component units is difficult because of limited training time and facilities and the difficulty in assembling all necessary player personnel. Computer wargames which allow interactive play of player personnel are a relatively inexpensive alternative and supplement to field exercises. Unfortunately, most existing simulations are designed to exercise maneuver command and staff tasks and little play is possible to exercise the full array of combat service support (CSS) tasks. The current versions of JANUS do not realistically model CSS functions and therefore, high priority units of the National Guard, such as Forward Support Battalions (FSB) are not afforded the opportunity to play CSS planning and execution. Advanced Systems Technology, Inc., proposes to modify the existing ARPA JANUS-3D wargame to permit exercise to two critical combat service support functions to demonstrate the utility of using JANUS-3D to training FSB command and staff personnel. The proposed modifications incorporate areas of medical support and resupply of high-use Field Artillery ammunition. The modifications will possess necessary granularity and fidelity to exercise personel, allow for play of medical and ammunition resupply impacts on maneuver operations, and permit assessment of JANUS-3D wargame training capability in a UNIX environment. Anticipated Benefits: Development of a JANUS-3D model for use in training National Guard Forward Support Battalions and use of the 3D capability in other military and civilian simulations.",

THE ADAPTIVE CONTROL SYSTEM WILL PITCH THE ROTOR BLADES IN ANTICIPATION OF A GUST (FEED-FORWARD), RATHER THAN AFTER ITS ARRIVAL.  THE RESULTANT MORE STABLE ROTOR POWER REMOVES THE NEED FOR DOWN RATING OF THE EQUIPMENT LEADING TO GREATER ENERGY CAPTURE AND FEWER START-STOP CYCLES.  FEED-FORWARD CONTROL IS INHERENTLY STABLE.

        "abstract": "The Aeronix Phase I task will address the problem of incorporating Imagery/High Speed Fleet Broadcast (HSFB) Receive Only Capability into the Multi-Mission Advanced Tactical Terminal (MATT) System. The significance of this effort is providing additional capability for field users of the MATT system. The MATT system connects military platforms with secure communications networks to provide tactical intelligence information to a variety of users. The current Built 1 MATT design supports UHF line-of-sight and/or UHF satellite communications with reception, decryption and data processing functions for the TADIXS-B and TRAP data links. Imagery uses compression/decompression techniques to transmit video images over limited bandwidth links. HSFB is an upgrade to the current Fleet Broadcast System (FSB) which will operate in the HF frequency band or narrowband in the UHF band. HSFB supports time division multiplexing of multiple data sources into a common data stream at up to 19200 bps. Incorporations of the HSFB UHF signal and imagery data will be addressed by Aeronix Phase I task. Incorporation of Imagery/HSFB in the core MATT system must be done without adversely affecting system performance. The Phase I task will identify the system requirements associated with insertion into MATT. Architecture tradeoffs will be performed and a top level design will be developed. This design will reflect the baseline for the Phase II prototype kit development (build, fabrication, assembly, checkout and integration. )",

Thehealth of HIV-l/AIDS patients may be better maintained through lower toxicity and more appropriateantiviral use. All currently approved HIV-l antivirals are targeted against reverse transcriptase (RT).Specific mutations in RT confer resistance to these antivirals. The aim of both phases of this SBIRproposal is to develop DNA chips to detect resistance conferring mutations in RT from clinical samples.In Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by 1) designing a set of overlapping DNAprobes that corresponds to the most common Ziovudine (AZT) resistance conferring mutation site in RT,2) synthesizing DNA chips containing arrays of these probes using light directed parallel chemicalsynthesis, 3) hybridizing fluorescently labeled target DNA to the chips, and 4) discriminating resistantand sensitive DNA sequences at this site. Completion of these Phase I goals will demonstrate thefeasibility of using DNA chips to detect and monitor mutations in HIV-1 that confer resistance toapproved and investigational therapeutics. In Phase II we will extend the DNA chip design to detect allknown mutations in RT that confer resistance to approved HIV-l antivirals and investigate the sensitivityof the assay to mixtures of viral genotypes. In Phase Ill, we will test the chips in a clinical laboratorysetting and investigate DNA chips to resequence the entire pol gene. This will allow application of thechips to detecting mutations that arise in response to investigational therapeutic compounds. Successfulcompletion of the research will lead to an effective diagnostic for resistance conferring mutations to thepol gene and permit the application of the technology to other HIV-l genes.",

        "abstract": "The focus of the Phase I work proposed herein is the preliminary design of a Coherent Phase Cavitation Monitoring System (CPCMS) for turbomachinery. Cavitation is the process of boiling water which occurs when local hydrodynamic pressures in the areas of accelerated flow drop below the vapor pressure of the fluid. When cavitation occurs on the turbopumps for liquid rocket engine propulsion systems, it can i) severely degrade the overall system efficiency, ii) cause excessive structural vibration, and iii) create erosion damage to the turbopump blades. The proposed Coherent Phase Cavitation Monitoring System will utilize our proven innovative signature analysis techniques to accurately detect the cavitation inception point (when it occurs), severity (magnitude), and location, with an on-line, continuous monitoring (stand-alone) system. The ultimate effectiveness of this system will be attributed to its unique signal processing ability to optimally extract cavitation generated signature without being subjected to the commonly encountered high frequency discrete interference. The Phase I effort will focus on the overall system design; sensors, data acquisition and evaluation of optimal signal processing techniques. The end result will be the overall Cavitation Monitoring System design to be used by both NASA and industry for online cavitation monitoring of turbomachinery systems.",

Global competition in manufacturing, limitations in fiscal and physical resources, ecological constraints, and technically challenging mission goals require that productivity be increased in the design, fabrication, and utilization of new or improved materials. The technical approach is based on unified learning and interpretation of combined process and product composition data in terms of resulting product properties. The approach builds on the results of two successful prior technical efforts. One is the CAD/Chem methodology by AI WARE, Inc. for exploring relationships between product formulation and product properties. CAD/Chem is based on neural-net computing and evolutionary programming. Another contributing methodology is the QPA work (US Patent #5032525) relating process sensor data, process control actions and product properties. The result of this work will be a methodology for building material models for interpolation and extrapolation from existing experimental data. The models will be accurate and useful because they will realistically incorporate process information instead of just nominal compositions; structure will be included in the model implicitly and explicitly if feasible. The models can be used to predict and discover. OPTION TASK: None submitted.",

Data contained in these databases will include text, graphics, sound, video, etc. The project will provide 2 kinds of services: 1. Index services to increase the ease and efficiency of locating information. 2. Retrieval services to present and conditionally deliver the selected data to the user. This project will simplify the task of accessing widely distributed databases and reduce both the costs and the time required to search them. The project speeds searching by building a mesh of index servers. This allows very rapid location of relevant resources, and the potential to keep the indices constantly updated. The project facilitates access and retrieval by caching resources located by a query, and allows the user to preview them before downloading them over low-bandwidth network links. The user sees a unified system instead of a large collection of databases. Anticipated Benefits: The government and private sectors can use this system to integrate databases on an enterprise-wide or even industry-wide scale. In addition, organizations can use the idexing service to track individual documents on an enterprise-wide basis or to provide a virtual searchable library of all of the organizations documents.",

However, the hole drilling costs associated with fabricating the injectors can be large, and the small holes that are desirable to achieve optimum atomization can be either too expensive or impossible to produce. We propose a novel injector fabrication method that avoids expensive laser drilling and \"platelet\" processes, and will result in injectors with superior atomization performance. These injectors will atomize liquid oxidizer into an evenly distributed spray of very small (30 microns) droplets that will vaporize with decomposed solid fuel gases. The innovation lies in a new way to form very small, uniform, cylindrical holes in a thick (0.02 to 5 cm) metal injector plate.

Both assessment of bone support and thedetection and measurement of small changes in bone and soft tissues are fundamental tot he intraoralexamination. The need for improved image resolution with minimal patient exposure has long beenrecognized. In conventional X-ray detection media, such as thick phosphors and film screens, thereexists a problematic tradeoff between the increasing thickness and decreasing spatial resolution due tolateral light spreading. Current X-ray sensors therefore limit the effectiveness of many radiographicprocedures and necessitate unduly high patient exposure. To address this situation, we will develop anovel imaging sensor based on a structured CsI scintillating plate coupled to a large area charge-coupleddevice (CCD). This microstructures plate consists of micron-sized columnar crystal structures whichprevent lateral spreading of the scintillation light through the process of total internal reflection. Fordetecting dental X-rays with high resolution, the proposed concepts allows a high detection efficiencywithout sacrificing image quality. A large area, novel scintillation plate coupled to a suitable large-areCCD will exhibit 99% detection efficiency, excellent dynamic range, and high spatial resolution. Theseare desirable properties for high contrast intraoral imaging procedures such as digital subtractionradiography for accessing small progressive alveolar bone loss.",

A critical advantage of human operators over ATR systems is their ability to make use of situation awareness in identifying targets. ALPHATECH proposes a research program to identify the critical parameters that influence the effectiveness of a human working with an automated system to maintain situation awareness in order to detect, identify, and acquire targets. We will build on the results of an investigation already underway at ALPHATECH, sponsored by the Army Research Laboratory Human Research and Engineering Directorate, on the design of effective displays for aided target-recognition systems. This research concentrates on human-ATR performance in context-free target-recognition decisions. The completed work will provide a starting point for the proposed new effort, which will introduce the critical factors of context and situation awareness into the target-recognition decision. In Phase I we will develop hypotheses, conduct pilot experiments using ALPHATECH's Macintosh-based ATR-Interface Testbed, and prepare an Experiment Plan for Phase II based n the results of the pilot experiments.",

Phase I test results have shown the ability of MEBS to reduce NOx to below 9 ppm.  Most importantly, these results are achieved at a much lower cost than SCR, of ultra-low-NOx burners under development.  Using the Phase I test results and cost data, it was estimated that the MEBS would be 70 to 90 percent lower in cost-to-remove-a-ton-of-NOx than FGR-based burner and SCR, respectively.

The Investigator stated that increased fetalhemoglobin in cells of patients with beta-hemoglobinopathy ameliorates the clinical symptoms of theunderlying disease. Several pharmacologic agents have been used to stimulate HbF synthesis duringrecent years. Treatment of patients with 5-azacytidine and hydroxyurea has resulted in higher fetalhemoglobin levels. Despite this, the clinical benefit has not been clearly established. Most agents whichhave been employed are either toxic or have been implicated in carcinogenesis. Therefore there isconsiderable interest in identifying less toxic agents which have potential to increase fetal hemoglobin.Thus far, only a handful of these agents have been tested, mainly due to the lack of an appropriateexperimental system that allows a rapid and accurate determination of the effect on hematologic cells.The Investigator indicates he has recently developed a novel, two-phase liquid culture system forgrowing erythroid progenitors derived from the peripheral blood of normal individuals and patients withhemoglobinopathies. He states that this system has proved to recapitulate in vitro many of thehematologic effects of hydroxyurea in vivo, including the stimulation of fetal hemoglobin production.The purpose of this research is to utilize this methodology for measuring total and fetal hemoglobin. Hewould employ the method for mass screening of agents to determine their fetal hemoglobin stimulatingpotential. The ultimate goal of these studies is to identify drugs with little toxicity which have asignificant potential for stimulation of fetal hemoglobin. He intends to optimize the conditions of theirculture system for stimulation of hemoglobin production and then screen various agents to determinetheir effects. Subsequently, he will use the methodology to study the modes of action of agents whichappear successful in stimulating fetal hemoglobin production.",

Phase I of the project willconduct feasibility study for the development of a non-isotopic sensitive assay to detect the deletionsof five frequently occurring genotypes of alpha-thalassemia using differential PCR. The Investigator willuse newly developed DNA/PCR mediated color complimentary assay which they developed to test driedblood samples on filter papers. These will be obtained from patients with alpha thalassemic disorders.The specimens will be made available to them by Dr. Griffin Rodgers, the Chief of the MolecularHematology Unit at the National Institutes of Health. We will develop a diagnostic kit for the detectionand quantification of hemoglobin alpha-genes in patients with alpha-thalassemia. The kit will be usedfor screening potential carriers with alpha-thalassemia in the United States, Southeast Asia andSouthern China. This should identify patients at risk of having offspring with symptomatic alpha-thalass-emia disorders. The Investigators note correctly that current screening methods are not practical forwidespread use and do not differentiate different types of alpha-thalassemia syndromes. In pursuit ofthe above, they plan to conduct studies on a micro-DNA-PCR assay to detect and differentiate deletionsof alpha-hemoglobin genes from dried blood samples. A method for using dried blood samples will beuseful in performing field studies. They then plan to establish the feasibility of a DNA-PCR mediatedcolor complementary assay to detect hemoglobin alpha gene deletions from dried blood samples and tocombine these two methodologies in to a simple and sensitive diagnostic kit for the alpha-thalassemias.Preliminary work is provided to show the feasibility of the methodology. In these experiments, theydemonstrated that deletion of hemoglobin gene alpha1 or alpha2 can be determined using three sets ofprimers from alpha thalassemia syndrome patients by differential PCR. In preliminary studies, they usedthis method to examine the hemoglobin alpha gene status from nine normal subjects and sevenalpha-thalassemia patients. These studies show that they can clearly differentiate alpha gene deletionsin these patients. They can be differentiated by measuring the band intensity of the target chains(alpha1, alpha2) and reference chain (beta-actin) after PCR amplification and gel electrophoresis. Theyalso have applied PCR mediated color complimentary assays on several normal subjects and found thisPCR mediated CCA can be used as a rapid sensitive method to detect alpha gene deletions by omittinggel electrophoresis. They postulate that after the assay is improved and stabilized, it would be auseful method of establishing clinical diagnoses in this disorder.",

We also have identified a growth inhibitory activity in CM that blocks growth factor stimulated 3T3 cell growth.

        "abstract": "This proposal investigates candidate main rotor blade de-icing systems which offer signature reduction capabilities. In comparison to traditional mechanical boot style de-icing systems, electrical de-icing systems are considered. One such candidate is a novel electrical thin film resistive de-icing system, which shows potential to lower the RCS levels associated with main rotor blade systems. This de-icing approach is a modified form of resistive heating. The resistive element is comprised of a thin sheet of resistive material in the areas of ice accretion on the rotor blade surfaces. In contrast to traditional resistive heating where highly conductive wires are used, a film of resistive material can be used to achieve the desired low observable (LO) specifications. This approach would be applicable as both an ice prevention technique and a de-icing technique. Basic evaluation of this approach will be performed through numercial and experimental investigation. Comparisons will be made to the traditional mechanical and electrical de-icing systems with various signature reduction techniques to assess the viability of the thin film resistive de-icing system.",

This device will be highly suited to the analysis of organic compounds in complex fluidsand will allow biomedical researchers to both identify and quantitate various species of interest rapidlyand with no previous training in the use of a mass spectrometer. The instrument, an atmosphericpressure chemical ionization-time of flight mass spectrometer (APCI-TOF-MS), will provide for theefficient ionization and delivery of analyte species to a mass sensitive detector with electronic integratingcapabilities. Various chromatography conditions (flowrate, buffer concentration, solution conductivity)will have minimum impact on the performance or reliability of the instrument by virtue of a specialultrasonic nebulization inlet system which has been specifically engineered for the delivery of liquids toanalytical instruments. As a package, the combination of the ultrasonic nebulization system and theAPCI-TOF-MS will provide solvent-independent operation over flowrates ranging from capillaryelectrophoresis range to microbore LC range (0.1- 400 mu l min-1). The TOF mass analyzer andintegrated transient recorder will allow even the most rapid elution conditions to be maintained whiledelivering high sensitivity and very high subsecond dynamic range.",

        "abstract": "The Navy's plan to launch and retrieve Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs) from submarines will require precise control of the UUV when it is in close proximity to the submarine hull. The hydrodynamic forces experienced by the UUV when it is near the submarine are significantly different from those it experiences when it is far away. In order to design a successful control system for the UUV, therefore, a method is needed that can predict these hydrodynamic forces when the two bodies are close together. The objective of the proposed effort is to develop a capability to predict the hydrodynamic loads and trajectories of a UUV and submarine while operating in close proximity and possibly colliding with each other. The basis of the proposed effort would be an existing unsteady computer code, USAERO, which already has a very general capability for computing flows about multiple body configurations in arbitrary motion. Under the proposed Phase I effort, certain modifications would be implemented which would demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. Further improvements would be identified for a Phase II follow-on effort that would productionize the method as a useful and effective tool in the design environment.",

We proposed to use the advanced processing architecture of the Image Understanding Architecture (IUA) in an AI paradigm that combines these various forms or processing. In particular, we proposed to utilize the IUA for recognizing vehicle types from multisensor data fusion, and then using sensor and domain knowledge to control the extraction, grouping, and matching of image features against stored abstract models fo the various vehicle types. In Phase I, we will use static images of military targets to experiment with extracting various image features such as lines, arcs, and regions from both visible and IR images. These features will be perceptually organized to form sysmbolic descriptions of complex imaghe events. Model matching algorithms will be developed to classify the image events based on abstract models of known vehicles.

Al(x)Ga(1-x)N is a compound III/V semiconductor system with a bandgap tunable from 220 to 365 nanometers (x=1 to x=0). Thus selecting x=0.4 we expect our UV sensors to detect only the UV emission from the flame (or plume) and not respond to the IR signal. This makes the sensor immune to false signals from the hot furnace background or the missile body. We also plan to use the GaAs substrate to monolithically integrate the preamplifier with the UV sensor.

Our approach is based on several innovations. These include the use of single precursor synthesized A1N powders that we feel will avoid carbon and oxygen contamination. Our reactor design is unique and has the flexibility of moving the charge or the seed to the high or the low temperature zones. This flexibility is based on one of our proprietary furnace designs. The crystallization approach we propose is a modified Bridgeman technique. The seeding initiates on the tip of a conical zone. in our future Phase II program, with the availability of flat single crystal substrates this design will be modified. Dr. Glen Slack currently at G.E. research and development Center will serve as a consultant on the project. He has the distinction of producing the only known bulk A1N single crystal using A1N powder. We feel that his association coupled with our unique A1N powder chemistry and the furnace design will enable us in demonstrating the feasibility of our approach in the Phase I program. Anticipated Benefits: High quality short wavelength lasers and UV detectors will result from a homoepitaxial scheme of A1N and A1GaN deposition on A1N substrates. These devices will find use in imaging, graphics, and multicolor video displays. They will also be useful for optical recording and storage, flame detection for boiler systems.",

In order to meet the needs of small robust spacecraft missions, Phase I of this project, carried out by AMT with support from Honeywell Space Systems Operations (HSSO), will attempt to demonstrate the feasibility of producing new CMGs with output torques ranging from 2-100 ft.-lbs. having a weight of less than 40 lbs. It is expected that the reliability will be typical of HSSO CMG products which is higher than .9995 after eight years of operation in space. Lightweight CMG requirements for small robust spacecraft will be established. A preliminary design of a CMG will be generated using advanced composites. A model of the smallsat CMG will be fabricated to demonstrate the overall size and componentry needed.

Recent MRI technique development has made possible sensitive detection of breast cancer and other abnormalities, but the major manufacturers of MRI systems have not provided high performance RF coils; the coils would help make these techniques practical for imaging the breast. We seek to develop a rf coil array. The rf coil array will provide at least a 40% improvement in signal to noise over available technology. The coils will also provide the potential for simultaneous acquisition from both breasts in the time usually required for single coil imaging. These goals will be accomplished by the application of a generalized theory of quadrature reception which is unique and proprietary technology. RF coil geometries provide the proper orientation to the spin system with elements arranged on a hemispheric form to be non-interacting and noise independent. The result would be an optimal coil array, and it would make possible shorter imaging times and/or higher resolution images on the 2,000 plus MRI systems for which the array could be readily adapted.",

Although the BECS performs the necessary balloon control functions reliably, it is not easily reconfigured when system requirements change.

ATA envisions a more effective solution based on recent advances in electronics, coupled with a modular software approach. We, in collaboration with the Physical Science Laboratory (PSL), propose to create a programmable and scalable Acquisition, Control, and Telemetry System (ACTS) by designing and implementing a modular hardware/software architecture that uses the VME bus standard. Consequently, the ACTS will take advantage of commercially available electronics, and provide such features as multiple telemetry streams, automatic software configuation, and experiment processing support. ATA has been at the forefront of many successful system integration tasks performed for the Air Force over the past 18 years. In addition, PSL has been involved with high altitude balloon experiments and telemetry systems for many years. Together, our understanding of system integration and balloon systems will ensure that the ACTS meets the needs of current and future balloon projects.",

BY OPENING UP A WHOLE NEW DIMENSION, SPACE, THAT CAN BE PACKED WITH SIGNALS, SINGLE-USER CHANNELS, FREQUENCY SLOTS IN A LOCALIZED CELL FOR EXAMPLE, CAN BE CONVERTED INTO MULTI-USERCHANNELS. THE GOAL IS TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WHILE STILL MAINTAINING THE QUALITY OF LINKS AS MEASURED BY OUTPUT SINR,OR BER, WHICHEVER IS APPROPRIATE. THE BASIC IDEA BEHIND THEPROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO ESTABLISH MULTIPLE SPATIAL CHANNELS AT THE SAME \"FREQUENCY\", I.E., SPATIAL-DIVISION MULTIPLE-ACCESS (SDMA). CLEARLY IF THIS CAN BE SUCCESSFULLYACCOMPLISHED, THE INCREASE IN CAPACITY IS SIGNIFICANT. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED EFFORT IS TO ASCERTAIN THE APPLICABILITY OF ESPRIT, A TECHNIQUE FOR REAL-TIME SIGNAL PARAMETER ESTIMATION, AND RELATED CONCEPTS TO THE WIRELESS INFORMATION NETWORK ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING BOTH MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS, DIGITAL OR ANALOG, AND PERSONAL COMMUNICATION NETWORKS. IN PHASE I, RESEARCH INTO AND DEVELOPMENT OF ACCURATE SOFTWARE MODELS OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC ENVIRONMENT WILL BE CONDUCTED. THESE MODELSWILL BE USED TO SIMULATE REALISTIC SCENARIOS ON WHICH ESPRITAND RELATED ALGORITHMS CAN BE TESTED AND APPROPRIATE SIGNAL DETECTION, ESTIMATION AND DEMODULATION TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT PHASE I WILL CULMINATE INTHE SPECIFICATION OF AN EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM FOR TESTING THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUES IN A REALISTIC ENVIRONMENT. THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FUTURE OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS, BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN, AND WOULD CONTRIBUTE SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE COMPETITIVENESS OF DOMESTIC COMMUNICATIONS RELATED INDUSTRIES IN THE WORLD MARKETPLACE.",

We will use computer aided computational modeling to design a low cost synthetic analog. We will provide proof-of-concept for selected FSII's and validate their ability to meet military specifications including MIL-I-27686 and MIL-I-85470.

The UV spectra from the free radial combustion components correlates with combustion effectivity in terms of predetonation, and provides a real time basis for central control of excess air ratio, internal combustion temperatures, and other fuel injector parameters. A system for the engine and powertrain control using this sensing method is expected to provide a remarkable improvement in engine performance characteristics. These GaP UV combustion sensors have the advantages of low cost, high sensitivity to ultraviolet light, insensitivity to visible light, and excellent tolerance to high temperatures commonly encountered in internal combustion engine compartments. Detector diodes fabricated using liquid-phase epitaxy show excellent dark current and visible-blind performance; high bandgap GaP material leads to enhanced high-temperature operation up to 500-600 degrees C. The high material quality of GaP and the low-cost of device fabrication lead to significant economic advantages over other high bandgap candidates, such as silicon carbide. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - The visible-blind gallium phosphide UV sensor with excellent high-temperature reliability would have numerous applications in astronomy, high-energy physics, medicine, chemical processing, and other optical analytcal measurement methods. Integration can lead to UV-sensitive CCD detector arrays, with tremendous potential for area-surveillance and safety monitoring.

        "abstract": "Wavelet techniques, in the form of time-scale or time-frequency analysis, have potential applications in the field of communications. This proposal addresses three research areas to be developed in this discipline. (1) Waveforms constructed of wavelets themselves demonstrate fractal, or multi-scale, properties that can make them useful for data modulation, scale-division multiple access (SDMA) and spread spectrum. Fractal modulation techniques leading to all of these constructs will be developed. (2) A class of waveforms -- based on coefficient matrices for othogonal wavelets of compact support -- already shown to be useful for covert, or low prbability of detection and intercept transmission, will be adapted to yield MA waveform sets having both covert properties and potentially higher capacity per unit bandwidth than conventional techniques. (3) The theory of Weyl-Heinsenberg frames will be applied to the construction of real-number error-correcting codes suitable for use of \"DSP\" channels where burst or dropout errors may predominate. Anticipate Benefits: The project has commercial application to progressive transmission of imagery, noninterfering multiple access/multiplexing for users at scaled data rates, multimedia communications, digital radio, satellite direct broadcast, cable TV, municipal communications and covert networks.

        "abstract": "This Phase I SBIR proposal represents a cooperative effort between Atlantic Aerospace Electronics Corporation and Texas Instruments, Inc. It is aimed at developing and assessing the feasibility of two innovative and fundamentally different approaches to track-before-detect (TBD) processing for passive airborne IRTW and IRST sensors. TBD processing techniques are required for airborne surveillance and threat warning applications in order to effectively counter the very low contrast IR signature of modern threats. Current TBD approaches can provide good signal gain but are computationally very costly and impractical for real-time implementation in compact, low power airborne hardware. The two proposed techniques each offer potential for major performance gains relative to existing methods. However, since they are based on entirely different signal processing approaches, there exists the possibility for potentially combining the best features of both to achieve performance in excess of that afforded by either alone. In addition both approaches offer good potential for smaller, lower power hardware implemenatations than competing methods. In Phase II we will synthesize an algorithm that incorporates selected elements of both approaches in order to maximize detection performance, reduce false tracks, and minimize processor size, weight and power requirements for airborne applications.",

Our basic approach is to utilize a tetrahedral finite-element representation of the antenna as a commn model for the analyses. A user would begin with a canonical or baseline representation of the antenna, composed of solids and surfaces within a CAD tool environment. The user then applies structural and/or thermal boundary conditions, meshes appropriately and analyzes for structural deformations and/or thermal gradients. The resulting model (no longer the baseline antenna) would then be re-meshed with tetrahedral elements with appropriate electromagnetic dielectric properties (temperature sensitive) and boundary conditions applied. A finite-element/boundary integral electromagnetic analysis then computes the impact on gain and VSWR due to the mechanical and thermal stresses placed on the antenna.

We willapply our unique capabilities to simultaneous ration imaging of calcium ion and cyclic AMP in single livingcells. For calcium we will use the fluorescent dual wavelength excitation-single wavelength emissiondye fura-2, and for cyclic AMP the single wavelength excitation-dual wavelength emission fluorescenceenergy transfer dye \"FICRhR\". We own the exclusive world-wide rights to this technology for smallmolecules developed at UC San Diego. In this phase I application we will first develop the reagent forcyclic AMP imaging in production quantities, establish methods of stabilization for its distribution anddetermine the proper hardware, software and calibration procedures to accurately utilize it for thedynamic measurement of cyclic AMP in cells. We will then develop techniques for the simultaneousmeasurement of cyclic AMP and calcium in single living cells using the fluorescent probes, \"FICRhR\" andfura-2. Success at simultaneous measurement of these two major cell second messengers will beimportant in providing the tools to elucidate a myriad of cell functions which are interregulated by cyclicAMP and calcium. Furthermore, success in this project will confirm the applicability of this generalapproach to the dynamic analysis of other substances of intracellular regulatory importance, potentiallyimplicated in a wide variety of diseases.

According to this method a deaf speechreader places his hand on a talker's shoulder with his fingers lightly against the neck; thus, the talker will obtain clues relating to voicing and dynamic speech intensity. The method was invented by a postlingually deaf Swedish male and has been studied since 1986 by several investigators including one of the applicants for this grant (Plant and Spens 1986). The original user's performance is outstanding, and the method has found to be effective on 24 postlingually deaf subjects even without training (Ohngren 1992). The Tactilator , an experimental device, has been built (Ohngren 1992). This device allows an individual to obtain similar information without coming into direct physical contact with the talker; the direct hand-neck contact is replaced with a contact microphone, an appropriate amplifying system and a bone receiver which is hand-held by the deaf speechreader. The purpose is to refine this experimental design; we will replace the contact microphone with a more convenient noise canceling microphone plus suitable processing circuits. We will also study the technique's utility, both as an inexpensive aid-to speechreading and as an adjunct to other tactual and implant methods. We will develop an inexpensive prototype based on an existing product, to design and implement effective evaluation methods, and to begin studies of performance using several variations of the Tactiling method.",

        "abstract": "Today many robots are being applied in areas where accurate positioning and orientation of the robot end-effector is required. A practical approach to achieve accurate positioning of the robot end-effector is through the use of an external measuring system. In 1986, a 3-D and 6-D laser tracking interferometer systems (LTIS) were commercialized and have been used worldwide for robotic applications. However, LTIS has severe limitations such as being too expensive, lacking robustness for some industrial applications and lacking capability for measuring orientations dynamically. This proposal presents a Phase I work plan to develop an innovative, low-cost, robust, next generation laser tracking system (LTS) of robot position and orientation measurement. An innovative absolute laser ranging system based on a technique referred to as \"repetitive time-of-flight\" measurement will be developed. The system measures the elapsed time for a light pulse to repeatedly travel between an emitter and receiver, and converts the time to precise distance measurement. To measure angles (pitch, yaw and roll) of the robot in rel-time, an advanced optical sensor will be also developed in this program. Successful development of this next generation LTS will have significant impact in industry. In addition, it creates many opportunities for precision engineering and robotic research.",

We will investigate the benefit gained by using the translation invariant wavelet transform (TIWT), developed at Aware, Inc., in the best-basis wavepacket algorithm. the TIWT provides better signal representations than those resulting from the standard wavelet transform.

The anticipated results are a number of electrically effective, space stable coatings that can be confidently used by NASA and the aerospace industry in general to provide protection to spacecraft from electrical charge build-up and solar heating problems in a single coating system.",

        "abstract": "The burgeoning growth of image and video databases demands fast and effecitve methods for representing and searching image collections. Most current approaches depend upon labeling images with text keywords. Manual labeling is labor-intensive and difficult, because one must predict which parts of an image will be of future interest, as well as what query terms will be used for the retrieval. This research seeks to develop a fully automatic method for representing images that allows query by images, subimages, or terms. The Context Vector appraoch, previously developed for document retrieval in ARPA's Tipster Text Processing Initiative, will be generalized to Image Context Vectors (ICV's) that can handle the special requirements associated with image retrieval. For example, ICV's are designed to be robust with respect to changes in size, position, and orientation of objects within an image, as well as partial occlusions of objects. Phase I will provide a proof-of-concept for the ICV approach as applied to a database of 200-500 images. Phase II will demonstrate effective performance on video images and ona large image database, will experiment with advanced representation techniques, and will explore neural network learning algorithms for adaptive improvement of initial queries. Anticipated Benefits: A successful project will allow automatic indexing and flexible searching of image databases and video libraries; queries can be images, snippets (subimages), or terms. Image Context Vectors may lead to fundamental advanceds in Image Understanding by catalyzing new approaches to image representation.",

The advantage of the non-equilibrium plasma chemical process for the control of NOx, VOCs, and air toxics is that it can operate at ambient temperatures, enabling its application after existing gas cleanup equipment such as electrostatic precipitators, scrubbers or bag houses or in processes where the VOCs or air toxics are from plant or building exhausts. Such a process is also suitable for control of odors. It is felt that non-equilibrium plasma chemical processes are a new, innovative, and cost-effective approach to prevent and control NOx emissions from stationary and mobile sources.

        "abstract": "Berkeley Optics Corp. conceived a novel idea that could reduce the cost of optical fiber connectors and couplers dramatically. In the invention, the core of the fiber is gradually enlarged into a cone-shape (called \"core-extension\") . The core-extension is made by immersing the output end of a fiber in a UV-curable polymer, and then coupling UV light into the input end of the fiber. The UV light divergently radiates from the output end, exposing and solidifying, or increasing the refractive index of, the polymer. Thus a light-guiding core- extension is formed at the end of the core, enlarging the core size from less than 0.1 mm to as large as a few millimeters, making the fiber-to-fiber connection much easier. Since the core-extension is self-aligned, self-attached, the cost of the fabrication could be very low. The core-extension was demonstrated in our laboratory. The US Patent Office decided to allow patent after only six months from the application, surprising us greatly, presumably to encourage us to commercialize the concept fast. This proposal is for making a rugged and very low-cost connector. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Fiber optics has reached a stalemate after a decade of the brisk exploitation of the point-to-point market. As it reaches offices and homes, much larger numbers of interconnection are required while number of users sharing per-interface cost is reduced. Until the costs of connectors and couplers can match those of the coaxial cables, this stalemate will not break. Leg aa, kelev On\"@ t,could break this stalemate.",

THE SENSOR IS CAPABLE OF DIRECT IMMERSION IN SOLUTION AND SHOULD PROVIDE CONTINOUS DATA ON EITHER CUMULATIVE MERCURY EXPOSURE OR INSTANTANEOUS CONCENTRATION.  SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS, SUCH AS ATOMIC ABSORPTION, ATOMIC EMISSION, AND ATOMIC FLUORESCENCE PROVIDE ADEQUATE SENSITIVITY; HOWEVER, THESE ARE DISCRETE LABORATORY TECHNIQUES AND CANNOT BE EMPLOYED FOR CONTINUOUS MONITORS OR IN THE FIELD.  ONE METHOD OF DETECTING PPB TO PPM LEVELS OF MERCURY IN SOLUTION INVOLVES THE USE OF NOVEL CLASS OF PIEZOELECTRIC SENSORS, KNOWN AS THE SHEAR HORIZONTAL ACOUSTIC PLATE MODE (SHAPM) SENSOR.  THESE SENSORS MEASURE THE PERTURBATION OF ACOUSTIC WAVE, IN SITU, TO CHANGES IN ELECTRICAL AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES.  THEY ARE READILY OPERATED IN CONTACT WITH A FLUID MEDIUM AND ARE SENSITIVE TO SUBNANOGRAM QUANTITIES OF MASS ADSORBED ONTO THEIR SURFACE.  THE SHAPM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RIVAL COLD VAPOR ATOMIC ABSORPTION AND ATOMIC FLUORESCENCE SPECTROSCOPY TECHNIQUES, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY OFFERING IN-SITU, CONTINUOUS MONITORING.  THE MONITOR IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE A MEASURE OF THE MERCURY CONCENTRATION IN MINUTES AND TO BE REUSABLE MANY TIMES.  PHASE I WILL DEMONSTRATE THE PRINCIPAL OF OPERATION OF THE NEW SENSOR TO DETECT NANOGRAM PER MILLILITER LEVELS OF MERCURY IN SOLUTION.  THIS EFFORT WILL INCLUDE THE FABRICATION OF SEVERAL DEVICES WITH DIFFERENT FILMS WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO CONFER SPECIFICITY FOR MERCURY.  RESPONSES OF THE SENSORS WILL THEN BE MEASURED OVER VARIOUS MERCURY CONCENTRATIONS.  EFFECTS OF POSSIBLE INTERFERENTS WILL ALSO BE EXAMINED.  PHASE II WILL CONCENTRATE ON OPTIMIZATION OF THE MOST PROMISING DEVICE WHICH WILL INCLUDE ASPECTS SUCH AS DURABILITY, REUSABILITY, SIGNAL PROCESSING, AND PACKAGING.",

The detector system will be designed to operate with a pencil-beam sca m ing x-ray source, and will detect the Compton interacted radiation that is scattered back toward the X-ray source. It will image horizontal views of thin layers of the underground structure. The detector we propose to use is cadmium zinc telluride (CdO-gZnO.2Te) ' which is a solid state detector. It is insensitive to vibrations and temperature change, consumes low power, is densely stacked, and has a response time better than 1 Ksec. The detector system will be designed to image layers of the ground with a voxel resolution of 2 cm cubes. The source-detector system will be insensitive to height variations, and will be designed to optimize backscatter radiation from the surface to 6 inches deep in the ground. This system could be successfully implemented with dual energy imaging if it determined necessary or desirable during Phase I. In Phase I we will evaluate experimentally a bench setup and image thin layers of soil. We will report the findings and present our reco m mendations for the development of a full system.",

        "abstract": "In order to grow plants for food on the Space Station, it is very important to cultivate and maintain appropriate microbial eco systems. These ecosystems are essential to fostering proper root development and permitting rapid and healthy growth of plants. Until very recently, there was no simple method or instrument that would permit the monitoring of microbial ecosystems. However in 1989, Biolog, Inc. introduced a revolutionary test kit technology that allows one to monitor micro-scale samples of microbial populations simultaneously in 95 different metabolic tests. This technology was developed originally for pure cultures of microorganisms to yield species level identifications. Then in 1991, Jay Garland and Aaron Mills showed that mixed microbial populations from a variety of soil and water ecosystems also gave unique and characteristic metabolic fingerprints when monitored continuously in Biolog MicroPlates. Recently, their findings have been confirmed at several other universities. In this SBIR submission, we propose to develop a very small instrument that incorporates all of the necessary components (micro test cards, continuous carousel with vision system, and software for analysis and recognition of microbial ecosystems). The instrument will monitor ecosystems of the Space Station, alert the astronauts to undesirable changes, and help determine remedial actions.",

In this project, we will develop an improved Boyden chamber chemoinvasion assay. The Boyden chamber chemoinvasion assay will utilize Transwell\u00bf membranes with a defined basement membrane overlayer that will allow in vitro assays for metastatic cells to be conducted with greater speed, reproducability, and sensitivity than existing assays. The chemoinvasion assays evaluate the invasive activity of metastatic cells by quantitating their ability to respond to a chemoattractant by penetrating a layer of reconstituted basement membrane (RBM). Several recent papers which utilize Matrigel\u00bf as an RBM preparation have shown that this assay can be conducted in 6 hours and clearly discriminates between invasive and non-invasive cells. However, there is considerable assay variability, which is caused by l) variability in the Matrigel overlayer and 2) poor adherence of Matrigel to the polycarbonate membrane (resulting in gaps through which non-metastatic cells can migrate). During Phase I, patented BSI photochemistry will be used to covalently couple type IV collagen and heparin onto the polycarbonate membranes with the expectation of greatly improving the adherence of RBM to the membrane. Also, initial experiments will be conducted to develop a defined RBM preparation to replace Matrigel. Modified polycarbonate membranes overlaid with Matrigel and defined RBM compositions will be evaluated with metastatic and non-metastatic cell lines. Phase II studies will complete the development of a defined RBM preparation.",

Similar electrodes for calcium, sodium and potassium are already in use in the clinical analyzer market. The major goal of the proposed project is to improve the lithium selectivity of the most promising family of lithium ionophores by covalent attachment of the ionophores to flexible ethylene oxide and siloxane polymers.

        "abstract": "Operation of cooling tower and boiler systems requires frequent monitoring of water chemistry parameters to obtain the necessary information for adjustments to the water treatment program. Failure to perform the necessary adjustments can result in reduced service life and poor energy efficiency resulting from corrosion, scale and fouling. A hybrid absorbance/emission spectrometer is proposed as the key sensor in an on-line system for automatic monitoring and expert system control of cooling tower and boiler systems. The absorbance portion of the system uses a field proven technique for on-line analysis of process solutions using specially calibrated pattern recognition algorithms to interpret the UV-VIS absorbance signatures obtained at frequent intervals using a series of two flow cells of differing path lengths. The emission portion of the system is a patented technique that uses a special flow cell in series with the absorbance cells to energize a sample with an arc discharge and collect the resulting emission pulse using a fiber-optic probe. Absorbance and emission spectra are detected and interpreted using a common spectrograph and embedded computer. They system also includes non-optical sensors such as pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen and temperature. The system is capable of simultaneously detecting the major water quality and treatment chemical parameters required to monitor and adjust cooling or boiler water treatment programs.",

        "abstract": "The ACRW is a revolutionary new design of a high speed, VTOL aircraft with STOL and CTOL capabilities. The aircraft consists of a circular rotating wing (CRW) which is rotably mounted to the fuselage. The CRW has the shape of a specially designed disk, is free of aerodynamically active flight controls or propulsion members and provides lift for forward flight and gyroscopic stabilization of the aircraft attitude. The fuselage will house the payload and the propulsion and control means. We have researched the ACRW aerodynamic theory, performed design calculations, conducted wind tunnel tests and computer analysis of the flow about the CRW. The wind tunnel tests and the computer analysis show a significant increase in the lift over drag when the wing is rotating as opposed to the fixed wing. Recently we have built two radio-controlled models and successfully investigated some of the ACRW flight characteristics. Bostan Research, Inc. is proposing to demonstrate the ACRW feasibility as a high speed VTOL UAV by testing three radio-controlled flying models. We have already built two new models and a third will be built during Phase I R&D. The models will have an identical configuration and mode of operation as the proposed ACRW-UAVs. The test results and flying principles will be equally applicable to aircraft of larger or smaller sizes having different configuration and uses. The enhanced aerodynamic characteristics together with the wing gyroscopic stability and artificial stiffening due to centrifugal forces, could make the ACRW the first truly efficient, high speed VTOL aircraft.",

The synthetic soil is zeolite based and slowly releases nutrients but unfortunately becomes acidic with time. The proposed research evaluates using natural and synthetic components to buffer soil pH within optimum ranges for plant growth. Objectives are to characterize pH buffering properties of zeolite and apatite (primary components of NASA's active synthetic soil), evaluate pH properties of select buffering amendments, and formulate combinations of amended zeoponic soil. The effort consists of acquisition and characterization of raw materials (zeolite, apatite, and buffering agents); evaluation of pH buffering properties of individual materials using equilibration, titration, and incubation experiments; formulation of various zeoponic treatment combinations using preliminary data and acid-base balance scenarios; and feasibility testing of formulations using additional equilibration, titration, and incubation experiments. Phase II will consist of growing plants with low, medium, and high pH preferences in amended zeoponic soil to refine the innovation to meet NASA needs and allow commercialization. The expected result is development of zeoponic soil with enhanced buffering capacity. NASA will use the innovation in their Regenerative Life Support System.",

        "abstract": "The cancer treatment modality called \"hyperthermia\" has been used to successfully treat thousands of cancer patients around the world. However, hyperthermia has never achieved its true potential because of technical limitations in steering and focusing the heating pattern. The goal is the solution of some of those problems. To do so, we will build and test an elliptical 24 dipole phased array applicator system (called the Sigma Ellipse). This new RF applicator will be innovative in four respects: l) the applicator will have the capability of varying the longitudinal length of the energy focus; 2) the primary heating pattern will have three dimensional dynamic electronic steering capability; 3) the applicator will have the ability to reduce localized superficial heating without significantly altering the central heating focus; and 4) the applicator will have an elliptical shape in order to reduce the amount of bolus water weight supported anteriorly by the patient. These improvements will increase treatment effectiveness and patient tolerance. Included with this project will be a new multi-channel RF generator with independent phase and amplitude capabilities and a modified external B-field sensing probe system for enhanced treatment monitoring. If this project is successful in achieving the expected improvements, the prototype designs will be refined for manufacturing and for clinical trials. Success in this project would provide the potential for a major improvement in the treatment of cancer throughout the world.",

CFD tools are critical to analyze the high Mach number flows typical of these advanced flight vehicles because of limitations on experimental facilities under these extreme flight conditions. However, the validity of CFD codes is limited by their ability to accurately model the complex turbulence processes of high speed flows. Our recent innovations in the development of turbulence transport models based on renormalization group (RNG) methods promise to render many of the most difficult engineering problems of the NASP tractable. Here, we propose to extend and then apply these models to high Mach number wall-bounded compressible flows in which previous modeling efforts have failed. We shall use our HERCULES unstructured grid code as the initial platform for these studies. To expedite access to the new technology for Wright-Patterson personnel, as well as to provide critical feedback to CHI for the commercialization phase, we also propose to implement the new turbulence models in appropriate Air Force software. This work will yield a practical engineering analysis tool for the NASP project.",

However, because of the wide range of scales and physical phenomena, no single code is likely to handle all problems. Here we propose to develop a systematic hierarchy of coupled codes that employ high-order efficient algorithms, state-of-the-art parallel computing software, and advanced turbulence modeling techniques. In Phase I, we shall develop an important building block of this integrated package, namely, a renormalization-group (RNG) large-eddy simulation (LES) code for flow simulations on scales of up to O(100) kilometers in the horizontal direction based on a robust high-order finite-difference algorithm for parallel supercomputers. In Phase II, this new code will be integrated with simulation tools for three-dimensional modeling of meso- and large-scale circulations. In particular, data obtained from simulations using the LES code will provide the necessary input for modeling of vertical mixing in the oceanic boundary layer to be used for global circulation modeling. A key feature of this work is the implementation of new advances in RNG modeling of geophysical and space physical flows that leads to high-order stabilization of negative viscosity phenomena important for global dynamics.",

The system will use automated video processing, accompanies by new uses of positioning devices, and photogrammetric triangulation.

Liposomes prepared from phospholipids (PL) have been proposed to be a system that will enhance immunity to a wide variety of antigens, but they have not gained wide-use, presumably because of problems of cost and variable biochemical stability. We have data that suggests that a non-phospholipid liposome (NPL) made with a variety of single-tailed biodegradable amphiphiles solve these problems. Our hypothesis is that NPL will overcome the main disadvantage of PL's as carriers of antigens, namely lack of stability both in vitro and in vivo, but will have all of the previously documented advantages of PL in terms of delivery of immunogens and modulation of cells of the immune system. We will investigate in controlled studies in the mouse model, the immune system. We will investigate in controlled studies in the mouse model, the immune response to purified Hepatitis B (HB) antigens encapsulated in NPL. We will pursue 2 specific aims in this Phase I feasibility study to test: 1. comparative studies on different chemical formulations of PL's and NPL's in terms of in vitro stability of NPL's, and 2. the immunogenicity of HBsAg encapsulated in NPL's.

Ceracon has demonstrated the feasibility of forming tantalum plates having ultrafine grained microstructure, which exhibits isotropic mechanical behavior at low and high strain rates, and a significantly higher static strength than wrought and other powder metallurgy processed tantalum. However, an understanding of the micromechanics of the grain boundary plasticity needs to be developed, to assure the suitability of this material for warhead applications. A Phase I program is planned, which will investigate the relationship between this unconventional microstructure, processing, and dynamic mechanical properties. This work is expected to lead to the development of intelligent process control to consistently produce desired microstructures in tantalum for warhead applications. Phase II program will address intelligent process control and process scale up to facricate tantalum plate materisl for DOD applications.",

The compressor half will be designed to withstand excessive inlet distortion, and provide a compromise between maximum pressure ratio (to minimize combustor volume) and flow (to maximize engine Isp). Design speed will be selected to accommodate ATR engine turndown ratio requirements associated with vehicle boost, cruise, and loiter requirements.

Stringent precision requirements for devices and the demand for low cost manufacturing techniques emphasize the need for optimizing plasma reactors.

Phase I of this study will involve the development of a simulation tool to model plasma enhanced chemistry and particulate nucleation/transport in plasma reactors. These models will be incorporated into an existing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code capable of solving multi-component fluid flow, heat/mass transfer, and gas/surface chemistry in complex reactor configurations.

The models will be further refined and validated against benchmark experiments in Phase II. The validated model will be demonstrated on a PECVD reactor to optimize process efficiency and uniformity. During Phase III commercialization, the simulation tools will be made available to members of SEMATECH and the semiconductor industry for further testing and application. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - A validated simulation tool for plasma reactors will facilitate the optimization of plasma systems during the development phase.

HOMBAS will employ many key design features of HOMME in a new software implementation, but with three major revisions: 1) extended and improved user interface, 2) incorporation of models for time-extensive skilled performance, and 3) capability for linkage with other simulation software. A ke focus of our HOMBAS design is a powerful facility for constructing task descriptions of required human operator functions, and automatically interpreting them, along with an application-specific knowledge base, into applications of human performance micro-models from a HOMBAS resident library. The principal outputs of HOMBAS will be a timeline of human performance events that will be merged with other simulation events generated by the host simulation in which HOMBAS is embedded. HOMBAS will be designed for implementation in the CLIPS 5.0 environment on a 486-class PC.",

        "abstract": "AirLand Battle and AirLand Operations doctrines require quick, accurate decision-making in order to achieve the synchronicity and agility needed to execute the doctrine. Current decision makin aids at the tactical level are almost exclusively manual and failr to adequately integrate all combat power multipliers, such as artillery, intelligence, logistics, etc., into single integrated decision aids that can accommodate real time information. CHI Systems proposes to adapt and integrate the Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (TPB), tactical planning and orders, and tactical situation assessment processes into a single intelligent tool to be known as Automated Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (AIPB). AIPB will be able to fuse available tactical information to develop an initial decision supoprt matrix in support of a tactical plan, and then cyclically update the matrix with information from Army data systems such as the Maneuver Control System and Advanced Field ARtillery Tactical Data System. This tool will provide real-time tactical decision support for Battlefield Commanders and Operations staff thorugh the use of a flexible, cognitively engineered interface and advanced expert system technologies. The final result of Phase I will be the design of an integrated \"living\" decision support system that will assist both tactical planning and execution.",

        "abstract": "Electronically tunable optical filters are important components of freguency-agile sensor systems. Acousto-optic filters (AOTF) offer the best near-term technology for implementation of frequency-agile imaging optical sensors. These filters however, suffer from several limitations. On important deficiency is the limited off-band rejection attainable with these devices which is typically of the order of 10(-4) far off-band and closer to 10(-1) near off-band due to the presence of side lobes. This limited off-band rejection limits the application of AOTF-based devices to target discrimination problems where a weak signal must be discriminated against a high background. Recently, holographic filters have become available with extraordinarily high off-band rejection of the order of 10(-7). These devices, however, are fixed-bandpass devices, and are not suitable for frequency-agile imaging sensors. The present porposal is to develop an innovative electronically tunable optical filter with off-band rejection comparable to that of a holographic filter.",

        "abstract": "Fluorescence-lifetime based sensing provides a more robust and reliable detection method than intensity measurements which are notoriously prone to systematic errors. Measurement of fluorescence lifetime is also an important adjunct to quantitative spectrofluorimetric measurements in direct fiber-optic sensing systems. The reason for this is that dynamic quenching effects by other species in the sample may disrupt the correlation between a fluorescence intensity measurement and the concentration of analyte. In these cases, a fluorescence lifetime measurement may provide the additional information required to account for the effect of quenching on the measurement. We propose to develop a 1 0 MHz single-frequency cross-correlation digital phase fluorometer which exploits recent technological developments for inexpensive generation of the light modulation and cross- correlation frequencies. Additionally, we propose to replace the expensive analog electronics in current use for the phase measurement with a digital filter and digital phase detection thereby achieving a dramatic reduction in cost, while improving performance and reliability. The proposed approach will convert the problem of accurate phase measurement from a demanding analog hardware problem to a software solution with off-the-sheff hardware.",

To compete with alternate modes of travel like the interstate highway system and airlines, GA aircraft must provide transportation that is fast, economical, safe, and reliably usable in any weather. The operation of light personal transportation aircraft of the near future will be made economically viable by the application of NASA developed technologies. The NLF airfoil series is an important example of those technologies. With very low drag coefficients at cruise speeds, it makes possible single engine aircraft that provide truly rapid personal transit. Electromagnetic type deicing is another example of a NASA developed technology that will soon be important to the utility of small single engine aircraft. Electromagnetic techniques provide deicing systems that are light weight, relatively low cost, and require relatively low power for actuation. Deicing systems currently available, are either too expensive for small business and personal transportation aircraft, or are not built to maintain natural laminar flow. The development of an NLF compatible, electromagnetic deice system will be a significant step in making GA travel safer and more dependable.",

        "abstract": "The catastrophic drinking water treatment plant failure in March 1993 in Milwaukee was a direct result of the inability to control coagulant chemical dosage during significant changed in raw water quality.  This event largely dispelled the myth that only small water utilities were vulnerable to such control problems.  The current state of this critical technology, coagulant dose control, is woefully inadequate.  The Milwaukee failure is traceable to the inadequate tools plant operators have available to deal with this daily on-going problem at every plant site.  Optimization with the jar test, a trusted standard feedforward control method, is skill and labor intensive, too slow, and too insensitive for many modern water treatment plants.  Streaming current detectors - the sole automated feedback controller - cannot be calibrated to a known reference and requires skilled technicians to set and maintain control.\n\nA new coagulation control concept was demonstrated in Phase I to be feasible for achieving both feed forward and feed back coagulant control.  This utilizes a technique called colloid charge titration, but with a unique new method of end-point detection.  Clear Corporation Enterprises, Inc.'s Phase II objectives are (1)  design a prototype instrument capable of proof in field test based on applicability proven in Phase I, (2)  implement the innovative new end-point detection and feedforward/feedback technique in a rugged easy to use and affordable design, and (3)  validate system performance at a municipal water treatment facility.  The proposed program is attractive because it could address a seemingly intractable, critical control problem which has plagued the drinking water industry nationwide throughout is history.  This device, if proven effective, could provide operators even in small facilities with the means to prevent catastrophes like Milwaukee's.",

        "abstract": "Computer and engine studies demonstrated a 100% increase in diesel engine power with the use of 31% oxygen enriched air (OEA) versus standard 21% oxygen air. Additional benefits from OEA include: (1) improved fuel efficiency, (2) compatible with lower grade (volatility) fuels, (3) reduced CO and hydrocarbon emissions, (4) enhanced lean burn capability, (5) smoother less noisy operation, (6) better and cleaner cold starts, and (7) reduced particulate emissions. The major limitation in using OEA for enhanced (diesel) engine performance is no compact OEA supply system exists today. Our high oxygen permeability perfluoropolymer membrances dramatically improve oxygen flux capability and will supply compact OEA membrane systems to support enhanced (diesel) engine performance. Engineering studies indicate our perflouromembrane system productivity is 30 times better than existing competition and membrane devices smaller than 0.25 cubic feet will supply all OEA (diesel) engine needs at full throttle. Phase I focuses on proof of proudct concept by developing the needed thin film composite membrane structure to demonstrate high flux. Phase II will focus on developing expanded area prototype membrane modules and running both actual engine tests and associated computer modeling studies. Anticipated Benefits: This project introduces compact OEA membranes for improved power, fuel efficiency and pollution control of engines. Although engines are our focus, other applications will follow. These include (1) OEA for health care, (2) OEA for improved burner efficiency, (3) VOC abatement, (4) nitrogen enriching air for inerting operations and (5) industrial oxygen and nitrogen uses.",

        "abstract": "Compact Software, a leading software company in development of CAD tools for microwave industry has teamed up with Martin Marietta, Electronic and Missile System group, to develop accurate CAD tools for Coplanar Waveguide (CPW) discontinuity structures. The lack of comprehensive design information on discontinuities and other interacting structures, especially in the commercial CAD-tools, has so far precluded CPW transmission lines from being extensively used in MMICs. To this date, there are no commercially available CAD tools which can support both simulation and optimization of circuits containing CPW discontinuities. Therefore, a designer has to design coplanar circuits using a combination of CAD-tools which neither inspires design confidence nor achieves first pass success. During Phase I, we will identify, design, and fabricate a comprehensive set of CPW discontinuities applicable to GaAs monolithic circuits. We will establish feasibility by developing accurate discontinuity models for a selected number of structures over a large range of physical parameters experiments. During the Phase II program, we will complete the modeling and validation tasks for over 200 dicontinuity structures. The validated models will then be used to design and fabricate two coplanar millimeter-wave monolithic amplifiers. The final discontinuity models will be integrated into our commercially available circuit simulators. Anticipated Benefits: Inclusion of the proposed CPW discontinuity models in our commercially available circuit simulators will enhance the accuracy of coplanar based MMIC designs. Since no other CAD vendor offers such models, we anticipate product distribution in excess of 2000 units within the completion of Phase II program.",

HBTs are viable candidates for future applications in monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) where highly accurate linear and non-linear noise models are critical, especially for first pass design. The noise models in use today are based on approximations which disqualify them for use with HBTs. Therefore a need exists for the development of an accurate physics-based HBT noise model which removes the current limitations. Our proposed model, is based on a full treatment of shot noise theory in semiconductor junctions, eliminating the current approximations. For model validation, we will obtain HBTs from several MIMIC foundries and will use \"on wafer\" noise characterization to obtain accurate noise parameters as function of frequency. During the Phase II program, we will complete the bias-dependent noise models for both shot noise and flicker noise and integrate the proposed models in our commercilly available circuit simulators, Microwave Harmonica and Super-Compact. The CAD enhancements resulting from this effort will be of immediate benefit to the MIMIC community and also to the DoD, MIC, MMIC suppliers and commercial microwave companies.",

This Generalized Entire Domain (GED) approach was pioneered and developed by the principal investigator, Mr. Terry L. Krohn. The second is a Quadratic Surface Patch (QSP) physical optics and physical theory of diffraction model, co-authored by Mr. Krohn. This computer code has received national attention from the Electromagnetic Code Consortium (EMCC). Mr. Krohn is a member of the MOM technical working group for the EMCC. Both of the computer models discussed above interface with Computer Aided Design (CAD) geometry packages. The basis for this approach is that internal (non-edge) currents are well represented by optics assumptions. Optics assumptions are angle dependent whereas MOM matrices are not.

For example, an astronaut could use micro manipulators as \"additional arms\" when performing repairs in space.

Recent advances in fuzzy logic and ANNs have provided new modeling techniques to narrow the gap between the model and real physiology systems. Specifically, hierarchical fuzzy systems and other fuzzy logic modeling techniques will be investigated and applied to improve eye muscle and vestibular modeling accuracy. Temporal and/or asynchronous ANNS will be incorporated for enhancing the vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR) neuronal pathway model. Utilizing hierarchical fuzzy logic systems adds benefit to tranditional software moedling because as future physiological properties are discovered the model can be adapted to include these aspects. Further, by utilizing temporal and/or asynchronous properties, the ANN based neuronal pathway model will be closer to real physiological systems. Therefore, the Phase I effort will determine the feasible improvement in the modeling of the vestibular system, eye muscle, and neuronal pathway. In addition, a final model which encompasses the above three will be outlined for prototypes in the Phase II.

        "abstract": "Because of their low noise and enormous bandwidth, dc Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUID)s are very attractive as amplifiers for many applications. Conventional SQUID amplifiers are often not suitable for these applications, because the readout electronics employ flux modulation which imposes a severe bandwidth limitation and increases their complexity. For applications in space, this significantly increases the cost of preparing flight-qualified electronics. If the SQUID is not properly designed and damped, parasitic resonances are introduced, complicating the operation of the SQUID and leading to excess noise which degrades performance. We propose to develop a low-noise, two-stage SQUID amplifier with very simple electronics and appropriate packaging that is ideally suited for cryogenic detector readout applications in space. The amplifier consists of a single, low-noise SQUID input stage, followed by a coherently modulated, series-connected SQUID array output stage. A proven design optimization procedure is employed to ensure proper treatment of the parasitic resonances. Properly designed, the output noise is dominated by the amplified noise of the input SQUID and is sufficiently high to allow direct connection to a room-temperature preamplifier. Additional electronics are not required, and the high bandwidth and dynamic range are preserved.",

These were statisticaly searching, which allowed users to enter requests in plain English and retrieve documents based upon the statistical occurence of words; and concept based searching, which requires users to define concepts in a knowledge base and perform searches by entering a concept by its name. Both of these methods made some improvements in accuracy, but placed additional burden on the user. Statistical searching has not been readily accepted because it is difficult to explain the results. Concept based searching requires extensive labor to build the underlying \"knowledge base\" of search concepts. ConQuest Software, by using retrieval software, called ConQuest (TM), that includes the best of both statistical and concept based searching, but also eliminated the need for users to build a knowledge base. The objective of this effort is to combine ConQuest with new processing to reach breakthrough levels of precision and recall accuracy by exploiting the power of a large semantic network that includes, but is not limited to the contents of WordNet. The research results will demonstrate that linguistically based text retrieval systems have a higher upside potential than purely statistically based systems.

        "abstract": "Current time-marching methods for assessing periodic blade loads consume inordinate computational time, greatly restricting analysis and design based on such approaches. This study seeks to redress this drawback by implementing a novel time-domain decomposition algorithm on a parallel computer. This parallel scheme will achieve orders of magnitude reduction in computation times while making full use of existing sequential algorithms for simulating periodic systems on parallel computers. Perfect load balance will be accomplished and inter-processor communication minimized using the proposed scheme. Though the parallel algorithm is applicable to any time-periodic system this effort will focus upon the rotor-stator interaction problem using an existing highly accurate aeroelastic analysis. By basing the analysis on a validated fluid-structure interaction code, another drawback of existing rotor-stator codes namely the absence of a true aeroelastic capability will be repaired. In Phase I, validation exercises will be conducted on a parallel machine in order to assess the coding effort entailed in adapting an existing serial code to parallel computation and CPU gains over serial methods using the proposed technique. In Phase II. the technique will be extended to full 3D viscous aeroelastic turbomachinery rotor-stator computations on a parallel machine.",

DNA supercoiling is an important facet of biological processes that entail local helical unwinding or denaturation. Recent computer simulations have demonstrated the potential for clarifying the biological role of local structures and ligand binding on DNA super-coiling. The polyelectrolyte character of the DNA has not been included because of computational constraint. The present effort aims to develop a fast O(NlogN) method for the robust treatment of the polyelectrolyte effect in prototypical Monte Carlo and finite element computations. The method will be implemented on advanced parallel- processing platforms using a novel low-overhead communication strategy. The new strategy exploits the multi-level near-field/far-field structure of the fast hierarchical method to eliminate the globality of the electrostatic problem. The resulting computational tools will be designed to take full advantage of the computing power put forth by high-performance parallel-processing supercomputers and will serve to showcase a Grand Challenge application of High Performance Computing in large scale biological systems.",

        "abstract": "All rocket propellant power derives from the reaction of a fuel and oxidizer. Accordingly, all liquid rockets, and especially all cryogenic liquid rockets, have two complete fuel systems. One set each of containment tanks, pumps, instrumentation, and so on. Solid rockets, on the other hand, have only one fuel system, so to speak. The solid rocket motor contains the fuel and oxidizer in a rubber-like base. The fuel is called a monopropellant, since it is not necessary to mix the two components. It is interesting to speculate on how things could be different if we had access to a cryogenic monopropellant. Perhaps we could combine some of the best features of solid rockets and liquid rockets. For instance, we could have the fuel system simplicity of a solid rocket combined with the ISP and variable thrust of a liquid rocket. Accordingly, we have developed a new cryogenic monopropellant which is made by adding a hydrocarbon fuel such as methane to liquid oxygen. We will show how liquid oxygen may also be combined with a hydrocarbon fuel, such a methane, under controlled pressures and temperatures such that a single phase, totally miscible, liquid cryogenic monopropellant propellant is provided. Under the conditions described, the liquid oxygen/methane propellant is a single phase totally miscible liquid solution.",

It has, however, proven difficult to scale MPCVD of diamond up to production levels due to the small size of the plasma produced under the constraints of diamond growth. Crystallume has developed and convincingly demonstrated a proprietary scaling technology for microwave plasma diamond deposition.

The innovation is twofold: the damping elements will be advanced tuned-mass dampers (TMDs) that (1) use magnetically induced eddy currents as the dissipation mechanism and (2) have an adaptive frequency tuning scheme. As the most weight-effective means of increasing narrowband structural damping, TMDs will contribute significantly toward improved performance requirements: a robust magnetic damping mechanism will withstand high-G launch and environmental effects, including temperature extremes, and the capability for adaptive frequency tuning will extend the utility of TMDs to volatile dynamic environments. Magnetic TMDs will be developed with self-sensing, actuating spring elements to enable the devices to track and damp a structural mode(s) as it changes in frequency with environmental or mission conditions. These highly predictable, all-metal dampers will require no power during normal operation, will be unaffected by temperature variations, and will not age or outgas.

Sensitivity and throughput increases of 20 fold each may be realized through implementation of optical improvements and a new separation technique.

Fast risetime electro-optic Q-switching will be used with a very short cavity to minimize the pulsewidth. A novel resonator will be employed that will result in single transverse mode operation with a large spot size in a very short resonator.

The sensor is antiucipated to have an electrode applied on the coating of the test coupon. When this electrode and coupon are exposed to moisture, either by immersion or high humidity, the near de impedance of the coating-metal system decreases by one to two orders of magnitude. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements using these test electrode sensors, a potentiostat and lock-in amplifier will be correlated with adhesion of the paint to the metal substrate and corresion of the substrate. Ellipsometry and X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy will be used to quantitatively assess the de-adheion to the amount of corresion occurring. In this way, the sensor offers a quantitative measure of incipient corrosion unlike other corrosion monitors that simply measure the time of wetness or the corrosion rate of the sensor itself, or that require externam electrodes and a bulk electrolyte medium.",

This Phase I study effort is proposed to build a database of existing NAVSEA approved USH procedures and related commercial procedures which meet the criteria to be established under this study for technology transfer to fit submarine requirements. The database developed will provide the basis for the analysis and decision portions of the study. This process leads to the evaluation and recommendation conclusion which will be the study results as presented in the final report. These recommendations will provide the necessary data required to continue the program into the Phase II effort.",

        "abstract": "An inexpensive blue laser source is needed to satisfy the market for high density data storage: a storage density of up to 3 GB on a CD becomes economically feasible if the laser cost can be reduced sufficiently. However, the lowest cost configuration, in which an infrared diode laser is frequency doubled in a nonlinear waveguide, does not offer the capacity for blue light generation at high evough power levels. We have devised a modified waveguide fabrication technique which can significantly reduce the device cost and increase the output power. In Phase I we will demonstrate the technology behind our new waveguide approach and in Phase II we will optimize the design and demonstrate its full potential.",

However, the best 350 nm source, the Argon-ion laser, is incompatible with a table-top instrument since it requires installing permanent support utilities. This constraint has prevented the clinical use of techniques such as DNA sorting which would help determine treatment strategies for cancer patients, and it has limited researchers in problems such as AIDS research which require semi-clinical data. This project will develop a diode laser based UV light source which makes possible a table-top UV flow cytometer. In Phase I, we will build a UV source to demonstrate the new optics technology required for success. This will be the first diode-laser UV source. We will also work with our collaborators at Stanford University and Los Alamos National Laboratory to identify methods to evaluate a cytometer based on this source. In Phase II, we will construct prototypes, install them into our collaborators' cytometry machines, and begin experiments to demonstrate the system performance. In Phase III, we will work with a manufacturer to develop a commercial table-top diode-based multi-wavelength cytometry system.",

Commercial applications such as locating avalanche victims or others buried under snow packs and foliage are deemed feasible at HF. Bistatic and multistatic tomographic image processing techniques and algorithms at HF frequencies form the basis of the proposed imaging concept. The baseline bistatic/multistatic surveillance system will exploit illuminations from either LOS or OTH transmitters coupled with receivers on a small aircraft to detect buried targets by forming tomographic images of the target returns. Imaging at multiple frequencies and polarization diversity will be studied to identify targets on the surface and at various depths. lssues will be investigated including waveforms, antennas, receivers, processing and advanccd navigation systems/auto focusing techniques.

In this Phase I effort, the functionality of this design software will be demonstrated by development of a material property database, an automated model set-up module, 2D FEA, and the definition of a preliminary set of design rules. Presently, the method of TBC design is based on physical experiments which are time consuming and expensive. Furthermore, the interpretation of experimental data is difficult due to the complexity of the variables and their interactions in determining TBC performance and life. In Phase I, 2D FEA will be performed to investigate variable complexities in order to define specific design rules. The use of FEA as an automated experimental method will speed TBC development by providing a means of separating complex variable interactions.

A Tc-99m radiolabeled thrombus-binding peptide would be ideally suited to this task by virtue of its specificity, favorable pharmacokinetics, and low-cost isotope, and widely available nuclear medicine facilities. As platelets are a component of thrombi, synthetic peptides that bind with high affinity to the GPIIb/IIIa receptor on the surface of activated platelets provide a rational basis for the development of a thrombus-specific radiopharmaceutical. We now have preliminary in vitro and in vivo data that indicate that this is a viable approach.

Our efforts will extend the favorable results we achieved for a deep-water, wideband active sonar adaptive beamformer to the shallow water environment. The previous work resulted in two promising adaptive algorithms: Cholesky Factorization - Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (CF - MVDR) and Constraint Preprocessor/Joint Process Least-Squares Lattice Adaptive Filter (CP/JPLSL). We will apply a beam-space adaptive filter to provide Coherent Spatial Discrimination (CSD). The adaptive filter operates on beam data whereby, in addition to the selected primary beam, one or more adjacent reference beams are selected on each side of the primary beam. The reference beams are constructed such that they receive the interference, but are essentially prevented from receiving signals coming in from the primary beam look direction. The adaptive filter uses the reference beams to provide a good estimate of the interference contaminant in the primary beam. It then subtracts the adaptive filter output from the primary beam output to obtain the desired \"interference canceled\" beam.",

        "abstract": "We propose to develop 5 element, linear, monolithic, InGaAs-on-Silicon, spectrally selective detector arrays for the near-infrared spectrum (1.0 - 1.7 um). The technique of selective epitaxy will be used to grow (100x100) um area detector mesas on the silicon substrate. Special methods will be used to practically eliminate the misfit dislocations caused by the severe lattice mismatch between the InO Ga 47As absorption region and the silicon substrate, thus, resulting in a very high quality detector material. The expected room temperature leakage current is less than 10 nA at a reverse bias of 5V. The innovation consists of a new, unique, optically resonant InO.53GaO.47As detector that has a wavelength selective response. This resonant detector not only discriminates different wavelengths in a compact and solid state design, but also has the extended wavelength coverage and improved quantum efficiency over conventional photodetector designs. In addition, the silicon substrate will incorporate low readout noise circuitry using standard CMOS process. These features will represent a major advance in infrared detector array technology.",

FLC-SLMs meet requirements of the solicitation (kHz frame rates, scalability to 1000x1000 pixels) and the use of DOEs offers the flexibilty and ease of assembly needed for a cost effectivwe generic technology. We will also plan for the use of active devices such as SEEDs and quantum wells. Our Phase I objectives are: (1) identify crucial technial issues in the use of DOEs for planar optical systems through design, fabrication, and test of key optics, (2) identify and address crucial issues in module assembly and component mounting through experimentation with key manufacturing steps, (3) test key performance parameters of electro-optic components available in Phase I, and (4) develop a preliminary design and manufacturing process for a Phase II planar optical processor.

        "abstract": "A low cost approach to fire detection is proposed which utilizes color ad CCD Machine Vision Flame Detectors (MVFDS) and a new infrared imaging MVFDS to monitor engine overheat/burn-throughs as a possible replacement for thermal wire. It may also have flame detection potential. The IR focal plane array consists of over 80,000 microbolometers on a SI chip which can resolve small temperature differences on the surface of an engine in high temperature backgrounds. This new detector will use four fiber optic cables, vibration protected, interfaced to the chip, routed from the camera in an adjacent bay into the nacelle bay. One detector per engine will serve as four detectors and the four subimages compose a single image which is processed at speeds of 10-30 frames/sec as is now done with color MVFDS. The system has a low LCC, costs less than thermal wire and provides higher benefits of temperature resolution and reliability. A video output to the pilot will also be provided. The color CCD MVFDS will be tested and software developed to simultaneously measure smoke concentration. Blue and red LEDs will be used as emittters in various locations of the camera's FOV. The transmissivity and optical density will be measured as well as ratios of each color intensity. This ability will save the cost of using separate smoke detectors. It is proposed to use the MVFDS to monitor color changes of reflected light due to changes in temperature of thermochromic liquid crystal materials. These inexpensive materials change color as their surface temperature changes. By measuring color changes of these materials while simultaneously monitoring for flame and smoke, potential overheat and hidden fire conditions can be located and wanrnings given.",

        "abstract": "Power dissipation is becoming critically important in large scale systems particularly with the increasing need for portability. Research into design techniques for reducing power has been hindered by the inability of design tools to include power dissipation in the early stages of the design process. A method to incorporate nodal activity into Algorithm Specific Architecture Programmable (ASAP) VHDL chip generators has been established. This capability will enable the development of a correlation between power dissipation and a weighted sum of nodal activity. This will result in the ability to quickly evaluate the power dissipation of a system while it is still described at a technology independent, high level of abstraction. We then propose to investigate using this capability to enable the transition of two low power design approaches from academic concepts to useful techniques as part of a next generation low power design methodology. We will investigate a reduced voltage approach which maintains throughput by pipelining and a self-timed approach which is data driven (asynchronous) instead of clock driven. In addition to reduced power, attributes associated with a top down VHDL-based methodology will be preserved: reduced time-to-market, technology independence, technology retargeting/upgrading, and design re-use.",

The system will provide ignition to multiple thrusters enabling accurate sequencing of RCS engine clusters. A single laser firing unit will deliver laser light through optical fibers to laser ignition assemblies mounted in multiple RCS thrusters. The laser energy will heat a target in the laser ignition assemblies above the autoignition temperature of O/H mixtures. Laser ignition assemblies will be designed for use in torch type igniters and resonator cavities. The latter type of igniter can potentially eliminate the requirement for valves dedicated to igniter propellant control, instead relying on propellants from the main thruster valves. Elimination of these valves simplifies RCS thruster operation, reduces weight, and decreases system complexity. Built-in-test systems will verify system readiness and ignition. Advanced optical diagnostics for measurement of mixture ratio, pressure, and combustion stability can be incorporated into the system.

        "abstract": "Impulse response radars present a major detection problem for current and developmental Electronic Support Measure (ESM) receivers. These signals are characterized by short pulse durations and wide bandwidths, for which current and developmental ESM receivers are not optimized. Detection and characterization of received radar impulses would enable classification of the emitting radar source, including measurement of pulsewidth and pulse repetition frequency. Dynetics proposes a novel nonlinear signal processing approach to solve the impulse and ultra-wide-band radar detection problem. Specific advantages of nonlinear approaches are: 1. Narrowband signals from a dense signal environment are removed prior to pulse detection, 2. Input signal-to-noise ration (SNR) is not degraded, and 3. Pulse detection is performed in the time domain (SNR optimized). To analyze linear and nonlinear detection algorithms, Dynetics has developed an ESM computer simulation. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the benefits of this type of impulse detection. Specific issues to be resolved during Phase I include assessing intercept receiver requirements, specification of nonlinear processing techniques for the detection, characterization, and direction finding of impulse radars, and selection of an optimal approach. In addition, a preliminary design and analysis of the optimal ESM receiver will be performed.",

In operation, the interrogator transmits a 1024-bit coded sequence to the soldier via a highly directional laser diode beam. Within this sequence is a smaller, seven-symbol sequence that opens an electronic shutter and exposes a low-cost retroreflecting tape that returns an optical flash to the interrogator. The presence and timing of this flash establishes identification and makes the Soldier Identification System robust to countermeasures. The Dynetics proposed solution has a very small package size, is lightweight, and is resistant to countermeasures, all of which are critical for practical field uses.

        "abstract": "Eagle Eye will develop a highly reliable, miniature transponder that will permit a user to accurately locate the transponder using a satellite communication system. The transponder will be small enough to fit inside a wristwatch case and it could be worn on a wrist or packaged into an inconspicous place in a sensitive piece of hardware. In the event that a person such as a Special Forces operative or a downed Air Force pilot needs to be rescued, a low earth orbiting satellite will interrogate the transponder tag to determine its position. The Eagle Eye system will use a satellite system scheudled to be operational later this year. This SBIR Phase I proposal is to develop the most critical technology for the concept, the MMIC transmit/receive front end in a multichip module package. Eagle Eye will also develop a plan to demonstrate the product with the low orbit satellite. Key technologies for the concept include Microwave monolithic Integrated Circuits, MultiChip Module packaging to miniaturize a transponder, thermal control of the package, and an innovative differential Doppler location technique. The basic technology in each of these critical items has been developed by the Department of Defense. Thus, this system development represent commercialization of several DoD technologies as well as a potential dual use military and commercial product. Anticipated Benefits: Anticipated benefits are increased safety for Special Forces missions, increased probability of retrieving downed military pilots, and tracking military cargo and personnel for logistics support. Potential commercial applications of the transponder tags include locating back country hikers, Alzheimer's patients, tagged animals in the wild, and tracking package shipments.",

In this post-Soviet world, U.S. forces will be presented with not only expanded regional conflicts among Third World countries but also an increased nuclear, chemical, and biological (NBC) weapons threat in terms of diversity and frequency. The past decade has shown that many nations have opted to develop NBC weapons programs. This development has been either for aggressive purposes or as a deterrent against a neighbor who possesses or is attempting to possess such weapons. The V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft will be in the forefront of supporting the mission of this post-Cold War power projection fighting force. As such, the V-22 is faced with having to operate and survive in an NBC environment. Therefore, survivability of the V-22 must include NBC detection of contaminants in the aircrew breathing system or environmental control system (ECS) and alert/warn the V-22 crew when unacceptable levels are reached. Detection of the V-22 must be approached in a logical and integrated fashion, whereby, a concept of an NBC detection and warning system for the aircrew system and ECS is developed first. From this concept will evolve the equipment design and prototype upon which detection for the V-22 aircrew system and ECS can be accomplished.",

The emittance modulation is achieved using electrochromic materials whose infrared reflectance can be continuously and reversibly modulated. The coatings have a multilayer, thin film structure that allows emittance to be switched in response to a low voltage DC signal. Innovations in electrochromic materials, infrared transparent electrical contacts, and vacuum deposition processes which allow fabrication of the coatings with a large emittance modulation are proposed. The objective of the Phase I program is the fabrication and characterization of variable emittance coatings employing crystalline LixWO3 as the variable reflectance component. Emittance switching between ~0.2-0.8 in the 3-14 um wavelength range is sought for Phase I coatings. The coatings may be attached to external surfaces of spacecraft, individual instrument packages, or on radiator surfaces. They will allow a non-mechanical means of temperature control and heat distribution through radiant transfer between exterior and interior surfaces. These capabilities should greatly enhance the performance and flexibility of thermal management systems without adding significant weight or complexity.",

In addition to visible and near-infrared transmittance, the binders are chemically tailored to have no significant absorption bands in either the 3-5 m or 8-1 m atmospheric windows, increasing the choice and effectiveness of pigments used for signature control. In Phase I, three novel binders based on aromatic polyamide polymers will be synthesized and characterized. The aromatic stabilization imparts chemical and high temperature stability allowing the binders to meet chemical agent resistant coating (CARC) requirements. Spectral emissivities and complex indices of refraction of the binders will be determined from spectroscopic measurements (0.2-26 m) and resistance to CW-related chemicals evaluated. The relationship between the chemistry and microstructure of binders and the required chemical and electro-optical properties will be established and used as a strategy for further binder development. The binders are synthesized from inexpensive chemicals readily available in bulk quantities and will be formulated as a two-component paint system with minimal solvent requirements and low VOC emission. The Phase II effort would focus on optimizing binder properties, incorporating pigments for low emissivity and visual camouflage, and modeling the optical properties of various pigment and binder combinations.

A number of innovative techniques have been employed, including the oligonucleotide ligation assay and reverse dot-blot hybridization. The end-point, and to a certain extent the effectiveness of these assays, is determined by the sensitivity of the DNA detection techniques used. Progress has been significantly enhanced through the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, implementation of PCR can be expensive as well as equipment and expertise intensive. We have applied a technique with proven effectiveness in the field of immunoassays for the non-isotopic detection of DNA; initial data indicates an increase in sensitivity 10(2)-10(3) times higher than conventional techniques. The assay, which we have called EDNA-ELCA, uses the amplification of the coagulation cascade to produce a calorimetrically detectable end product. A DNA template is labelled with biotin and a haptene, and is then immobilised in a streptavidin coated microtiter plate. An antibody against the haptene is conjugated to a snake venom coagulation activator (RVVXa), and introduced into the microtiter well. The assay is then developed by the addition of coagulation factors, including an enzyme labelled fibrinogen. The deposition of enzyme labelled fibrin is indicative of a positive reaction. We have chosen three specific applications to prove the utility of this method. They are detection of the deltaF508 mutation of cystic fibrosis, a codon 12 mutation in the first exon of K- ras for colon cancer, and the mecA gene in methicillin resistant Staphlococcus aureus.",

        "abstract": "Lead is a widespread environmental contaminant occurring in airborne, soil, and aqueous media. It is a deleterious, cumulative body poison and its health effects are usually not reversible. Indoor and outdoor small arms firing ranges may contain serious airborne contamination from lead and other heavy metals that potentially threaten the safety of personnel that use these facilities as part of their training regimen. The purpose of this effort is to develop a compact, portable, cost-effective lead in air monitor that allows personnel to use the range undisturbed, but provides a record of ambient lead concentration and warns of a potential health risk. The instrument will be capable of both AC and DC operation. Innovations proposed will allow air samples to be taken automatically, potentially from several locations within the range so that one instrument can service an entire facility. The unit will also be autocalibrating to allow long-term operation without requiring maintenance nor disrupting the concentration of field personnel. The proposed designs will also permit expansion of instrument capabilities to other metals and soil/water analyses. The proposed technology will also be applicable as the basis for an inexpensive process for removing lead from the surrounding air as it is produced, thereby reducing or eliminating the health hazard in real time. This would also decrease contamination of surrounding soil and water, saving immense clean-up costs.",

This will be followed by implementation of a Neural Network Analysis (NNA) to the impedance data obtained. The resulting NNA transformed data will then be utilized by software based pattern recognition techniques to classify the hidden chemical corrosion site. The experimental program will be performed by: i) fabrication of laboratory FFTEIS instrumentation incorporating preferred components, ii) performing impedance measurements on relevant metal substrates subjected to hidden chemical corrosion, iii) developing and training Neural Networks for unambiguously detecting and determining the severity of hidden chemical corrosion on the subject metal substrates and iv) fabricating and performance testing prototype instrumentation.",

The PTCA will reduce the size and cost, and increase the reliability and power efficiency of the amplifier compensation. The effort will consist of: the design and layout of the attenuator resistors and terminations, a software simulation and analysis of the design, the development of thickfilm thermistor inks followed by fabricating and testing a prototype. Upon completion, this project will yield a working unit that can be used to replace temperature compensating circuits using active variable attenuators (Typically with GaAs FET or PIN diode elements) that are controlled by linearized drivers with temperature detection circuits. The resulting increase in reliability due to the elimination of active components and the reduction in the total amount of parts is achieved at a fraction of the current expenditure in terms of cost, size and power consumption.",

        "abstract": "Presently available technology for converting logistic fuels to hydrogen for use in fuel cells is unsatisfactory in three fundamental ways. First there is the problem that the hydrogen that is produced in the initial fuel gasification step contains impurities such as CO, H,S and NH, which must be removed since they would poison the fuel cell. Secondly the hydroden is diluted with CO, and N2 which make it unsuitable for use in some types of fuel cells and reduce the efficiency with which it can be used in the others. Thirdly to achieve any reasonable efficiency a complex heat recovery system is needed. This proposal describes a new technology for producing hydrogen from high molecular weight liquid fuels which avoids all these problems, i.e. fuel and water are fed to a single reaction vessel and the product coming out is, except for some excess water, virtually pure hydrogen. As is discussed in detail in the proposal there are good reasons to expect that this new technology will be highly efficient at full and part load, have low capital and operating costs relative to presently available technologies, have excellent transient response, near zero emissions of NOx and soot, and will have no materials of construction problems. Anticipated Benefits: Successful development of this technology will greatly increase the number of situations in which fuel cells are the method of choice for generating electricity.",

Literature shows that specific compositions in this alloy system have provided high figures of merit (3.2 - 3.4 x IO-3/Deg K at 3OOK) with a maximum Peltier cooling of 77 Deg K. Recently investigators at the University of Virginia reported a high figure of merit of 3.7 x 10-3/K for p- type (Bi, Sb)2(Te, Sb)3 alloy. The process selected for depositing the films in the proposed program will be a unique, high rate Microwave Enhanced CVO process (MECVD) developed at Energy Conversion Devices, Inc. ECD has achieved deposition rates as high as 3OO Deg. A/sec for amorphous Si-H alloys using this technique, and this process has been developed for depostion on large area surfaces.

The system will be based on ECD's ability to develop novel metal hydrides that have the potential to achieve gravimetric energy density of 2.5Wh/kg and volumetric energy density of 2500 kWh/M(3), while also having good hydrogen sorption kinetics, long cycle life, resistance to poisoning and low cost. Such a H-storage system will make the PEM and other types of fuel cells viable for commercial and military applications. Our previous work on disordered, multi-component Mg-based thin film hydrides has already achieved such high value for gravimetric energy density. However, these alloys have good kinetics only above 200oC. We will now attempt to reproduce these high storage capacity alloys in bulk with minimum loss of capacity, and during Phase II, modify them to improve the kinetics at low temperatures. ECDs technological leadership in metal hydrides was recently recognized by the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) when it was awarded a contract ($18.5 million/3 years) for the development of its proprietary nickel metal hydride electric vehicle battery. Anticipated Benefits: High energy density metal hydride systems for hydrogen storage, will allow fuel cell technology to be realized for many defense and commercial applications. The knowledge acquired under the program will also be applicable to a wide range of other products such as hydrogen fueled ICE vehicles and non-CFC heating and cooling systems, resulting in economic competitiveness within the United States.",

The innovative feature of the proposed Phase I effort is to combine the novel feature of the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method and the Eulerian/Lagrangian method into a unified solution algorithm for efficient, time-accurate calculations of multiphase free surface flows valid at all speeds. The proposed method reformulated the VOF equation to strongly couple two distinct phases (liquid and gas) and tracks droplets on a lagrangian frame using a unified predictor-corrector technique to account for the non-linear linkages through the convective contributions of VOF. The discontinuities within the sharp interface will be modeled as a volume force to avoid stiffness. The proposed method will be implemented into the FDNS code which has three-dimensional, multi- zone and combined Eulerian-Lagrangian capabilities. Further exten sions of the current proposed algorithm for handling other flow processes such as turbulence, droplet coalescence and chemistry are extremely feasible.",

        "abstract": "The proposed innovation is to develop thin inorganic barrier coatings to protect bare chip-on-substrate (COS) multichip modules in lieu of normally used heavy and bulky ceramic/metal cavity packages. Inorganic coatings will be deposited over assembled microcircuits precoated with stress-free, high-purity polymers, sealing them from external moisture and internal outgassing. Previous work involved plastic encapsulation alone or inorganic coatings followed by plastic encapsulation. These approaches suffer from either non-hermeticity or exposure of the assembled circuit to high deposition temperatures. Reversing the sequence obviates these problems. This project will analyze and select compatible inorganic and organic coatings to reliably protect COS microelectronics from extreme terrestrial and space environments. Based on Phase I, experimental validation of the approach will be planned for Phase II. A 6-month effort consisting of assessment, evaluation and selection of a COS packaging approach for multichip modules and preliminary experimental studies are proposed. This technology will provide NASA and the commercial community with a weight/volume reduction of 50-80% for each module-important in achieving NASA's goal for the next generation of microspacecraft. There is also a potential reliability improvement (interconnections will be reduced by 50%) and cost reduction (eliminates large high-I/O count cavity packages).",

It is believed that the use of specialized organisms will minimize many of the previously-recognized limitations of bioaugmentation including, wellhead plugging, requirement of toxic inducers, and oxygen depletion and competition-for-resources associated with adding nutrients to aquifers to prolong microbial activity. This work will expand Envirogen's collection of commercially applicable specialized degradative microorganisms (Phase I), demonstrate the efficacy of using them for in situ remediation (Phase II), demonstrate the economical and commercial feasibility of bioaugmentation for in situ remediation (Phase II), and demonstrate the field application of the organisms for in situ remediation of a contaminated aquifer (Phase III).

This study is designed to investigate the hypothesis that changes in patterns of both known and unknown small molecular weight compounds (e. g., tyrosine and tryptophan metabolites, neurotransmitters, cofactors, peptides and purines). This study can predict and precede or trigger changes in the balance of anabolic and catabolic processes ultimately resulting in osteopenia. The work will examine the osteopenia inducing human bedrest model as compared with seasonal bear metabolism as a model where osteopenia does not occur. Coulometric Electrode Array Systems (CEAS) will be used to isolate patterns of 4-500 compounds at the picogram level from plasma. Developmental software will be employed for complete pattern matching and data base transfer of 40-60 known and 200-300 unknown compounds. Existing plasma samples from 200-250 seasonal bear, 100-150 human bedrest study subjects, and 30-40 rats will be analyzed. Initial CEAS analysis of summer and winter bear plasma corroborates the theory that, fueled by the bear's winter lipid metabolism, protein synthesis proceeds at higher rates in winter than during summer. There were significant differences in serotonergic, kynurenic, dopaminergic, purine and peptide profiles. Pattern changes in small molecular weight nitrogen cycle metabolites may represent evolutionary adaptation coping with environmental factors and offering osteoregulatory mechanisms mitigating torpor's immobility effects. The data will be analyzed for inter and intraspecies differences in metabolic profiles that may be potential triggers or suppressors of osteopenia. Particular attention will be paid to acquiring information regarding the timing and pattern changes in anabolic metabolism.

The desire to fabricate a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) withthis aluminum alloy has resulted in devices with less than spectacular performance.

By using a growth technique with the capabilities for phosphorous compounds, Organometallic Chemical Vapor Deposition (OMCVD), a more comprehensive investigation can be made to identify the improvements to be gained by substituting InP as a large band gap material in place of In0.52A10.48As. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The benefits will be realized through lower cost components for use in various microwave and millimeter wave applications. The cost of MMIC's for automotive and communication applications will see dramatic reduction.",

The device would be readily expandable to monitor other parameters. Our low power architecture includes 3V off-the-shelf CMOS electronics, a low power scalar output piezoelectric accelerometer, and a novel method of event triggered recording. The scalar method of detecting acceleration conserves both calculation requirements and memory size. Event triggering allows the use of a low power standby mode. The piezoelectric sensor requires no standby power. For this Phase I we will fabricate 10 functional prototypes which fully meet the requirements of less than 20 pounds weight (target weight is under 1 pound), including batteries, for 30 days operation for sensing shock, vibration, temperature, and humidity. Sensors to detect and log additional environmental parameters will be investigated, as will power line modem communication. Deliverables will be l EMD prototype unit, a Final Report which shows the feasibility of a credit card size commercial EMD with a clear path to miniaturization, and a plan for production.",

Kwok at SUNY Buffalo, propose an innovative approach to fabricate sensitive, broad--band high--speed bolometric IR detectors on diamond. The low heat capacity of a diamond substrate makes it possible to build sensitive bolometers with a fast response time. No one has yet deposited high quality YBa2Cu307 (YBCO) thin films on diamond because of lattice mismatch, chemical contamination, and differences in thermal contraction. Our approach is to combine two established technologies--diamond on silicon, and YBCO on silicon with a YSZ buffer layer - to create diamond-silicon--YSZ-YBCO multilayers, in which the silicon and YSZ serve as a composite buffer layer. This innovation is a promising approach to developing a bolometer which detects infrared radiation at wavelengths 1--100 microns more sensitively than any other detector operating at or above 77K.",

EXOS has developed several prototype exoskeleton display and sensing devices including: 1) a prototype of a force reflecting exoskeleton master which reflects forces to the index finger, 2) TouchMaster which uses vibration to indicate fingertip contacts in a virtual display, and 3) the Dexterous HandMaster which uses an exoskeleton to measure joint angles. By building on our previous work in comfortable attachment, human perception, and force reflection, we will be able to complete the five primary objectives: Development of a task performance specification, Determining the sensing methods employed in performing the tasks, Development novel feedback methods, and Construction and verification of a prototype HEHD.

Such systems require the sequenced development of methods for the integration of fibers, fiber components and supporting electronics and optics into composite material systems and structures. The objective of the proposed SBIR program is to study the first phase of this development process-the integration of fibers and first-level fiber interconnect capability into polymer and metal matrix composites. Fiber & Sensor Technologies (F&S) and its university subcontractor, the Fiber & Elec Optics Research Center (FEORC) at Virginia Tech, are major innovators in the smart materials and structures field.

        "abstract": "Many high-power ultra-wideband (UWB) sources produce a single-ended signal that is fed into a transmission line. Normally, one would like to radiate this signal with an antenna, however, many antennas require a differential mode input. A balun is therefore required to convert the source output into a form acceptable to the antenna. The challenges in designing such a balun lie in the need to avoid voltage breakdown and the need to preserve the risetime of the signal. Conventional balun designs fail to meet these requirements, so new designs are required. The objective of this research is to design a balun to convert single-ended high-power UWB signals to balanced signals. Tradeoffs between voltage, bandwidth, and transition length will be evaluated. We will work toward a design in Phase II that maintain an 80 ps pulse with less than 15% risetime degradation or energy loss. The design goal will be to approach 1 MV peak voltage and 100 GW peak power. During Phase I we will develop a design for a balun that appears likely to reach these objectives. We will provide both analysis and, if necessary, simple experiments to support our design.",

Preliminary results using a prototype system demonstrated the potential of the proposed system: the HDL, and VLDL fractions were clearly separated, plasma samples were analyzed without sample pre-treatment, and differences in lipoprotein profiles were noted for different patients. Analyses times were between 20 minutes and 1 hour. Determination of accurate particle size of the lipoprotein complexes also demonstrated the unique capabilities of this system. The separation strategy of the proposed Lipoprotein Analyzer is based on Flow field-flow fractionation, (Flow FFF) an elution based technique. This methodology is capable of high resolution measurements and is bio-compatible for analysis of biological macromolecules ranging from proteins up to chromosomes and cells. Thus, this instrumentation is potentially a powerful and effective tool for rapid and direct measurement of the entire subfraction set of the lipoprotein profile.

        "abstract": "Existing radars are very powerful and perform many functions. However, they have difficulty resolving multiple targets in the same range cell with similar doppler shifts when the targets are close in angle. Typically, targets closer than one beamwidth of the radar\\'s aperture cannot be resolved with conventional radar processing. Signal processing techniques that increase the angular resolution of radars beyond the Rayleigh resolution limit are said to provide \"superresolution\". Superresolution techniques require intense, numerical operations upon a covariance matrix. Unfortunately, conventional radars do not directly provide the covariance matrix. In this Phase I effort we propose to investigate techniques to increase conventional radar\\'s angular resolution through the use of superresolution processing as an \"applique\". The following innovative techniques are proposed for Phase I and elaborated upon in the proposal: o Indirect covariance matrix measurement o Processing only where targets have been detected o Subarraying to reduce computations and data collection Flam & Russell, Inc. has a great deal of experience implementing superresolution processing to a number of systems; direction finding, radar cross-section measurement as well as non destructive evaluation systems. Thus, we possess the right ingredients to add increased angular resolution of conventional radars in an efficient, cost-effective manner.",

OMAR, currently under development as a low cost, stand alone, precision, all weather landing system for VTOL aircraft lends itself uniquely to these UAV requirements. Modifications to the exiting OMAR design will be required for this specialized UAV use but basic concepts of Luneberg lens beam shaping with angel/range processing will remain valid. Basic OMAR characteristics, including the ability to operate in a passive (covert) mode, makes it attractive as a portable 3-dimensional military IFF, positioning, tracking and command system with many commercial applications. For UAV applications, its response to authentication coded interrogation, structured in directional low-power reflective needle beams, provides a low probability of intercept and a positive identification of friend or foe (IFF) for unsophisticated, lethal and unmanned aerial vehicles. It's small, all, weather, unique operational characteristics makes it possible for OMAR to monitor more than 50 IFF targets and provide its 3-dimensional positioning information in digital form into intel networks such as the NOMAD and SAMURAI systems and/or Patriot Missile System in real time.",

We will apply a micro-mechanical model to design rigid-rod and other specialized polymers for fibers that exhibit high tensile strength (>30 gpd), high modulus (>500 gpd), higher elongation (>5 percent) and strong intermolecular interaction.

The system developed is capable of capturing fleeing, static or attacking suspects via a LOS ensnarement munition delivered from a 38mm weapon or a similar platform. The flight and capture principles have been proven in previous test programs and many of the subsystems have undergone initial optimization. A unique fuzing technique permits the munition to remain in a packaged state to avoid entanglement with intermediate objects. The streamlined profile gives the munitions range capabilities exceeding current less than lethal weapons. It also results in a stable flight pattern resulting in simplified aiming. A conservative design approach has resulted in a system that is less than lethal throughout the complete 0 to 30m range. Enhancements are suggested which can extend its range and extend the demobilization of the target. By integrating an electrical discharge system into nets construction the concept evolves into a deployable electric fence or sting net.

        "abstract": "Field repair methods for composite aircraft structures fail to account for the unique materials, construction and failure modes associated with thick section fiberglass composite combat vehicle structures. Although acceptable repair techniques for thick laminates have been demonstrated in the laboratory, most viable techniques require the application of heat to cure an adhesive or resin. Heating blankets, hot air, heat lamps and solar radiation are field deployable, but they all rely on heat transfer from the surface through the thick, low thermal conductivity laminate. Depending on the environment, it may take many hours to effectively cure through the thickness of the laminate. Such a lengthy procedure could severely tax field maintenance assets. In or near a combat zone, time is a life or death matter. Foster-Miller proposes a practical means to drastically reduce the time required to effect high quality field repairs. Our method would combine two proven thick laminate repair methods, resin injection and through-thickness fasteners, with an ultra-rapid, simple and safe microwave heating method. We believe that this method has the potential to reduce field repair time from many hours to less than an hour. In Phase I, we will demonstrate that a man-portable microwave hood, comprised of low cost commercially available components, can be used to rapidly and safely heat repair adhesives injected into interior delamination surfaces in a fiberglass laminate.

        "abstract": "After decades of dramatic advances in optoelectronic device performance, it is clear that the implementation of fiber optic systems has been retarded by inadequate packaging technology. Commercially available packaged components often suffer from uncertain reliability, high unit cost and low functionality. Also, the intrinsic performance of the device is frequently compromised by parasitic element associated with poor packaging technology. The program described in this proposal addresses the challenges specific to optoelectronic device packaging. Foster-Miller intends to develop a new and innovative packaging concept that promises to satisfy reliability requirements, preserve device performance, and, at the same time, offer a cost-effective approach to hybrid integration. Cost reduction will be effected by, utilizing passive alignment technique for optical I/O, and an innovative liquid crystal polymer-based multichip packaging technology. Further cost reduction, at the system level, will result from the increased functionality and reliability of a multichip packaging approach. The extension of the microelectronic MCM concept to the optoelectronic MCM, or OMCM, is the core of the proposed program. Foster-Miller believes that there are compelling reasons, rooted in optimizing the mix of cost, performance and reliability, to adopt the module discipline for optoelectronic packaging.

The conformal microchannel covering will direct a flow of liquid coolant over the LRM and each electronic component on it. Space needed for the conformal microchannel at the card surface will come from space saved at the card core -- the central aluminum heat sink (or LFT channels) will be eliminated, leaving only a thin, much lighter composite stiffener. The new IAR and the LFO cards will work together to allow densely-packaged electronics upgrades to existing suites of aircraft with minimal impact on the aircraft environmental control system.

HFC refrigerants are not \"drop-in\" replacements for R-502 because HFC's are not miscible with existing compressor lubricants.

This oil change is a costly process which makes conversion of existing refrigeration system uneconomical. The purpose of this proposed project is to correct this problem through the use of additives to improve the miscibility of HFC's with existing compressor oil.

        "abstract": "Honeycomb sandwich structures used in aircraft are particularly susceptible to impact damage which creates a path for moisture intrusion. Moisture condensing on the exterior is forced into the core during descent causing corrosion, bondline degradation, reduced structural performance. Sandwich structures can be used in primary wing and fuselage components, if improved damage tolerant core materials are developed. Foster-Miller's truss reinforced foam core (TRFC) concept combines the strength of aluminum honeycomb with the resistance to moisture intrusion of closed cell foam. Our concept uses structural foam, reinforced with a network of small diameter truss members about 10 mils in diameter. Analysis predicts shear strength exceeding that of aluminum honeycomb. Our initial tests of this structure show that the truss network dramatically improves the load capacity of the foam sandwich with minimal increase in weight. TRFC sandwich panels are made using Foster-Miller's proprietary z-fiber process. This proven process can be used to produce the desired structures during a standard autoclave cure cycle. Its use will permit fabrication cost reductions relative to honeycomb since it eliminates machining of the honeycomb and secondary bonding of the facesheets. Lockheed will assist in Phase I to insure approaches developed are relevant to future aircraft and integrate with their Robost Composites Structures proposal.",

        "abstract": "The ideal aeroengine bearing will provide adequate performance without need for active cooling or lubrication. Foster-Miller's concept for an advanced aeroengine bearing uses ceramic races and rolling elements along with a self-contained, solid lubricating \"composite\" ball cage. The key innovation in this bearing concept is the cage element. It can simultaneously meet bearing cage requirements of light weight, high 1500 degrees F strength, and lubricity over -60 to 1500 degrees F. During the Phase I effort, Foster-Miller will conclusively prove the feasibility of this novel bearing cage concept and demonstrate a net shape process to cost effectively fabricate such bearing cages. Cage material specimens will be subjected to relevant friction/wear and strength tests at temperatures up to 1,500 degrees F. During the Phase I option, a representative bearing cage component will be fabricated to net shape, and performance benefits offered by this technologywill be quantified. The Phase I team consists of two recognized experts on solid lubricants and ceramic bearings-Bobby McConnell and Jim Hanoosh. Additionally, the Phase I includes two commercialization partners-NTN Bearings, a bearing manufacturer, and Textron Lycoming, an aeroengine manufacturer and a bearing user, to ensure \"commericializable\" technology that is relevant to aeroengine bearing needs.",

        "abstract": "Synchronous Multiplane Tomography (SMT) is an X-ray-based nondestructive testing technique that will produce a series of contiguous freeze-frame cross-sectional images of the deep interior of a turbine engine operating at speed. Based on techniques derived from computed tomography, SMT can image interior components of turbine engines while they are hot, running, and under load. SMT is based on physical components and reconstructive algorithms that have been previously developed for other purposes on other programs, mostly under Air Force sponsorship. No new hardware is requiested, only an assembly of existing components and subsystems. In Phase I, Foster-Miller joins with Lockheed, Pratt & Whitney, Boeing and others to present a program that performs an experimental demonstration of the SMT technique to establish performance, that sets requirements and that provides a conceptual design for a full-up SMT system. Quantitative image data from the SMT system can be overlaid with other nondestructive testing and diagnostic data on the IHPTET knowledge template. The Phase I program establishes a cost-benefit plan for the SMT system and a strategy for identifying users. In Phase II we would build and demonstrate a prototype SMT. This prototype system would be essential to the commercialization of SMT through further demonstration and applications development.",

        "abstract": "Full Circle Research, Inc. proposed a program to develop a package for microelectronic integrated circuits which will shield these devices against the deleterious effects of space radiation. Such a package would permit spacecraft designers to use commercial ICs in applications where, previously, only more expensive military technology radiation hardened chips could be used. Previous attempts to develop such packages have assumed a wartime environment in which the radiation belts surrounding the earth would have been \"pumped up\" by exoatmospheric nuclear bursts, resulting in electron spectra much harder than the natural radiation environment. Also, secondary radiation generated by nuclear interactions between protons and the shield material was neglected. These conditions, in addition to the changes in IC vulnerability to space radiation brought about by the advance in IC technology since the original work was done, combine to make the earlier shielded packages obsolete. The program proposed herein will, during Phase I, use recent advanced on space radiation effects on micro-electronics to modify the design equations for package-level shielding, and develop new package designs using these modified equations. Then, during Phase II, prototypes implementing these designs will be fabricated and tested to demonstrate their ability to shield against ionizing radiation without increasing to an unacceptable extent single event upsets caused by cosmic rays and Van Allen belt radiation. Finally, during Phase III, production of these packages will begin, aimed at use in commercial satellite systems such as IRIDIUM.",

Significant growth in the use of the male (ZDF/Gmi, fa/fa) by researchers has occurred since the model's commercial availability. Preliminary experimentation lead us to believe, that through manipulation of diet, NIDDM can be produced in the ZDF/Gmi female. Currently, there is no reliable type II female model available for comparative study. Considering that the ZDF/Gmi female has not historically expressed NIDDM, and the preliminary data shows that these same females have expressed high glucose levels through carbohydrate stimulation, it is believed that a female NIDDM model can be created. Through experimental dietary manipulation the research team believes both the degree and the timing of onset of NIDDM in this model can be made both reliable and variable.

Each wafer may contain a polypeptide of completely independent sequence. There is an anticipated decrease of 30% in reagent consumption.

Phase I will allow the creation of one semi-automated peptide synthesizer and the software to drive it. Automation will first be applied to the solvent delivery system and then to the entire process. Availability of hundreds of peptides in this manner will significantly reduce the cost and time of research into biological activity screening, mutagenesis, structural studies, etc.",

The objective is to identify a system for obtaining measurements on rocket exhaust clouds, which are needed to baseline current and future hot spill models that predict the environmental behavior, transport, and ultimate fate of toxic rocket chemicals in the air produced by Air Force rocket launches. Phase I will consist of four tasks: a. Evaluate the best methods to acquire observational data, including multi-spectral passive sensors such as lidar or millimeter wave radar. Existing data sets will be examined to determine usefulness in defining the viability of various sensors. b. Evaluate existing software and hardware systems for processing of rocket cloud imagery to determine applicability to the rocket plume measurement problem. c.

Middle-aged and older Americans are being affected by the AIDS epidemic in various ways: as patients, care providers, family members, friends, neighbors, consumers, and as citizens. While knowledge of AIDS has been increasing in the general population, several studies have shown that individuals age 50 and over, and especially those over 64 are more likely than younger persons not to know, or to be unsure, about associating with persons who have AIDS and are less likely to perceive themselves at risk. While numerous education programs have been implemented for various high-risk groups in the United States, little effort has been made to reach older adults in spite of the need. We will develop a low-cost, comprehensive education program that will be made commercially available to organizations and agencies that service adults age 50 and over. The project will be guided by the most current information and developments in AIDS research.

C3A is a human liver cell line derived from an hepatoblastoma that retains most of the characteristics of the human hepatocyte. We have cultured these cells in hollow fiber devices and shown that they are capable of carrying out many of the major liver-specific metabolic interconversions. We have successfully tested this device in an animal model of fulminant hepatic failure and in four human subjects. In preparation for a multisite trial of this device, we will undertake a feasibility study of five patients gathered from the affiliated hospitals of the Baylor College of Medicine and at the Hermann Hospital, Univ. of Texas School of Medicine. The use of liver transplantation is limited by both the availability of organs and financial constraints. An ELAD should have application in a number of transplant situations. First, it will allow patients in fulminant hepatic failure to be stabilized and calmly evaluated before operating. Second, it will find use in stabilizing and assisting patients after transplant, particularly in situations in which the graft fails on reperfusion. Third, in some instances, it may serve as a substitute for transplant. This device would allow time for the patient's natural liver to regenerate, sparing the expense of operation, the lifelong dependence on immunosuppression and the likelihood of premature mortality.",

To provide the capabilities needed for dynamic and complex real-world applications, a tool that can be employed by the user to specify the identification and presentation of information is needed.

Meg-CSF is of significant importance in the treatment of thrombocytopenia due to diseases of a variety of etiologies, or due to chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. In the past, tremendous efforts have been made around the world to purify and eventually to molecularly clone this hematopoietic growth factor. However, purification of Meg-CSF has been aborted or hampered largely because of the lack of a quick, sensitive and reliable assay. This Phase I grant will develop a molecular assay for Meg-CSF using a newly-established megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line HIMeg. Preliminary studies have shown that this cell line, treated with vitamin D3 (VD3) or cis-retinoic acid (cis-RA), is able to differentiate into more mature megakaryocytes. Specifically, we will determine (i) if VD3 or cis-RA-induced differentiation is associated with up regulation of megakaryocyte/platelet gene expression and (ii) if functionally purified Meg-CSF induces megakaryocytic differentiation of HIMeg cells. The overall goal is to utilize the unique cell line to discover novel and effective factors/drugs for treatment of thrombocytopenia and megakaryoblastic leukemia.",

        "abstract": "The present trend in the packaging of advanced integrated circuit chip is toward various types of multi-chip modules (MCM). Of these, MCM-D employing film deposition is the one most capable of supporting hich system performance. This proposal considers MCM-D as the basis for implementing a variety of thin-film layers which could integrate digital and analog functions into a single miniaturized system package. These layers might be conductive or superconductive, magnetic or ferro-electric, as well as dielectric insulating layers, deposited in a multilayer process. Having defined the material choices from general system requirements, the optimization of the system is then achieved by optimizing the performance ofthe components and assuring compatible communication between them. Voltage levels of operating temperatures are key adjustable variables for the system. The trend for CMOS fabrication is toward the continuing reduction of IC feature size. Toward this end, voltage reduction and the accompanying reduced theral dissipation must be primary objectives. It is clear that these objectives can be achieved by lowering operating temperatures. The Phase I effort would examine a specific system of military interest - a microwave receiver, to assess the application of these principles to produce a conceptual optimization of the packaged system, namely, a cryocooler. Anticipated Benefits: All commercial high-performance electronics which comprise of digital and analog functions will benefit from this development. Work stations and higher level computers would have thier central processing boards replaced by optimized cryoelectronic MCM-Ds, since a small refrigerator could easily be made as part of the chassis.",

The Army initiative for the Battlefield Combat Identification System (BCIS) addresses the need for pre-launch IFF. With deployment of smart muntions and long-range guns, there is an increasing need to provide post-launch IFF capabilities on-board munitions. This proposal describes an advanced concept of identifying co-operative targets capable of both pre-launch and post-launch applications. The proposed concept is based on the use of low-cost miniature microwave transponder (i.e. ID tag) that can be interrogated from the firng position and/or from munitions in flight. Both the transponder and the interrogator will be build in MMIC chips for low cost and small size. The proposed interrogation and response system, with electronically programmed encryption, is immune to jamming, decoding, or false target detection. The interrogator function on munitions may be built into a transmitter available on board. The interrogator may be integrated with the proximity fuze available on board. The interrogator may be integrated with the proximity fuze transmitter, for example, for pre-fuzing or dudding when a friendly target is detected.

Along with this advancement in the GPS-based guidance technology, advent of low-cost hand-held terminals for personal and data comunications offers the prospect of mid-course correction of munitions in flight from a ground-based control station. Low-cost implementation of both the GPS receiver and guidance data link is made possible as high-scale integration of microwave circuit functions on GaAs chips becomes an established practice. Hittite Microwave Corporation has pioneered in the development of highly integrated microwave monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC) chips for proximity fuzes, GPS frequency translators and command receivers for gun-fired munitions subjected to high-G setback force. In addition to MMIC designs, Hittite has developed a novel concept for implementing IFF functions on munitions using guidance and/or fuze transmitters. These MMIC-based system concepts may be cabined to implement a method of terminal guidance of munitions in flight by a man-portable (hand-carried) telemetry transmitter coded with target position data. This function may be integrated with the fuze and IFF systems on board the munition for precision fuzing and prevention of fratercide. The proposed system concept relies on the GPS translator on- board for location and tracking of the munition, correction of impact position by means of the position data transmitted from the ground via a telemetry link, and the fuze transmitter for IFF and detonation. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - The proposed program will produce a large number of by-products with potential applications in commercial sectors. The data-link portion of the proposed system, for example, will be directly applicable to spread spectrum communications in the 2.4 GHz band.

To be successful, the PIO prediction method must: be accepted as valid by the manufacturers and government flight test organizations; account for all of the factors that contribute to PIO; be in a form that can be used for design guidance; and be easily calculated from flight test data. In the proposed Phase I effort, a candidate set of unified PIO criteria will be assembled following a thorough review of PIOs and their contributing factors and establishment of a database for criteria evaluations. A series of one-on-one information-gathering meetings is proposed with key members of industry and government to identify the consensus of opinion concerning PIO causes and the status of prediction criteria.

Lithium niobate crystals have been extensively characterized as a storage media and it is readily available commercially. The key innovation of the proposed system is the incorporation of the dynamic copying method with the 3-D holographic disk which compensates for the erasure of the stored holograms while they are read out. The specifications of the proposed 3-D disk are: terabyte capacity per disk, read/write capability, recording rate in excess of 50 Mb/second, readout rate of 250 Mb/sec, and access time estimated to be approximately 20 milliseconds. The proposed system yields very high storage density at approximately 113 bits per micron squared. The first phase of the proposed effort intends to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system. The phase I work plan includes the optimization of the copying schedule, the incorporation of error correcting capability into the system, the studying of alignment sensitivity issues, and the design of the 3-D disk prototype.

        "abstract": "The Montreal protocol banning halon production after 1995 has motivated the Air Force to actively seek replacements for halocarbon fire extinguishers. Currently proposed drop-in replacements such as HCFC's and CF3I have carbon-halogen bonds and are thus vulnerable to the same environmental concerns as is CF3Br (Halon 1301). While bromine atoms are very effective at catalytically poisoning the chain reactions of combustion, it is not essential to deliver Br to a flame as a halocarbon. A Phase I SBIR program is proposed to explore halon substitutes based on labile Br in a proprietary material that meets Air Force requirements for thermal stability, toxicity, and extinguishing capability per unit mass and volume. The proposed species is water soluble. Both it and its combustion products are unstable against tropospheric oxidation and thus have neither ozone depletion potential nor global warming potential. Theoretical analyses will include computational fluid dynamics and thermochemical kinetics at an appropriate level for wide area and aircraft engine fires. The thermal and oxidative decomposition products of the material will be calculated using quantum electronic structure methods and will be compared with pyrolytic and oxidation experiments. An engineering experiment will add calibrated flows of existing and proposed extinguishing materials to a 100,000 Btu/hr turbine fuel flame. The flame's response will be diagnosed by optical and infrared emission to rank existing and new extinguishing materials. The ranking developed from the small-scale experiment will be compared to the results of more elaborate, published studies of current extinguishers, including Halon 1301, hydro-fluorocarbons, trifluoromethyliodide, water and sodium bicarbonate.

        "abstract": "Huntsville Sciences Corporation (HSC) proposes to develop a new and innovative approach for predicting the pore pressures and structural behavior of a thermochemically decomposing composite ablator material like those commonly used to insulate rocket nozzles. The proposed method uses a two-dimensional (2-D) finite element solver with adaptive grid features in solving a modified form of the energy and mass continuity equations proposed by Weiler[1] which describe the thermochemical ablation process. The adaptive grid features of the proposed method will permit the accurate resolution of the large pressure gradients that exist at the pyrolysis zone / virgin material interface which currently pose resolution problems with other finite element and finite difference techniques. The proposed method is 2-D. It accounts for the spatial variation in material properties ,i.e. thermal capacitance, thermal conductivity, and porosity in computing the temperatures and pore pressures in the ablating material. The Phase I code will accurately track the surface recession and the char and pyrolysis zone formations that occur during the ablation process. The planned Phase II enhancements include (a) modifications to the Phase I code to solve the complete energy and mass continuity governing equations, (b) the addition of chemical kinetics, (c) the addition of a two-phase water vapor/condensation model, and (d) developing efficient interfaces to codes like ACE [4] and MEIT [5] which produce the surface input data for this model . With the Phase II code enhancements, this code will be used to accurately predict ply separation in thermochemically decomposing rocket nozzle liners which is a problem of prime interest to NASA.",

        "abstract": "Fast Fourier transformers (FFFs) are used extensively in military and commercial applications. There is a constant demand for faster and more accurate FFTS. RNS (Residue Number System) based FFTs are candidates to provide these improvements, however techniques for efficient implementation of RNS operations must first be developed. RNS operations will be develope in the proposed Phase I research that will lead to RNS-based hardware designs with significan improvements in both speed and accuracy. The Phase I research will provide the conceptual are preliminary designs of the RNS-based FFT. The most promising designs will be selected an compared in terms of estimated performance versus cost. This will be accomplished by developing a computer simulation to evaluate the candidates for selected moduli. In Phase II the preliminary design will be refined and a hardware processor fabricated. The RNS-based FFT will be evaluated in terms of speed and accuracy and compared, based on performance and cost, to current FFT processors used in military and commercial applications. The technology developed in Phase I and implemented in Phase II will lead to enhanced performance of sensors in future weapons systems. Further , commercial applications that require intensive data analysis a processing will benefit from this research. Anticipated Benefits: FFTs have a variety of uses in both military and commercial applications which can benefit from RNS-based FFT processors. The most common military application is radar signal processing. Commercial applications which require intensive analysis of test data in the structural, fluid flow, and thermal areas such as aircraft and automobile engine testing will benefit from this technology. Weather forecasting and seismic modeling of earthquakes which record and process large data bases can effectively use this technology.",

Firstly, it requires less capital investment and NRE costs. Secondly, the process itself is far less complicated. Thirdy, it may be more reliable than the solder bump process. The siginificant advantage of this epoxy flip chip technology is its affordability for production implementation for small companies. This should make MCM manufacturing available to a broader community. The feasibility and reliability of this process will be investigated by developing an application process and hardware for optimum epoxy bump geometries, evaluating commercially available robotic systems for final assembly, and testing a specailly designed package that will include a silicon test chip and PGA ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: After the successful development of an epoxy flip chip, potential applications would be a cost effective replavement for solder bump flip chips used in MCM.

        "abstract": "We will develop an inexpensive device that rapidly measures the body density (in air) of non-infant children and adults, so a quantitative degree of obesity (body fat fraction) may be deduced. Such routine measurements should result in improved weight control programs with consequent reduction in the health risks associated with hypertension, cardio vascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and many other disorders. There are two known methods that have been proposed for the in-air measurement of body volume\u00bfprincipally for infants. One is based on air displacement and the intrinsic relationship between gas volume and pressure. Another method, using the Helmholtz resonator principal with excitation from a loud-speaker, has also been proposed for infants. Both methods are complex and highly sensitive to temperature. The new device also uses acoustic resonance principles, but eliminates problems related to temperature or humidity changes. It is expected that very accurate measurements can be made in much less than a minute with readout in body density and estimated percent body fat. The device should be inexpensive and a product desired and eventually required by most physicians. Specific aims of Phase I would include design and construction of a breadboard acoustic volume device to measure the volume of adults and optimize the system by measuring a range of known volumes of water.

        "abstract": "Hypres proposes to develop an ultra-sensitive 10GS/s Analog to Digital Convertor (ADC) for direct conversion of the SIS (Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor) mixer output signals to digital data for use in radio astronomy. The observation of broadband emitters, such as cosmic dust clouds and proto-planetary objects, requires a large instantaneous bandwidth for analysis of multiple spectral lines. For these observations a sample rate of 10GS/s is desired. The 10GS/s ADC is constructed from three comparators and digital logic. HYPRES proposes to design, fabricate, and test an innovative comparator design based on Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs). SQUIDS have demonstrated the energy resolution required for 2K noise thresholds at 5GHz bandwidths. The complete ADC will be fabricated using niobium which operates at 4K, is compact (1mm x 1mm), and low power ( < 1mW) making it suitable for space-based imaging arrays requiring an ADC per pixel. HYPRES has developed superconducting digital logic which can be used to crosscorrelate the ADC data at 10GS/s. The design would the follow the ADC with a 1 to N demultiplexor, this will produce N output ports at l/N of the sample rate, each port is connected to a semiconductor correlator. A second approach would implement a superconducting correlator operating at 10GS/s.",

        "abstract": "Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) are extremely sensitive detectors of magnetic flux and can be used as low noise amplifiers for many applications such as cryogenic detectors and biomagnetic measurements. In order to utilize a SQUID as an amplifier, extensive peripheral electronics are required. Such room temperature electronics are very expensive, specially for space-qualified applications, and are responsible for a substantial portion of the cost of the commercial magnetometer systems. Therefore, it is highly advantageous to simplify the electronics required to operate SQUIDs. This project will lead to the development of an all thin-film SQUID array amplifier chip. The proposed DC SQUID amplifier integrates several (on the order of a hundred) DC SQUID gates with a high sensitivity analog SQUID magnetometer. Each chip, in addition to having a SQUID array coupled to an analog SQUID, will also have an integrated superconducting transformer to facilitate its interface to an external pick up coil. This scheme will eliminate the need for the most critical part of the peripheral electronics, that is, the low noise amplifiers, which, in practical systems, determines the noise floor of the systems. Such a system will be compact and cost effective, and requires ordinary support electronics. As a result of this effort, it will be possible to design and fabricate SQUID chips that will contain arrays of such SQUIDs for integration in magnetometer systems, thereby reducing the complexity of the room temperature electronics for such systems. Due to significant progress in superconducting electronics at HYPRES in recent months, we are actually proposing to design, fabricate and evaluate these SQUID array amplifier chips under this phase I program. The goal for the flux noise for such chips is less than 5XlO-6~o/~Hz when operated from 4.2 K down to milliKelvins.",

        "abstract": "We propose to develop liquid metal current collectors for Navy homopolar ship drives. Our concept utilizes a collector leaf (of finger brush) to deliver a film of liquid metal to the slipring surface. The proposed system has active collector actuation which helps maintain a stable film through improved slipring tracking. Our collector concept is aimed at improving serviceability while maintaining electrical performance. Multiple collector modules mounted to the return conductor form a collector ring. Each module consists of three parts; a manifold, a collector leaves assembly, and a guide block. Collector maintenance (if required) will involve only the replacement of the collector leaves assembly. Our Phase I effort will result in concept level drawings of the liquid metal current collector system needed for Navy homopolar ship drives. We will develop the tools needed to make knowledgeable design decisions. We will use these tools to perform a concept design of the ship drive collectors. In Phase II, we will continue collector development through testing at IAP Research, Inc. and the David Taylor Research Center.",

        "abstract": "Currently used anti-cancer agents have limited selectivity for the tumor. Immunoconjugates that have been prepared from these drugs are not potent enough to be therapeutically effective. We will use 100 to 1000-fold more cytotoxic drugs and endow them with tumor-selectivity by linking them to antibodies. Thus, drugs that are too toxic to be used alone can be rendered therapeutically useful. Effective immunoconjugates will be generated by a) substituting the moderately cytotoxic anti-neoplastic agents in current use in antibody-drug conjugates with CC-1065 analogs which are 100 to 1000-fold more potent and b) linking these CC-1065 analogs to antibodies via disulfide bonds that should be stable in circulation, but efficiently cleaved inside the cell to release fully active drug. In order to realize this goal, new disulfide-containing CC-1065 analogs will be synthesized without affecting the high cytotoxicity of the parent drug. Preliminary experiments indicate that the presence of a disulfide functionality preserves the potency of the drug. The most cytotoxic of these drugs will be linked to antibodies via disulfide bonds, and the in vitro cytotoxicity and specificity of these conjugates will be determined. The antibodies we will use in this study are already being used in human clinical trials.",

In particular, optimized cladding will be developed, scattering defects minimized, and purification improved to achieve lower loss. The fibers will then be formed into coherent bundles for image relay applications.",

Successful implementation of the proposed technology will impact two critical issues of our time - infrastructure and the environment - through recycling of some prominent plastic wastes into cost-effective rehabilitation materials with desirable performance characteristics. Phase I research evaluates the technical feasibility and economical viability of developing polymer concrete rehabilitation materials through depolymerizing impure and color post-consumer PET wastes. For this purpose, PET scrap sources and depolymerization process capable of generating unsaturated polyesters with acceptable processability and clear-cast resin characteristics will be identified. Optimum composition of polymer concretes incorporating recycled polyester binder will then be determined based on set characteristics, short-term engineering properties, and cost. Finally, market potentials of recycled polyester concrete will be determined through technical and economical evaluations against conventional rapid-setting rehabilitation materials.",

We will manufacture flexure and CTE specimens for the evaluation of ambient and high temperature flexure strength, CTE, and thermal cycling behavior. The following results are expected: Through use of hybridization, we will 1) achieve exact positioning of fibers in the preform and subsequent casting, 2) reduce CTE mismatch strains to tolerable levels and eliminate radial and longitudinal cracking, and 3) demonstrate a low cost process for the manufacture of low defect, high integrity, high performance, net shaped components.",

The retro transmitter can be made very small, say the size of a rivet or smaller, and can be thin and flat if desired enabling easy integration into or onto the aircraft or missile skin. The power required on the remote transmitter is small, consisting only of the power needed to modulate the retro return of the retroreflector. A battery comparable to a wrist watch battery should suffice. Ruggedness obtains as a result of the small size and compactness of the device and because of its insensitivity to alignment and displacement.

In many cases only a small fraction of system's potential power is utilized. The efficient use of these systems is a function of a number of factors, but primarily depends on exploting the application's inherent parallelism, choosing a compatible architecture, and optimally mapping the application functions into the processors. Our innovation is to develop mehtodologies (and eventually a set of software tools and an environment) which a user can employ to perform above and other tasks in support of designing an application and evaluating its performance on a parallel system.

        "abstract": "Dense arrays of high-frequency photonic devices could provide many advantages to several Department of Defense systems currently under development. One example is their usage in phased-array radar systems. However, crosstalk from one device to the next must be kept at very low levels in order to not degrade the system performance. Often, crosstalk levels are required to be less than -100 dB electrical. These are very low levels when operation frequencies can be between I and 30 GHz. We propose to investigate methods of achieving dense arrays of traveling-wave electrooptic modulators that will satisfy these stringent crosstalk specifications. These methods will utilize various optical and electrical shielding structures integratable on the array substrate as well as on the electrical interconnect circuits required to impress the electrical drive signals onto the device array. In summary, the problem considered in this Proposal is that of dense arrays of highly-isolated, high-frequency photonic devices. The intent is to develop methods of optically and electrically isolating dense arrays of devices without compromising the high performance required of the individual devices. The techniques discussed here could have significant impact on systems applications in the defense and commercial sectors. Anticipated Benefits: The anticipated benefits of this R&D is the ability to integrate high-performance devices into cost-effective dense device arrays. These arrays can be used in systems where in the past the cost of the number of discrete devices required was prohibitive; thus capit- alizing on the large investments already made in the development of discrete high-performance devices.",

Integrated Sensors, Incoporated (ISI) has developed a fast, non-contact, displacement and orientation object tracker that can perform real-time passive helicopter position measurement.

We propose to apply the techniques to a Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP) process. RTP is a state-of-the-art method for performing several important steps in semiconductor wafer fabrication. A physically-based model of the process will be derived using a method for modeling ther thermal process as a nonlinear passive network. The model will be linearized for control design. A standard input-output model will also be derived as a baseline. In Phase I, models will be developed and evaluated in a computer simulation. In Phase II, a set of comprehensive models and associated software will be developed and demonstrated on a new commercial RTP chamber.

        "abstract": "Concurrent engineering is the simultaneous design of process and the control system to improve equipment development. Integrated Systems Inc. (ISI) proposes to create a software design tool for integration of a high fidelity simulation and model- based process control algorithms for semi-conductor equipment processes and apply it to a rapid thermal processing (RTP) chamber. In particular, it is proposed to develop the capability to interface general-purpose finite-element thermal and fluid-mechanical simulators with advanced process control algorithms. This new simulation capability will greatly enhance the industry's ability to prototype and test advanced fabrication equipment and control algorithms. Because the large-scale physically-based simulators represent the essential nonlinearities in the system, they can be used to develop sensor-to-actuator response surfaces before hardware is built. Enormous time and cost savings can be realized by testing control algorithms on simulators before building and testing hardware. The methods used will be compatible with robust control approaches. The simulation can be used to derive a set of linear models and quantitative measures of modeling errors for robust control. Methods for interfacing the controller to the simulation will be developed and demonstrated in Phase I. In Phase II, a variety of new designs will be performed and evaluated. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - The integration technique will be validated on the model of an RTP chamber. As a result the potential commercial application is great. ISI envisions producing a stand-alone closed-loop simulation software product.",

Recent advances in the development of fuzzy logic controllers and neural networks provide a unique opportunity for achieving highly integrated, reliable, robust and adaptive fllight control systems which enhance maneuverability, accommodate uncertainties,and simplify design and maintenance. During the proposed work an innovative fuzzy control system architecture, namely the Fuzzy-CMAC (cerebellar model arithmetic computer) neural network, will be evaluated for use in advanced flight control systems. This architecture exploits a synergism between the CMAC neural network and fuzzy logic control. CMACS and fuzzy logic are similar in terms of input encoding and mapping structure. Different features of both models are compared and a Fuzzy CMAC model which combines preferred features of both models is then established. The fuzzy CMAC controller utilizes available human control experience in the initial construction of its knowledge base. Then the CMAC neural network further provides powerful self-learning capability and flexibility in achieving robust performance over an expanded fligh envelope.",

        "abstract": "Using current methods for sequencing DNA, billions of dollars will be required to sequence theentire human genome. The development of new techniques is much more likely to produce a costeffective means of meeting the goals of the Human Genome Project. One important component ofassembling a sequencing reaction is to step along a DNA fragment using an oligonucleotide to prime thenext portion of the sequencing reaction. This type of oligonucleotide priming only requires about 5picomoles of oligomer; conventional synthesizers produce more than 10,000 times that amount. Thisproject involves the development of a synthesizer that can produce smaller quantities appropriate forsequencing at costs that are an order of magnitude lower than conventional systems. The projectcombines recent advancements in low cost parallel synthesis of oligonucleotides with advancedcomputer controlled machinery. Using the pin array parallel synthesizer concept developed by Dr.George Church, the plan is to design a completely integrated synthesizer instrument that requires littleoperator intervention and has small reagent costs. The phase I project will involve a close cooperationbetween academic and small business researchers and will generate an initial design for the instrument.The phase I objectives include developing a set of requirements for oligonucleotide synthesis forsequencing, design of a loading/unloading system for glass beads, developing a fast, automated cleavageand deprotection system, and developing a design for a phase II instrument. The phase III project willentail the commercialization of a parallel automated oligonucleotide synthesizer, which, if successful,can produce oligonucleotides at less than 1/20 the cost of conventional systems.",

These innovations will enable the Separation Anxiety Test to be administered more readily to larger samples at lower cost; lower cost widens availability to investigators. Successful completion of Phase I objectives will lead to a fully implemented system in Phase II which will be used to administer the projective measure to 250 children. The research will more firmly establish the utility of a projective method for assessing an important dimension of child socio-emotional development.

Tasks such as ammunition handling, resupply, and logistics applications often make use of mobile robots such as a Cybermotion robot. These mobile robots have a severe deficiency in that there is sufficient slippage between the wheels and the floor that after very short distances, the robot no longer knows its position. Once the robot docks at a station the position can be re-established but this is inadequate because it is slow, unreliable, requires expensive hardware at each docking station, and does not help the robot navigate between docking stations. We believe we have a practical, reliable system which will provide the position and orientation of a mobile robot at a rate of 60 measurements per second. No wires at all are required between the robot and the base station, and the system is portable and requires only a single base station whose position and orientation is known relative to the work area.",

Foci for interventions are the prevention of tobacco, alcohol, and drug use and the appropriatecontrol of anger among target high-risk youth. Once developed, the interactive microcomputer softwarewill undergo field testing in a randomized trial with a sample of high-risk youths in nonschool settingswithin New York City. The ability of the software to effectively and efficiently deliver health behaviorintervention content will be examined by comparing the software curriculum with a conventionalintervention curriculum. Of interest to the comparison will be outcome variables on high-risk youthsubjects measured before and after intervention delivery and process variables measured duringintervention. Data from Phase I will form the basis of a Phase II proposal to expand and carefullyevaluate interactive software for health behavior intervention among high-risk youth in nonschoolsettings.

Its innovativeness is in the application of stacked memory performance attributes (extremely dense electronics and short, massively parallel, low capacitance connections) to high resolution sensor performance problems. Many short sensor outputs connect the sensor to the ROE, and much more circuit area is behind each sensor line than in conventional planar hybrid FPAs. The large circuit area behind each sensor line, and fast, short interconnections address the following needs from the solicitation: 1.\tSub-electron read noise for detector arrays: \t \t\tLarge geometry, low noise preamplifiers minimize read \t noise, and ADCs make focal plane outputs more robust 2. Thermal isolation of electronics in cryogenic dewars: \t A large number of parallel, slower circuits (especially \t ADCs) dissipate less power than a single multiplexed fast \t circuit.

Often, however, due to inadequate medical staff in small or remote medical hospitals, these disease-related casualties are improperly treated before return of the patients to the Zone of the Interior. In cases requiring the examination of biopsies or blood smears, the human eye is used to form a picture of the specimen as part of the decision-making process in arriving at the formulation of a treatment plan. If, in difficult cases, the image seen could be referenced quickly by use of computer intelligence to a medical image database and/or transmitted to a remote site for observation by an expert medical specialist, treatment could be improved and lives could be saved. It is the purpose of this report to propose a Phase I feasibility study that would address this problem. The study would be jointly performed under the leadership of the Kensal Corporation (Tucson, AZ) in partnership with Intellipath (Santa Monica, CA) and the Lockheed Missile and Space Division (Sunnyvale, CA).

Alkaline phosphatase is currently obtained from mammalian sources and is not stable at elevated temperatures. Thermophilic microorganisms producing heat stable alkaline phosphatase have been isolated by J. K. Research. The objective of this proposed research is to select a thermophile producing heat stable alkaline phosphatase and characterize the enzyme. Media will be developed to enhance enzyme production.

        "abstract": "Combat outcomes are generated by two principle effects: attrition and suppression, where attrition is th ephysical destruction of personnel and materiel and suppression is the degradation of combat effectiveness through the non-lethal effects of firepower upon personnel. Historical analysis has shown that the effects of suppression are at least as (and quite possibly more) significant as the effects of attrition, yet none of the combat modesl commonly used by the US Army accuratley reflects suppression effects. As a result, the combat outcomes generated by these modesl are grossly distorted in favor of attrition. This phase I SBIR will attempt to measure and accurately model the effects of attrition using the Tactical Numerical Deterministic Model (TNDM) an historically validated combat model, to evaluate two sets of battles for which detailed informatio is available. The first set consisting of \"normal\" battles, will be used as a baseline to identify the relationships between suppression and attrition. the second set will consist of battles in which massive firepower was used deliverately for suppression, to determine the relationships between firepoer and suppression effects. In Phase II, the offeror will refine the suppressin coefficients identified in Phase I and apply them to existing Army combat models.",

        "abstract": "Range imaging is the measurement of the three-dimensional shape of an object as an array of 3-D distance values. While range imaging is a critical robotic sensing techonology, existing methods are very slow; the best current devices still produce only a few tens of frames per second. We propose to develop an ultra fast range imaging system consisting of a scanning laser and a sensor array of photosensitive cells. The scanning laser sweeps a scene continuously with a moving light stripe, and each sensor cell of the array measures the distance by recording the time at which the incident light intensity peaks during each sweep. The noveltry of this system is a VLSI-based computational sensor which exploits the inherent parallelism of this techiques by integrating photoreceptors, analog circuitry, and digital logic on a single CMOS die. The resulting system can produce 1000 range images per second, two orders of magnitude fasterthan current systems. Also, the system will be simple and compact since it does not require a separate computer for processing signals. Phase I of this project will develop a prototype design that will lead to commercial production of a highly advanced, high-speed range imager. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: An ultra fast, 3D range imager will revolutionize the machine vision market, traditionally dominated by 2D techniques. Fast 3D vision and measurement systems will have endless applicatons, rainging from military and manufacturing to robotics, medicinge, and textiles. Examples include: whole shape measurement of a vehicle for radar refelctance simulation; design and inspection of manufactured parts; tele-existence via 3D images; and 3D imaging of the human body for reconstructive surgery, design of protective equipment, and the fashion industry.",

Development of an underwater walking robot is important due to the need to explore ocean bottoms for oceanography, bottom tomography, performing pollution assessments, and ship inspection. Shallow water in particular is a difficult portion of the ocean to explore due to the heavy currents and surges common in coastal waters. The objective of the Phase I research is to design a walking machine which can operate in the presence of subtantial fluid perturbations. K2T will draw upon its experience as the mechanical designers of the Antarctic volcano exploration robot, Dante, to create a design which overcomes much of the difficulties associated with fluid perturbations by emphasizing stability, a conservative gait, and a straightforward vehicle controller. The results of the Phase I effort will be a feasible design including system configuration, formulization of walker controller, performance specifications for legs, kinematic simulations, force stability study, gait study, and feasibility assessment based on biological principles and comparisons to predecessor walking machines. This design will provide a foundation for the Phase II construction of a prototype walking vehicle.",

        "abstract": "Two new families of Liquid Membranes have been developed for cleaning oily waste water and removing dissolved solids from water. One, called Membrane-Like-Material (MLM) is formed using chlorinated solvents, which are solvents removed to far below their solubility in water. The dissolved materials in the water are not removed by the MLM and a second system based on surfactant mono-layers on air bubbles coated with the ions of Alum and Sodium Hydroxide is used to effect the separation of heavy metals from water. It is proposed that these two proceses be combined to use the same hardware to use both at the same time. Since the chemistry of each is not effective with the other, this should be possible. Thus, materials such as TCE in the presence of heavy metals in the water can be processed with a single treatment stage as one unit process only. In addition, the TCE is used to remove itself from the water, and once started the process will continue with recovered TCE. Four experiments are proposed to improve various aspects of these two technologies. The Bubble Generation of mono-layer bubbles has a lot of development room left. The MLM process could perhaps be done in the vapor phase, and dilute aqueous MLM solvent systems are known to exist. Any or all of these avenues of improvement will lead to less equipment being required.",

        "abstract": "This proposal outlines a program of work that will develop a test procedure to identify faulty wing bearings without removing the wing assemblies from the aircraft of Navy F-14 aircraft. The acoustic emission (AE) NDE technique, outlined in this proposal, would provide a nonintrusive, insitu method of inspecting wing pivot bearings. The proposed method would also provide insight to the wing pivot bearing integrity, and help to schedule aircrft on a more empirical basis. Currently, the Navy's F-14 wing pivot bearings are being changed according to a time schedule or when wing sweep causes excessive noise in the bearing. The problems with this method is that replacing the bearing on a set time schedule is costly since some bearings do not need to be replaced. Also, some wing pivot bearings fail before the scheduled replacement time, thus causing structural problems. When a failure of this type occurs, both the pilot and aircraft are at risk since the dynamic loading experienced in flight could cause cracking in the box beam. Safety-of-flight and effective maintenance could be improved if it were not for access limitation that accompany the wing pivot joint. This limitation causes the removal of the wing to gain access to the bearing, which amounts in large sums of time and money. Thus, by using acoustic emission nondestructive testing techniques, valuable information concerning the structural integrity of the wing pivot bearing and wing box could be acquired without the removal of the wing assemblies.",

These systems enhance the quality and efficiency of healthcare by (1) providing advice about the likelihoods of alternative diseases, given sets of presenting symptoms, and (2) performing cost-benefit analyses about the next best tests to perform, through a formal weighing of the costs and benefits of alternative tests in a way that maximizes expected utility. However, a critical problem remains largely unsolved: We have found that even modest inconveniences imposed on the ergonomics of medical care by diagnostic systems often make them unacceptable to medical personnel.

To facilitate compliance monitoring and to improve cost-effectiveness of control technologies, a reliable, continuous CVOC monitor is essential.  Current CVOC instruments do not meet this growing need for air toxic monitors.  Such monitors must be inexpensive, continuous, capable of analyzing ppb level so CVOC's, robust, field usable, and capable of alarms, hardcopy compliance documentation, and signal processing for control systems.\n\nThe Phase I research clearly demonstrated the technical and economic feasibility of a continuous CVOC monitor meeting these requirements.  The monitor exploits a unique CVOC oxidation catalyst to convert CVOC's exclusively to inorganic chlorine compounds, which in turn are measured by existing commercial instruments.  Enhanced sensitivity arises from the favorable reaction stoichiometry, allowing measurements at ppb levels of CVOC's.",

        "abstract": "A novel sensor technology is suggested which has significant advantages in the areas of packaging and integration of sensors. It is proposed to develop this technology for pressure transducers. The key innovation of the process is the bonding of a sensor to a planar cover-wafer which contians through-wafer inteconnects. The sensor is hermetically sealed within the cover and is thus protected from the outside environment. The encapsulated sensor can be surface mounted to a header or board without external wires. This allows part of the packaging to be accomplished at the wafer level, enabling the benefits of batch fabrication to be applied to the package. The cover-wafer can also contain signal conditioning electronics to amplify and compensate the sensor's output. Integration is thus achieved at the wafer level, resulting in a reduced pin-count, which will lower the cost and improve reliability. This \"smart sensor\" is integrated vertically, thus allowing the independent optimization of the sensor and electronics with the coupling of the two.",

The formulation of a field size dependent color difference metric will enable symbol and display designers to optimize the use of color on self luminous displays. During the Phase I effort we will develop a theoretical model that aids in the design of symbology for color CRT displays. The effects of ambient illumination and surround color as factors in producing a reliable model for color discriminability also will be addressed in the study. The proposed program will utilize experiments with observers to determine the proper weighting vectors to modify the color difference metric. The effectiveness of a particular set of weighting vectors will be based upon how well the modified color difference metric yields discriminable colors as the field size is decreased under various illumination and surround conditions.",

Early therapeutic efforts resulted in unacceptable scarring that was attributedto unselective heating of tissue. Understanding the mechanisms of laser-tissue interactions lead to theclinical application of pulsed lasers which selectively target the vasculature and leave the surroundingtissue thermally unaffected. Despite these advancements, the optimum laser pulse duration has yet tobe investigated. Modeling predicts that a pulse width of several milliseconds would be ideal.Flashlamp-pumped dye lasers (pulse width = 0.4 ms) create pulses which are short to avoid bruising,or purpura, and are localized to the irradiated spot. Purpura is a result of vessel disruption and is not adesired clinical or cosmetic endpoint. Continuous wave lasers (exposure time > 30 ms) result inscarring due to overheating the vessel. We will develop a solid state laser capable of generating pulsesbetween the range of one and ten milliseconds. This laser is a modification of a surgical laser wecurrently manufactured.

Elevated Lp(a) levels can be treated with niacin. Lp(a) differs from other lipoproteins by the presence of a glycoprotein, called apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)], which is present in numerous isoforms that vary by size and creates significant error in assays that measure Lp(a) mass. We will measure and standardize Lp(a) by its cholesterol content [Lp(a)-c], a relatively stable component of Lp(a) that does not vary with isoform size. Specifically, Lp(a) will be separated from other lipoproteins by a lectin precipitation process devised by the applicant. Lp(a)-C will be determined in the precipitin by standard enzymatic methods. Lectin binding is a rapid and inexpensive method to separate glycoproteins by variation in polysaccharide content. Measurement of Lp(a)-c introduces less error than Lp(a) mass, as a result it is more amenable to standardization and allows for direct comparison of Lp(a) to other lipoproteins because they are routinely measured by their cholesterol content. Preliminary data indicates a high correlation of Lp(a)-c with Lp(a) mass, utilizing a standardized cholesterol assay.

L'Garde has recently made significant advances in developing the capability to also rigidize inflatable structural components after they have been deployed. This enhances the capability to form structures with a long life since, after rigidization, the inflatant is no longer needed. Also the rigidized material is very strong. The capability of fabricating inflatable/rigidizable basic tubular structural members has been developed. However, the capabilities to fabricate the joints in a structure where several tubes are joined, as well as other design aspects of a complete structure, have not been developed. This proposed program is designed to meet this need. The completion of this development will provide a unique capability which will be of benefit in numerous applications.",

At the present time, GaN films which are produced by the most widely used folm growth technologies, have residual hydrogen which leads to high donor levels. This leads to degradation of the electrical properties and prevents attainment of high mobility n-type or p-type films. Hydrogen free films of superior electrical properties can be grown by MBE, but the growth rates are slow and the method is expensive. The purpose of the proposed program is to provide a low cost method for obtaining large area, single crystal films of GaN which are free of hydrogen and which would have superior electrical properties and device performance.",

        "abstract": "In many real-world systems, isolating faults is complicated by the large number of faults that can occur, the complex interactions or relationships between faults, and the presence of uncertainty. Consequently, automated fault isolation for such systems can become computationaly expensive, thereby making it difficult to provide an accurate diagnosis in real-time. This proposed work will develop an approach to automated fault isolation in the presence of uncertainty that can often provide a diagnosis in real-time. The principal types of uncertainty that will be dealt with in this work are uncertainty in the observed symptoms and uncertainty in the relationships in the fault net. Various methods for utilizing fuzzy logic in incorporating information in the form of natural language rules, degree of severity of the symptom, degree of symptom-fault relationship, continuous transition across thresholds, etc. and the combination of this evidence, will be developed and tested. As a result the diagnostic method will be more robust and accurate than when such uncertainties are ignored. This method will be applied in the problem of diagnosing failures in a space communications system.",

        "abstract": "This Phase l is a feasibility study of the design and synthesis of novel, non-intercalative dyes for nucleic acid (DNA/RNA) probes for DNA hybridization and other nucleic acid quantitation assays. In the past, radiolabels were used for detecting hybrids, but these are being replaced by non-radioactive probes such as oligonucleotide probes linked to fluorescent dyes. Fluorescent probes have been partially successful, but there remain significant problems associated with accurate fluorescent quantitation. Most fluorescent indicators are planar molecules that can intercalate between similarly flat base-pairs of nucleic acid helices, resulting in the quenching of fluorescence with consequent errors in quantitation, as well as loss in sensitivity of detection. We will develop new types of fluorescent dyes that are sterically hindered so as not to intercalate into the DNA helices when they are linked to probe sequences. Three approaches will be taken: 1. a sterically hindered fluorophore will be developed, 2. a \"dendritic\" spacer unit will be developed to prevent intercalation of linked dyes and to allow multiple dye attachment, thus enabling signal multiplication, and 3. a fluorophore will be entrapped within a caged system, or host-guest complex. The new fluorophores will be attached to deoxyuridine (dU) or deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP), which will be incorporated into oligonucleotide probes, the efficacy of which can be easily determined.",

        "abstract": "Shock waves which form forward of an occupied ejection seat in a supersonic airstream can produce static and total pressure values which indicate safe altitude/airspeed conditions suitable for recovery parachute operation when in acutality, extreme high altitude/airspeed conditions still exist. A simple means for reliably determining supersonic airspeed condisitons and an optimum means for deploying the recovery parachute are described. The technique used to determine whether a supersonic airspeed exists depends only on measuring the rapidly decreasing static pressure which occurs as the ejected seat and occupant mass is declerated by the airstream. The technique used to set the recovery parachute deployment time is to continuously measure the airspeed and altitude, and after deceleration to subsonic airspeed conditions, deploy the parachute immediately upon reaching a preset airspeed for the measured altitude. The improved reliability of post-ejection sequencing as well as the increased performance capability of the escape system that will be provided by this optimized Mach number immune sequencer is discussed. A program is proposed to demonstrate the feasibility of such an optimized Mach number immune sequencer which is suitable for use in futer escape systems.",

By these means, a facultative engine can be implemented whereby a highly variable amount of air can be efficiently utilized to conserve expendables to the benefit of payload, range, and endurance. The proposed system would be electrohydraulically operated and regeneratively cooled with circulated fuel thereby eliminating external cooling provisions and cumbersome mechanical drives and controls while providing convenient packaging and automation interfaces for remote command and control. The proposed investigation will examine the transient hydraulic effects, injection pulse profiles, turn-down range and design details of the components required to implement a common rail, solenoid-controlled electrohydraulic unit injection system subject to microprocessor control.

Large FOR staring IR FPA's are presently very expensive and difficult to manufacture. A possible lower cost, easy-to-fabricate alternative is to scan the large FOR over a small IR detector array. Scanning approaches using binary optics with a microshifting mechanism, line scanners, and gimbaled wedge scanners hae limitations in image quality and speed. We propose to provide a detailed analysis through a preliminary design and performance prediction of three different large search FOR IR FPA scanning concepts. Each concept has the potential to provide substantial performance improvements over previous techniques. The analyses will include parametric design studies of each scanning concept to determine a near-optimum design and the operating constraints for each concept. We will compare the designs for each concept to determine the best design for a given application. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The large search FOR IR FPA scanning concepts we propose to evaluate have the potential to provide high quality images at high speed, small size, low power, and low cost.

DFT usually occurs within a standard design flow incorporating capture, synthesis, and simulation capabiiities. Existing point solutions generate some structures such as scan-chain, 1149.1 elements and do not generate all the necessary structures. Existing point solutions require the designer to be intimately familiar with DFT and require that he/she understand both the structure and its connections with the rest of the design. Coventionally, it is the responsibility of the designer to both maintain and re-use test data/structure(s). LogicVision's existing solution provide the ability to generate built-in self-test (BIST) and various other structures at the RTL and higher up levels. LogicVision intends to develope a configuration manager which will maintain all the test structures/data generated by the tools and by operating at the RTL and higher levels, the structures are connected by the configuration manager with the rest of the design. The tools thus permit the re-use of test objects and test data across the hierarchy of the design.

        "abstract": "Treating waste sites contaminated with dioxin is both costly and difficult. Current clean up standards require that treatment reduce dioxin residuals to very low levels. The allowable level of residuals is very strict because of the assessment that dioxin poses a serious health hazard. At present, incineration is the only available technology in the US deemed acceptable for treating dioxin-contaminated materials but the public are highly skeptical about the performance of incinerators. Dioxins are extremely insoluble in water, are only slightly soluble in some organic solvents and have a strong affinity for adsorption onto organic matter and soil particles. These difficulties limit the range of remediation techniques suitable for remediation of dioxin containing soils. To meet cleanup standards, Lynntech has developed a special chemical oxidation system that offers several cost and process benefits for the treatment of dioxin contaminated soils. The merits of the new process are: (1) degradation of dioxins occurs in situ which eliminates the need to extract and treat the total quantity of the waste soil; (2) the process uses low cost bulk chemicals; and, (3) the reagents are efficiently distributed throughout the fine structure of the soil particles. Preliminary research is described that demonstrates the viability of the new process for degrading chlorinated organic contaminants in soils and initial cost estimates are highly favorable when compared to existing processes for handling and treating dioxin contaminated soil. The Phase I research will focus on domonstrating the new process in laboratory soil test cells emphasizing degradation of dioxins that are adsorbed to the soil matrix.",

        "abstract": "The Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) protocol wastes bandwidth. This severely limits the number of network entities on bandwidth-constrained long-haul networks (LHNs). DIS is a fairly static protocol, in that it is difficult, time-consuming, and costly to add new types of vehicles and munitions to it. LHNs introduce transmission latencies that can adversely impact the stability of command and control feedback systems so crucial to Precision Strike. We propose a DIS variant that is much more bandwidth-efficient, that introduces less latency, and that accepts new entity and munition types more readily than does DIS. We propose to use an ARPA funded DIS extension, the Migratory Object Protocol, to overcome LHN-induced latency. This will enhance the fidelity of Precision Strike simulations.",

In this concept, the antenna feed is fixed and only the (non- parabolic) reflector is rotated to produce beam scan. This cannot be done with a conventional reflector. This technique eliminates lossy RF rotary joints and typically results in ~8:1 reduction drive mass and power due to a 2:1 scan- angle amplification and reduced rotational inertia.

Its primary application to date has been the replacement of standard solid parabolic reflector antennas with a planar structure having a much lower weight and superior form factor.  To date we have used this technique for construction of several antennas for missile seeker and airborne radar applications.  One physical realization of the FLAPS antenna is construction in the form of a wide mesh \"tennis racquet\" using plated Levlar string.  Such a construction as a replacement for a solid SATCOM antenna results in a much lighter antenna and a very much lower wind loading.  The much lower weight and wind loading would allow for installation of multiple antennas on an existing pedestal and control system.  As is shown in our proposal, this FLAPS antenna lends itself very well to multiple band operation within the same antenna.  Additionally, increased performance can be obtained by increasing the size of the antenna while still maintaining a lower weight and compatibility with existing pedestal systems.  Under this proposed Phase I effort, the feasibility of such a multi-band, increased performance, lower weight antenna installed on the existing single antenna pedestal would be established.  Our proposal gives an example of a recently completed Malibu Research 20 ft. C-band SARCOM FLAP's antenna using esactly this concept for operation in 60 knot winds.",

As a result, many different tests are used to assess liver function. Although these tests provide information concerning the metabolic state of the liver, each procedure has limitations that compromise its value. The galactose breath test represents a non-invasive method of assessing liver function, since galactose is primarily metabolized by the liver. In this test, galactose (labeled with 14C or 13C) is administered to the patient and the appearance of label in the expired CO2 is used as an indication of liver function. Although the literature suggests that this test is a good predictor of liver function, due to the radiation risk associated with 14C-galactose and the unavailability of 13C-galactose, the clinical usefulness of the galactose breath test has not been fully evaluated. The goal is to produce 13C-galactose and clinically evaluate the usefulness of this compound as a non-invasive measure of hepatic function. We will culture, in the presence of 13CO2, a proprietary microalga that overproduces galactose. The purified, labeled galactose will then be used for human clinical studies to determine the specificity and sensitivity of this test for assessing liver function.",

This proposal will address the problems of growing {100] W whiskers/fibers in a heavy alloy matrix. The whiskers/fibers will be grown by the proven VLS process in which MER has considerable expertise (prior experience in growth of SiC and TiB2 whiskers) using a [100] W single crystal substrate, a mixture of WCl6 and H2 as the reactant gases and a Ni-based catalyst (Ni-Fe, Ni-Co, Ni-Cu). The whiskers/fibers will be harvested, cold-pressed and infiltrated in-situ by the catalyst (by varying temperature and atmosphere to promote wetting). This will demonstrate processing that can produce projectiles (>10mm in diameter) for ballistic evaluation. A test scale WHA composite synthesized through the above process will be delivered to the program technical monitor.",

        "abstract": "Conventional composite processing techniques are presently unable to fabricate unidirectional fiber reinforced composites based on small diameter fibers, for example, ~5-20 um in diameter. The primary problem is one of infiltration of the matrix in between the fibers and maintaining a reasonably constant fiber spacing. An innovative MMC processing technique is proposed wherein, starting with a ceramic fiber tow, each fiber would be spread and individually coated with the matrix material by a plasma-assisted sputtering process. The continuous coated fiber can then be utilized in a variety of ways, such as fiber lay-up for uniaxial panels or weaving in 2 or 3 dimensional architecture, followed by hot consolidation to obtain advanced composites with desired fiber orientation. Such a composite processing technique is also amenable to tailoring of the fiber-matrix interface by the addition of a very thin coat of metals such as Cr or Ti (which improve adhesion of the matrix to the fiber) prior to deposition of the matrix in a single step. Further, the fiber volume fraction within the matrix can be varied by varying the thickness of the coating. By coating all the fibers to a given thickness, an uniform fiber spacing can be obtained in a hot-consolidated state. This composite processing technique is also flexible enough to accommodate a starting compliant/compensating layer, if necessary, to improve the thermal cycling performance of these composites (especially those based on relatively brittle matrices).",

In addition, by depositing carbon by CVD, the C-C composites can be made impervious. High thermal conductivity and stability of C-C composites in highly corrosive atmospheres is the motivation behind this proposed application in sodium-sulfur batteries as a container material. The state-of-the-art sodium-sulfur batteries use chromized mild steel containers for the sulfur electrode. This has three drawbacks: (1) attack of mild steel due to defects in chromized layer shortens cell life. (2) heat dissipation during charge-discharge is a limitation due to low thermal conductivity. (3) Higher specific gravity of mild steel lowers the specific energy density (energy/weight). C-C composites are ideally suited as they are superior to chromized mild steel in all three aspects. In addition, due to the additional step of chromizing that is a must with mild steel containers, the projected cost of C-C composites is not expected to be a limitation. It is proposed that C-C composite tubes will be acquired from Hercules, Inc. The issue of attachment of steel collar to the tube to form a hermetic seal will be addressed. Two sodium-sulfur cells using Na- \"-alumina solid electrolyte tubes, sodium anode and sulfur-impregnated carbon felt cathode will be assembled and tested in charge-discharge mode and peak power mode. The cells will be thermally cycled and technical feasibility of using C-C composites for sodium-sulfur cells will be evaluated.

Very few of the researchers have addressed the formidable problems of handling kilograms of such materials, forming of intermediate shapes (preform), or proceeding directly to final consolidation from the original nanomaterial. It is obvious that if engineering applications for nanomaterials are to be found, cost effective technologies to form dense, near net shape bodies must be developed. This Phase I effort proposes an evaluation of three promising but emerging consolidation techniques; plasma activated sintering, hot isostatic forging and electro discharge compaction. We will explore these techniques for their utility in consolidating nanoparticulates of interest to the Army as potential structural materials. We will perform nanoparticulate synthesis using the pulsed reactive electrode technique developed at MMI for tungsten, tungsten composites, and intermetallic aluminide or a silicide as well as commercially available nanomaterials - a ceramic material and another tungsten material synthesized using other methods such as sputtering or spray forming/CVD. We will fabricate specimens of the avove materials which can be characterized for density, microstrucutre and hardness. Finally, we will evaluate the state of development of each process and estimate its potential for scale up to fabricate commercially viable, cost effective components of interest to the Army.

        "abstract": "The replacement of depleted uranium (DU) by tungsten alloys with plasma spray formed claddings is proposed. Such claddings would force highly localized shear to be continually induced by employing a thick adiabatic shear-susceptible coating or cladding on tungsten alloy cores. This cladding or composite approach enables optimal shear performance to be developed in an alloy or cladding structure without compromising the ballistic performance of the core tungsten penetrator. Chamber or vacuum plasma spray forming in controlled atmospheres (low pressure or inert gas) will be used to produce such thick claddings from powders of alloys which intrinsically exhibit highly localized, adiabatic shear. Plasma sprayed claddings of tool steels, intermetallics and titanium will be evaluated. Another method of achieving highly localized shear band deformation is through a combination of alloy and microstructure (composite/micro-laminate) whicha re plasma sprayed. Such microstructure-induced shear systems which consist of micro-laminate layered structures with alternating layers of a base alloy such as tungsten, tool steel, or titanium with TiC, zirconia, or nickel aluminide layers will also be studied. The particualte and layer processing capability of plasma spray forming lends itself to the formation of such alloys and structural claddings onto tungsten penetrator cores. The challenge will be to achieve sufficient bonding and strain compatibility between the cladding adn tungsten core. Controlled atmosphere plasma spray has the potential to improve the bond, especially with post-spray heat treatments and by grading interfaces to accommodate the strains which will induce high stresses at the cladding/core interface.",

        "abstract": "Under separate Navy funding, MSI has developed a low cost injection molding process for piezocomposite fabrication that has made these innovative materials available for the first time in manufacturing quantities. 1-3 type piezoelectric ceramic/polymer composites have demonstrated performance advantages in Navy sensor and actuator applications, and their benefits in commercial acoustic imaging applications are well understood. In Phase 1, MSI plans to demonstrate the benefits of 1-3 piezoelectric composites on two large array systems of current applications interest to the US Navy: The Advanced Mine Detection System (AMDS) and Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) imaging arrays. The AMDS, now approaching its production phase, is currently using a 0-3 composite that is manufactured offshore, and has limited sensitivity and actuation ability. The Phase 1 work will be accomplished on 20-element array 1-3 piezocomposites in a test tank. In Phase 2, MSI will build full AMDS and UUV arrays for systems evaluation. At present, the manufacturing costs of these 1-3 composite transducers limit their widespread applicability in cost-sensitive commercial applications because there is no large volume application to generate economies of scale. The planned AMDS application will provide the necessary manufacturing volume and will thereby facilitate large scale commercial development.",

In addition to the moral outcry against the procedure, the Draize test has been criticized due to the high degree of inter- and intra-laboratory variability, its lack of objectivity, and the extra sensitivity of the rabbit eye in comparison to the human eye. Nonetheless, the Draize test has become the standard ocular toxicological testing method since it was developed nearly 50 years ago. The purpose is to develop an alternative to the Draize test which is a reliable predictor of ocular toxicity. The alternative is a cell culture based corneal analog whose cellular and tissue-like behavior can be quantified in a well defined, reproducible manner as a function of exposure to a potential toxicant or irritant. Such a system would remove the subjectivity of the Draize method, increase reproducibility, and avoid the moral problems of inhumane treatment of animals.",

With proper processing, these polymers are expected to lead to a new class of foam core materials with specific mechanical properties better than other organic foams and comptetitive with honeycomb core. The objective foams will feature low densities (6-12 lbs/ft ) in combination with high strength and stiffness. The new foams will form better bonds with surface skins (better contact area), will be more moisture resistant, and more damage tolerant than competing honeycomb cores. Thus, resulting foam core sandwich structures will show overall better mechanical properties along with reduced repair and maintenance and will find much use in weight-sensitive applications. The primary Phase I objective is to fabricate demonstration quantities of the new Poly-X foams via 3M's proprietary supercritical foaming method and demonstrate their superior properties (compression, flexure, and shear) in snadwich panels. Phase II eforts will include optimization of the foam composition for maximum processability and properties, scaleup of 3M's foaming process, evaluation of alternate foaming techniques, and more detailed testing of prototype systems.",

The compensator ring will be fabricated of an alloy whose transformation temperature is suited to the stage 2 and stage 3 of this turbine, and the design and thermo-mechanical processing of the ring will be such that when the turbine has reached operating temperature, the ring diametral change will reduce the tip clearance to approximately 0.001\". Performance will be evaluated for a range of ambient air temperatures encountered, and the stability of the compensator ring as a function of cycles of operation and dwell time at operating temperature. The tip clearance compensation by the shape memory induced diameter change of a ring insert would substantially improve engine efficiency and fuel consumption. Systems for accurately locating the rings in the shroud in both the axial and radial direction will be developed as well as concepts to facilitate assembly.

Further, wavelength division multiple access (WDM) devices have been developed for ultradensity, Gigabit switchable networks.

The number of men at risk for this disease is growing rapidly as the population ages. This research is intended to introduce and evaluate Passive Microwave Radiometry (PMR) technology for the treatment of prostate Cancer. The PMR technique provides noninvasive, passive sensing of temperatures deep within tissue; this allows temperatures within the prostate to be measured using transurethral or transrectal microwave antennas. A major advantage of the PMR system is that temperatures are measured directly from the tissue, eliminating catheter effects. Another advantage is that the same microwave antenna can be used to both deliver hyperthermia and measure temperature. This dual function eliminates the need for additional thermometry catheters. The Phase I Program will seek to determine optimize and characterize temperature distribution of antennas to be developed as an intracavitary hyperthermia system for treating prostate cancer. Combining the PMR system with newly designed transrectal and transurethral applicators should allow intracavitary prostate hyperthermia treatments to be delivered without the need for additional invasive thermometry.",

Various methods for producing the pressurized air beams have been explored. The current method of arch fabrication is to cut patterns from flat fabric, and sew or cement seams to form the curved tube and end closure, with air-retention provided by a separate internal bladder or a coating. This method is labor intensive, and the resulting seams provide a large number of potential initiation sites for tube failure. The Army is currently pursuing both 3-D weaving and braiding approaches for producing the curved arches; however, these techniques are still in the developmental stages. Merix proposes to develop an automated method to inexpensively form the arches directly form non-woven fabric, with no seams. The Merix process should be less expensive that 3-D weaving and braiding, and should eliminate the possibility for defects in the 3-D weaving and braiding processes to degrade the arch support capabilities of the structure.",

        "abstract": "This project will develop an electronic covering analogous to human skin, which can be mounted on robots or other devices to provide environmental information such as proximity, force and temperature. Merritt Systems Inc. (MSI) proposes to investigate and develop a skin that incorporates a variety of sensing media and to accomplish this task. MSI has previously developed a whole-arm coverage, non-contract proximity sensor system for articulated robots using discrete infrared and acoustical sensor elements on flexible circuit boards (sensorSkin). This implementation can be extended to function like human skin by incorporating additional sensor types: temperature, force/pressure and tactile. MSI will determine operational requirements, develop a preliminary design and determine the feasibility of this sensor sheet during Phase I. We will also investigate an innovative sensing method using instrumented compliant foam components to make up the skin. Additionally, we will investigate several temperature detection methods including contact and non-contact methods. The sensor system will incorporate media-specific snalog circuits, and common microcontroller and serial interface components on a single hybrid PC board. The sensorSkin contains digital communication and power buses, and sockets at discrete locations for mounting the sensor elements. It will be designed to be cut, shaped and bent without losing connectivity.",

By recording a wavefront that has passed through the test field, the three dimensional characterization of both the amplitude and phase information in the field is possible.

        "abstract": "A novel nonintrusive laser probe for measurement of the structure of velocity flow fields for ground testing of aircraft turbine engines will be developed. A narrowband ArF excimer laser will be used to photo-dissociate O2. The O (1D) photoproducts rapidly react with ambient O2 to form O3, and thus \"write\" a line of tagged O3 molecules. After a fixed time delay, a novel approach to O atom detection will be employed to \"read\" the displaced ozone line. A second laser sheet (XeCl-pumped double-dye laser) will measure the progress of the tagged O3 by photodissociating ozone, and monitoring the O atom photoproduct by two-photon planar laser induced fluoresence (PLIF). The spatial displacement of the tagged line will be used to measure the velocity in time-of-flight fashion. The proposed innovation is the development of an entirely new photofragment flow tagging technique suitable for low temperature, subsonnic, unseeded flows, and application to inlet flows of aircraft turbine engines. The use of an intensified CCD camera will ensure that large areas of the flow will be imaged.",

The proposed technique will solve a fundamental problem in optical particle sizing that normally prevents the use of backscattering or near backscattering. Multiple wavelengths from independent laser diode sources will be mixed to produce a laser sheet to illuminate the particles. Light scattered at angles between ninety degrees and backscattering by particles crossing the laser sheet will not have the large Mie scattering oscillations characteristic of monochromatic radiation, but instead will be characterized by a near-monotonic distribution. The feasibility of using two receivers positioned symmetrically to the laser transmitter will be explored to assess the ability of establishing particle asphericity. A backscattering receiver with an interference filter centered at a wavelength of interest to optical air data systems will provide the backscattering distribution. Analyses using five discrete wavelengths near 800 nm show that particles between 0.4 \u00bfm and 20 \u00bfm yield a typical measurement error of 5% for known index of refraction.

The dose-response mechanism relies on the enhancement of the proton NMR relaxation of water in the gel at the site of radiation absorption; acrylic comonomers dispersed in the gel are polymerized. Doses of the order of 10 Gy can be measured with a spatial resolution less than lmm using clinical MR imaging equipment. In addition, the optical turbidity of the transparent gel increases with absorbed dose because the copolymer precipitates from water and, thus, the dose distribution can also be optically visualized. The gel will find widespread use in radiation therapy practice, for 3D measurements in homogeneous and anthropomorphic phantoms, confirmation of computerized treatment planning and in quality assurance procedures. In Phase I, we will devise and evaluate a protocol for convenient and inexpensive preparation of a prototype polymer-gel dosimeter. We will also demonstrate the dosimeter's stability and reproducibility as well as spatial uniformity of the dose- response.

The critical band model has been the basis of research efforts in the past concerning noise-induced hearing loss, presbycusis, and speech recognition. Little effort, however, has been made to use critical band theory in the field of speech enhancement. The effectiveness of the speech enhancement system developed in this effort will be judged both objectively and subjectively. A battery of speech recognition tests will be employed in several noise environments under several signal-to-noise ratios. Subjective quality assessments from the listeners will also be obtained.

Existig Inlet Particle Separator (IPS) systems based on Bortex tube designs have two major limitations: their efficiency decreases with the size of particulate matter, and they are difficult and expensive to retrofit in existing APU/SPUs. The objectives of this project are to develop and assess a novel IPS system based on a boundary-layer momentum transfer concept that will greatly improve the efficiency of particle removal while operating within the performance and spatial parameters of existing APU/SPus. Prior research has shown this technique to be very efficient at removing particulates from unconstrained gaseous streams. The thrust of Phase I research is to use computer simulation modelling to analyze the trade-offs between particle removal efficiency, pressure loss, airflow, size and weight of an IPS that can be adapted to existing APU/SPUs. The resulting criteria will be used to evaluate production/retrofit costs and to create a preliminary IPS design emphasizing the higest efficiency for the lowest cost and size.

The method consists of microdispensing a photoabsorptive dye onto the surface of tooth then focusing a laser beam on the dye spot, which is 75-200mum in diameter. By the appropriate choice of photo-absorptive dye and laser wavelength, the system can be tuned for the optimal transfer of energy from the laser to the tooth. Thus, ablation can be achieved without photoacoustic or thermal damage to underlying tissue. In the dental hard-tissue model, a dye microdispenser and a laser-aiming optic are combined in a single, compact handpiece. The microdispenser and the laser are aligned together, so that the operator can dispense microdroplets of fluid and deliver pulses of laser irradiation simultaneously on a single spot.

        "abstract": "Under a variety of conditions, effluents from ship stacks can enhance reflectively of shallow layer clouds in such a way that the presence of ships can be detected in daytime satellite images. Multispecial observations from AVHRR abroad NOAA polar orbiting satellites have been used to identify ship tracks through enhanced cloud reflectivity at 3.7 microns, and to a lesser extent 0.63 microns. Nonetheless, some difficulties remain associated primarily with the high variability of cloud reflectivity which results from large variations in liquid water amount and droplet sizes at small spatial scales. Further, the age of the tracks can lead to signatures that are weak and, hence, can pose problems for automated detection, even though the tracks are apparent by visual inspection. In this proposal we address the problem of developing an automated ship track detection system. To do so, we propose to perform the following: 1) optimally enhance satellite images using multispectral signals; 2) determine features that best characterize higher reflectivity and curvilinearity of ship tracks; 3) apply rule-based and cluster analysis techniques to reduce the data stream to a limited number of subscences with potential tracks; 4) apply state-of-the-art neural net and statistical discriminant analysis methods as final detection filters; 5)assess detection success and error rates; 6) develop an automated prototype system design. The algorithms used here are ones that have exhibited success on this or similar problems. We will adopt the approach of applying a sequence of tests or detection filters to optimize the benefits of each and to minimize detection error rates of both types.",

        "abstract": "The design and development of the radiating portion of broad band active element phased arrays has not kept pace with the development of microwave integrated circuits. The commonly used \"Vivaldi Notch\" arrays are large, expensive, prone to manufacturing tolerance problems and their impedance can vary with respect to antenna scan angle. This effort will provide the detailed design of a 7 to 12 GHz array that is thin (approx. 1 inch from ground plane to top layer) and scan compensated from normal out to 60 deg. in any direction. This array design will contain feed and matching networks so it can be readily interfaced with MMIC T/R modules. The array design will use standard printed circuit techniques for low cost and highly reliable manufacturing tolerances. The electrical design of the arry will use proven computer codes and account for all potential radiation including feed line effects. The feed and matching networks will be designed using common microstrip methods and the connections between various layers in the network will implement plated through hole technology. This type of array is well suited for conformal applications but can be adapted to virtually any radiating aperture and can be applied to commercial aircraft radars, automated highways (IVHS) and the telecommunications industry.",

This is achieved through extensive computer simulations that incorporate input parameters which allow the user to customize the simulation to his particular need. Several tunable materials (in the 300 - 1200 nm range) have been synthesized and tested with excellent agreement to the data obtained b the simulations. In addition, MKR has developed novel microfiber technologies which can be used to incorporate the multispectral materials within, thus providing the alternative of weaving new textiles if desired. MKR is also currently pursuing the use of conductive polymers as a means to camouflage radar returns. Among other applications of these radar absorbent materials include the capaiblity to decontaminate radar return.",

The study will: (a) assess the impact of using a Healthcare Suite on both the elder residing in the unit and family caregivers, and (b) obtain information from potential users, family members, and professionals to identify aspects of the physical unit and service components that could be adapted and improved.

The technological innovation of the proposed work lies in the use of recent kinematic technology in physiological investigations, the consideration of different synergy patterns in the task requirements, the emphasis on training tasks that are functionally meaningful, and the use of regulated sensory feedback to effect improvement.

A fundamental problem with the use of polymeric materials is the poling or aligning process needed to obtain the second order optical nonlinearity. In the proposed work, we will undertake to apply methods of enzymatic resolution to obtain optically pure chiral monomers, synthesize polymers from these monomers and examine the ability of these polymers to impart an asymmetric environment to an NLO active guest.

Reflecting optics, often based on multilayer reflection, are the only practical optic for most applications.

The goal is to combine multilayers and other emerging technologies to innovate and develop very fine line width (,0.1 ~m period or 10,000 lines per mm) multilayer diffraction gratings for the EUV and soft x-ray spectrum. We propose with this SBIR to innovate and develop a fine line lithography technology to enable the fabrication of these very fine line gratings. Technology essential to fabricate useful, high spectral resolving power (> 10,000) diffractive and imaging optics for these wavelengths will be the final result. These optics will provide the spectral resolution to enable more accurate measurements, and a more detailed understanding, of x-ray and EUV spectra and the phenomena which produce radiation at these wavelengths. A side benefit of this innovative research and development will be the ability to fabricate other optics which are waiting for practical fine line lithography, such as visible light wire grid polarizers.",

A potential solution to this problem is reinforcment with diboride fibers to create tough, thermal shock resistant diboride fiber-diboride matrix composites. The proposed work will involve the fabrication of ZrB2-Zrb2 composites by the forced-flow chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) of low density carbon fiber mat preforms. The 40 to 50 um diameter fibers will be formed in situ by depositing ZrBf2 onto the 9 um diatmeter corbon fibers to give final fiber volumes of 40 to 50%. This will be followed by depositing thin layers of BN on the fibers to promote the debonding needed for toughness and them forming the ZrB2 matrix by CVI. The experimental work will be guided by thermodynamic and transport analytical modeling methods developed in a previous program. In addition to the ZrB2 CVI development, experiments will be performed to determine if SiC particulate can be added to the composites by slurry infiltration to improve oxidation resistance. Specimens will be characterized by light and acanning electron microscopy, and toughness and strength will be evaluated by pressurized ring tensile tests.",

In the prototype three dimensional atlas, the ability to interactively compute arbitrary oblique slices through the three-dimensional anatomy of the normal mouse embryo will demonstrate the capability of the system to precisely match the anatomical orientation of any slice through a mutated embryo that a researcher might select for comparison. We will use the database and software tools that we develop to formulate a prototype set of tools and commercial services including, in part, a microcomputer-based CD ROM atlas and knowledge base, an online database, and a consulting service. Subsequent phases will produce the full mouse development databases, and establish an operating consulting service for the assessment of mouse dysmorphologies.",

Treatment of human fungal disease, especially in immunodeficient patients suffering from Acquired Immunodeficien- cy Syndrome, is hampered by the virtual lack of clinically useful drugs. Filamentous fungal morphogenesis and growth are the direct result of polysaccharide polymers and other materials being sequentially deposited at each hyphal apex, leading to the formation of a mature cell wall. Cell-wall assembly results in a wall containing chitin, beta(1-3) glucan, and other beta- and alpha-linked glucans, proteins and lipids. Perhaps the key step in fungal cell-wall assembly is the synthesis of beta (1,3) glucan, and its subsequent incorporation into the cell wall. Although there are a number of known glucan synthase inhibitors, each suffers from a variety of flaws that precludes their clinical use. We will develop a high-throughput, sensitive, specific screen for inhibitors of beta(1,3) glucan synthase activity. This screen can be used to identify novel inhibitors for eventual therapeutic use.",

        "abstract": "Translated GPS tracking systems are frequently used to track missiles, aircraft, and other aerospace vehicle for applications requiring real-time position and velocity. The GPS/TPS tracking system provides intermediate data that is recorded during tracking and available for post-mission trajectory analysis. Greater post-mission trajectory accuracy can be achieved by using improved error models and making optimum use of the available data. This proposal outlines an error model analysis and post-processing technique directed at improving post-mission trajectory information. A method of generating accurate contiguous carrier phase measurements from the translated GPS signals is proposed. This carrier data will then be processed post-test to generate a \"kinematic\" solution for the trajectory. Flight test results with GPS receivers using this method have demonstrated that accuracies of better than 10 cm are possible. The degree of improvement in post-mission trajectory determination will be demonstrated using this method.",

        "abstract": "The DOT has identified the need for an emergency location service as part of the IVHS program. GPS has been proposed as a method of providing location in support of this \"Mayday\" service. However, the expense, slow time-to-first-fix, and inability to compute a navigation fix except when four satellites are visible make conventional GPS receivers inappropriate for emergency location. NAVSYS has developed an alternative, low cost GPS sensor, the TIDGET, which is ideally suited for emergency location. This sensor was developed under the USAF contract for tracking radiosondes. Instead of tracking the GPS signals, the TIDGET sensor captures a brief \"snapshot\" of ray GPS sampled data and transmits this snapshot to the emergency dispatch center where the location of the motorist is computed. The central processing is aided by data from a map database when fewer than four satellites are in veiw of the sensor. The TIDGET requires no initialization or warm-up time since there is no processing of the data performed at the vehicle In large quantities, the TIDGET cost is less than $100 per unit, not including the cellular phone or other mobile communications link. Under this project, it is proposed to complete the TIDGET Mayday system architecture design and perform an initial in-vehicle demonstration of an emergency sensor. Anticipated Benefits: A reliable Mayday service will significantly increase highway safety, particularly in rural regions. The proposed TIDGET Mayday system architecture also permits value-added services to be provided to consumers through a public-private partnership. Commercial applications include AAA and tourist information services, stolen car recovery, and automatic vehicle location (AVL).",

Syntheses are proposed for new dendrimers based on adamantylic initiator cores and chain branching monomers and rigid rod spacers; these will be also be used as single-label carriers for multiple gold clusters. The resulting probes should combine the ease of visibility of larger colloidal gold particles with high sensitivity, low non-specific protein affinity, no aggregation or label dissociation, and penetration up to 30 microns into cells and tissue sections. New multiple gold cluster probes used with silver enhancement in antigen detection blots should demonstrate unprecedented sensitivities; we possibly should use an order of magnitude or more higher than current chemiluminescence methods.

The hardware incorporates a novel pipelined architecture with intraframe and interframe block codings for significant bit-rate reduction and low-power operation. The intraframe coder utilizes vector quantization (VQ) for a low-loss video compression at 0.5 bit/pixel rate. The interframe coder employs an adaptive index replenishment scheme for further bit-rate reduction. Two candidate VQ architectures are proposed: (1) a full search VQ for a fully parallel, analog implementation with very low power dissipation and low chip count; (2) a tree search VQ for a pipelined, digital implementation with high configurability and low power operation. Active pixel sensor (APS) technology will be used to produce a low power, high resolution imager with on-chip pixel block formatting capability. In Phase 1, we optimize VQ architectures, perform preliminary design of an image encoder based on the selected VQ architecture, and develop APS devices for a Phase 2 hardware prototype development and demonstration.",

Existing facilities and equipments will be investigated to determine feasibility of interfacing the LADAR equipment to achieve required performance for the ground-to-air demonstration. The design of these equipments will be such that they can be incorporated into aircraft for subsequent Phase III development by the Navy.

        "abstract": "Urinary incontinence is experienced by a substantial number of mid-aged and older adults andresults in a range of costs -- clinical, psychological, social, and financial. Treatment of incontinence canimprove occur many patients. However, treatment techniques are diverse and patients are frequentlyfared with several options about which they might have limited, if any, knowledge. We will develop andtest a series of educational videotapes for health care consumers regarding various treatments for urinaryincontinence (UI). The tapes will promote informed decision-making about treatments as well as patientsatisfaction with the decision by providing information regarding: description of each treatmentprocedure; the type(s) of UI for which a specific treatment is indicated; evidence of treatment efficacy;expected outcome, including potential risks or untoward effects. Phase I has three specific aims: 1)develop the content and video treatment of each videotape in the series; 2) arrange for production ofthe videotape; and 3) establish distribution strategies and outlets. Phase II activities will includeproduction of the videotapes and a randomized field trial of their effectiveness in increasing knowledgeabout etiology and treatments of UI and promoting patient satisfaction with their treatment decision.The final product at the end of Phase II will be a tested and attractively packaged videotape series. Theproduct will be developed in close collaboration with the Simon Foundation for Continence who willassume a primary role in marketing and distribution in Phase III. Other distribution outlets will includeprofessional societies and distributors of educational health-care materials.",

        "abstract": "Older people in the U. S. receive most of their health care from primary care providers (internists, family or general practitioners). Consequently it is incumbent on them to differentially diagnose physical vs. emotional health problems. Depression in older persons presents particular challenges in this regard. Depression in the elderly is frequently masked as a somatic episode and much of it appears as comorbidity. While depression among elders is known to be prevalent, there are estimates that up to 90 per cent of it is \"missed\" during everyday clinical encounters. Physicians are often not well trained to recognize elder depression. Their practice settings may discourage its detection because it is time consuming and under-reimbursed. The overall goal is to develop an instructional videotape to sensitize internists, primary care physicians and family practitioners to the presence and subtleties of depression in their elderly patients in order to enhance their diagnostic skills. Tasks during Phase I will include: (a) developing (with a team of practicing psychiatrists and internists) the precise content areas of the video (e. g., somatized depression, comorbid depression, relationship to dementia, SDAT, etc.); (b) producing a script outline under the leadership of Ms. Carol Rainey (an award winning film producer at NERI); (c) review and written criticism of the script by an Advisory Committee; (d) revising the script on the basis of reviewers' recommendations; (e) developing a production schedule for early in Phase II. Phase II will involve the actual production and evaluation of the video in collaboration with the Division of General Internal Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine. The product at the end of Phase II will be an evaluated, state- of-the-science, educational videotape ready for mass production and distribution to internists, primarily providers, geriatricians, gerontologists, nurses and medical social workers during Phase III.",

        "abstract": "Active patient involvement in therapeutic decision making has been related to increased adherence to prescribed medical regimens and improved disease prognosis. Older patients, however, are less likely to assume an active role because they accept the physician as authority and, therefore, assume a passive role during the physician visit. The purpose is to develop and test an educational videotape to empower elders to take an active role as partners with physicians in their health care. The videotape is an educational tool that can provide realistic examples of partnership behaviors and techniques to improve elders' communications and satisfaction in health care encounters. Currently no videotape regarding this issue is commercially available. The aims of Phase I are to: 1) develop the content areas of the videotape; 2) produce a script for the 30-minute videotape; 3) develop a list of distribution outlets; and 4) arrange for the production of the videotape. Phase II activities will involve production of the videotape and a test of the videotape's effect on select patient behaviors.

        "abstract": "To determine the relative efficiencies of different interconnection technologies, we will compare optical interconnects using integrated optical waveguides and free-space with electronic interconnects, noting that the fabrication technology for waveguides and diffractive optical elements (used in free-space optical interconnects) are compatible with electronic manufacturing technology. Integrated optical waveguides are attractive because of higher bandwidth than electronic interconnects. Free-space interconnects appear to be even more attractive because the achievable connectivity is higher than waveguide interconnects. Free-space interconnects are especially suitable for global interconnection, since long distance connections are carried out optically in three dimensions, requiring less area. Using wavelength or orthogonal phase code multiplexing techniques, it will also be easier to reconfigure free-space interconnects for better fault tolerance. We propose to compare quantitatively optical interconnects using waveguides and free-space with electronic interconnects. We will determine the better interconnect technology between free-space and integrated optics. As an option to Phase I, we will produce a few key elements of the better technology. For Phase II, we will produce an optimized interconnect design and a scalable demonstration based on the proposed technology determined in Phase I. The demonstration will be a packaged, optically interconnected multichip module.",

        "abstract": "This proposal deals with the development of an advanced life support testbed at the United Stated Antarctic Program's (USAP) Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. This test facility is currently being developed through the CELSS Antarctic Analog Program (CMP). The purpose of the CMP is to provide NASA with an operational facility through which the design of future space systems may evolve. The focus of this proposal is directed specifically towards the development of a regenerative power system capable of supporting the functions of the CAAP testbed. Experience derived from the design of the CMP facility has demonstrated that advanced life support system must be designed to leverage off of available power sources and thus are intimately coupled with power generation facilities and energy reuse techniques. In the Antarctic, just as would be the case in a Martian habitat, the long and costly logistics train imposes a prohibitive burden upon the operation of any recycling technologies. The use of in situ resources to supplement power generation requirements will greatly reduce the operational costs associated with this facility. In this proposal a 100 KW wind turbine will be designed for use at the South Pole. The development program will be focused on the identification and resolution of technical problems, specifically related to the polar environment. NPS will provide performance analysis, detailed engineering and conceptual designs which address the identified polar concerns. The outcome of the three phase SBIR program will be the development of a new line of 100 KW direct drive 208 VAC 3 Phase wind turbines designed specifically for cold region applications. These new turbines will fill a void in the current marketplace, and will make significant reductions in the cost of electrical energy in polar regions. In addition it is expected that this project will demonstrate the applicability of wind power for future NASA sponsored Mars missions",

        "abstract": "Image analysis and graphics synthesis can be achieved with learning techniques using direct image examples without physically-based 3D models. We have developed novel techniques based on computer vision and on neural network algoritms: The mapping from novel images to a vector of \"pose\" and \"expression\" parameters can be learned from a small set of example images using a function approximation technique called an analysis network. The inverse mapping from input \"pose\" and \"expression\" parameters to output color images can be synthesized from a small set of exmaple images and used to produce new images under real-time control using a similar learning network, called in this case a synthesis network. The two networks rely on a) using a computer vision optical flow algorithm that matches corresponding pixels among pairs of grey-level images and effectively \"vectorizes\" them and b) exploiting a class of learning techniques that approximate the nonlinear mapping between the vector input and the vector output. We will design a real-time architecture implementing the two networks using software on a standard digital platform, enhanced by ASIC VLSI chips for the real-time computation of the optical flow and of the neural network mapping. Anticipated Benefits: The analysis and synthesis networks described here have several applications in computer graphics, special effects, interactive multimedia and object recognition systems. The analysis network can be regarded as a passice and trainable universal interface, that is a control device which may be used as a generalized computer mouse, instead of \"gloves\", \"body suits\" and joy sticks. THe synthesis network is an unconventional and novel approach to computer graphics. The two techniques together can be used for human-computer interfaces and interactive simulations that are model-based in a very unconventional way.",

Physical and chemical nitrate removal methods only concentrate the pollutant, and bioremediation methods introduce other contaminants into the water.  In the Phase I stage of this project, The Nitrate Elimination Company, Inc. (NECi) proved the feasibility of utilizing electrically-driven immobilized enzymes, EzNET(TM), for point-of-use denitrification of potable water.  This process is fast and selective, and reduces nitrate to environmentally benign nitrogen gas thereby eliminating the pollutant from the environment, without introducing contaminants into the water.  In Phase II, NECi proposes to improve reactor design and optimize formulation of immobilized enzymes catalysts, and determine how to produce required quantities of the enzymes in a cost-effective manner.  A variety of electrode materials will be tested in the EzNET(TM) reactor, and large scale enzyme production methods will be developed.  Optimized prototypes will be tested for performance and stability.  Finally, design of an EzNET(TM) reactor suitable for commercial manufacture will be developed.  At the end of Phase II, project cost of the EzNET(TM) system relative to alternative nitrate removal methods will be known.",

The proposed Adaptive Multi-Rate Vocoder (AMRAV) architecture allows dynamic selection of the best communication strategy from a list of predefined techniques; in certain scenarios in which the grade or rate of service can be controlled, the source coding strategy can be chosen automatically. The objective of the Phase I program is to refine the baseline set of candidate algorithms (presented in this proposal) and demonstrate the feasibility of the architecture by implementing a subset of the final AMRAV system to be constructed under the Phase II effort. A system breadboard will be constructed and tested during the Phase I effort to demonstrate the feasibility of the system. This will ideally position Nova for Phase II of this program which will culminate with the delivery of several AMRAVE engineering units.",

Microchannel plates (MCPs), very lightweight and relatively inexpensive lead glass wafers containing millions of well-aligned and regular microscopic channels having widths of about 10 microns, have recently demonstrated an impressive ability to collimate and focus soft X-rays. The innovation we propose will result in a highly accurate and reproducible process to change MCP channel alignment such that all channels remain normal to a spherical radius, with little or no channel distortion. This channel geometry will allow radiation from a point source to be collimated to a quasi-parallel beam with -5 mrad divergence or less, with enhanced field irradiance.

It phosphorylates phosphatidylinositols specifically at the D-3-hydroxyl to produce the 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides, 3-PPI, comprising phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, PI(3)P, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, PI(3,4)P2, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, PI(3,4,5)P3. Mutational studies of growth factor receptors and oncogenes have shown that the associated PI 3-kinase and its products PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 regulate cell growth and transformation. The 3-PPI are not physiological substrates for the PI-specific phospholipases C, and so the intact lipids have been suggested as novel critical second messengers of growth signals. Biochemical studies to determine the cellular targets of PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, the metabolic fate of these lipids, and their roles in the cell cycle have been handicapped because well characterized 3-PPI samples are not readily available; there is no commercial source. These materials are needed as research probes for defining their biochemical and physiological roles. The materials may also be useful for developing new anticancer agents and applications in medical biotechnology. Practical synthetic methods for 3-PPI are not available. The overall objectives are to develop synthetic methods and analogues for the 3-PPI and to prepare and characterize these by physicochemical and spectro- metric techniques. A strategy based on total synthesis and partial synthesis as complementary approaches is suggested. During Phase I, the feasibility of these complementary approaches will be tested for the synthesis of PI(3,4,5)P3, and the product will be fully characterized by analytical, physicochemical and spectrometric measurements. In Phase II, these approaches will be adapted and extended for the syntheses of PI(3)P, PI3,4)P2, isomers and analogues.",

Many other complex-oxide E-0 crystals show promise for providing substantial improvements in E-0 device performance. orders of magnitude reductions in drive voltage, power consumption, electroacoustic wave generation, and device size are expected by replacing LiNbO3 with materials having very large E-0 coefficients, such as SrxBal-xNb2O3- However, the difficulties associated with the bulk crystal growth of these high E-0 figures of merit complex- oxides have hampered their use in practical applications. Epitaxial vapor phase growth is an alternative approach to obtaining large area, high purity single-crystalline films. The recent advances in thin film deposition processes have opened an unprecedented opportunity to fully realize the potential of advanced complex-oxides. In this Phase I program, NZ Applied Technologies, in collaboration with Prof. E.L.

The thin film device structures having rigid substrates further restrain the electroacoustic wave generation. In Phase II, the fabrication process will be optimized, and the prototype devices will be produced.

This vibration is due to aggressive firing and high speed retargeting and maneuvering of the turret.

In this SBIR effort, a two degrees-of-freedom adaptive (learning) control systemis proposed for vibration suppression and pointing purposes under aggressive firing and maneuvering. The approach is based on the Simultaneous Control and Motion Pattern Specific Optimal System Design (SCMPSOSD). Furthermore, a new piezoelectric ceramic actuator is proposed for added control and actuation. A prototype of the actuator will be developed and tested with the advocated control design. The Trajectory Pattern Method(TPM) based technique allows for optimal simultaneous control and structure design with optimal locations for the sensors and actuators. Through the two degrees-of-freedom architecture of the proposed control algorithm, high performance with an acceptable robustness property will be attained. Furthermore, the special architecture of the proposed control design is suitable as a low cost optimal performance digital control technology especially designed for precision fire-on-the-move applications.",

The disease results from a glutamic acid to valine change at position 6 of the adult beta-globin gene (Hb to HbS) resulting in an irreversible deformation of red blood cells, hemolytic anemia, splenic atrophy and blood vessel occlusion. P-thalassemia is a common lethal disease in the Mediterranean basin and in Southeast Asia which results from abrogation of beta-globin gene expression. Genetic evidence suggests a 30-40% induction in gamma-globin gene expression should effectively treat sickle cell patients and obviate the need for transfusion of beta-thalassemia patients. We will engineer erythroid cell lines containing stably integrated DNA constructs which measure changes in gamma-globin gene expression in response to drug treatment.

The intercavity Raman cell uses two focusing mirrors to contain the first Stokes and partially contain the second Stokes beam. This approach benefits from the high intensities inside the laser cavity and by effectively increasing the Raman interaction lenth by the Q of the shifting cavity.

In this way, 10 or more channels can occupy a bandwidth of less than one nanometer, and the lasers can be tuned by small adjustments in bias current. Wavelength shifts of 1-2 nm in adjacent arrays can be fabricated by step-etching prior to top mirror deposition, as described in this report. In this way, large VCSEL arrays could ultimately provide densely-spaced channels covering the Erbium amplifier band.

OptiComp Corporation proposes to develop a high speed photonic switching architecture by exploiting its enabling \"Smart\" GaAs optoelectronic interconnect technology. This implementation will allow data transmission with addressing (or routing) to be performed in a single stage. A prototype architecture will provide a high speed inter-module interconnect without the power requirements and cross-talk limitations of electronic circuitry. Specifically three objectives will be accomplished during Phase I. Initially, an 8 x 8 element, optoelectronic fast packet, switching array suitable for ATM controller test bed development will be designed. Subsequently, an optical multiplex (MUX) architecture based on global (multidimensional) \"Smart\" GaAs optoelectronic interconnect technology will be developed as a predecessor to crossbar technology. A system layout of a 3:8 data router operating at 1O MHz will then be demonstrated in the laboratory. Multi-element arrays of DANE \"Smart\" pixels will provide the required packet switching and controlling functions within the ATM protocol. \"DANE\" refers to the GaAs \"Smart\" pixel which (1) detects light, (2) amplifies the result, (3) negates the result (inversion) and (4) emits the resultant Boolean value through the output laser. Diffractive optical interconnect elements (DOIEs) provide the signal routing for the decoder by selectively imaging, in free space, each element on the DANE's laser diode array to predetermined positions on the next DANE detector plane.",

The key concepts involved are: premixing the propellants prior to injection, and a thermally choked chamber which allows using a chamberless throat and skirt for the combustion/expansion process. The problem areas on small thrusters are: (1) inefficient long-term storage of propellants which has led to common use of storable propellants in spite of their lower performance and the contamination produced by the exhaust plume; (2) chamber cooling because of the high surface to volume ratio of the chamber, which has resulted in resorting to very high rates of film cooling which reduces performance further and increases plume contamination; (3) difficulty with injection and mixing because of the small orifice sizes, and effects of the nearby wall, which has led to problems of chamber wall streaking and pitting, reduced performance and shortened chamber life; and (4) precision of start and stop thrust curves and precision of impulse for short pulses, which makes the controllability of space vehicles more complex, and is particularly severe when doking maneuvers are involved.

        "abstract": "In analysis of basebanded Doppler radar signals, it has been noted that trained operators can classify target types by aural analysis of the baseband signals. This implies that there is sufficient structure in the signal so that automated analysis using speech processing techniques can perform classification. Standard analysis techniques assume that the data is stationary and well modeled using Fourier transformations of the data. The resulting spectrum is used to determine signal components that are then used for classification. Unfortunately, the audio signals of interest are highly nonstationary and can even contain sequences of pulses. The standard Fourier spectral analysis techniques cannot determine the time-varying structure wihtin the data and thus do not provide sufficient features for classification. It is this time-varying strucyure that gives the operator the clues he needs for classification. ORINCON proposes to develop and demonstrate an automated system that uses high-resolution time/frequency representations to characterize the data. The feature extractor is coupled with a neural network to solve the classification problems. Neural networks have been used extensivvely and successfully at ORICON to solve detection/classification problems in underwater acoustics, as well as for fault detection/classification problems in rotating machinery.

In the past many attempts have been made to develop and automated classification system.

Additionally, front-end processors were inappropriately designed and did not provide information required by the classifier to produce high-confidence results.

The recent advent of broadband communication services has dramatically increased this demand. The opportunity exists to merge two of the most promising advances in cornmunications: acoustic charge transport (ACT) devices and neural networks. ACT devices are available that implement a 128 tap programmable transversal filter operating at 360 MHz on a chip measuring less than 25 square millimiters. Although these devices provide wideband communications signal processing, they are limited to linear operation. It is possible to use these devices to configure neural networks that perform nonlinear filtering operations. Neural network filtering operations for adaptive equalization and signal detection have consistently shown at least a 3dB performance improvement over their linear counterparts. This project will design, implement, test, and analyze an ACT-based implementation of a neural network for communications applications. The resulting ACT-based neural network implementation provides almost an order of magnitude improvement over the faster commercially available neural network devices available today.",

        "abstract": "A compact device is needed to generate planar acoustic waves over a symmetrically dimensioned volume of approximately one cubic meter in the frequency range 60 Hz to 5 kHz. This normally requires an anechoic chamber or other environment that results in acceptably low acoustic reflection or scattering back into the volume of interest. ORINCON proposes an approach that confines sections of planar acoustic waves within a section of a waveguide enclosing the test volume. The plane waves will be created by a specially developed plane wave source at one end. The plane wave source will be carefully designed to minimize evanescent waves and excitation of modes other than the plane wave mode in the wave guide above its cutoff frequency. The far end of the enclosure will be terminated by an acoustically active sound control transducer or array to suppress reflection or diffraction of sound back into the enclosure and to suppress evanescent waves created by the acoustic impedance mismatch between the wave guide and the room at low frequencies. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - This device will be useful for calibration and measurement of directional response patterns of microphones over a broad frequency range. It may also be applicable to testing techniques for active cancellation of acoustic scattering from small objects, or from small-scale models of larger objects.",

The specific aims of our proposed Phase I research are: (1) implementation of a number of biologically motivated algorithms, (2) preparation of a number of data sets for use in algorithm comparisons, (3) evaluation of the performance of the various algorithms, (4) selection of the best algorithm, and (5) performance of a feasibility analysis for a VLSI implementation.

        "abstract": "The treatment of the waste by-products of electronics manufacturing is raising increasingly important issues. Of particular concern is contaminated waste water resulting from the stripping, etching, plating, and washing operations in printed circuit board fabrication. Waste treatment has proven to be an expensive and cumbersome solution which has not completely solved the problem. In order to achieve significant reductions in harmful waste geneation and emissions, electronics manufacturers should employ materials and process which are intrinsically waste-free so that there is no waste that has to be treated or disposed. Ideally, a new process for the production and assembly of printed circuits would completely eliminate waste-water from the manufacturing process. This proposal entails the adoption of additive printed circuitry by means of dry printing of solderable electrically conductive inks. To do so, new processes and equipment which do not exist today will have to be developed and demonstrated. The objectives of Phase I will be to prove the principle of waste-water free fabrication of state of the art multilayer printed circuit structures with conductive inks by employing a printed through hole, a sequential printing process for multilayer with adequate planarization, and produce fine lines using photoimagable dielectrics. Anticipated Benefits: Anticipate that this work will successfully lead to the development of environmentally safe processes for the fabrication of multilayer printed circuits and multi-chip modules. These materials will enable the fabrication of printed circuits with no generation of waste-water streams of any kind. The materials can replace current, environmentally harmful printed circuit fabrication materials and processes in every area.",

This work is worthy of support under the stated criteria for developing new and innovative ideas for improvement of today's technology in the areas of infrared seekers and sensor fusion because it is truly innovative. Biological sensors provide technically rich example for us to use in the development of devices which are more efficient with respect to sensitivity, data throughput and post-detection processing of recovered image data. This project proposes an effort which will accomplish a preliminary design for a sensor which extends the previous work that we hve done in the development of the neuromorphic focal plan device. The resulting body of work will provide a solid technical basis for the development of an actual device in a Phase I and Phase II that will help further refine design issues in preparation for the hardware development. Devices which mimic biological counterparts are more efficient than conventional sensors in many ways. To a large degree, they process information directly on-plane, reducing the computational load of off-plane processing resources. The ever-increasing pixel count of currently-available devices generates a tremendous quantity of data which must b handled by off-plane processors. Biological systems do pre-processing of the data to reduce the amount of transmitted data to a level which may be handled by reasonably-sized processors. The data that they deliver has been pre-filtered with respect to spatial and temporal requirements of follow-on devices. they operate to a large extent in the real-time analog domain, so their power dissipation is orers of magnitudes lower than conventional systems would require to perform the same computational tasks. commercial devices developed based upon these new devices will be smaller, lighter run faster, and will be cheaper to manufacture than currently-available infrared instrumentation.",

In Phase II, we will design, build and operate a custom TGS growth system that will encompass the technology developments and improvements highlighted in the Phase I plan. We will demonstrate and optimize the TGS growth and characterization of GaN crystals. Several GaN wafers will be tested for high temperature device performance.

Realizing this improved performance in a low storage volume, cost effective system is dependent on an Integrated Hydrodynamic Deployment System which ensures optimal acoustic performance of the Navy's VLA. Creare proposes to develop such a system which will provide for constant and optimal VLA configuration over the range of operational conditions. Specifically, Creare's system will utilize a Buoyant Lifting Body (BLB) with a faired VLA. The BLB will provide a vertical tension force on the VLA which increases with current speed resulting in a constant lift-to-drag-ratio and a constant array configuration, for the range of currents. For optimal survivability, the BLB will be inflated with ployurethane foam. Creare's integrated approach to VLA deployment sytem hydrodynamics in synergy with the Navy's acoustic sensor package will allow the superior performance of VLA acoustic sensors to be realized in shallow water scenarios.",

Endothermic fuels are attractive for hypersonic propulsion systems because they increase the fuel heat sink capacity. We propose to develop a compact and lightweight heat exchanger/reactor in which cooling is provided by the catalyzed decomposition of the endothermic fuel. The innovation is a heat exchanger configuration which enables efficient decomposition of the fuel within a very small volume, resulting in an order of magnitude reduction in the size and a factor of three reduction in weight of the reactor. There are three key advantages to the proposed heat exchanger: small size and weight, increased reliability due to a simplified internal configuration, and low pressure drops for air cooling applications. Preheating of the fuel occurs within the same compact unit. The objectives of Phase I are to prove the feasibility by demonstrating fabrication and sealing techniques and to assess the benefits to hypersonic propulsion systems. In Phase II we will build and demonstrate a prototypical reactor/heat exchanger and perform tests to provide data for design and optimization of hypersonic propulsion systems.",

In the gas turbine, heat is transferred from the burning of R.D.F., to the inlet of the primary combustor through an innovative kind of heat exchanger, a modular regenerator.

In addition, because it is the performance of an entire aircrew that results in flight safety and effective mission performance, we will explore the usefulness of collecting critical incidents of team or aircrew performance. Once we have collected these CRM-related critical incidents, an important step will be the \"retranslation\" of these incidents in order to obtain information about their effectiveness and the dimensions that underlie performance in the CRM parts of aircrew jobs. Finally, in order to more clearly demonstrate the usefulness of these critical incidents for developing CRM training tools, we will develop a behavior-based rating scale targeted at one of the CRM performance dimensions identified as part of the critical incident analysis. A set of such rating scales could be used to measure performance before, during, and after training, and thus would be useful both for training needs assessment and for training evaluation.",

The coarse-search optical processor can compare the input pattern with the key features of an entire template data bank in one pass of light transmission and provide most likely addresses to the data bank for accessing possible matching patterns. These possible matching patterns will then be fed into the fine-search optical processor for a thorough comparison. The advantage of this two-step processing is its intellegence--the system does not have to exhaustively search the entire data bank. POC further proposes a unique technological development in each step of the SAR N6 interconnectability, represents a technology beyond the state of the art in coarse-search processing.

In order to provide even more accurate diagnoses, we will develop an autostereo fiberscope (ASF) for real-time 3-D monitoring of cancerous tumors, in vivo, without the need for open surgery. The ASF device is based on POC's autostereoscopic 3-D display technology, combined with medically accepted silica based imagefiber for disposable ultra thin fiberscopes (such an angioscopes, urethral scopes, etc.). The novelty of POC's ASF device is in its combination of ultra thin fiberscopes with the company's proprietary passive autostereoscopic 3-D displays. As a result, POC's display, combined with a pair of image fibers that have already been partially medically verified, provides a relatively low-cost disposable device with fully developed unmatchable 3-D perception. The core component of this system is POC's holographic 3-D display screen that looks like a regular movie projection diffusion screen and has no bothersome elements that could distract from human 3-D perception. POC's 3-D visualization is very persuasive, and it has already been successfully presented in an experimental demonstration.",

A further benefit of moth-eye surface relief structures is their enormous surface area while maintaining excellent optical properties. Moth-eye films are low bulk and may be incinerated.

In theproposed approach, chemically sensitive indicators would be immobilized by photopolymerization at thetip of finely tapered optical fibers similar to those used in Near-field Scanning Optical Microscopy(NSOM).

This design is based on three of POC's existing technologies: coherently-coupled (phase synchronized) HFPFs, tunable liquid-crystal cell preparation, and fabrication of high-efficiency controlled-bandwidth holographic mirrors in the UV to the IR regions of the spectrum, using a high-order harmonic recording technique and a proprietary photopolymer processing technique. The ENCHART filter will exhibit extremely high (0.1 angstrom) resolution with fine tuning over a range of at least 3 angstroms in a selected range of the spectrum ( from UV to IR), high out-of-band rejection (OD > 2) with adequate suppression across an operating range 1000 times broader than that passband, and superior performance under harsh operating conditions.

We will combine these existing technologies with our Phase I results to build an innovative automated inspection system that will be usable in depot-level ENSIP inspecitons and that can replace many of the present EC and FPI inspections and signficantly reduce reliance on the use of hazardous chemicals.",

(PSI) proposes to demonstrate a low-cost, compact, rugged instrument for simultaneous measurements of static temperature, velocity, and H20 density in the exhaust nozzle of a supersonic propulsion engine. The measurements will be based on room temperature, tunable diode laser absorption measurements using recently available InGaAsP lasers. Aunique, low-cost, and simple noise canceling detector (NCD) will be used to provide near shot-noise-limited performance for highly accurate measurements without the complexity and cost associated with frequency modulation (FM) absorption techniques. The NCD also permits use of low-cost, commercially available InGaAsP lasers rather than custom-fabricated, long-wavelength devices. The resulting system is pressure-independent, simpler to use, and lower cost than comparable FM-based systems. The Phase I portion of the program will demonstrate quantitative, simultaneous H20 density and temperature measurements over the range of temperatures expected in a combined-cycle Mach 6 exhaust nozzle. In Phase II, a prototype instrument for simultaneous H20 density, temperature, and velocity will be delivered and integrated with the Air Force High Mach Advanced Research Test Facility.",

We plan to investigate two versions of this maser, both to be built in the Phase II: the first is a full size version, and the second will be a compact version. The full size version will be comparable in size and power requirements to a common rubidium standard, but the stability will exceed that of a full size hydrogen maser. A compact version of this maser would be significantly smaller than any atomic standard currently available. The innovations that enable the development of these compact standards are: first, a gas cell design where a optical pumping and microwave interrogation occur in separate bulb volumes; and second, a rubidium gas cell that operates without a buffer gas and has been shown to produce a 10 Hz linewidth of the rubidium hyperfine transition. In the proposed Phase I program, we will investigate several technical issues to be addressed prior to the construction of the rubidium maser. After the comletion of the Phase I program, we will propose a Phase II program that will include the construction of the maser with both a full size and a compact cavity. Such a maser could have wide scale application in navigation systems, EW, bi-static and multi-static radar, as well as commercial areas.",

        "abstract": "The application of electromotive propulsion to rotorcraft provides several opportunities for the improvement of the helicopter's operational efficiency. The propulsion of rotors via tip thrusters has long been envisioned, since they provide the opportunity for higher G.W. helicopters, higher payload/G.W. ratios, and reduction in power and fuel requirements. Utilizing the electromotive drive to provide rotor blade propulsive thrust, as well as chordwise and blade coning balance, allows an overall reduction in weight empty, thus increasing the payload/lift capacity. This technology can be applied to rotorcraft gross weights from 10,000 to 350,000 lbs. The weight and complication of a mechanical drive are reduced with tip propulsion. Tip propulsion also eliminates the anti-torque side force required in a shaft-driven helicopter. Another advantage is the saving of the rotor blade balance weight (required for chordwise balance) by using the weight of the blade thruster and the drive system weight as the balance weight. This is particularly valuable in large diameter slow-turning rotors that require additional balance weight to keep the rotor coning angle within a practical angular limit. Improved lift performance, reduced maintenance, increased safety and reduced operational cost are potential attributes of the electromotive rotor tip propulsion system.",

However, the use of electrically resistive polymer composite materials as (quasi-) bipolar electrode substrates has suppressed the optimalhigh power possibility of the lead/acid system and presented difficulty for bipolar sealing and packaging. Pinnacle Research Institute, Inc. (PRI) proposes to remedy these problems by substituting the polymer composite with a ceramic oxide coated metal substrate. This ceramic oxide/metal substrate, which has been developed by PRI, is electrically conductive, mechanically sturdy and thin. Moreover, it is chemically and electro-chemically compatible with H2SO4 and thus the conventional requirement for SnO2 plating of the anode can be avoided. Utilizing the ceramic oxide/metal substrate will enble PRI to incorporate its in-house developed bipolar sealing technique developed for Ultracapacitor technology. PRI will demonstrate unit cells and the feasibility of a multiple cell SBLA which is predicted to have an energy density exceeding 50 WH/kg and power density greater than l kW/kg without degradation to cycle life. The proposed advanced SBLA will be extremely rugged, maintenance-free, long cycle and shelf lives and be well-suited to a low temperature operation (-55 degrees c) for weapons application.",

        "abstract": "The proposed innovation is to apply unique optical fiber sensing elements and optical transduction principles to the early detection of microbial fouling. Critical to monitoring and maintaining the quality of recycled waters and assessing the effectiveness of new methods is the development of sensor instrumentation suitable for in situ detection of microbial species. Such sensors, integrated with a control and feedback loop, will allow appropriate action to be taken before crew health, plant, or food quality can be compromised. Polestar Technologies, and its subcontractor GEO- CENTERS, INC., proposes a Phase I program to demonstrate the feasibility of using proprietary sensing material, and fiber optic sensor technology, for the early detection of biofilm formation. This approach should provide not only the great sensitivity associated with optical transduction, but also the capability to monitor in situ, and in real time. This innovation, once developed, should also be readily extended to identification of specific microbial populations, biocompatibility studies of new materials, and monitoring of air filtration systems as may be required throughout NASA. In a subsequent Phase II program a prototype Fiber Optic Biofilm Monitor will be fabricated, tested, and delivered to Johnson Space Center for evaluation in a water reclamation test bed.",

Various macrocycle compounds have been shown to uniquely complex metal ions. The innovation is to use chromogenic macrocycle compounds, which are currently under development, and optical transduction principles, to fabricate and test metal ion sensors. The Phase I work includes fabrication of these recognition elements; attachment to optical substrates; and spectrophotometric characterization in the presence of select metal ions to determine sensitivity, response time, reversibility, linearity and stability. Preliminary evaluation in multicomponent and mixed metal solutions will be performed in Phase I. Simple, reliable, in situ sensors to monitor dissolved metal ions do not exist at present. In a Phase II effort, a prototype Metal Ion Sensor Array will be fabricated, tested, and delivered to NASA for evaluation in a Nutrient Delivery System. This sensor system could also be used to assure the quality in water reclamation systems currently under development by NASA for use in long- duration space flight, and could be used as part of a mobile robotics laboratory for exobiology experimentation and sampling.",

        "abstract": "Most modern military casualties entail shock, including hemorrhage, burns, heat stroke, and sepsis. Identifying shock accurately and promptly, after injury and during resuscitation efforts, will sharply reduce morbidity and mortality. The body's principal homeostatic response to shock is the diversion of blood flow away from the splanchnic viscera towards critical organs, such as the brain. The resultant mesenteric hypoperfusion produces intestinal mucosal ischemia, reflected by a decrease in mucosal and intraluminal p02 and a reciprocal increase in pC02. In this proposal, we offer to design (and in Phase II, implement) a sensor to measure the intraluminal gas tension of C02 and 02: a quantitative and direct early warning system for shock states. ANTICIAPTED BENEFITS: The technique is markedly superior to current modes of shock monitoring and has obvious dual-use potential for saving lives in both military & civilian surgical, emergency and intensive care settings. The nearly 20 million civilian cases require monitoring for shock in the U.S. annually would benefit from using our porposed sensor in hospitals or first aid situations.",

The new test machines should be capable of measuring mechanical and physical behavior under cyclic stresses at high frequencies of up to several kilohertz (2,000-5,000 Hz) at high temperatures. The damage tolerance factors to be tested include failure modes, crack and void growth, oxidation, etc. Existing materials test machines cannot test beyond 1,000 Hz; hence we propose to develop a new test machine with 5,000 Hz capability. Its central feature is examining the feasibility of the resonance principle to amplify the cyclic stress applied to the specimen. Another key feature is the use of a two-level vibration isolation system that permits the specimen to resonate, but prevents resonances in the machine frame. A third key feature is the employment of a closed-loop controller which will maintain constant cyclic stresses throughout the tests. In the Phase I, we proposed to address critical issues relating to incorporation of these key features and develop a layout of a conceptual configuration of the test machine.

The use of flat panel displays in the E2C cockpit will make it possible for pilot and copilot to observe tactical information in a form similar to that presented to the Naval Flight Officer operators in the CIC compartment. The addition of reconfigurable displays will lead to a reduction of scan time during certain flight situations. There are a number of problems like high illumination level, severe space constraints, difficulty of accessing the controls etc. During the phase I study we will study the civilian and military controls technology to find the best controls technology to solve the problems of the E2C cockpit. Three alternative approaches will be presented to solve the problems of the cockpit controls and of image and data visualization. The present controls and the display technologies as well as future technologies that will be available in the next decade will be thoroughly studied for the purpose of the recommendations.",

        "abstract": "Nuclear, chemical and biological warfare weapons are the weapons of mass destruction (WMD). It will be desirable to develop a single detection system for monitoring proliferation of WMD based on monitoring of the particulates and trace chemicals in the air by air sampling. All the WMD and their production facilities give out particulates or chemicals in the air which can be monitored by a air sampler and detection systems. The proposed detection systems are spectroscopic innature and have a number of common elements which can be used to design a compact monitoring system for nuclear, chemical and biological WMD. For nuclear detection, we will use a sensitive gamma detection system based on CdZnTe crystal detectors and MCA. For chemical detection we will use a diode laser based spectroscopic technique and for biological warfare agent detection we will use UV flourescence technique. In Phase I a review of all the existing detection technologies will be made and design of a compact system for monitoring of the WMD based on air sampling technique will be completed. The system will be built in Phase II. In addition, we will design and build a chemical detection system in Phase I which can be used for detection of chemical weapons as well as environmental pollution. The system for monitoring of the WMD can be used for environmental pollution measurement. Anticipated Benefits: The system, once developed, can be used to monitor the proliferation of WMD in certain countries in different parts of the world who have active programs in such weapons. The system can be used for air pollution and environmental monitoring and monitoring of chemical processes. There would be a large commercial market for such a system.",

PES proposes a 3-phase program. Phase 1, a 6-month effort, will demonstrate the capability of the software for mass spectrometric applications. The software was developed over 30 years and with an investment of 50 million dollars, to provide highly accurate and comprehensive analyses of performance of electron and ion lenses. Phase 2 effort will validate the accuracy of the proprietary software by modeling the detailed geometry and performance of a particular spectrometer lens design and experimentally measuring the performance. Phase 2 will also lay the groundwork enabling NASA and its contractors to submit requests for simulations and designs to be performed in the future. In Phase 3, the software will be used in the design, prototype fabrication, and manufacture of highly-portable and compact, i.e. hand held mass spectrometers, which as commercial- off-the-shelf products would be capable of revolutionizing and expanding the current $500 million dollar commercial marketplace and application areas for mass spectrometers.

Detection sensitivity in the parts-per-billion level can be achieved. The technique offers 5 decades of linear dynamic range with a response time less than 1 second. Continuous time weight average monitoring is also possible. This technique has the advantage of high chemical selectivity, high sensitivity and non-intrusive nature of detection. Absorbance as low as a few parts in 10-8 can be detected. The use of diode laser and its pure electronic modulation-demodulation scheme permits a compact and portable instrument design.

The system will be intended for detection of clandestine movement of nuclear materials from nuclear facilities or storage areas and other places. The system will be easy to use and will display the radio nuclides whose radiation is detected by the system. To build such a system we will use semiconductor detectors like H912 or CdTe with the associated electronics for multi channel analysis. The electronics will be reduced in size by use of Multi Chip Module(MCM) or flex circuits and by using application specific ICs wherever suitable. A software will be developed to automatically identify the nuclides and display them on a small display. In the first phase of the program, the evaluafion of the detectors and the means for size reduction of the electronics will be done. After that the software requirement will be defined in detail and the design of the full system will be made during phase 1. Such a system will be used in many DOD programs as well by IAEA inspectors monitoring safeguards and for environmental applicafions. The prototype system will be built in phase H which will be tumed into a commercially available product and produced during Phase III. Anticipated Benefits: The prototype developed during Phase II of the program will be a product which will find many different applications. The most important high volume application will be for environmental applications, for monitoring radioactive contamination. The other applications will be for DOD, DOE and IAEA monitoring of nuclear safeguards. The product will have a high volume commerical market.

Attempts to utilize conventional cable handling methods are not suitable for array handling, and appropriate methods have not yet been defined. Outboard system volume, weight, system complexity, installation complexity, and cost far exceed acceptable standards for a handling system. Today\\'s systems should be operating at double their present retrieval speed while at double ship\\'s present deployment speed. To achieve both functional and operational advantage will require a new handling system concept rather than a larger machine. The proposed X-DRUM(TM) Capstan has the advantage of potentially meeting existing and next generation needs. Because of its bi-helical camming principle, bend radius is elliptically multiplied and size reduced proportionally as the square. It could provide an S-bend offset without guide tubes, which is a useful feature for submarine system installations. Its fixed drum simplicity and length to diameter aspect ratio also make this design best suited for outboard submarine installations. The intent of this feasibility study is to investigate high strength array messenger design and the possibility of dual stacked messenger operation. The advantage of dual messengers would be total encapsulation of the array, initial self threading of an array, and the capability to push the array for deployment. Our Phase I concept study will determine the probability of multiple stacked messengers and their maximum configural strength. These exploratory development concerns are primary because of submarine equipment location and reliability.",

Recent procedures using luminescence have often surpassed conventional isotopic methods; among these the luminescence of firefly luciferase is the most efficient. Relevant biomedical applications include reporter gene technology, viral and cell tracer methods, non-isotopic immunoassays and other probe technologies, and clinical biomass/viability assays. Through fundamental research on the enzymatic mechanism of beetle luciferases, we have developed new chemistry which provides greater luminescence intensity with simpler reaction kinetics. To better understand the commercial potential of beetle luciferases and to develop specific enzymes suited for applications, we are currently examining the structure and function of several adult-form isozymes. This project is for extending our investigations to include a new class of isozymes derived from embryonic and juvenile developmental forms of elaterid beetles. These isozymes are spectrally unique, and taxonomic data reveals that they are evolutionarily divergent. Yet, due to inaccessibility, these enzymes have never been investigated biochemically. In Phase l, genes encoding these novel isozymes will be isolated to allow for enzymological and physical studies of the recombinant enzymes planned for Phase II.",

Based upon charge-coupled devices (CCD's), it provides high efficiency with less noise and at a low cost. Designed for battery or solar-cell systems, it has zero-volt input-to-output differential for highly efficient \"no-drop\" regulation. A 3 V NDR requires only two 1.5 V batteries, decreasing its size and weight. A linear regulator's inherent diode drop requires three batteries. A switch-mode regulator includes an isolation diode, reducing its efficiency and limiting the maximum input voltage to a diode drop above the desired output voltage. The NDR provides isolation without a diode, allowing operation with higher voltages. CCD's also produce lower noise and ripple than conventional switch-mode regulators. Voltage multiplication is possible with the NDR if desired. Thus, more efficient, lower-noise operation over a wider voltage range than competing regulators is possible. The NDR feasibility will be assessed during Phase I. Prototypes will be fabricated and tested during Phase II. Broad DARPA and commercial applications will drive Phase III production of this innovative regulator concept. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: High-efficiency regulation will extend the life of any battery-operated system.

The pathophysiological significance of oxygen free radicals and transition metal catalysis extends to any organ system and includes carcinogenesis including leukemia, coronary artery disease, inflammation, ageing, and neurodegenerative disease and stroke. An important aspect to these studies is the development of iron defined serum-free medium for in vitro iron metabolism studies. The goal of Phase I is to develop such serum-free medium free of iron contaminated components such as albumin or transferrin. The substitution of albumin with lipid microemulsions or lipid bound cyclodextrins will be evaluated. Substitutions of transferring with iron molecules as iron citrate will be explored. These studies will focus on two cell lines, Raji and IEC-6 cells, used in such iron studies and later as time permits primary rat duodenal cells.",

In Phase II, mutagenized cDNA clones will be combined with appropriate cloned parental wt dengue 1 sequences to produce full-length chimeric dengue 1 cDNAs.

This reagent will fill the critical void to provideinvestigators who are working in this exciting area. They have preliminary data indicating thatosteoclast/hematopoietic reagents in combination with purified osteoclast colony stimulating factorssupported osteoclast colony formation. However, the reagent formulation needs to be further developedsince it did not support colony formation equivalent to serum containing reagents. This proposal willdevelop osteoclasts/hematopoietic kits and reagent medium for osteoclast proliferation that does notrequire the presence of serum. These reagents will be valuable in assessing the growth parameters ofosteoclast in both normal and diseased states. It also will be of value in assessing the cytokinesinvolved in these processes.",

To do this, SWFTDA uses the software developer\u00c2\u00bfs expertise about the application system, combined with SWFTDA\u00c2\u00bfs built-in expertise about software fault tolerance.  SWFTDA also provides the building blocks for modeling and implementing software fault tolerance.  The purpose of the SWFTDA is to help users - determine whether to apply SWFT techniques in a particular application, - select candidate data diverse SWFT techniques for their applications,- evaluate those techniques using a modeling tool,- choose the recommended technique based on candidate selection criteria and simulation results, and - implement the recommended technique using reusable code.SWFTDA was qualification tested by examining a database controller for a commercial order processing and workflow system.  The most appropriate software fault tolerance techniques for the application were determined by SWFTDA.  The system was modeled using modeling templates of the candidate techniques.  Based on the simulation results and trade-off analysis, a final technique was selected for implementation.

Two approaches will be explored. The first approach characterizes various clutters by suitably selected wavelet packets such that the WT coefficients are contributed mostly by clutter information but almost not affected by the targets. Bu subtracting these WT coefficients from the original signal, the clutters are effectively suppressed and thus the target detection can be greatly enhanced. The second approach is the wavelet matched filter which is synthesized wth reference data and wavelet packets that represent the features of the target. The wavelet matched filter incorporates the efficient feature detection and noise suppression capability of the WT and high discrimination ability of the matched filter. The clutter reduction and target identification operations are performed in a single step. The performance of the developed alforithms and the hardware implementations will also be investigated.",

Recent advances in semiconductor technology led to development of light emitting diodes (LEDs) capable of high irradiance with electrical efficiencies at least equivalent to other lamps currently used as plant light sources. The LED has other characteristics, such as safety, reliability, long life, and low mass and volume, making it a very desirable irradiance source for space applications. Commercially available LEDs designed as indicator lamps are not entirely satisfactory for plant lighting. Proposed research would fabricate and evaluate alternate methods of mounting semiconductor chips to provide significant electrical efficiencies when operated at high current inputs with conventional discrete LEDs. Increased electrical efficiency would relate to improved heat dissipation from the chips and the geometric dispersion of photons emitted from semiconductor chips. In addition to space applications, highly efficient LED lighting units would find extensive terrestrial commercial applications for hydroponic plant growing operations, household ornamental plant growing, and plant photobiological research.",

High p-type base doping levels (on the order of 1O 20 power cm-3) have allowed for the improvement of the maximum oscillation frequency, f max, as well as current gain cutoff frequency. Commonly used p-type dopants, Be and Zn, suffer from diffusion during the epitaxial growth process as well as during high current level operation resulting in decreased emitter injection efficiency. Carbon as a p-type dopant is attractive because of its low diffusion coefficient. The use of carbon in the base of an npn HBT increases the wafer yield and device reliably by eliminating dopant diffusion into the emitter during epitaxial growth and reducing the current induced degradation of the dc gain observed during operation. Pennsylvania State University has installed a gas source carbon cell on their existing Varian Gen II MBE and is currently using CBr4 as their source for carbon, while QED has installed an electron beam evaporation solid source carbon cell to one of their existing Varian Gen II MBEs. Phase I of this program will investigate the two most promising carbon doping techniques in order to establish the most viable.",

        "abstract": "Quantum Well Infrared Photodetectors (QWIPs) based on the III-V material system make an excellent detector choice for certain infrared applications. Although the QWIP does not compare favorably with the ideal HgCdTe detector due to its intrinsically shorter carrier lifetimes (about 1-10 ps) leading to large thermal generation rates, it does benefit from the more mature III-V epitaxial growth technology which allows better control and uniformity. In particular, for applications such as NASA's Earth Observation Satellite (EOS), which contains the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), the QWIP provides an ideal choice for the 12-16 micron region. The high Hg content required for operation in this region results in reproducibility difficulties as well as excessive dark currents. The high noise requires the additional expense of a space qualified chopper and associated differential amplifiers for each of the array elements. Although much work has been reported on the GaAs/AlGaAs based QWIP, the InGaAs/GaAs version will yield improved performance. The higher carrier mobility and lower effective mass associated with the InGaAs well and GaAs barriers will yield significantly enhanced response.",

The proposed method involves measuring the impedance associaated with driving different radius indentors into the material, as a function of frequency. With multiple data points for the impedance as a function of endentor radius (at a given frequency), nonlinear simulataneous equations are solved to obtain all four constants of interest directly from the complete impedance relation for a radiating sphere in a viscoelastic medium. This approach will be demonstrated in Phase I. In addition, data acquisition time gating will be examined as a means of overcoming finite sample thickness issues. This will be supported by analytical theory development for radiation impedance in finite thickness materials. Because the proposed multi-indentor polymer characterization scheme uses the complete sphere radiation theory, it not only provides all of the complex moduli data, byt should improve accuracy over the present approach which relies on modeling the system with a single spring rate.

Sometimes modification of the profile of the beam to match the volumeof tissue involvement during procedure such as photodynamic and photothermal therapy is desired.Recently, interest has developed in fiberoptics for contact surgery and uniform irradiation of tissue duringphotodynamic therapy. More recently, side emitting tips have been developed for directional irradiationduring photothermal therapy. These tips are designed to reflect the laser beam at a 90 degree angle.If a large surface of tissue needs to be irradiated, one must position the tip with multiple laser exposure,aimed only at the untreated areas. Other diffusing tips have not been optimized for the delivery of tensof watts needed for coagulating large volumes. We seek to further develop a family of diffusing tips fordirectional and non-directional, isotropic distribution of laser light.

Large migratory bird populations drawn to a nearby landfill have threatened JFK airport, where safety of flight considerations nearly caused shutdown of the airport. Aircraft operators, including USAF, are now liable for civil damages should an aircraft strike and kill and endangered species of bird. Relatively recent evidence indicates that \"infrasound\" (below 20Hz) is an important sensory input into bird behavior, providing cues for navigation, and it is theorized, \"warnings\" that elicit avoidance responseds. The proposed research develops a scientific baseline for gull, raptor, and waterfowl reaction to infrasound. Further, the research would define mechanically replicable infrasound parameters that provide avoidance stimuli to two of the three species. The goal of the research is to test the feasibility of developing an infrasonic device, or family of devices, that could be used around airfields to reduce the occurrence of aircraft/bird collisions by 50% or more.

The carbon bed absorbs most hydrocarbons and CHCs, while the catalytic oxidizer removes the methane and CO which cannot be absorbed. Because carbon has little affinity for CHCs, and because no current catalysts oxidize CHCs at reasonable temperatures, the large carbon bed used to absorb the CHCs must be replaced every three months. Periodic replacement of the carbon bed is one of the top thirty maintenance items on Space Station Freedom. To reduce the frequency with which the bed must be replaced, TDA Research will develop and test novel metal oxide based catalysts to determine whether they can oxidize CHCs at reasonable temperatures, in the presence of water, and without the production of toxic by-products.

TDA Research (TDA) proposes to investigate compounds that, when added to hydrocarbon fuels, initiate endothermic fuel reactions.

Phase I of the development will investigate the following major areas of the preliminary design of panel structures which are subjected to severe thermomechanical loading during operation. We will develop algorithms and strategies for determining critical design condition loads from the output of finite element models of the structure. We will investigate at least three approaches: an automated search program which will evaluate output files from finite element models and define critical thermomechanical loading conditions and structural elements from time-consistent load histories: a statistical model which uses the finite element data from large samples and determines the most probable set of design conditions: and a deterministic mathematical model in which a functional is formed using the finite element data base with the design condition combinations being produced by a calculus of variations minimization solution. We will also develop a buckling analysis program which uses conventional analytical methods to define the buckling loads and margins of safety of critical equivalent stiffened panels. We will investigate, demonstrate and deliver adaptive meshing software to improve the resolution of internal loads and the capture of peak moments in stiffened panels and substructure for evaluation of local crippling of the hot structure. Prototype software will be available and delivered at the end of the Phase I effort. Phase II will extend the concepts and software to the operational mode, interfacing with most commercially-available finite element structural packages.

Radiographic means are perhaps the state-of-the-art today and, unfortunately, have been for the past several decades since their inception. Popular, \"high-tech\" means of noninvasive body imaging, such as magnetic resonance (MRI), ultrasound, or computed tomography (CT), all exhibit technical hurdles which have historically made it inconceivable to image the characteristic slow motions and small volumes of the microcirculation. Our recent innovation in medical ultrasound has made it possible to detect microcirculatory blood flow; the medical ultra sound injects a special contrast agent and analyzes a previously ignored component of the backscattered echo. In this project, it is intended to extend this Doppler and one-dimensional imaging technique to two-dimensional imaging. A short term feasibility study will modify and test a commercial duplex ultrasonic imaging system on in vivo animal model. The modifications will involve an external \"plug-in\" module to avoid damage to the imager and to expedite the animal experiments. This innovation will revolutionize many areas of medical diagnosis. These areas will range from retinal blood flow imaging to characterization of diabetic micropathy to tumor detection and assessment without the introduction of hazardous substances or radiations.",

Our intention is to develop a chaotically controlled suppression system utilizing electrorheological (ER) material based adaptive structures. ER material structures can suppress structural vibrations through three functional characteristics: variable structural damping, resonance circumvention, and modal shape control. Theological Systems will develop chaotic control methods to synergize the three functionalities into a single control system. Chaotic methods are chosen because of the inherent nonlinearities and complexities of controlling structural vibrations. The distinguishing features of chaos are unpredictable behavior where no relation between cause and effect seem to exist. Most structural vibration applications exhibit chaotic behavior. The concept of chaotic control is to bound a region embedded in the chaotic attractor through time dependent perturbations.",

In recent years the number of serious fungal infectionshas increased markedly as a result of the growing number of immunosuppressed and immunocompromis-ed individuals, such as AIDS patients, transplant recipients, and chemotherapy or radiotherapy patients.Efficacious and non-toxic antifungal therapeutics are difficult to identify, in part due to the fact that bothhumans and fungi are eukaryotes and share many potential molecular targets in common.

An urgent need exists for more antifungal agents, especially those acting against additionaltargets. Translation-targeted therapeutics are particularly desirable because of their proven value intreating bacterial infections.

The candidate engine model is small, lightweight and, depending on the model chosen, produces from one to two horsepower per cubic inch displacement and has the potential for even higher power density (the 70 series rotary demonstrated five horsepower per cubic inch displacement). The engine is a true multifuel engine with the capability of operating on heavy fuels and gasoline. The study will detemine the engine generator combination that provides the ac and dc power needs while optimizing other system requirements such as smoke emission, fuel economy, noise and infrared signature. Included in the study will be an investigation directed toward utilizing the AAV vehicles existing intake, exhaust and cooling system to support the APU.",

Advances in cockpit recording technology have all but eliminated instrumental artifacts. Here we propose to tackle the remaining obstacle by developing an advanced signal processing system for Real-time physiological Artifact Detection And Reduction (RADAR). We will leverage our previous development of effective algorithms for detecting movement, eye, muscle, and other artifacts, and for efficiently reducing the effects of eye and muscle contaminants, in EEG data collected in the laboratory.

Present methods to convert these paper drawing to digital form are slow, expensive, and error prone.

These new methods will reduce costs by a factor of ten and will improve the quality of the finished conversion. The research will combine recent advances in scanner technology, advances in algorithm technology, and government advances in modeling languages to make these improvements possible.

        "abstract": "In military and commercial aircraft, airframe health is central to operating safety, maintenance costs, and aircraft availability. While thorough inspections provide the best means of assessing airframe health, they are expensive, time consuming, and can inflict new damage to the aircraft. Other methods of estimating airframe health, such as flight logs and service records, must be veryconservative to account for variations in operational loading and corrosion. Recently, researchers have been investigating embeddable sensors for real-time sensing of airframe strains, but their high cost and their requirement for composite structures render these systems impractical for near-term implementation. In this proposal, Sarcos Research Corporation (SRC) outlines a develoment effort for an airframe health monitoring system based on micro machined strain sensors. The system will monitor real-time fatigue and strain in both metallic and non-metallic structures. By using an innovative digital sensor developed by SRC previously, this system will measure the absolute strain at each sensing point, without the drift associated with conventional strain gages. Phase I will develop a system design that will include monolithic signal processing and mutliplexing to improve performance and greatly reduce wiring and weight requirements. Phase II will implement a prototype system of distributed strain sensors, and Phase III will focus on commercial development of the system. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: The robust and versatile health monitoring system proposed will have immediate application in the military and commercial aircraft industry. Other areas where structural performance is critical, such as in naval vessels, space structures, bridges, and buildings, will also benefit from this development.",

        "abstract": "Progress in electric flight control has been hindered by the lack of a high bandwidth actuator. The challenge is to identify an efficient, responsive, and powerdense source of mechanical displacement. Actuators based on \"giant\" magnetostrictive materials, such as Terfenol, achieve very high magnetic strain (up to 2,000 ppm) and therefore provide power density unmatched in electromechanical systems. They outperform all known piezoelectric materials in terms of mechanical properties. SatCon has used Terfenol in several high performance actuators for space applications. In a large-stroke actuator, however, strain must be amplified while preserving power density. SatCon proposes to demonstrate an innovative actuator which uses local hydraulics to transform magnetostrictive strain into an arbitrarily long stroke. Magnetostriction generates pressurized fluid flow which powers a linear hydraulic actuator. The benefits of high performance hydraulics are retained without sacrificing the weight, redundancy, reliability, and simplicity of electric actuation. During Phase I, SatCon will develop a preliminary actuator design suitable for a cyclic/collective application. During Phase II, SatCon will detail design, fabricate, and bench test the actuator. Specifications will be as stated (3 inch stroke, 25 hp rating, and a reponse comparable to hydraulics). Alternate forms of electric power will be studied. Air cooling will be maximized.",

Using magnetostrictives, the single axis actuator can meet the weight, volume and durability requirements, without compromising the force or freuency range specifications. In contrast to piezoelectric materials, magnetostrictive materials have seven times larger strain and fifteen times higher energy density, resulting in more actuation effort for the given mass and volume budget.

        "abstract": "The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments list nearly two hundred toxic materials that must be regulated. Among these are hydrazines, compounds that are used as rocket fuels. Air Force compliance with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations will dictate the investigation and careful monitoring of the emissions of hydrazines to the atmosphere, particularly during the fueling and launching of rocket vehicles. However, current techniques to monitor atmospheric pollutants are not sensitive and specific enough to hydrazines to satisfy future EPA requirements. To fill this need, Science Research Laboratory (SRL) proposes to develop a portable interferometric pollution monitor (IPM) with the capability of measuring hydrazine and other pollutants in situ and continuously at the parts-per-trillion (ppt) level. The basis of this instrument is the interferometric measurement of the optical-path change that occurs immediately after a pulsed carbon-dioxide laser beam is absorbed by the pollutant present in one arm of the interferometer. An instrument that utilizes a line-tunable, pulsed carbon-dioxide laser can be tuned through the near-infrared absorption spectrum of hydrazines to determine their concentration in the presence of other absorptive species. An IPM will be sensitive to a concentration of several parts per trillion, orders of magnitude better than instruments based on other approaches to detect such toxic species. Such an instrument will be ideal for monitoring compliance with EPA regulations and for continuous measurement of the effectiveness of control processes that minimize the emission. The proposed Phase I feasibility study will be followed by a Government-sponsored proof-of-principle Phase II demonstration.",

        "abstract": "The use of high energy (E ~ 1-5 MeV) electron beams (HEEB) at high average power (P ~ 50 kW - 1 MW) allows carbon-carbon (CC) composite components to be joined together and bonded to high-temperature metallic materials. HEEB joining utilizes deep-penetration volumetric heating to melt a thin, high-Z braze alloy interlayer. The localized power deposition raises the CC and braze temperatures only at the joint, permitting wetting and reliable joint formation. Traditional joining methods such as furnace brazing and mechanical techniques are not acceptable for production of CC thermal shields or CC-containing tubes for rocket exhaust applications. HEEB joining minimizes thermal expansion failure which can occur with furnace brazing and replaces ad-hoc joining. Science Research Laboratory (SRL) has developed a new generation of pulsed induction linear accelerators which allow reliable, cost efficient production of high average power electron beams with the necessary parameters for CC joining. A unique feature of these accelerators is the high repetition rate (>5000 pps) all-solid-state pulsed power drivers which make these accelerators scalable to MW power levels at an electron beam cost of less than $2/Watt. The induction accelerator technology developed by SRL is consistent with the power densities (300-3000 W/cm2) and beam energies (1-5 MeV) required for CC joining. A HEEB CC joining system based on this technology is described. Preliminary experiments in Phase I will demonstrate HEEB joining and determine joint reliability and strength. Process optimization and the fabrication of thin-walled tubes containing CC-refractory metal bonds are planned for Phase II.",

Electron-beam-cured composite frames have the necessary stiffness for vehicle support, and can be produced at the high throughput rate necessary for commercial success.

The time-tested method of verifying shielding integrity, the CW radiation test, is generally manpower intensive, costly, and has environmental problems (e.g., interference with airport communications). There is a need to develop a built-in-test (BIT) system which can, on demand, readily evaluate the electromagnetic hardness of the aircraft, compare to pre-determined \"safe\" levels, and report all problems requiring maintenance. We propose to design and develop a BIT system for monitoring aircraft shielding effectivensss using the Stochastic Process Test Technique (SPTT) developed under an earlier proof of concept program.

        "abstract": "For current high temperature applications, superalloys have been the major structural materials with the intermetallic alloys being the materials for the next generation. Heat treatment is one of the most critical operations in manufacturing components of these materials. Problems such as unacceptable microstructure/properties, distortion, cracking, etc. during heat treatment processes have been the major obstacles preventing these materials from many potential applications in high performance energy conversion devices. This project will develop a computer modeling system for the heat treatment processes in manufacturing demanding structural components of high temperature materials. The objectives of the proposed Phase I work ar to define the functional requirements and to establish the theoretical foundation of a user friendly FEM-based computer simulation system for heat treatment of high temperature structural materials. The framework derived from this work will provide the basis on which a full scale implementation and integration will be performed in the Phase II work. OPTION TASK: $19,800",

Almost all of these active surge/stall controls have been proof-of-concept studies on laboratory-scale compressors or engines. A compelling need arises which is to evaluate all reported and new methods of active surge/stall control and to select the most feasible method for full engine demonstration. Scientific Monitoring, Inc. proposes to conduct a program of research on surge and rotating stall controls for turboshaft engines. Particularly, the research will emphasize a systematic trade study of various control methods and actuator/sensor combinations.

Knowledge of both longwave and shortwave radiation is critical to understanding the heat transfer among the ice, atmosphere, and ocean, and therefore required to understand environmental change in the Arctic. Long term autonomous systems are planned to be deployed in the Arctic to measure a variety of environmental parameters. It is currently not possible to include radiation measurements in these system, simply, because there exists no power conserving system for keeping the radiometer domes clean. Blowing snow and ice crystals form a hard crust-like surface on the radiometer domes resulting in erroneous measurements. In recent field operations, radiometer domes needed to be cleaned as frequently as every hour. Here we propose to design, build, and test a stand-alone battery-powered system for recording radiometer data for periods up to one year.

        "abstract": "A modern military fighter, such as an F-16, carries a multitude of different external store configurations through its design envelope. For certain configuration, flutter or limit cycle oscillations (LCO) restrict the maximum airspeed or the weapon release. As new weapons are introduced into the aircraft's inventory, radical changes may occur in the aircraft structural dynamics to thepoint of potentially encountering flutter. This potential requires an exhaustive certification process to define the flutter/LCO airspeed limit for each new store configuration. The payoffs associated with the removal of flutter speed restrictions include: increased survivability during war-time operations, increased flexibility in store selection, potential cost savings associated with reduced analyses and testing, and inherent reduction in risk associated with flight flutter test. The overall objective of Phase I is to design and test an on-line identification technique for adaptive structural mode suppression for F-16 aircraft. Specific tasks are: i)Acquisition of data and models for F-16 aircraft under different store configurations. (ii)On-line identification of structural modes using Stochastic Realization algorithm; (iii)Evaluation of sensor data and computational requirements for on-line identification of structural modes. Phase II will consist of hardware/software implementation and real-time testing of the robust control concepts bia nonlinear simulations incorporating both rigid body and flexible modes.

        "abstract": "An approach to helping pilots reduce or eliminate the consequences of errors is proposed. These consequences-to-be-avoided are termed \"hazards.\" The approach is based upon the idea that it is hazard, rather than error, that should be avoided. It is impossible to prevent all errors; attempting to do so will interfere with learning and innovation in a crisis. The proposed hazard monitor (HM) models pilot activities that can lead to dangerous situations. It used human-centered methods to help pilots avoid danger without taking authority or responsibility from the pilot. Errors are modeled as failed expectations associated with stages of an on-going task; tasks are moeled as sequences of situations. Serious hazards only occur after a swquence of situations that all contain increasingly dangerous failed expectations. A study of pilot activities, pilot errors, and iaircraft hazards along with an examination of current error mitigation techniques is proposed, the results of which will be used to design an aviation hazared monitor.",

The standard source of propulsion thermodynamics is the NASA Lewis CEC code, which describes the thermodynamics of multicomponent, ideal gases in the temperature range of 300 to 5000 @K. There are currently many important propulsion problems, that the proposed analyses would address, which lie outside this range of restrictions. Also, there are currently no systematic studies to generalize CEC type codes. Real fluid thermodynamics and transport properties including phase changes, combustion kinetics, and turbulent mixing modules will be produced as a result of this study. CFD codes are widely used to investigate propulsion problems, because they are not limited in the fluid properties or geometries used to describe the system. The proposed innovation would improve existing CFD methodology with a minimum cost and effort by providing better property descriptions in the new submodels which will be developed.",

        "abstract": "In today's society, computers are being interconnected at ever increasing rates - with an apparent goal of seamless global communication. One of the last roadblocks restricting the formation of one globally inter- connected network is the fear of malicious hackers invading protected islands of information, stealing secrets and reaking havoc with an expensive information base. Because of this fear, network architects will continue to use physical isolation or restricted flow of services. Unfortunately for network administrators, these (semi-) isolated networks are usually too large to administer on a hands-on basis and are beyond the capabilities of net management protocols such as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), and Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP). Phase I of this effort is to identify techniques for implementing network management protocols in a multi-level secure environment, through the use of Type Enforcement and cryptographic techniques. Phase II of this effort will focus on the development of these protocols iinpleniented on the LOCK computer platform. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - This proposal will examine techniques for implementing network management in MLS networks through a combination of high-grade cryptography and a relatively new security mechanism called Type Enforcement (TE). The combination of these two mechanism permits network management protocols to achieve a global view of the network while still protecting the sensitive information encountered on these networks.",

        "abstract": "Target planning is one of the most significant technical challenges to developing a tactical or strategic war plan. The requirement is to analyze considerable amounts of data concerning the enemy, common and allied force situation and provide results in a form useful for quality decision making in a short period of time. Due to the complexities of mission planning, these systems will becom more autonomous, with a man-in-the-loop to override, correct errors and to monitor performance. Short timelines and semi-autonomous operations pose a classic challenge to the artificial intellegence community to explore new and innovative adaptive information processing approaches that minimize reliance on heuristic or ad hoc techniques. Networks of dynamically programmable logic modules (DPLM networds) appear promising in such areas as pattern recognition and classification, signal processing, and robotics. One specific requirement is to develop new parallel processing techniques to support target planning applications. The objective fo the proposed Phase I project is to demonstrate that a genetic algorithm can be used to evolve DPLM network software to support complex target planning applications.",

        "abstract": "High spatial resolution imagery from geo-stationary orbit places uncompromising demands on spacecraft stabilization and optical system thermal stability. GEO requires + 8.80 pointing FOR, 1.25 urad IFOV (10's of urad accuracy) and < 1 urad (rms) jitter at ~ 10 Hz rate. Prior solutions have combined complex and costly ACS/IMU/Stellar control of spacecraft jitter with detector oversampling and image motion compensation (IMC). The problem is heightened for limited weight MicroSpacecraft sensors with increased excitation bandwidth and lack of on-board control capability. Ultra-lightweight, thermally stable silicon carbide optics and advanced servo control systems permit large aperture pointing and high precision stabilization in one lightweight assembly. The core innovation of combining these technologies removes the tight slewing and jitter requirements from the spacecraft and IMC from the ground station; complexity, weight and cost are dramatically reduced. This program will develop a 0.5m aperture, high precision SiC pointing and stabilization mirror assembly including servo control electronics. Phase I will provide the conceptual design and analysis of a prototype unit and a hardware demonstration of an advanced 6\" x 9\" SiC mirror in an existing 2 urad pointing system. The closed back SiC mirror, replacing a beryllium mirror, has superior thermal stability, stiffness and strength. Phase II will provide the development and test of a flight qualifiable advanced pointing assembly for GEO; a wide range of micro-spacecraft such as Quick LAWS and commercial remote sensors and imagers are supported.",

Aluminum metal is a stable low cost fuel that is typically used in the form of powder or flake. In high energy systems the energy of the balst and the velocity of the detonation wavefront can be limited by the utilization efficiency and oxidation reaction rate of the aluminum powder. In this work a composite aluminum powder will be developed that has the potential of extremely high reaction rates, full utilization of the aluminum material and the future potential for an Integrated Fuel System, that incorporates additional fuel and or oxidizer in a single powder particle. A patented ultra high speed vacuum process will be used to produce a material that is composed of tens of throusands of submicron aluminum layers separated by submicron polymer layers. a composite aluminum particle can have tens or even hundreds of very thin aluminum layers, resulting in a very high surface to volume ratio, that will increase the reaction rate and oxidation efficiency. The polymer materials are thrermally and mechanically stable and can incorporate functionalities that can aid or control the detonation process. The composite powder can have a variable density, it has superior environmental stability, and it is relativly safe to handle. In the Phase I work powders with select polymers and different aluminum to polymer ratios will be produced and will be therochemically characterized. Samples will also be supplied to the HERD group for evaluation. In Phase II the polymer material and the aluminum to polymer ratio will be optimized for specific appliances and pilot production samples will be supplied for evaluation to the HERD group and commercial explosives and solid fuel propellant manufacturers.",

        "abstract": "The performance of aero-acoustic weapons systems mounted on army ground vehicle/weapon platforms is often seriously degraded by interference from engine noise, vibration and vehicle motion. The purpose of this project is to improve the performance of the acoustic sensors by cancelling or reducing the vehicle noise appearing in them, through the application of multi-channel noise cancellation. Others have previously tried to accomplish this by application of the classic Widrow algorithm for multichannel noise cancellation. The Principal Investigator of Signal Separation Technologies (SST) also has previously attempted to apply the classical algorithm, in his case to the elimination of tow cable strum induced vibration noise appearing in a Navy towed array sonar. Finding the classic algorithm to be theoretically and practically deficient for multichannel noise cancelling application, he augmented the algorithm to make it work correctly. This new method, termed the Signal-free Reference - Singular-value Decomposition (SFR-SVD method), was able to solve the sonar vibration noise cancelling problem. This method will be applied to the vehicle noise problem, and should yield similar benefits.",

        "abstract": "Many optical computing problems are centered around the processing of incoherent images. These images may be conventional visible light such as those taken with a CCD imager or camcorder. They may also take the form of infrared images in the case of missle seekers or x-ray images from medical or other sources. For optical processing, these images must be converted to either phase or amplitude modulated coherent light. This is typically accomplished by electronically feeding the originally captured image into a spatial light modulator (e.g., liquid crystal or deformable mirror array) and modulating a coherent reference beam with the 2 dimensional data pattern. The electrical input to the SLM creates a data flow bottleneck in the optical processing system due to the inherently serial input architecture. SMD proposes a novel incoherent to coherent image converter which solves this problem by providing a massively parallel, optical input feed capability, utilizing a novel combination of micromachining and ultra-thinned wafer technology to achieve an integrated incoherent to coherent image converter.",

        "abstract": "High-speed, large area detector arays are needed for recording fast events in both military and commercial applications. Deblurring of high-velocity targets within an image require extremely short exposure times. Short exposure times in turn, reduce the time availble for photon intergration and, because of increased amplifier bandwidths, result in higher noise levels at the CCD sense node. The desire to take high quality (high-speed) images under ambient lighting conditions imposes a need to optimize both the light gathering capability of the individual photosites and the sensitivity of the CCD output amplifier. Previous efforts at reducing sense node capacitance have been hampered by either physical constraints of the fabrication process, or band-width limitations imposed by using lightly oped drain techniques. Deblurring of high-speed events typically equires interline transfer CCD designs which allow for high-speed shuttering capability, but severely limit the detector element's light gathering capability. SMD proposes an alternative imaging architecture which optimizes both photosite and amplifier sensitivity through the use of novel micromachining techniques. The modified amplifier and photosite structure promises to achieve charge to voltage conversion gains of l00 to 200 microvolts per electron.",

These methods require intensive image processing and is time consuming. High Speed Panoramic Inspection System (HSPIS) combines coherent image guide technology, structured illumination, panoramic image translation algorithm, machine vision and computer interface technologies into a system that \"unfolds\" a 360 degree view of an object into a 2D image array.

With the support of Brunswick, this technique will be applied (Tech-Transfer) to surface inspection of composite launch tubes and miniaturized pressured vessels as well. The HSPIS will be integrated as an automated inspection system which can inspect all sides of a component in a 30 milliseconds time frame.

Unlike conventional optical manufacturing processes that require extensive hand work, Opticam technology produces optical surfaces having shapes that are accurately determined by the geometry of the grinding machine. Surface errors produced during tubular grinding are closely related to the relative alignment of the tool and workpiece. This makes it possible to predict the errors produced by various types of misalignment, and thereby make it possible to correct the alignment of the machine by inspecting a manufactured part.

Even though several U.S. companies ahve successfully entered into various diamond thin film markets with CVD grown films, we have not yet seen widely used commercial wear resistance diamond coatings. The major problem for such applications is that one cannot achieve both economic and good wear resistance coatings with the currently predominant microwave CVD technique. In order to have economical competativeness, at least a factor of 10 times increase in the deposition rate thatn the current rate is required, such an increase in deposition rate while maintaining high film quality is not likely to be accomplished in near future using present methods. The direct C- ion beam deposition (IBD) process has demonstrated superior properties in adhesion, low friction surfaces, and film uniformity becuase the nucleation occurs uniformly across the surface due to the intrisic high energy of the C- ion beam (50-100 eV). The current large area ion sources also have difficulties in commercial applications because of its low deposition rate (~1um/hr). We proposed to develop an innovative IBD process which promises to deliver depostion rates up to 100 um/hr with our novel way of producing C- ion beams. We are proposing the development of a unique rectlinear C- ion beam source design which is capable of making deposition in any length with depostion rate of the order of 100um/hr for the beam area. In a test system we have demonstrated scratch resistant, morphologically smooth, and transpoarent diamong like films.

        "abstract": "An innovative annular combustor concept has demonstrated superior performance while achieving very low lean blowout fuel to air ratio and providing a major reduction in NOx emissions. The design utilizes bulk swirl and is based on a Variable Residence Time (VRT) concept which allows large fuel particles adequate time to completely burn in the circumferentially mixed primary zone. High durability of the combustor is achieved by dual function use of the incoming air. Due to the method of circumferential air admission, it is ideally suited to very high inlet air velocities with minimum losses which will result in an improved cycle efficiency and a lower engine specific fuel consumption. SOL-3 Resources proposes to apply the VRT combustor concept to an advanced small engine currently under development. The support of the major engine manufacturer has already been obtained.",

These hydrophones will be designed to fulfill the requirements for accurate, wideband measurement of lithotripter fields, suitable for quantitative biophysical research or Food and Drug Administration submissions. The disposable feature of the hydrophone system will make it cost effective for research, quality assurance and regulatory submissions.

One cost-effective response to this requirement is the use of both computer and hardware simulation to test the response of US electronic warfare (EW) systems to different threats and engagement scenarios. Hardware EW simulations are conducted in shielded anechoic chambers both to control the test environment and to conceal the test scenarios from electronic intelligence gathering by potential adversaries. Historically, most laboratory tests of EW systems have used direct insertion of the simulated threat signals into the receivers of the system under test. Advanced airborne intercept radars currently under development use electronically steered arrays to passively locate and track other aircraft by their electromagnetic emissions. The need exists for a dynamic target simulator which emits signals that accurately simulate the signals from a distant moving target within the constraints of an RF anechoic chamber. S*R proposes to meet this requirement with a Radiated Direction of Arrival Simulator (RDAS) utilizing an array of antennas to simulate one or more moving emitters within the field of view of the passsive airborne intercept radar.",

        "abstract": "The need to recycle solid plastic waste is becoming increasingly acute in view of the limited availability of both landfill space in which to dump plastic trash and the petroleum reserves needed to replace discarded material.  The National Research Council has identified the need for a rapid and reliable means of chemically identifying plastics as a Critical Technology.  Without such a means of identification, it will not be possible to reprocess the billions of pounds of plastics that are being landfilled or incinerated every year.  This Phase II proposal builds on Phase I success to offer a new spectroscopic device that is able to positively identify the chemical composition of plastic waste containers and scraps at rates that could ultimately exceed one-hundred pieces per second.  This innovation in essence can be described as a Molecular Bar-Code Reader.  The effort proposed will put Phase-I-proven principals into practice by building commercial prototype devices from rapid plastic identification using laser spectroscopy coupled with advanced optical signal generation, separation, and detection technologies.  The end result of Phase II R&D will be three functioning plastic identification systems:  (1) A transportable system with hand-held read head, (2) a battery-powered portable hand-held unit, and (3) An OEM sensor prototype for use in automated solid-waste sorting.  These systems will be suitable for field testing and demonstration to secure Phase III support and establish a solid technology base for commercialization.",

Hardened ceramic coatings will reduce wear and will have immediate commercial impact with significant benefits to younger patients who would have to use these devices for extended periods. Zirconia is a biocompatible, hard ceramic with good wear and lubricity. It can be uniformly applied on intricate surfaces by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at low temperatures.

Such devices are dual-use technology, desired by both defense and commercial antenna manufacturers. California Microwave, Inc., an antenna company, is actively seeking a practical implementation of such switches, trademarked as \"Photistors,\" for its implementation of a synaptic antenna. California Microwave has identified required switching characteristics, and has encouraged Spire to develop these much needed devices. Photistor-devices are photoconductors made in very pure (background concentration = 10(12) cm-3) , high-lifetime semiconductors. High purity results in extremely high OFF \"dark\" resistance, while simultaneously allowing a low ON resistance under weak light due to the high material lifetime. Photogenerated carrier concentrations 1000 times higher than the dark background are the goal. Most photoconductors of recent interest use amorphous, semi-insulating, or ion-implanted-precipitate material, which results in lower minority carrier lifetime than pure material. This increases speed and resistivity at the price of decreased sensitivity, higher required optical power, and non-linear IVs. In contrast, Photistor-devices are made in near-perfect semiconductor material to achieve the highest carrier lifetime, light sensitivity, and lowest background concentration (highest OFF/ON ratio) possible with linear I-V curves to avoid harmonic generation by the RF antenna currents. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Photistor-devices are linear, very light-sensitive, optically triggered electronic switches with applications in antenna switching, antenna reconfiguration, microwave control, high voltage switching, and opto- isolation.

Previous research with interference-based techniques, specifically holographic concentrators, can become practical with LTP. Holography enables the concentrator designed an additional degree of design freedom by allowing arbitrary choice of the ratio between angles of incidence and reflection.

        "abstract": "A major difficulty in properly treating burn patients is the inability to reliably differentiate full dermal thickness burns, which should be excised and grafted, from partial thickness burns, which will heal within a few weeks without excision. Recently, the use of an intravenously injected florescent dye illuminated with 800 nm infrared radiation has been shown in animal experiments to provide a clear differentiation between full and partial thickness burns. The flashlamp source which produces the infrared illumination, however, has limited discrimination ability and little practical utility in clinical applications because of its lack of spectral purity, spatial uniformity, and spectral intensity. Preliminary experiments performed using a Star Medical Technologies (SMT) high energy diode array laser (5 millijoules in 5 milliseconds) indicate that a diode array laser illuminator can remedy these major dificiencies. Design studies indicate that a compact, hand-held diagnostic unit can be built and inexpensively produced. SMT proposed to perform the experiments necessary to validate this diagnostic approach and gather the critical design data necessary for the construction of a clinical prototype.",

The long term goal is to eliminate heavy, labor intensive on-board computer hardware by using \"educated\", aircraft-specific, neural network computer \"chips\" of diagnostic software, capable of intelligent interpretation of both engine sensor signals and aerothermal performance details. The proposed approach uses recent advances in neural network technology, finite element based rotor dynamic analysis, and throughflow performance analysis. Phase I will involve the development of neural software for structural diagnosis of gas turbine engines and the demonstrtion of this software for engine diagnostic purposes using a physical rotating model. This work will demonstrate how dedicated finite element modeling and select engine measurements may serve as the \"brains\" for a neural network based diagnostic system. Engine performance aspects will be accomplished with the same neural network approach by replacing the finite element model with an engine performance model. During Phase II, prototype aircraft monitor will be developed in conjunction with Rolls-Royce Incorporated by extending the principles demonstrated in Phase I. The neural network based system will be \"trained\" in the dynamic and mechanical behavior of an engine, and in the engine performance characteristics as determined by aerothermal cycle synthesis. The prototype system will provide the USAF with demonstrated, real-time estimates of remaining component life and of engine performance for a select engine, based on real-time, updated behavior during operation.",

        "abstract": "An important factor of monitoring processes, testing parts which have been in service for extended times, or performing intelligence on new materials from other countries is identification of material composition and internal structure. A common approach to this task involves destructive testing in which the object under test is taken apart and analyzed to reveal internal structure and material composition. Ultrasound, X-ray, or other similar forms of testing can provide internal structure, but do not identify material composition. Also, such techniques cannot be used for remote identification. All materials, however, posses relatively unique spectral reflectances, emittances, and transmittances. Internal structure gives rise to similarly unique spatially varying heat capacities and thermal conductivities. These parameters together give rise to unique, spatially varying spectral radiances which properly exploited can be used both to identify material composition and internal structure. An instrument designed to exploit spectral radiances would be an invaluable tool for non-destructive test and identification. Proposed is a development effort aimed at developing an instrument capable of collecting high spectral resolution images, nominally from about 3 microns to about 12 microns, but potentially down to about 0.35 microns. These images, comprising 256 x 256 spatial pixels, are collected at 600 frames per second, calibrated and processed in real-time with massively powerful yet extremely compact electronics to elicit material composition and structural integrity.",

A natural and arguably necessary extension to image-guidedneurosurgery workstations is the ability to integrate real-time ultrasound imagery into the intra-operativelocalization process. This functionality is motivated by two elements: 1) the need for the neurosurgeonto monitor intra-operative diagnostic imagery and relate these images to presurgical diagnostic imagery(MRI/CT) and localization information, and 2) the need to track the brain shift that may occur during aneurosurgical procedure and to correct presurgical diagnostic imagery to accurately reflect this brainshift. We will complete the laboratory studies and will perform the preliminary clinical studies necessaryto validate the technical and clinical feasibility of a stereotactic ultrasound system that will be integratedinto the NeuroStation . The stereotactic ultrasound system will consist of a custom-designed ultrasoundunit for stereotactic neurosurgery that will intra-operatively provide localized ultrasonography, registeredmultimodal (CT/MRI/Ultrasound) visualization, 3D ultrasound datasets. and brain-shift correction forpre-surgical CT/MRI datasets.

Because of this, there may be time periods for which the system performance can be enhanced, if the coolers are shut down. One method of allowing for system shut down is to provide an alternate passive cooling source for the sensors. SAI proposed to develop a closed system Phase Change Material Device (PCMD). This device will provide 750 Joules of cooling at 60 Degrees Kelvin for one half hour. Once developed, by varying the fill pressure, the Phase Change Temperature (operating temperature) can be varied over a small range. Additionally, other operating ranges (i.e., 10 to 20 K and 40 to 80 K) can be provided by changing the working fluid. This device can be utlized in either ground and/or space applications.",

The innovation lies in a novel homopolar-type structure that offers an 85* increase in load capacity and a 33* decrease in weight relative to other homopolar configurations of similar size. The bearing also offers improvements in power consumption, controllability, manufacturability, and packaging. The Phase I objectives are to demonstrate the feasibility with proof-of-concept tests, trade studies, and preliminary design engineering. It is anticipated that the bearing will offer clear advantages for high temperature gas turbine systems. In Phase II, the bearing will be demonstrated as a full-scale prototype.

There is a practical need to screen for the presence of benzodiazepines and their metabolites. Oxazepam glucuronide is the final metabolite of oxazepam and related benzodiazepines in humans and other species. It may be used in the area of drug screening to establish a protocol which will be simpler, faster and more reliable than the method in current use which requires a hydrolysis step. This project proposes to explore the chemical synthesis of oxazepam glucuronide. The synthesis research will include a. preparation of the proper protected sugar moieties, b. coupling reactions between oxazepam and the protected sugar moieties, and c. conversion of coupling compounds into oxazepam glucuronide. The success of the proposed project will provide a new commercial product for forensic chemistry and will lead to the establishment of a new testing method which will have obvious advantages over the present hydrolysis- extraction method.

        "abstract": "The technical objective of the Phase I effort described herein is to determine whether a \"virtual\" improvement in the E-2C aircraft flying qualities in the carrier environment can be achieved by having the pilot use a head-up display (HUD). In order to accomplish this objective, existing military and civilian HUD technology will be surveyed to determine what might be available for use in the existing E-2C cockpit without major airframe interruptions. At least three candidate systems will be selected for presentation, with their particular rationales, in report format. The Phase I work plan will assay the merits of a head-up display (HUD) for the E-2C in terms of six key display characteristics: (1) identification of critical mission phase(s) and tasks, (2) the elements of the display, (3) the display content, (4) the display format, (5) the symboloby, and (6) cost/feasibility assessment of most promising HUD systems. This technical approach employs closed-loop analysis of the pilot's tasks associated with a specific vehicle operational profile or mission phase. The resulting multiloop feedback (and feedforward) structures reveal, in detail, not only the content, format, and dynamic properties of essential pilot information requirements but also appropriate piloting control techniques, which can be helpful in training as well as in predicting flying qualities.",

This problem is important because shrinking budgets drive the ever increasing need for excellent cost-performance ratios in parallel computers. Our proposed solution is to develop a rational parallel computer architecture design technique in which the application is paramount over the architecture and the underlying hardware is based upon commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components. Our methodology is in two parts. First, we will examine real-time avionics computations for their fundamental computational behaviors. Second, we will develop appropriate modeling tools in which the behavior of the avionics computations drive the parallel computer architecture design. From this Phase I effort, we will produce the high-level design of a COTS-based parallel computer (with an excellent cost-performance ratio) specifically intended to solve real-time avionics computations. The Principal Investigator has performed research in the area of parallel computer architecture, and the Key Personnel have considerable software engineering experience in designing and implementing tools. The long term commercialization result will be a methodology by which to design and build high performance, low cost parallel computers for specific application domains.",

SYTRONICS' maintenance study can ensure that the T-38A will serve as an efficient, reliable trainer into the 21st century and beyond. The key to SYTRONICS' effort is the data provided by Northrop's Supportability Technology Development Center. Northrop built the T-38 and has collected large amounts of data (ranging from 1972 data to current, real-time CAMS data) on all aspects of T-38 maintenance. In addition to Northrop's recorded data, SYTRONICS will also be able to call on Northrop personnel who maintained the T-38 while serving in the Air Force. This first-hand experience will be invaluable to SYTRONICS' study. Possible maintenance improvements produced by the Phase I study will become specific recommendations for Air Force action during Phase II.

        "abstract": "The US Army is continually faced with the task of providing the crew members of weapon systems with realistic, high-quality training. This training must be based on known principles of instructional design, yet meet the needs of specific weapon system based training issues. The problem of providing quality training compounded by a reduction in force, resulting in smaller crews. There will also be few trainers, training developers, and smaller support staff for production of training materials. In addition, training production costs are rising. The Crew size reductions in Army weapons systems have been made possible by Intelligent functions such as Decision Support Systems/Decision Aids which perform operations normally associated with crew members. These cooperative, computer-based systems will require a different level of training than was previously provided. Decision Support Systems are now being developed for armor and artillery, and these systems will require Embedded Training for all crew members. U.S. Army TACOM has developed a Vetronics Crew Display Demonstrator (VCDD) for development and evaluation of concepts relating to future vehicle-based weapons systems requirements. A major focus of this effort are the requirements for the Integrated Two-man Crew Station (ITCS). The ITCS architecture will integrate the physical, electronic, intelligent subsystems, training and control functions into a fieldable configuration. The effort proposed here is directed at the Embedded Training component .",

The first is to investigate the feasibility ofimplementing certain critical areas of the hardware of an ultrasound scanner, which was developed foruse with inverse scattering theory, as VLSI components. The second is to develop calibrationmechanisms for ultrasound inverse scattering tomography of the female breast. Both of these objectiveswill accelerate the process of moving our inverse scattering imaging algorithms, now operating on slowermechanical laboratory scanners, onto an electronic scanning platform that is more suitable for the clinicalenvironment. These objectives shall be accomplished by upgrading an existing prototype ultrasoundscanner which was initially developed to aid our research into inverse scattering tomography as appliedto breast cancer imaging. This scanner, the TechniScan Ultrasound Breast Scanner (TUBS), has suppliedTechniScan with a deeper understanding of some of the technological difficulties which need to beovercome for inverse scattering to work in a clinical environment. In order for TechniScan to proceedwith this development, we believe that it is necessary to retrofit the TUBS with state-of-the-arttechnology.

        "abstract": "Solid state active phased array antennas promise to provide very low sidelobe capability. However, they will be subject to short term calibration drift and element failures. This compels an on-line, operational self calibration capability. TSC proposes a completely internal, on-line self calibration technique which utilizes the inherent mutual coupling among the radiating elements to accurately measure the transfer coefficients of each of the elements and their associated T/R module receivers and transmitters, transmission lines, and beamformers. The technique does not require knowledge of the absolute magnitude of the mutual coupling coefficients, but exploits the fact that the coupling coefficients will be very consistent across the array, and will remain very stable with time. Once the transfer coefficients are accurately measured, the appropriate corrections are applied to the T/R module phase shifters and attenuators. In case of a failed element, one of several algorithms is applied which optimally adjusts the other elements in the array to recover the antenna pattern sidelobe performance. The simplest of these to implement utilizes adjustments to the weights of the other elements in the array to synthesize, and add back, a close approximation of the missing array element pattern.",

        "abstract": "A ground-based clutter emulation transponder is proposed for the cost-effective development and testing of airborne space-time adaptive processing (STAP) algorithms. The deisgn of the clutter emulator is based on uniquely modulating each output of a radar transponder having multiple transmit antennas that are spatially distributed in the cross-range dimension. During Phase I, the feasibility of using the ground-based transponder to emulate accurately the spatial and temporal characteristics of sidelobe clutter, as observed by an airborne radar, will be analyzed. The quality of the emulation will be determined by simulating the responses of selected STAP algorithms to a computer model of the transponder. The responses will be compared to the outputs that are obtained when the algorithms are exercised using existing, high-fidelity clutter simulations. For the design configurations that yield favorable comparisons, the simulation will be used to quantify the cirtical emulator parameters and thereby establish the feasibility of the concept. Both an implementation plan for the clutter emulator, and a demonstration test plan based on using the UHF RSTER system will be prepared to facilitate the transition into Phase II of the SBIR Program. Anticipated Benefits: The principal benefit of the proposed concept is the acceleration of the development of a critical enabling technology during a period of reduced defense spending. This benefit can be realized because the clutter emulator will allow existing ground-based assets, rather than costly-to-operate airborne assets, to be used during the initial stages of STAP algorithm development. The clutter transponder could be applied to the testing of systems such as air traffic control radars.",

        "abstract": "Nap-of-the-Earth (NOE) flight in a conventional helicopter is extremely taxing for two pilots under visual flight rules (VFR) conditions. There is a desire to develop an all-weather Automated NOE (ANOE) system that will allow a single pilot to safely fly a helicopter at altitudes near 50 feet. Recent work by NASA/ARC has indicated that ranging to the ground and potential hazards using passive camera sensors can significantly improve ANOE performance. These sensors indicate that an effective all-weather, day/night, ANOE system can be developed by augmenting passive sensors, INS/GPS and hazard data with an active radar system. At present, the data base required to specify such a sensor system does not exist. This proposal is to define a low cost, data collection radar to derive the necessary data base. During Phase II the radar would be developed and tested. This radar will collect data not only for the ANOE mission but will also collect data to determine its utility as a situational awareness sensor during approach, landing and taxiing. In addition, the radar will collect preliminary data to help define a machine vision system for landing in very low visibility. The critical issues are height measurement accuracy and hazard detection, e.g., towers and wires. We will use our experience in developing unique algorithms for obtaining very precise height accuracy.

To accomplish this, existing 3 m resolution 1FSAR imagery will be used to identify critical feature components, and to develop and exercise scene segmentation and terrain identification algorithms. The program will quantify the advantages that such 3-D processing can achieve relative to conventional, 2-D SAR systems. Two-aperture IFSAR data are subject to glint effects that can seriously degrade height estimation accuracy. Utilizing three vertical subapertures provides two IFSAR images simultaneously. A unique algorithm can then be applied to determine the height of both a primary and a possible secondary scatterer. Available, three-subaperture, 10 m resolution IFSAR imagery, which has been collected and is currently being processed under an IR&D program, will be utilized during Phase I to quantify the benefits 0-f three-subaperture operation.

Existing software will be used to perform SAR data retrieval and image processing, and to exploit USGS data bases in ground-truth assessment. Anticipated Benefits/Potential Applications - Automatic geologic and terrain classification from SAR and IFSAR data has numerous applications. Commercial and scientific applications include such diverse possibilities as providing accurate data bases for siting portable air traffic control radars during emergency efforts (e.g. after hurricanes and floods), detecting terrain features indicating the presence of minerals or oil, and monitoring the size and health of forests and wetlands.

Tenelex Industries, Inc., will negotiate with federal and state highway safety regulating agencies to incorporate their requirements into the prototype design. Design considerations will include the capacity for future networking LifeLites for traffic pacing in tunnels and bridges. Anticipated Benefits: Low-cost electronic race pavement markers offer significant benefits for public safety. In addition to use in fog-related conditions, these passive solar powered units could be used on rural or mountain roads where hills or curves limit visibility.",

The airplane will utilize cost and weight effective composite structures designed for progressive failure to absorb energy. In addition the forward portions of the airplane will be designed to reduce the tendency of digging into soft soil by a combination of shape and strength of the lower cowl. Careful shaping of rate sensitive foam seat cushions will protect various size and weight occupants from impact decelerations. Completion of Phase I will provide the data necessary for completion of the structural design and completion of Phase II will verify the complete design process through subscale tests. Tooling will be built and a number of airframes provided to NASA for full scale tests (once tooling is built the cost of test airframes will be relatively low). Tests completed under this program will extend NASA data into complete airframes and the low cost airframes will allow NASA the opportunity to extend their full scale crash data base into small composite airplanes and to further explore impacts into soil.",

        "abstract": "This proposal discusses the need for a monitor on commercial aircraft capable of detecting RF emissions over a broad dynamic range and an extremely wide electromagnetic spectrum. The security monitor has two purposes: (1) detect inadvertent RF emissions from passenger's portable electronic devices (PEDs) and (2)detect attacks from hostile subversives using high power microwave (HPM) RF weapons. The proposal discusses the synergistic combination of airline's advertisement of their vulnerability to hostile sources, the increased incididence and probability of domestic terrorist activity, the availability of HPM sources and their intrinsic characteristics that make them particularly attractive to subversives. A possible attack scenario is described in terms of the immediate results and the evidence that would be left for investigators. The consequences of ignoring the present vulverability are explored, as well as the safety net provided by deployment of sensor systems. To optimize the value of the sensor system, it's usefulness in detecting non-hostie, inadvertent emissions from passenger's PEDs is also defined. Having such a system deployed in commercial aircraft will simultaneously allow passengers to operate non-interfering electronic systems freely while preventing and locating PEDs that are radiating interference.",

        "abstract": "Under sponsorship of the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC/XR), Toyon Research Corporation developed an innovative approah for simulating the interaction of an aircraft employing radar countermeasures against an attacking missile employing counter-countermeasures. The Toyon approach yields a simulation which is very fast running, yet models all principal factors, including those which are computationally demanding. It has been implemented under a Microsoft Windows environment using standard pull-down menus familar to PC users. This proposal is to initiate an effort to extend Toyon's innovative radar-guided missile simulation to include optically guided missiles. The integrated simulation will provide ASC and other users with the ability to (1) rapidly derive a quantitative understanding of target/missile engagements, (2) explore tradeoffs of the key parameters for the purpose of developing better radar and optical countermeasures and counter-countermeasures, and (3) efficiently train new personnel in the science of target/missile countermeasures. In order to prove both the feasibility and value of the proposed simulation, Toyon will deliver a computer disk containing executable code which demonstrates a sequence of interesting target/missile engagements employing optical seekers.",

The filtration system must be simple, lightweight, and produce negligible pressure drops across the air intake. The filter will be fabricated by sol-gel techniques using a patent pending ambient pressure drying procedure that offers net-shape, low-cost fabrication with precise control of membrane pore structure. Combined with ceramic fiber reinforcement, the sol-gel process enables the fabrication of tough, low cost, high performance filters. Cylindrical filters will be chemically aged, dried, and infiltrated to control membrane pore size and pore size distribution. A hydrophobic layer will be covalently bound to the surface of the filter to prevent airborne contaminants from wetting and fouling the filter. Characterization will include thermal stability, mechanical properties, pore size and pore size distribution, filtration efficiency, in-line pressure drop, and wetting.

Small, low power consumption digital signal processors make feasible implementation of powerful adaptive signal processing algorithms in very small form factor devices. These algorithms provide the means to attenuate background noise, widen the dynamic range of human hearing, and improve sound location capabilities. A Phase I program is proposed that will use a digital signal processing system consisting of non-linear gain, adaptive echo cancellation, and adaptive noise cancellation algorithms to solve hearing enhancement problems.

Magnetic bearings require auxiliary ball and roller bearings to carry high transient maneuver loads thta exceed the magnetic bearing capacity and to support the rotor when the magnetic bearings fail or are turned off. Commercial hybrid-ceramic auxiliary ball bearings have performed best but have failed at high-speed touch-downs in recent magnetic bearing rotor testing. Special solid-lubricated self-contained ceramic bearings patented by Tribology Systems, Inc. (TSI), have already achieved considerable analysis and test experience under operating conditions very similar to that whihc auxiliary magnetic back-up bearings are subjected to, including rapid acceleration to high speeds and successful long-life operation under high transient shock loads. TSI was selected competitively to suppoy auxiliary bearing analysis and prototypes for United Technologies' magnetic bearing rotor testing this year. Starting with the above analysis and test experience, auxiliary ball and roller bearings for Army magnetic bearing gas-turbine engines will be analyzed with TSI's advanced bearing computer codes in coordination with the latest rotor dynamics and magnetic bearing control technology on Phase I.

The rotor of this generator is made of samarium-cobalt magnets and generates core heating due to eddy and hysterisis losses. Cooling of the rotor to a safe operating temperature is essential to maintain the required efficiency. Conventional forced air or oil jet cooling of the hollow rotor shaft has been found to yield poor results. This proposal addresses a novel cooling concept to efficiently cool the rotor. The rotating heat pipe principle is used here. A set of radial fin-like vapor chambers attached to an external condenser through the extended hollow shaft. The condenser can be conveniently cooled by liquid spray cooling externally. As an operating temperature < 200oC is preferred for the generators, water or alcohol can be used as working fluid. The objectives of Phase I effort are to design a representative APU rotor thermal model and analyze its thermal characteristics incorporating the proposed cooling technique for demonstrating the feasibility. Anticipated Benefits: Efficient cooling of generator rotor prevents machine overheating and premature failures. APUs can be built very reliably, minimizing aircraft engine repair or down time. A well-cooled rotor design will result in weight reduction.

The project will be combined with software that will permit easy access to the coding, universe information, and questionnaire context of all variables. The foundations for this project are three computer utilities that have already been completed; however, the utilities are for a UNIX mainframe environment. One utility searches through a dictionary of CPS variable names to find all variable names that contain any user-supplied character string. The second utility takes a list of variable names supplied by the user and produces an ASCII file of the CPS data for the appropriate survey years. This utility also issues a report on the screen (or other medium) containing the coding and universe information for each variable in all survey years. The third utility provides context by outputting (to the medium designated by the user) a list of the CPS questions that gave rise to the variables supplied by the user. Proposed Phase I funding will be used to improve and complete existing documentation, to write a user's manual, to modify and improve the existing utilities, and to develop compression/decompression algorithms appropriate for storing the CPS data on CD.",

The software developed as part of the project will allow demographers, sociologist, economists, epidemiologist, and researchers in other fields to answer a greatly expanded set of analytical questions not previously possible. Statistical procedures included in the software will be useful for modeling marital and nonmarital fertility, adult and child morality, cohabitation, marriage, divorce, health care utilization, medical cost, nursing home use, and a wide variety of other demographic models. Statistical models include failure-time, qualitative outcome, and continuous panel data. An important new feature is the ability to model these processes jointly. The project will take recent statistical developments previously applied to specific research problems and (1) develop the basic set of algorithms into a flexible and powerful software package, (2) make the software user friendly, (3) document the technical statistical algorithms, (4) write reference and user's manuals, (5) plan for distribution of the software, (6) provide training workshops for new users, and (7) design a system of support for users.

        "abstract": "A gas turbine engine concept is proposed that provides the technical innovation needed to increase specific power, thermal efficiency, and overall performance and reliability without need for development in material technologies. This advanced fluid-fluid energy exchange device can serve as the core of high performance gas generators to meet a variety of land/air applications. This unique system is based on unsteady flow phenomena which produces the functional equivalent of a coupled gas turbine and compressor by continous expansion of one gas stream while extracting energy which is used to compress another gas stream. The wave processes occur within one rotor which features canted blades that are alternately exposed to hot and cold fluids resulting in material temperatures much lower than peak cycle values. The proposed program features the modification of an existing CFD code, that has been developed to investigate the wave processes within a rotor cell, to include blade angel and cell area change effects, and exercise the code to determine optimum rotor and performance characteristics suitable for laboratory test rig. A unique concept will be difined for a cold flow laboratory test rig that features flexibililty, modularization, ability to acommodate test diagnostics, and be economical. Moreover, the design will allow for first and second stages of the expansion/compression processes to be investigated without need for high temperature combustor gases.",

It is clear that disinfection methods involving chlorine compounds result in the formation of byproducts that constitute a health risk.  The proposed work addresses the removal of the disinfection byproducts (DBPs), especially the haloacetic acids, or their humate and fulvate precursors by using an inexpensive inorganic material as a catalytic or anion exchange material, respectively.  The Phase I work demonstrated that one of the ion exchange materials can effect nearly complete removal of the precursor humic substances present in the water.  These materials can also catalyze the decomposition of the haloacetic acids at ambient conditions.  The goal of the Phase II work is to develop a viable technology for water treatment that either (1) removes the DBP precursor so that low levels of DBPs are obtained with disinfection one or (2) removes the haloacetic acids from the chlorinated water.  Sufficient data is needed to reach a go/no go decision that either process is competitive with activated carbon and membrane filtation and proceeding with either process to the pilot stage is a convincing investment.",

The combination of high performance, high firing rate (over 1000 rounds per minute per barrel), and extensive burst fire duration imposes extreme heating loads on the barrels that cannot be withstood by conventional barrel design techniques. In recent years, new materials, coating, platings, and manufacturing techniques have been developed that may be successfully applied to high-performance gun barrel design. High melting temperature yet resilient ceramics, coating and sputtering techniques for applying high temperature materials, and new metals and compound design techniques incorporating liners, etc., are conceptually promising but need to undergo design and evaluation. During the proposed program, candidate meterials and processes for advanced gun barrel design will be identified and evaluated. The Phase I effort will include interior ballistic simulations to help define the themal and pressure environment; formulation of innovative barrel design concepts that take advantage of material properties; structural design analyses to evaluate material configurations in the ballistic environment; and heat conduction simulations to evaluate thermal response and behavior under burst-fire conditions. It is anticipated that one or more advanced barrel design configurations will be shown to be feasible and suitable for experimental development and evaluation during Phase II.",

Such systems are complex and add significant weight to the seat. One of the factors driving this complexity is low (or negated static stability.

At high airspeeds a small lifting surface can generate high maneuvering forces that can further help to expand the safe egress envelope. The proposed research will determine feasiblity and produce preliminary designs for two deployable aerodynamic devices. One is a stabilizer consisting of cruciform fins on the ends of rapid-deployment booms. The device will provide increased static stability within 100 msec of first motion. The second device is a pair of small wings that deploy from the sides of the seat and provide lift for hard upward maneuvering.",

To this end, liposomal TNF will be produced in sufficient quantity to define (1) its cytotoxic activity against murine B16 melanoma cells, (2) its lethal dose in B57CI/6 mice that bear B16 melanoma implants, and (3) its in vivo effectiveness as a treatment for murine melanoma. Formulations containing murine and human TNF-alpha will be compared because cross-species variation in TNF-receptor interactions are known. Identically prepared liposomes without TNF-alpha will serve as a control.

A recently developed ZVS PWM forward converter with an active clamp combines the soft switching advantages of a resonant converter with the low voltage and current stress of a PWM converter. The converter also allows self-driven synchronous rectifiers. Obtaining the necessary power density and efficiency will also require an advanced magnetics design with possibly PCB or printed windings.

To date, there are only two FDA approved drugs which provide direct antiviral activity against this virus, and the toxicities and emerging resistance limit their widespread utility. In order for new and efficacious anti-HIV agent to enter human clinical trials, small animal models are required to demonstrate in vivo activity. Since HIV is a uniquely human virus, novel means are required to introduce this virus into rodent hosts. One such means is through the xenotransplantation of human HIV permissive cells into sublethally irradiated athymic mice. We have previously demonstrated that the CEM cell line infected with the III-B strain of the HIV can reproducibly demonstrate high levels of p24 antigenemia using this novel approach. With anticipation of expanding this model into a fully accepted and valid small animal model of HIV infection for efficacy evaluation of pharmaceutical compounds, it is the overall objective to continue to refine this model. This will be accomplished by expanding the transplantation aspect to include HIV permissive cells of various phenotypes, by expanding the HIV strains (including AZT resistant & primary) capable of replication within this system, and by introducing other well established means of measuring viral infectivity (i. e., FACS analysis). This additional information will provide a firm basis to design the experiments required for drug therapy determinations in this animal model system.",

This system will allow new IRFPA's to be used in the field almost immediately upon their release, eliminating the long delays and high costs associated with designing and building custom support systems. Surveys of DoD and civilian researchers will determine features and performance goals for the system. Surveys of IRFPA manufacturers will ensure that the system will operate with all next generation IRFPA's. Additional system objectives are compact size, moderate cost, and ease of use. The system will be configured for different IRFPA's with software, and will not require hardware or wiring changes when changing IRFPA's. Key areas of development will include high speed IRFPA drive electronics and preamplifiers, very fast high resolution multichannel data acquisition, signal processors for data reduction, and optical fiber data interfaces. Breadboard experiments will verify the technical feasbility of the performance objectives. Successful completion of this work will lead directly to the construction and evaluation of a complete system in the Phase II program.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer mortality will be drastically reduced if tumors are diagnosed and removed as early as possible before the onset of metastasis. On the basis of data from the groups working with contract-enhanced MRM, it can be expected that MRM will in the next century replace conventional mammography as the chosen procedure for breast imaging. Since the current MRM is more expensive than conventional mammography, its increased application will accelerate if a special inexpensive MRM devices appear on the market. A low cost, open air, self-shielded superconducting MRM has been designed and proposed. The MRM will enable the patient to be examined in the open air with surface coils very accessible for breast biopsy. The patient can be maneuvered around, so the magnet only needs to produce a smaller volume of high resolution magnetic field. Therefore, the overall physical size and the cost of the MRM will be significantly reduced. Since the MRM is self-shielded, the cost of any facility construction, remodeling or shielding will be eliminated. We will (1) design \"C\" shaped split gap 1.0 T self shielded superconducting MRM and (2) design a table top 0.5 T or vertical superconducting wall permanent magnets composed of high temperature superconductors. These designs will have sufficient details to allow the selection of construction of a low cost MRM in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Bubbles within a cloud can undergo collective oscillations and produce large acoustic emissions at low frequencies (20 to 2 kHz). Using the collective oscillation properties, relatively small targets can be developed for underwater acoustics research and other applications. This proposal presents three designs to produce and contain bubble clouds in a fixed geometry for the purpose of producing low-cost, high-target-strength acoustic scatterers for sonar calibration and decoy design. THe first design is a cylindrical container made of an acoutstically transparent material. A propeller will be used to disperse the bubble sinto a spatially homogeneous distribution. Compressed air or chemical foaming agents can be used as the air supply to produce microbubbles from an underwater bubbler. The second design uses agar gel to stabilize air bubbles grown from decompression of the supersaturated gel. The third design uses polymer additives to suspend and stabilize bubbles injected at the time of target production. The void fraction and bubble size can be adjusted by mass flow rate, size of aerator and degree of supersaturation, depending on the design selected. The acoustic resonance frequency can be tuned by varying the size and number of the injected bubbles (therefore, the void fraction) and the size of the containers. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: This research effort will lead to the successful development of low-cost bubble cloud targets for commercial applications in sonar calibration, undersea beaconing, environmental simulation, and designs of decoys and countermeasures. The products will benefit researchers as well as manufacturers in the field of ocean acoustics and defense industries conducting underwater acoustics research.",

        "abstract": "QUEST Integrated, Inc. (formerly Flow Research) proposes to develop and fabricate compliant coatings synthesizing dolphin skin/blubber for use on underwater vehicles to achieve drag and flow noise reduction. Guided by the theory of the hydrodynamic response of viscoelastic materials, the design of the compliant coatings will be aided by using a computer code combining finite element techniques, viscoelastic material theory, and available acoustic data from studies on live dolphins. Following the current trend of compliant coating research, we will conisder three different coatings all with a thin but strong exterior layer that serves as the protective skin for the interior layers, which have the desired viscoelastic properties but are weak in mechanical strength against wear and tear. Three types of interior layer(s) will be evaluated: an isotropic layer, multiple (progressively softer) isotropic layers, and multiple fiber-reinforced layers. These compliant coatings will be fabricated, and their viscoelastic properties will be measured at the material laboratory of the Naval Surface Weapons Center. One of the coatings will be selected to be installed on a \"self-propelled\" slender body for laboratory testing in a towing tank as a means for assessing the practicality and robustness of the coating. A novel visualization technique will be used to determine the potential of the coating for drag reduction. For measuring the flow noise, a microphone will be intalled inside the body. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: This development will improve the performance of underwater and surface vehicles, for military and civilian applications; lead to increases in the speed and range of the vehicles, enhancing their mobility and reducing their vulnerability and operational cost; and result in flow noise reduction, and thus decreased detectability. The coatings may also be applied to propellers/impellers to increase thrust output. Commercial applications include use as coatings on ship hulls and as liners in various pipelines.",

In addition, a special tool is usually required for each thread parameter to be inspected and these tools require periodic certified calibration. The following proposal addresses the need to improve the Army's quality control process by adapting field-proven, laser-based measurement technology to to the application of threaded part inspection. In Phase I a bench-top prototype unit will be designed and built that can be demonstrated on a thread form found on a critical Army ordnance system. During Phase II a full-scale thread inspection system will be developed for use b the Army in one of its ordnance manufacturing plants. The system will be capable of inspecting both external and internal threads and will be adaptable to a large number of parts.

The switchable gratings are formed using nonlinear volume phase diffraction grating composites. The resulting optical time delay networks include both addressable free space delay lines and uniform delay switching fabrics to route optical channels through desired members of an array of guided wave optical delay devices. An additional nonlinear device is added that selectively absorbs weak signals that leak through nonselected channels due to imperfect diffraction efficiency, scatter, etc. while transmitting the signal in the selected path with minimal attenuation. After refining initial device designs, a computer model of these devices is constructed using volume diffraction and nonlinear optics theory. A prototype network is designed and the model is used to demonstrate feasibility of the concept and design. Experiments are included to study improved material systems. Resulting networks are expected to possess advances in switch isolation (thus lower signal distortion) and insertion loss (yielding greater radar dynamic range).

This naturally includes computers, which are themselves used in many electrical applicances. To assure quality, circuit cards must be checked for breaks and shorts. We propose five technologies which will allow imaging of electromagnetic fields on a circuit card. These technologies exploit the following physical effects: - electrodynamic forces - electrooptical materials - magnetooptical materials - piezoelectric materials (used for heating, and for deformation) Preliminary numerical estimates for most of the technologies have been carried out. The estimate for using electrodynamic forces appears to allow direct imaging, if tested at a sufficiently low frequency.

For small rocket systems, N20 based hybrids potentially offer higher performance than liquid oxygen based hybrids for less complexity and cost. Storable and non-cryogenic, N20's advantages stem from its high (750 psia) vapor pressure at room temperature, allowing the oxidizer feed system to operate in a \"blowdown mode\". As such, a pressurization system is not required, increasing stage reliability. As a first step, this investigation is focused on acquiring the data necessary to fully quantify the behavior of N20 at a large scale. Blowdown tests will be conducted for motors in the 10,000 lb thrust class at NASA Stennis Space Center's (SSC) Component Test Facility. SSC will perform the necessary modifications to the CTF for this effort, and will assist in the testing.

The Investigator indicatesapproximately 16% of all multigravida pregnancies in the United States occur in women who are Rhnegative and 84% of the male population is Rh positive, approximately 13% of fetuses are at risk fordevelopment of a hemolytic diseases in the newborn due to Rh incompatibility. Although less than onepercent of fetuses actually develop full blown erythroblastosis fetalis, this outcome is so severe thatserial amniocentesis and percutaneous umbilical blood sampling was adopted for use in all multigravidaRh pregnancies by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. This is required becauseall women at risk, even though approximately 16% of the total women at risk are bearing Rh negativefetuses and thus are at no risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn. In order to achieve the goals ofdesired, the Investigator plans to develop a commercial diagnostic test. His Specific Aims inaccomplishing this goal are (1) to use PCR and DNA sequencing for molecular characterization of multipleRh forms obtained from clinical partners, (2) correlate the DNA sequence information with serologicaldata, (3) development of a DNA heteroduplex screen that will allow rapid identification of multiplealleles,and (4) screening, identification and clinical correlation of Rh isoforms from amniocenteses todemonstrate the utility of the test in predicting hemolytic disease in the newborn. Thus, during PhaseI of this proposal, the Investigator plans to identify the major Rh isoforms and by demonstrating thatDNA based technology can be adapted to amniotic specimens. Subsequently during Phase II, he plansto convert to laboratory procedures for Rh isoforms into a kit format that can be used by any laboratoryperforming PCR amplifications of DNA samples. He recognizes that the specific type of assay procedurefor identifying isoforms will be governed to some extent by the number of alleles that are identifiedduring phase I. If the allele number is large, heteroduplex method will be employed and converted toamplified kit formats for direct analysis on amniotic samples. He indicates that his laboratory hasdemonstrated that mutant alleles from a variety of genetic disorders can be identified in this manner andhas a patent pending on the method of using heteroduplex patterns for identification of specific alleles.He plans to include all the components in kits needed for performance of the tests. This will includesmall precast gels, all necessary primers, buffers, a inexpensive gel apparatus and a visual allele patternrecognition template. If there is a low number of alleles, they plan to adopt an allele specific oligonu-cleotide assay based on a microtiter plate format.

The receptor is expressed bysome of the activated cells such as those in certain forms of lymphoid malignancies, autoimmunediseases, and graft rejection. Taking advantage of this property of IL-2R, several IL-2R directed clinicaltrials have been reported with variable successes. For example, IL-2 combined to diphtheria toxininduced significant tumor regression in patients with hematologic malignancies. However, in the past,investigators were unable to demonstrate the relationship between the level of IL-2R expression andtumor response primarily because of the inability to accurately measure the high affinity IL-2R levels.Monoclonal anti-Tac conjugated with a pseudomonas endotoxin or fusion toxin consisting of IL-2 andPE40 also have been developed to target IL-2 expressing cells. In addition, the monoclonal antibodiesprepared against IL-2 receptor induced remission in some patients with T-cell leukemia. These studiessupport the need for development of a rapid, sensitive, specific, and uncomplicated assay to measureIL-2R levels. Based on their experience with receptor transcript phenotyping (RTP) assay forerythropoietin receptor, the Investigators now propose to develop and assay based on PCR quantitationof IL-2R subunit messenger RNAs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and sorted tumor biopsies.They will design and test PCR primers specific for IL-2Ra mRNA and determine the tissue specificity ofthe RTP assay by screening several cell lines. The quantitative aspect of the PCR will be tested first bynormalizing dilutions of samples with internal standard such as GAPDH gene. The Investigators,however, will attempt to develop absolute quantitation of IL-2a mRNA by template competition. Finally,binding assays will be performed to determine by Scatchard analysis the affinity of binding sites onselected cell lines.",

        "abstract": "Epilepsy is a debilitating disorder affecting 1 adult in 200 in the United States. Although several drugs are valuable for epilepsy therapy, their poor aqueous solubility does not permit effective formulation for intravenous administration. No IV formulation exists for carbamazepine (CBZ), a drug of choice for epilepsy therapy. Since therapeutic levels of CBZ in the brain are not reached for several hours following oral administration, other, less desirable drugs must be used when acute intervention during epileptic seizures is required. We will develop a formulation for carbamazepine suitable for intravenous administration. This will be accomplished using patented technology to convert this nearly water-insoluble drug into spherical, amorphous, uniformly-sized submicron particles suspended in a biocompatible aqueous medium. This technology has been applied successfully to other compounds to produce formulations for improved diagnostic imaging as well as for anti-cancer and antimicrobial therapy. Nanoparticle formulations have also demonstrated improved bioavailability following oral administration. Other administration routes may benefit as well. The intravenous formulation of carbamazepine will be subjected to preliminary pharmacokinetic and biodistribution evaluations to demonstrate feasibility. Phase Il objectives will focus on preclinical efficacy and toxicity studies. A Phase III partner will be sought to conduct clinical trials for NDA submissions and marketing.",

However, extensive preprocessing is required to reformulate the problem in the desired differential inclusion format, and a significant amount of storage is necessary to obtain high precision solutions.

The system when integrated into the airframe will provide real time monitoring of the health of bonding joints and critical failure locations (e.g. fasteners, bolts, composite joints, welds) on an aircraft by monitoring corrosion by-products (metal ions).

Previous research has shown that the HL method simplifies the specification of speech sounds, yet yields highly intelligible synthesis output. In addition, numerous regularities have been observed for the HL specifications of different types of speech sounds; this may raise the possibility that an efficient set of rules could be defined for synthesizing sound sequences automatically from symbolic input. The proposal seeks support for development of a subset of the rules that would be needed for a complete synthesis-by-rule system in order to evaluate the extent to which there may be increases in the efficiency of the synthesis rules and in the accuracy of the speech representation as a consequence of using HL parameters.",

Phase II will thereby demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing low cost HTS MCMs and ferrite circulates, thus leading to Phase III commercialization. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS: JVD processes for HTS MCMs and ferrites for microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) have great potential: 1) Military: active phase array radars, expendable decoys, navigation, missiles, 2) Commercial: commerciations, automobile radar and anti-collision system, local area networks, cellular radio",

THIS PROPOSAL PRESENTS A FEASIBILITY STUDY TO INVERT WIDEBAND INDUCTION EM DATA TO IMAGE SUBSURFACE FEATURES. ULIKE OTHER TECHNIQUES SUCH AS GPR, LOW FREQUENCY EM TECHNIQUES ARE SENSITIVE TO DEEPER STRUCTURES DUE TO THE GREATER SKIN DEPTH OF THE LONGER WAVELENGTH SIGNALS. THE ISSUE THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES IS TO INVERT THE EM DATA TO CONSTRUCT A TWO-DIMENSIONAL ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY VS. DEPTH MODEL. DATA COLLECTION COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED BY A SINGLE OPERATOR, WITHOUT THE INSTRUMENT TOUCHING THE GROUND, AND SIGNAL PROCESSING COULD BE COMPLETED AUTOMATICALLY IN REAL-TIME. ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY ANOMALIES, SUCH AS DUE TO FLUID-FILLED PORES OR FRACTURES, COULD THEN BE EASILY INTERPRETED IN THE FIELD.",
