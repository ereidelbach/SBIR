STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT INFLAMED SULCI ARE ACCOMPANIED BY ELEVATED TEMPERATURE INDICATIONS. CONVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS BLEEDING UPON PROBING, SUPPURATION, OR GINGIVAL REDNESS ARE HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE DIAGNOSTICS WITH RESPECT TO THE DETECTION OF ACTIVE DISEASES. THE TEMPERATURE SENSING ELEMENT OF THE PROPOSED PROBE IS IMBEDDED IN THE PROBE TIP. THE TIP SHAPE AND SIZE ARE SIMILAR TO CONVENTIONAL PERIODONTAL PROBES WITH WILLIAMS MARKINGS. THE ADVANTAGES OF SUCH A PROBE ARE (1) THE CONCURRENT MEASUREMENT OF SUCULAR TEMPERATURE AND ATTACHMENT LEVEL, (2) THE IDENTICAL PROBE INSERTION TECHNIQUE USED IN CONVENTIONAL ATTACHMENT LEVEL MEASUREMENT, AND (3) THE RAPIDITY IN ALLOWING FOR MULTIPLE-SITE EVALUATION OF DISEASE ACTIVITY. THE KEY FEATURE OF THIS PROBE WHICH ALLOWS THE FAITHFUL MEASUREMENT OF SULCULAR TEMPERATURE IS THE SPECIALLY DESIGNED LOW THERMAL MASS OF THE PROBE TIP. THIS FEATURE PROVIDES MINIMAL THERMAL PERTURBATION TO THE REGIONAL TISSUES THUS ALLOWING FOR A MEASUREMENT ACCURACY OF BETTER THAN 0.1 DEGREES C AND A RESPONSE TIME OF LESS THAN 2 SECONDS. THE PHASE I PROGRAM WHICH THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES IS CONCENTRATED TOWARDS THE FABRICATION AND IN VITRO TESTING OF SUCH A PROBE FOR ITS REPRODUCIBILITY, SENSITIVITY, AND RESPONSE TIME. PRELIMINARY IN VIVO STUDY WILL BE PERFORMED TO RELATE TEMPERATURE TO PERIODONTAL DISEASE ACTIVITY. THE PHASE II PROGRAM WILL BE ORIENTED TOWARDS THE CLINICAL VALIDATION OF SULCULAR TEMPERATURE CHANGES ACCOMPANYING DISEASE ACTIVITY.

DURING PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT, COMPLEXES WILL BE SYNTHESIZED IN WHICH THE PHTHALIC ACID LIGAND WILL BE REPLACED BY MORE WEAKLY ACIDIC LIGANDS RESULTING IN MORE STABLE PLATINUM COMPLEXES. SUCH LIGANDS WILL INCLUDE SUBSTITUTED SALICYLIC ACIDS AND CATECHOLS IN WHICH THE SUBSTITUENT GROUP WILL AID IN SOLUBILIZATION OF THE COMPLEX. THE DIAMINOCYCLOHEXANE CHELATING LIGAND WILL BE RETAINED AS IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT THIS TYPE OF CHELATE IS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE A LACK OF CISPLATIN CROSS RESISTANCE. THE LIGAND WILL BE SEPARATED THOUGH INTO ITS \"CIS\" AND \"TRANS\" ISOMERS TO DETERMINE DIFFERENTIAL EFFECT ON ACTIVITY AND/OR TOXICITY AMONG THE ISOMERS. IN ADDITION, THE ISOLATION OF ISOMERICALLY PURE COMPLEXES WILL FURTHER SIMPLIFY THE ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE AND THEREBY FACILITATE COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT. DISSOCIATIONRATES WILL BE DETERMINED USING UV AND HPLC TECHNIQUES. THOSE COMPLEXES HAVING GREATER STABILITY THAN NSC 271674 WILL BE SUBMITTED TO NCI FOR ANTITUMOR EVALUATION. THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF STABLE, SOLUBLE PLATINUM COMPLEXESWITH IMPROVED THERAPEUTIC PROPERTIES (MORE ACTIVE, LESS TOXIC) COMPARED TO CISPLATIN WOULD BE HIGHLY BENEFICIAL TO THE ONCOLOGIST AND TO CANCER PATIENTS.",

SUCH DISEASES INCLUDE THOSE IN WHICH PHAGOCYTE ACTION (INFLAMMATION) HAS OCCURRED IN CONJUNCTION WITH CONNECTIVE TISSUE TARGETS. PROMINENT AMONG THESE DISEASES ARE PULMONARY EMPHYSEMA, PNEUMONIAS, ADULT RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME, DERMATOLOGIC IN FLAMMATORY PROCESSES AND INFECTIONS, VASCULITITIS, AND AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS. WE HAVE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED A UNIQUE INHIBITOR OF HUMAN NEUTROPHIL ELASTASE IN SEVERAL BACTERIAL SPECIES. WE HAVE PERFORMED PRELIMINARY PURIFICATION AND CHARCTERIZATION OF ONE OF THESE INHIBITORS. WE MUST NOW DOCUMENT THAT THIS INHIBITOR IS CAPABLE OF PREVENTING SOME OF THE DISEASES MENTIONED, IN LABORATORY ANIMAL STUDIES AND, AT THE SAME TIME, DOCUMENT THE SAFETY OF ADMINISTRATION OF THIS INHIBITOR. AFTER THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF THIS PRODUCT IS DOCUMENTED IN ANIMAL STUDIES, APPLICATION WILL BE MADE TO BEGIN HUMAN STUDIES. DURING PHASE I, WE HOPE TO BEGIN AND COMPLETE THE SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR ANIMAL STUDIES USING RABBIT AND RAT EXPERIMENTAL MODELS OF DISEASE. PRIMARILY, WE WILL STUDY THE ABILITY OF THIS INHIBITOR TO PREVENT EXPERIMENTALLY INDUCED EMPHYSEMA AND TO MITIGATE AGAINST THE PERMEABILITY CHANGES IN ANIMAL MODELS OF THE ADULT RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME. DURING PHASE II, FURTHER ANIMAL STUDIES WILL BE ADDED AND HUMAN STUDIES WILL BEGIN. IF ALL THE POTENTIAL OF THIS PRODUCT IS REALIZED, THEN THIS MEDICATION MAY BECOME THE MAINSTAY OF THERAPY IN MANY CHRONIC AND ACUTE DISEASES THAT EFFECT TENS OF MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THIS COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD, SEVERAL OF WHICH HAVE NO EFFECTIVE THERAPY.",

IT IS COSTLY BECAUSE OF HIGH RAW MATERIAL COSTS, HIGH CRYSTAL GROWTH COSTS, AND LOW MATERIAL UTILIZATION DUE TO INEFFICIENT SLICING. THE COST CAN BE REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY BY INCREASING THE MATERIAL UTILIZATION USING A NEW WIRE SLICING TECHNIQUE--FIXED ABRASIVE SLICING TECHNIQUE (FAST). THE FEASIBILITY OF THE MULTI-WIRE FAST APPROACH HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED FOR PHOTOVOLTAIC SILICON BY REDUCING KERF LOSS, SURFACE DAMAGE AND WAFTER THICKNESS. SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIOAL SAVINGS CAN BE GENERATED, PARTICULAR FOR THE MORE COSTLY GAAS, BY IMPROVING SLICING ACCURACY. BY SLICING ACCURATELY WITH MINIMUM SURFACE DAMAGE, IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO ELIMINATE A COSTLY MATERIAL-INTENSIVE GRINDING OPERATION AND GO DIRECTLY TO POLISHING. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM FOR GAAS WILL ADDRESS THREE RELATED AREAS AFFECTING SLICE ACCURACY: WIRE GUIDE ROLLERS, BLADE COMPOSITIO AND CRITICAL CONTACT LENGTH TESTING. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE GUIDE ROLLER SYSTEM WILL BE OPTIMIZED BY USING ABRASION RESISTANT POLYURETHANE AS A ROLLER MATERIAL.

THE LONG TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS THE PERFECTION OF SIMPLE PROTOCOLS AND A KIT USING DNA HYBRIDIZATION PROBES FOR THE DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION OF PATHOGENS IN CLINICAL SPECIMENS. THE SPECIFIC AIM OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ASSESS THE FEASABILITY OF THIS APPROACH TO PATHOGEN IDENTIFICATION IN CLINICAL SPECIMENS BY: 1) DETERMINING NUMBERS AND METHODS OF RECOVERY OF PATHOGENS IN CLINICAL SPECIMENS; 2) ASSESSING THE FACILITY WITH WHICH THEY MAY BE LYSED AND THEIR DNA PREPARED FOR HYBRIDIZATION; 3) DETERMINING THE UTILITY OF PROCEDURES DEVELOPED FOR RAPID HYBRIDIZATION; AND 4) ASSESSING PROBE MODIFICATIONS TO ENHANCE DETECTABILITY. THE METHODS EMPLOYED INCLUDE CLONING AND IDENTIFICATION OF BACTERIAL DNA FRAGMENTS WITH UNIQUE BASE SEQUENCES, PROCEDURES FOR LYSIS OF BACTERIA AND RECOVERY OF DNA, PROTOCOLS FOR RAPID DNA-DNA HYBRIDIZATION, AND DETECTION OF HYBRID COMPLEXES. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF PHASE I WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT DNA HYBRIDIZATIONS PROCEDURES CAN ACCURATELY AND QUICKLY DETECT AND IDENTIFY PATHOGENS IN CLINICAL MATERIAL. WITH FEASABILITY DEMONSTRATED, PHASE II DEVELOPMENT WILL REQUIRE THE CLONING AND TESTING OF ADDITIONAL PROBES SPECIFIC FOR PATHOGENS ENCOUNTERED IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE, THE MODIFICATION AND ADAPTATION OF PROCEDURES FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF CLINICAL SPECIMENS AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE METHODS FOR DETECTION OF HYBRID COMPLEXES. THE APPLICATION OF RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNOLOGY TO DIAGNOSIS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE REPRESENTS A FUNDAMENTAL DEPARTURE FROM CURRENT MICROBIOLOGICAL IDENTIFICATION PROCEDURES AND SHOULD PROVIDE UNSURPASSED ACCURACY IN ORGANISM IDENTIFICATION.

SINCE, 1973, NUMEROUS SYSTEMS STUDIES HAVE PRODUCED CONCEPTUAL FUSION REACTOR DESIGNS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN VIEWED AS MEETING THE NEEDS OF ELECTRIC UTILITIES. THESE STUDIES HAVE FEATURED SUPERCONDUCTING CONFINEMENT TOKAMAKS AND MIRRORS BECAUSE OF THE GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR PHYSICS BASIS AND THE CONVICTION THAT SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNETS OFFERED THE ONLY HOPE FOR AN ACCEPTABLE POWER BALANCE. HOWEVER, OTHER DESIGN EFFORTS HAVE INCLUDED A VARIETY OF CONFINEMENT CONCEPTS BASED ON NORMALLY CONDUCTING MAGNETS. THESE STUDIES INDICATE THAT THIS MAGNET APPROACH CAN BE ECONOMICALLY ATTRACTIVE PROVIDING THAT HIGH GAIN IS ACHIEVED, SUBJECT TO FIRST WALL HEAT FLUX CONSTRAINTS, AND THAT NEUTRON DOSE TO THE REACTOR INTERNALS IS RECOGNIZED AS A LIMIT. THE PROPOSED WORK IS ON A TOKAMAK CONCEPT THAT HAS BEEN CONCEIVED SUBJECT TO THE ABOVE CONDITIONS. IT IS DIRECTED AT HIGH FIELD OPERATION TO COMPENSATE FOR MODEST BETA PERFORMANCE, HIGH GAIN, AND A REACTOR MAINTENANCE CONFIGURATION FOR THE CHANGEOUT OF NEUTRON DAMAGED CORES.

THE THRUST IS TO PRODUCE A SIMPLIFIED BATTERY-OPERATED EASY-TO-USE DEVICE SUITABLE FOR CLINICAL APPLICATIONS. PRESENT DEVICES ARE LINE OPERATED AND INCONVENIENT TO USE, OVER THE LONG DURATION OF THE RECOMMENDED THERAPY. THE BASIC DESIGN WILL ENCOMPASS THE TWO PROVEN MODALITIES OF EM STIMULATION I.E, THE PULSED STIMULATOR OF LOW DUTY CYCLE, AND THE LOW FREQUENCY CONTINUOUS SYSTEM. THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE \"PORTABLE\" OBJECTIVE WILL RESULT FROM PROPRIETARY ENERGY RECOVERY CIRCUITRY. ADDITIONALLY, EFFORT WILL BE DIRECTED AT EVALUATION OF A CLINICALLY EQUIVALENT ALTERNATIVE WAVESHAPE WITH LOWER POWER REQUIREMENTS. THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THIS PROGRAM WILL ALSO BE RELEVANT TO EXISTING EM STIMULATOR THERAPY WHICH HAS HERETOFORE PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH FRACTURE HEALING. PHASE 1 WILL RESTRICT ITSELF TO EVALUATION AND DESIGN OF PROTOTYPE UNITS. WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT CLINICAL PROGRESS IN THE AREA OF EM HIP THERAPY HAS BEEN HELD BACK BY THE ABSENCE OF A CONVENIENT, SIMPLE, PATIENT ORIENTED DEVICE AND THAT THE PROPOSED POEM SYSTEM WILL SATISFY THE NEEDS OF THE CLINICIAN.

ONE APPROACH INVOLVES THE USE OF AN ELECTRODE MATERIAL WITH GREATER CATALYTIC ACTIVITY FOR THE ELECTROCHEMICAL OXIDATION OF GLUCOSE, AND/OR LESSER ACTIVITY FOR THE OXIDATION OF ANY ENDOGENOUS COREACTANTS. ANOTHER INVOLVES THE USE OF AN ELECTRODE MATERIAL THAT WOULD RESPOND ONLY TO ENDOGENOUS COREACTANTS SO THAT A CORRECTION FOR THESE COREACTANTS COULD BE MADE.

EXISTING TECHNOLOGY FOR CELL WASHING IS INEFFICIENT IN THAT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FINAL WASHED PRODUCT IS OFTEN LOST IN THE PROCESS. THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE EXTENSION TO CELL WASHING OF A NEW CORE TECHNOLOGY OF BLOOD SEPARATE CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED AT HEMASCIENCE LABORATORIES, SANTA ANA, CALIFORNIA. THE BASIS OF THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY IS A REVOLUTIONARY NEW TECHNIQUE TO EXPOSE A MEMBRANE FILTER TO A FLUID CONTAINING ELEMENTS TO BE FILTERED. EXTERNAL INERTIAL FORCES ARE USED TO PREVENT FORMED ELEMENTS IN THE BLOOD FROM ADHERING TO THE MEMBRANE. THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL ALLOW REDUCTION OF THE SURFACE AREA OF THE MEMBRANE FILTER FROM 10 TO 100 TIMES THAT USED IN CURRENT BLOOD FILTRATION SYSTEMS BASED ON FLAT PLATE AND HOLLOW FIBER TECHNOLOGIES AND THEREFORE PERMIT SIGNIFICANT COST REDUCTION. THE TECHNOLOGY IS CONTINUOUS AS OPPOSED TO THE BATCH OPERATION SO IT IS INHERENT FASTER THAN EXISTING DEVICES IN ITS PROCESSING TIME AND NO WASHED PRODUCT IS LOST. WE BELIEVE THAT IMPORTANT COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY INCLUDE DEGLYCEROLIZATION OF FROZEN BLOOD, AUTOTRANSFUSION AND FRESH WASH OF BLOOD PRIOR TO TRANSFUSION.

IN PHASE I, A SYSTEMATICAL INVESTIGATION WILL BE PERFORMED OF THE NOISE GENERATED DURING THE PROCESS OF HONING CYLINDERS. THIS NOISE IS OF INTEREST BECAUSE THE EXPOSURE OF THE MACHINE OPERATORS TO THE HIGH FREQUENCY TONES EXCEEDS THE EXPOSURE ALLOWED UNDER THE OSHA NOISE REGULATIONS. FURTHER, THERE ARE NO VIABLE RETROFIT SOLUTIONS TO THIS PROBLEM WITHOUT SEVERE ECONOMIC PENALTIES. PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS PERFORMED BY HOOVER KEITH & BRUCH, INC. HAVE REVEALED THAT THE NOISE RADIATED FROM THE CYLINDER BEING HONED IS NOT DUE TO THE CYLINDER BEING EXCITED AT ITS RESONANT FREQUENCIES. THE EXTREMELY HIGH ENERGY TONAL LEVELS (SQUEALS) ARE EITHER THE RESULT OF A STICK-SLIP PHENOMENON BETWEEN THE HONES AND THE CYLINDER OR THE RESULT OF A RESONANCE OF THE SYSTEM OF THE HONES, THE HEAD HOLDING THE HONES, AND THE HYDRAULIC PRESSURE SYSTEM WHICH MAINTAINS A CONSTANT FORCE ON THE HONES. SEVERAL METHODS OF VIBRATION GENERATION ARE DISCUSSED. AT THE CONCLUSION OF PHASE I, WE WILL UNDERSTANDWHICH OF THESE GENERATION MECHANISMS IS THE CAUSE OF THE SQUEAL. THIS UNDERSTANDING IS CRITICAL IN DEVELOPING A GENERIC NOISE CONTROL SOLUTION FOR HONING AND FOR OTHER MACHINES WHICH PRODUCE SIMILAR NOISE.

THE PROPOSED METHOD OF REACTIVATING THE CONTAMINATED ACTIVATED CARBON INVOLVES, FIRST, A SIMPLE LAUNDERING PROCESS TO ELIMINATE DIRT, STAIN AND GREASE. NEXT THE GARMENT IS TREATED WITH A POWERFUL DISPLACING AGENT WHICH WILL DESORB THE HYDROCARBONS, CONTAMINANTS, AND OTHER ADSORBATES IN THE ACTIVATED CARBON. THE DISPLACING AGENT AND THE ENTRAPPED WATER VAPOR CAN THEN BE REMOVED BY LOWERING THE BOILING POINT THROUGH VACUUM EVAPORATION. THE HEAT LOSS DUE TO EVAPORATION IS REPLENISHED BY A LOW DUTY CYCLE MICROWAVE HEATING METHOD. THE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE DISPLACING AGENT CAN BE RECOVERED AND REUSED BY MEANS OF A COLD TRAP.",

THE OXYGEN PUMP IS EXTREMELY SIMPLE IN CONCEPT. EXCEPT FOR A SMALL FAN TO CIRCULATE AIR, THERE ARE NO MOVING PARTS, PROVIDING FOR QUIET OPERATION. THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR CONCENTRATING OXYGEN IS PROJECTED TO BE 4-5 TIMES MORE EFFICIENT THAN THE BEST PRESSURE SWING ABSO ABSORPTION DEVICES AND TO HAVE ADDITIONAL SIZE AND WEIGHT ADVANTAGES. MAXDEM WILL EXTEND THE SUCCESSFUL PHASE I WORK ON THE OXYGEN PUMP TO FULL SCALE LABORATORY TEST CELLS. THE PERFORMANCE WILL BE IMPROVED BY MATCHING THE PROPERTIES OF THE COMPONENT MATERIALS TO THE OBSERVED CHEMISTRY. BOTH SURFACE AND SOLUTION CHEMISTRY PLAY A ROLE IN OVERALL EFFICIENCY AND WILL BE INVESTIGATED. ENGINEERING AND CHEMICAL STUDIES WILL BE CLOSELY INTEGRATED. BASED ON THE TEST CELL RESULTS A PROTOTYPE SINGLE CELL WILL BE CONSTRUCTED AND A COMPLETE CELL STACK DESIGNED. THE ARMED FORCES UTILIZE OXYGEN GAS FOR A VARIETY OF CRITICAL NEEDS. AT PRESENT, MOST OF THE OXYGEN PURCHASED AS COMPRESSED GAS OR IN LIQUID FORM FROM COMMERCIAL SUPPLIERS. THE ASSOCIATEDTRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE REQUIREMENTS POSE SEVERE LOGISTICS PROBLEMS E.G. FOR REMOTE LOCATIONS AND FIELD HOS HOSPITALS.

        "abstract": "IN THE PROPOSED PROGRAM WE WILL DEVELOP AN INSTRUMENT FOR MEASURING SMALL AMOUNTS OF TRANSIENT BIREFRINGENCE IN MICROSCOPIC BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES, AND WILL APPLY IT TO AN EXISTING MEASUREMENT REQUIREMENT IN THE AREA OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY. THE PROPOSED LASER MICROPOLARIMETER WILL BE CAPABLE OF MEASURING SAMPLE BIREFRINGENCE WITH SENSITIVITY AT LEAST 100 TIMES GREATER THAN THAT OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TECHNIQUES, AND WITH SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTIONS OF 2 MICRONS (DIAMETER) AND 1 MSEC RESPECTIVELY. THE BASIS FOR THE MAJOR IMPROVEMENT IN INSTRUMENT SENSITIVITY IS THE APPLICATION OF A STABILIZED 2-FREQUENCY HELIUM NEON LASER WITH A HETERODYNE SIGNAL ANALYSIS SYSTEM. THIS APPROACH DIRECTLY MEASURES BIREFRINGENT-INDUCED PHASE CHANGES IN LIGHT FREQUENCY, CIRCUMVENTING THE LIMITATIONS INHERENT IN THE CONVENTIONAL TECHNIQUE WHICH RELIES UPON INTENSITY MEASUREMENTS OBTAINED THROUGH CROSSED POLARIZERS. IN PHASE I, OUR PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT WILL BE USED IN VOLTAGE-CLAMP EXPERIMENTS TO MEASURE THE INDUCED MEMBRANE BIREFRINGENCE RESPONSE OF THE SQUID AXON. RESULTS WILL BE COMPARED WITH THOSE OBTAINED BY CONVENTIONAL METHODS. SINCE TRANSIENT MEMBRANE BIREFRINGENCE CHANGES HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH NEURON ACTION POTENTIALS AND MUSCLE FIBER EXCITATION, THERE IS A COMMUNITY OF INVESTIGATORS WHO WILL BENEFIT IMMEDIATELY FROM THE PROPOSED PROJECT. BIREFRINGENCE MEASUREMENTS OFFER AN ATTRACTIVE NON-INVASIVE ALTERNATIVE TO MICROELECTRODE METHODS FOR MEMBRANE POTENTIAL STUDIES. WITH A MORE SENSITIVE AND MORE PRACTICAL TECHNIQUE FOR MINUTE POLARIZATION MEASUREMENTS, WE FORESEE MANY APPLICATIONS IN CELL BIOLOGY AND DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY.",

THE USE OF MULTIPLE RECEIVE BEAMS IN A NEAR ORTHOGONAL PLANE PROVIDES WIND INFORMATION. PARTICLE SIZE IS MEASURED AS A FUNCTION OF SCATTERED SIGNAL STRENGTH. THE STATISTICS OF THE WEATHER PARTICLES ARE DETERMINED BY AVERAGING A LARGE NUMBER OF MEASUREMENTS PROVIDED BY PMR. THE FEASIBILITY OF PMR IS BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF SOLID STATE RF DEVICES IN THE FREQUENCY RANGE OF 100 GHZ, LIGHT WEIGHT PRINTED CIRCUIT ANTENNA ARRAYS, AND SINGLE CHIP SIGNAL AND DATA PROCESSORS.

ONE APPROACH TO REDUCING SURFACE RECOMBINATION IS BY GROWTH OF AN EPITAXIAL HETEROJUNCTION \"WINDOW\" OF A HIGHER BANDGAP MATERIAL WHICH IS TRANSPARENT AND OFFERS BOTH LOW INTERFACE RECOMBINATION AND LOW RESISTANCE CONTACT. TRANSPARENCY REQUIRES A BANDGAP OF AT LEAST 3 EV, WHILE A LOW DENSITY OF INTERFACE STATES MAY BE OBTAINED BY EPITAXIAL GROWTH OF THE WINDOW LAYER.

        "abstract": "\"ELECTRONIC CELL FUSION TECHNIQUE FOR HYBRIDOMAS\" SBIR - DIV. OF RES. RESOURCES AND/OR NIAID - IMMUNOLOGY. THE PRODUCTION OF HYBRIDOMAS BY CELL FUSION IS AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF BOTH RESEARCH AND CLINICAL PROTOCOLS. ALMOST ALL FUSIONS ARE DONE WITH TECHNIQUES WHICH HAVE LOW ABSOLUTE FUSION EFFICIENCY (TYPICALLY 1 IN 10(5)), REQUIRE LARGE NUMBERS OF CELLS (TYPICALLY 10(9)) AND ARE PARTIALLY TOXIC TO THE CELLS. WE HAVE RECENTLY CONDUCTED PRELIMINARYRESEARCH ON A NEW APPROACH, THE ELECTRONIC CELL FUSION TECHNIQUE. THIS TECHNIQUE USES A MICROCHAMBER WITH ELECTRODES TO CAUSE THE CELLS TO BE HELD BY PAIRS IN CONTACTTO EACH OTHER. AN ELECTRONIC IMPULSE IS THEN USED TO PUNCTURE THE MEMBRANE AT THE POINT OF CONTACT WHICH IMMEDIATELY INDUCES THE ONSET OF FUSION. THIS METHOD HAS THE POTENTIAL TO OVERCOME ALL OF THE LIMITATIONS MENTIONED ABOVE AND MAKE POSSIBLE THE SUCCESSFUL FUSION OF A WIDE VARIETY OF CELL PARTNERS NOT PREVIOUSLY ADDRESSABLE. THE RESULTING HYBRIDOMAS WILL BE OF USE IN MANY AREAS INCLUDING HLA TYPING, ANTITOXIN PRODUCTION AND BASIC RESEARCH. BIOFUSION, INC. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL PROPOSES TO DO THE RESEARCH NECESSARY TO DEVELOP A RELIABLE AND PRACTICAL ELECTRONIC CELL FUSION APPARATUS ALONG WITH A PROTOCOL SUITABLE FOR THE GENERAL PROBLEM OF CREATING A WIDE VARIETY OF HYBRIDOMAS. IN ADDITION, AS A SPECIFIC PRACTICAL TARGET, AS WELL AS A VEHICLE FOR PROOF OF CONCEPT, WE PROPOSE TO MAKE SPECIFIC HUMAN ANTIBODIES FOR HLA TYPING. IN PHASE I WE WILL FOCUS ON RESEARCH TO DEMONSTRATE BOTH THE POTENTIAL STRENGTHS AND THE PRESENT LIMITATIONS OF THE ELECTRONIC CELL FUSION TECHNIQUE. IN PHASE II, WE WILL PERFECT THE TECHNIQUE AND STRIVE TO MAKE THE HUMAN HLA ANTIBODIES. THE POTENTIAL MARKET FOR MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES IS EXTREMELY LARGE. THE ABILITY OF THE ELECTRONIC CELL FUSION TECHNIQUE TO FUSE VERYSMALL NUMBERS OF CELLS WITH HIGH EFFICIENCY SHOULD ALLOW BIOFUSION, INC. TO PRODUCE A UNIQUE LINE OF PRODUCTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE AREAS OF HLA TYPING AND ANTITOXINS.
