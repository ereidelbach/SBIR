        "abstract": "Overhead imagery analysts employ computer-based software as Electronic Light Tables (ELTs), to perform detailed analysis of aerial images in search of elements of interest. Conventional display design for ELT software requires analysts to take their eyes away from the image they are analyzing to perform routine functions. This interaction overhead typically leads to losses in visual momentum and in situation and context awareness, and requires significant cognitive shifting, which all contribute to degraded performance.  To overcome these challenges, an immersive and context-based method of interacting with overhead imagery software to support and improve visual search is needed. Aptima proposes to develop IMAGINE (Imagery Management through Agile, Geo-Interactive, Natural Embodiment), a tool and framework for interacting with imagery that leverages direct, embodied control beyond typical input devices. IMAGINE will be a multi-modal, naturalistic, and flexible environment that layers on top of existing software and that includes  Control devices to supplement conventional mouse/keyboard input systems;  A context-driven command and visualization model that will interact with imagery software to interpret the analysts input based on current task and interaction environment;   Output displays such as large screens or mobile device interfaces to complement and augment the computer screen-based visualization of imagery and its manipulation.",

Techulon has developed a Rapidly Adaptable NanoTherapeutic (RANT) approach to address this problem, which utilizes genomic targeting, on-demand synthesis, and nanotherapeutic delivery.  Component feasibility studies conducted during Phase I demonstrated successful targeting and inhibition levels in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a pervasive infectious bacteria acquired in hospitals and problematic for military wound healing. The Phase II work is designed to demonstrate in vivo validation of Techulons nanotherapeutic platform by establishing safety parameters and demonstrating efficacy in murine-infection models. Optimizing the response time of RANT is emphasized in the study plan. The research objectives for Phase II include system integration of proven components and developing agents against other pernicious infections in military hospitals, including Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to demonstrate the platform flexibility.  Regulatory approval strategy is being developed and deployable-GMP production requirements will be established.  Commercialization opportunities have been identified and the company has secured funds to address transition of the technology to broad military applications such as wound healing and burn trauma. The platform is also applicable to homeland defense applications such as unknown bio-terror threats. Commercial opportunities include clinical applications for hospital infections.",

Our solution is dependant on a digital Bill of Materials (BOM) which we also provide a tool for importing and loading the cleansed parts structure from the data cleansing teams. Our solution was able to predict part failure rates at 70% during testing scenarios; we believe with additional funding this number will greatly increase.  BENEFIT:  The proposed solution would provide the United States Air Force a thin client solution for loading cleansed part data into a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) application, examine every part for historical and probable failures, then exporting this data for review.

Existing first-shot detection systems based on acoustic sensing may lose effectiveness because of reverberation and multipath propagation, multiple threat scenarios, and high levels of acoustic noise. Gun-fired bullets and projectiles passing through open-air regions carry electric charges which can be sensed by an electric field (E-field) sensor to determine the direction of travel. QUASAR Federal Systems (QFS) has demonstrated a new class of E-field sensor with significantly reduced size and adequate sensitivity for detection of gun-fired bullets. In this Phase II SBIR project, QFS proposes to develop and test an E-field Gunshot Detection System prototype optimized for mounting on the OGPK, but with the potential to be extended to dismounted and human-wearable applications. The technical feasibility (sensor and detection algorithm) of this project was established in Phase I. In Phase II, we will develop an integrated scientific prototype, mount it on an OGPK, and demonstrate its performance through gunshot tests in real-time.",

Since impact induced damage is not readily visible in many instances, quantification of residual stiffness and strength under different service conditions following impact is critical for ensuring structural safety until the component or the structure is inspected or repaired during a scheduled maintenance. The ultimate objective of this project is to develop and commercialize a validated, predictive capability for predicting impact damage initiation and growth as well as post-impact determination of residual strength of composite structures used in defense applications. The predictive tool based on peridynamic theory will quantify residual strength and failure modes under general loading conditions, especially compression after impact. This tool will also enable the designers to consider various laminate lay-ups without significant amount of material testing and characterization; thus, reduction in cost and design cycle time in order to use high performance material systems.",

        "abstract": "In this abstract the development of vertical power transistors utilizing bulk GaN substrates with breakdown voltages of 1200V or higher, normally-off operation, and a drain current rating of 100A is proposed. These devices will feature vertical current flow, avalanche ruggedness, and a wide operating temperature range (-55 to 150\u00b0C). The target specific on-resistance for the transistor is 30x lower than the best-in-class Si MOSFETs and its switching frequency more than 10x faster than state-of-the art IGBTs. Cost parity with silicon devices will be achieved in three years using a two prong approach. Firstly, the bulk GaN substrate price will be reduced by: (i) using a scalable ammonothermal substrate technology, (ii) enabling commercially available substrates obtained from the epitaxial lift-off process, and (iii) driving the price of GaN substrates down along with the solid-state LED lighting industry. Secondly, manufacturing cost will be reduced by predominantly using legacy silicon fabrication equipment in the Avogy facility in San Jose, CA. The transistor and technology performance metrics will be verified by an independent testing facility. Also, in this proposal gate drivers will be developed for these vertical transistors to replace existing MOSFETs and IGBTs. Finally, commercialization partners will evaluate devices and gate drives in power conversion applications.",

The Phase I program demonstrated feasibility of the concept and further support for a Phase II effort was recommended.  The Phase II program is focused on development of the following key areas:  increase the solid waste capacity to 50 lbs/hr, integration of the sub-system components for continuous operation, integrate heat capture from the gasifier and engine to reduce parasitic losses, develop a fully automatic control process, and design, fabricate and test a full scale prototype in the laboratory and at an Army base.

However, IR sensors pose significant challenges, requiring coordination of two sensors to produce 3D tracks, special techniques to deal with merged measurements, and efficient control of mechanical steering.  In this Phase II effort, we propose to develop a complete sensor resource management (SRM) solution for IR assets composed of two main parts.  A local-level SRM located in a ground station coordinates the low-level activities of IR sensors and generates fused tracks.  A network-level SRM in the C2BMC performs high-level coordination of radar and IR assets to maximize engagement success in raid scenarios.  The solution leverages previous work by Numerica on IR tracking, IR SRM, and C2BMC SRM and battle management, producing an integrated prototype in the BMD Benchmark that enables a mission-level assessment of the benefit IR sensors bring to the BMDS.",

This technique represents a major improvement over existing state of the art by eliminating the need for multiple light activated custom solid state switches and the associated laser trigger generator. The key item, an ultra-fast spark switch must be designed to have the same wave impedance as the transmission line segments that constitute the frozen wave ensemble. Switches with the appropriate turn on characteristics have been demonstrated where switch compactness and wave impedance were not factors. The ability to match the impedance in compact frozen wave geometry will be a major focus of the project. Using a frozen wave generator as the RF converter, in this single switch geometry, allows most of the space in a warhead application to be devoted to energy source for radiation and antenna system rather than for a massive laser and optical power train necessary for precision triggering of the solid state switch elements. The final deliverable for this program will be a TRL-6 prototype RF source with all necessary support equipment to function for a static test.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned vehicles are becoming an increasingly valuable tool within the Department of Defense, and related technologies are beginning to appear in commercial systems. As their utilization grows, these unmanned systems will become a significant target for cyber attack. Indeed, existing Defense Department unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have already been subjected to attack by various adversaries.    One of the primary reasons that our cyber adversaries have had such success is due to the use of deception in their operations.  For instance, among APT adversaries, their standard means of gaining an initial foothold is through social engineering: a target is fooled into giving away personal information that the adversary exploits to gain access to a target resource.  Deception plays a role in virtually any cyberattack simply for the reason that it works, and the historical evidence bears this out.  The very effectiveness of deception suggests that it should be considered as a means to fight back against cyber adversaries.     Our response to the challenge of applying deception to the domain of cyberattacks on UAVs is the creation of a platform called ADIDRUS --&#039;Adversarial Dectection, Inference, and Deceptive Response for Unmanned Systems&#039;.  ADIDRUS is designed to be a platform-agnostic, software-based solution that incorporates all three of the tactics above into a system that hardens UAVs against attacks through the use of adversarial reasoning models and deceptive tactics turned against the adversary.",

The Phase II program is built upon previous work conducted by SI2 during a Phase I effort to develop a metaferrite antenna for MUOS SATCOM frequencies. The advantages of SI2s antenna solution include: low profile, high efficiency and bandwidth extension to cover Legacy UHF SATCOM.  In Phase II, this antenna concept will be refined through modeling and hardware. A custom feed network will be design for low profile integration direction into the antenna cavity. The performance of the antenna system will be optimized and validated through the manufacture and testing of hardware demonstrators. A flight test prototype will be fabricated to support a test on a representative aircraft with a SATCOM radio, resulting in TRL 7 for the antenna system.",

In addition, modifications to seal installation practices are also being implemented such that improper seal component misalignment propensity is reduced and debris generation and subsequent seal contamination is lessened.  These material improvements and installation modifications will lead to higher durability and lower failure rate at improved performance.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  SSCI proposes creation of an Intelligent Course of Action Learning System (iCOALS), building on extensive past experience in learning advanced fighter combat maneuvers from simulation. By learning from repeated simulations, robust strategies can be constructed that allocate a complete action repertoire (including the mission-specific, limited range of weapons, countermeasures, associated maneuvers, etc.) to multiple autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles in mission scenarios. By utilizing SSCIs unique genetics-based rule learning (GBRL) techniques, these strategies take the form of rule sets, which can then be used for real-time reaction to evolving threats during mission execution. By evolving against a range of simulated mission conditions, the resulting rule sets will be robust against a corresponding range of IADS behaviors. This robustness can be further advanced by two-sided learning in the simulation, where the IADS also evolves strategy rule sets. iCOALS will encode strategies as rule sets that are highly human-readable. This will enhance the ability for human intervention in a semi-autonomous execution mode. The proposed Phase II will refine the vehicles models used in iCOALS, conduct additional experimentation and testing on new mission scenarios, and deliver a framework ready for integration with sponsor-provided simulation resources and other mission and simulation systems.  BENEFIT:  iCOALS is being designed as a modular system, which can find application in deriving reactive behaviors for a range of multi-vehicle mission systems. Such behaviors are essential if autonomous and semi-autonomous systems are to be deployed in any military or commercial domain that is potentially lethal, dangerous, or inconvenient for onboard human operators. As such, this is a critical element of SSCIs autonomous systems focus, which is being deployed in marine, air, and ground-based autonomous systems.",

Simple fabrication and assembly methods enable these heat exchangers to be built at low cost.  Our fabrication approach enables the recuperator to conform with available space around the engine, which shrinks the overall envelope.  In Phase I we proved the feasibility of our approach through fabrication trials, proof-of-concept experiments with sample recuperator cores, design of a prototype core, and assessment of benefits compared with conventional technology.  In Phase II, we will scale up fabrication methods, demonstrate thermomechanical and thermal performance, and design and produce a full-size prototype.

Development of air to air targeting algorithms for a stabilized turreted gun systems has not kept pace with technology and improvements are needed to be effective against aerial systems. Military helicopters use machine guns as offensive and defensive weapons against air and ground targets. However, they have challenges in targeting airborne targets where the target is moving rapidly in three directions. Targeting errors have many sources such as tracking errors, winds, turret pointing errors.  New air to air targeting algorithm approaches need to account for errors such as these to increase the accuracy.

Image processing is typically performed using the Kalman filter or some variant thereof, despite the fact that these filters have known shortcomings.  In general, they are ill suited for nonlinearly moving targets which is exactly what would be observed in a jittering image stream.  Recent development of an enhanced image processor based on the Particle Filter Algorithm (PFA) is attractive because, among other advantages, PFAs inherently handle target nonlinearities.  The enhanced PFA has been designed to improve speed, compensate jitter and reduce detectable target SNR through the incorporation of a number of preprocessing components.   Polaris Sensor Technologies proposes to further advance this PFA through the development of additional preprocessing components designed to better exploit the image information.

In Phase I, POC developed the formulation and demonstrated its efficacy to accelerate wound healing and extend skin graft survival in pilot animal studies. In Phase II, further therapeutic evaluation and elucidation of the mechanism of TOSTTs action on extended skin graft survival in in vivo murine and porcine models as well as an in vitro human skin model will be performed.",

        "abstract": "Linearizer Technology Inc. produces analog predistortion linearizers.  Integrated with a power amplifier (PA) and used for SATCOM applications they approach the performance of an ideal amplifier.   Limitations of LTIs linearizers are the need for meticulous tuning to achieve the desired characteristics over frequency, and the need for adjustment to match a PAs specific characteristics.   LTI has developed an adaptive analog predistorton linearizer (AAPDL) for Ku-band (13.75 to 14.5 GHz)  not limited to a satellite channel (36 MHz) that operates with multicarrier signals and all forms of modulation across a 750 MHz bandwidth.    LTI proposes to extend its AAPDL technology to Ka- and Q-band.  In Phase I, it produced a prototype Ka-band AAPDL covering 27.5 to 31 GHz and the preliminary design for a Q-band version.  The Ka-band linearizer is capable of multicarrier operation over its full instantaneous bandwidth.  When mated with a PA, it should provide an AM/PM of less than 1 /dB, and an adjacent channel power ratio nears that of an ideal amplifier up to saturation across its operating band.  The proposed Phase II effort will develop a AAPDLs for Ka and Q-bands ready for manufacture and demonstrate their operation with commercial PAs.",

        "abstract": "This proposed Phase II effort is a continuation of the SBIR Phase I contract (W31P4Q-13-0014) which identified several potential areas of improvement in signal processing for semi-active laser seekers in noisy, dirty-battlefield or countermeasure environments.  A list of innovative processing algorithms to address these issues was down-selected to the four highest pay-off innovations:  Smart Tracking, Smart Scanning, Clock Synchronization and Multi-Gate Processing.  Each offers a substantial performance boost in one or more of the following areas: dealing with atmospheric backscatter and battlefield obscurants, electro-optical countermeasure rejection, enhanced seeker sensitivity, clutter rejection and improved target acquisition.  Each innovation appears to be technically feasible and practical for use.    Semi-Active Laser Guidance has been a preferred air-to-ground guidance mechanism of all four US services for decades with notable improvements in hardware capabilities but no matching updates in many of the key signal processing algorithms.  To maintain technical superiority over our adversaries, antiquated processing techniques must be modernized.  GRA proposes that these innovations be fully developed with the expectation of near-term use in at least the widely-used HELLFIRE-R system.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  It is proposed to build the breadboard functional proof unit of a new space borne instrument DPTIS (Double-Probe & Topside Ionosphere Sounder) that simultaneously measures in situ electric fields and the vertical electron density profiles from the spacecraft altitude to the F2 layer peak. The instrument is designed for a small satellite and integrates an RF Topside-Ionosphere-Sounder (TIS) with Double-Probe (DP) electric field sensors. Availability of six booms, configured into three orthogonal dipoles and 3 isolated double probes, is assumed.   The TIS scans from 0.1 - 30MHz and specifies the wave polarization (O/X) and the echo angles-of-arrival for ionospheric skymap construction. Heritage from IMAGER/RPI and Digisondes is used, providing high programming flexibility that can adapt to diverse spacecraft orbits. Ionogram cadences of 10s provide high spatial resolution. Heritage autoscaling software derives real-time electron density profiles from the spacecraft altitude to the F2 peak.  For the double-probe measurements, isolated spheres are mounted at the end of six antenna booms. The DPs will measure the 3 electric field components from DC to 1 KHz. DP voltages are continuously sampled at 2.5kS/s.  DP design and processing is based on heritage instrumentation that UNH developed and delivered for the MMS and other missions.    BENEFIT:  Unambiguous measurement of the topside electron density profiles will provide unique data for the specification of the topside electron density distribution, which is otherwise only provided by incoherent scatter radars at a few points and at limited times.  Assimilation of these data into an ionospheric model like IRI RTAM or GAIM will for the first time provide an accurate real-time assimilative model for the ionospheric electron density specification up to the spacecraft altitude (~1000 km). A fleet of topside satellites with DPTIS can provide near real-time high resolution maps of foF2 and hmF2 over the oceans and land, complementing the ground-based ionosonde measurements, as well as global near real time specifications of the topside electron density profiles which are affecting all transionospheric radio signals, including GPS.   Ionospheric research missions in the F layer, both above or below the F2 peak, for detailed studies of equatorial spread F and scintillations, or auroral and polar cap irregularity structures can easily be carried out with DPITS because of its flexible programmability.",

        "abstract": "We propose to develop a new and innovative capability to model complex target plumes by upgrading the SOCRATES-P direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) high altitude plume signature code. This capability will enable SOCRATES-P to simulate 3D plume flowfields in a unified manner, from inside the nozzle to the far field, and include plume-plume, plume-body, angle-of-attack, and other complex target effects. This new capability is based on an advanced and highly accurate CFD/DSMC hybrid numerical method, called low-diffusion DSMC (LD-DSMC), which allows strong coupling between high-density continuum regions and more rarefied regions of the plume flowfield for both steady-state and time-dependent flows. Non-thermal equilibrium (NLTE) chemistry and radiation effects, important for accurate rendering of radiation signatures, will be treated in a consistent and accurate manner throughout the flowfield by an innovative extension of LD-DSMC proposed here. Several computational speed-up procedures are also proposed, which do not compromise model fidelity. Because SOCRATES-P is 3D, parallel, and the DoD standard code for high altitude plume signatures through rendering by its own post-processor and through FLITES, the results of the proposed effort will be immediately useful to the BMDS community.",

        "abstract": "The innovation presented in this proposal is a new paradigm for capturing critical quality information at the point-of-care using advanced technologies in an intuitive workflow. Healthcare quality and cost represent top national priorities. An increasingly common strategy to improve outcomes and value of care is performance assessment to promote best practices. Over decades, the most successful quality improvement (QI) programs have been heavily data-reliant. These programs require identifying patients that fit specific quality measures and assuring their care meets national guidelines. Linking patients to quality measures is the rate limiting step, involving an overwhelming amount of manual labor to review narrative notes one at a time and link them to an appropriate subset of hundreds of known quality measures. Leveraging a robust platform proven in Phase I, the proposed Phase II solution offers an automated approach to capturing a set of quality measures in real-time. The output will provide rich and compliant documentation enhanced with quality measures that feed the electronic health record (EHR) and downstream clinical, operational, and financial hospital systems through standard protocols. The goal is a disruptive change that will fast-track national initiatives and enable a safer and more efficient healthcare system. The broader/commercial impact of this program is to further national healthcare goals of reducing cost and improving quality in care. The approach leverages increased breadth, depth, and accuracy of patient data captured at the point of care. The most aggressive national initiatives encourage capturing a small portion of the hundreds of known quality measures. Accelerating capture and use of quality measures is an opportunity to meaningfully improve a healthcare system that lags in quality and cost. Impact must also be considered at a personal level. There is a cost to care within a system where quality is not documented and tracked. A typical example out of the hundreds of defined measures is ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). Multiple studies on manual programs to document VAP and leverage care algorithms demonstrate greater than 40% reduction in mortality and 20% reduction in cost. VAP, though common, did not make the top 15 list of measures required by the government in 2014 because it is too difficult to capture. There is currently no automated approach to capture this quality measure. Addressing technical limitations in documenting quality measures will expand QI reach and save lives.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop targeted nanoparticle delivery systems capable of delivering conventional cytotoxics preferentially to tumor cells. While therapeutic nanoparticles have been introduced into clinical practice (Abraxane(TM) and Doxil(TM)) and others are in development, none have been developed that show tumor target specificity (as opposed to increased affinity) or deliver multiple therapeutic agents (whether conventional cytotoxic or targeted agents). The hypothesizias underlying this project is that targeted delivery of cancer therapy via highly modular and synthetically robust nanoparticles can improve therapeutic response while minimizing systemic toxic effects of therapy for virtually any cancer. In the Phase I study, the innovation of this approach was demonstrated by dramatically reducing the tumor burden in a transgenic mouse model of adult leukemia with our proprietary nanoparticle agents. The technical objectives in this Phase II proposal are designed to refine and optimize the nanoparticle formulation to treat adult leukemia. This Phase II proposal will enable the completion a critical phase of the preclinical studies for the nanoparticle delivery vehicle to anticipate applying for IND status for this new drug with the FDA. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project offers a great opportunity to add value to nanomaterials. The broader market for nanotech-enabled drug-delivery therapeutics was just over $1 billion in 2010 and is projected to mushroom to $136 billion by the year 2021, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) estimated at 49.96% over the same period. Within the U.S. alone, there are an estimated 274,930 people living with leukemia. In 2011, it is estimated that 44,600 people (25,320 men and 19,280 women) were diagnosed with leukemia, including 10 times as many adults as children and adolescents. Also in 2011, 21,780 of those already afflicted with leukemia were expected to die from the disease. The American Cancer Society projects even higher figures for 2012, estimating that 47,150 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with leukemia and that approximately 23,540 patients will die from it. The nanoparticle delivery system proposed here is well positioned to advance the drug delivery field on a scientific level by demonstrating efficient delivery of therapeutics to leukemia cells. Combined with effective tumor delivery this technology could facilitate highly effective, ?personalized? cancer therapy that is not currently possible with routine systemic therapy.",

The prototype will be designed for use by a professional health care provider, such as a physical therapist. The system will be validated in a university lab by testing against advanced costly gait analysis systems, and against itself to ensure consistency, and an application for assessing Fall Risk in the elderly will be developed as the first outcome of the project. The potential of this system is to significantly improve, at a very low cost, the analysis and monitoring of mobility issues due to age, injury, disease, disability, inactivity or obesity. The results will be compared with norms and archived, allowing subjects to see their progress or regress. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to address a needed gap in the field of mobility assessment. With the advent of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the healthcare industry is motivated to move in the direction of preventive care. Private insurance companies and Medicare are encouraging and funding programs designed to maintain wellness, and methods to keep people healthier and independent longer. A quantitative Fall Risk Assessment will be of enormous value. An important aspect of a fall assessment is mobility issues related to gait and balance. Falls are the leading cause of injury death for older Americans ? they not only jeopardize the safety and independence of the older population, but generate tremendous economic costs. Current yearly costs is over $30 billion and expected to be over $250 billion by 2040.",

The SAWN ion source developed during phase I resulted in a device that has competitive performance between the two most popular ionization techniques for MS: electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix--?]assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI). SAWN offers the convenience of ionization from a planar surface like MALDI, but the performance characteristics of ESI at atmospheric pressure (Heron et al. Anal. Chem. 2010). However, at the end of phase I SAWN remains low throughput and at an early developmental stage technologically. The phase II proposal will refine SAWN performance by coupling it to a novel MS interface that efficiently samples solvated analytes produced by SAWN making it immediately available on all major manufacturer?fs instruments. Phase II will result in an 1) optimized piezoelectric wafer by investigating options other than lithium niobate; 2) automated, robotic, HTP--?]SAWN that will double the throughput of an existing ESI--?]based assay; and 3) a more economical to manufacture and efficient to operate concentric ring interdigitated transducer electrode design developed in phase I. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will provide a high--?]throughput --?] surface acoustic wave nebulization (HTP--?]SAWN) ion source for mass spectrometry that offers ease of use; lower ion energetics and the capability to instantaneously monitor chemical reactions.

In addition to HTP--?]SAWN, phase II will result in SAWN being compatible with all major manufacturer?fs instruments. SAWN will also be combined with direct analysis in real time (DART) to expand the capability of SAWN and DART; e.g. the combination will provide secondary ionization of compounds in emulsions desorbed from the SAWN chip into the DART stream. Additionally, dried blood spot analysis by HTP--?]SAWN will be developed using a newborn error assay for lysosomal storage disorders as an example. This assay will be used to demonstrate the potential of SAWN for immediate analysis of reaction products.

We anticipate the results of the project to expand the scope of, and transform, high efficiency thermoelectric refrigeration and waste-heat harvesting technologies. In particular, this project aims to transmute our synthesis approach to a manufacturing technology that consistently yields ton-scale nanothermoelectrics with ZT&gt;1. The objectives are to 1) Complete the design of, and implement a microwave manufacturing platform with a 10 tons/year capacity, 2) Develop protocols for industrial-scale wafer production from the nanomaterials for device fabrication, and 3) Devise methods to further increase ZT through process optimization. The knowhow generated from the demonstration of kilogram-scale production shown in Phase I provides the foundation for the Phase II effort. We will focus on the widely used bismuth and antimony tellurides, and their alloys. We will strive to maximize process flexibility to facilitate greater ZT gains through process optimization and to facilitate the adaptation of our process technology to other thermoelectric nanomaterials for refrigeration and waste-heat harvesting. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to unlock and access the multi-billion dollar potential of thermoelectrics for transforming solid-state cooling. Thermoelectric materials already support a ~$1B/year industry, but has promise to be multi-fold higher if the conversion efficiency is increased just two-fold by using nanomaterials. The project will scale-up a nanomaterials manufacturing technology targeted to create new high efficiency solid-state cooling devices that can replace the current refrigeration and air-conditioning technologies based on environmentally unfriendly gases, and create high-efficiency electricity generators from waste heat, significantly expanding the thermoelectric markets and impacting global energy usage and addressing global environmental concerns. The work performed in the project will result in low-cost high-value thermoelectric nanomaterials manufacturing to replace extant energy-intensive methods that cannot cost-effectively produce high-efficiency materials. This will lead to introduction of a new class of nanomaterials with superior properties than that available currently in the marketplace. The work will expand the scope of thermoelectric device applications, paving the way for power generation technologies through implementation of our manufacturing method for other materials systems. The project is anticipated to create 10-25 jobs in 3-5 years besides making New York State a global player in thermoelectrics innovation and nanomaterials manufacturing.",

The goal is to extend the successful Phase I measurements of 104 cfu/g Salmonella typhimurium in spinach within 2 hours to 10-100 cfu/g S. typhimurium on equipment and in cheese, Listeria monocytogenes in cantaloupe, Escherichia coli O157:H7 in ground beef, and Campylobacter jejuni in poultry. Foodborne diseases affect as many as 50 million people in the United States each year, resulting in 130,000 hospitalizations and over 3,000 deaths. Unfortunately, current methods used to detect these pathogens rely on lengthy growth enrichment steps that take 1 - 4 days, negating effective prevention of contaminated food distribution and consumption. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be the development of a platform technology to detect pathogens on food handling equipment or in food in 1 - 2 hours. This will benefit the food industry by increasing productivity, minimizing withdrawals and recalls, and most importantly, minimizing illness outbreaks and potentially saving lives. The small footprint of the analyzer will allow measurements in process plants and supporting labs, and eventually, at food sources, ports, and inspection stations. It can also speed the process of identifying the source of an outbreak, helping minimize illnesses and deaths. The knowledge gained by developing the proposed sampling system will allow developing similar systems that can monitor pathogens in water supplies, detect bioagents in air, and infectious pathogens in hospital patients (e.g. detection of Staphylococcus aureus, human immunodeficiency virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis).",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aiming to develop and validate a point-of-care monitoring for tacrolimus, an immunosuppressive medication widely used by organ transplant patients. The product being developed combines the existing, well-developed and low cost glucose meter technology with the gold standard immunoassay platform, leading to a product that can potentially improve the treatment outcome of transplant patients. Currently, monitoring of tacrolimus level is achieved by using laboratory assays, which has a long turn-around time and frequent monitoring is more difficult. However, tacrolimus is a drug whose toxic level is only couple times higher than its therapeutic level, and current infrequent monitoring approach is less effective to ensure the most effective drug levels in patients. The Phase II project will be achieved by first optimizing the glucose meter based tacrolimus assay developed in Phase I, following by the development and validation a disposable device which will house the assay and a glucose monitor which has an improved sensitivity. We anticipated the system composed of a disposable and a reader will be developed and validated at the end of the Phase II project, preparing the technology for clinical validation. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in the future development of the technology that will expand the potential test targets beyond tacrolimus. Numerous drugs currently on the market have a narrow therapeutic range, as well as many effective drugs that cannot be marketed due to lack of close monitoring methods to reduce their toxic effects. The innovative therapeutic drug monitoring device we are developing will allow many of these drugs become more available. For our current target market, with hundreds of thousands of transplant patients using tacrolimus worldwide for the remainder of their lives, the commercial potential for our product is immense. The social impact is considerable, and for just kidney transplants, 29% of the allografts will fail in the next five years due to improperly managed immunosuppressant medications costing hundreds of millions of dollars for post failure treatment and dialysis. Providing patients with a convenient tool to manage their medication can significantly reduce the number of failed kidneys, leading to better life to the patient and huge savings for the society.",

The effort will build upon Phase I achievements, which included a successful feasibility demonstration of a fractional proof-of-concept prototype and development and validation of a computer model, thereby proving the viability of this new system technology platform. The technology enables efficient performance within a very compact and cost-effective form that also can easily scale in capacity. The Phase II effort will involve improving subsystems and designing, modeling, fabricating, and testing a full TEG system for a passenger car application. Furthermore, scalability will be explored by applying the TEG to a larger vehicle platform. the broader/commercial impact of this project lie in the fact that industry has found it very challenging to develop a TEG system design that meets market metrics of performance, reliability, compactness, and low-cost, particularly for automotive applications. The proposed TEG system architecture, which includes a novel exhaust gas heat exchanger uniquely integrated into the remaining system, shows strong potential for meeting such metrics, and thereby achieving significant reduction in vehicle fuel consumption and emissions. By penetrating the large passenger vehicle market, initial market introduction could easily range in the 100,000s and much more if the cost of the product is extremely low. Broader opportunities to recover exhaust waste heat for transportation include medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, which may also be addressed by this scalable technology. Other adjacent markets include stationary and mobile generator sets, solid-oxide fuel cells, and potentially, aircraft propulsion systems.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  there is a clear need for a radically new interconnect architecture that minimizes the routing delay through the backplane to enable increased performance, reduced costs, and faster time to market.  To this end, we propose the development of a space compatible optically interconnected backplane with reconfigurable routing fabric.  By removing the electrical interconnections between logic blocks, data can be quickly and efficiently routed across the backplane. Such a novel design will remove the routing bottleneck associated with existing architectures and enable the rapid development of high data rate optical backplane for space communication systems.  The use of a wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM)-based optical backplane communication system allows for better utilization of the spectral bandwidth resources available to the system. Along these lines, WDM systems have been proposed using many kinds of technology such as: planar light-wave-circuit (PLC)-based array waveguide gratings (AWG) and fiber gratings. However, such technologies typically have sizes on the order of centimeters, in order to support a large number of sufficiently spaced wavelength channels. Alternatively, a radical new WDM architecture that is Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) compatible with miniaturized commercial applications, avionic applications, and satellite and place platforms is urgently needed.    BENEFIT:  The ability to integrate photonic functions into a chip to reduce overall chip size will enable the development of next generation photonic integrated circuits and will advance research in various DoD areas including; physics, materials, devices and photonic integrated circuits, processing and chip architecture  particularly for Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR), National Missile defense (NMD) and communication mission areas.  Realization of a reconfigurable optically interconnected chip would meet the requirements for the majority of the DoD programs; including all optical switching on a chip, multistage tunable wavelength converters and multiplexers, all optical push-pull converters, compact beamsteering, very fine pointing, tracking, and stabilization control; and ultra-lightweight antennas and eventually pave the path towards an optically interconnected routing chip.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  As integrated circuits technologies scale down to deep nanometer regime, conventional transistors and interconnect are approaching their fundamental physical and material limits. One of the potential directions for the next generation nanoelectronic applications is the adoption of graphene based circuit elements. In the past few years there has been a surge of interest for the two versions of graphene technology  carbon nanotube (CNT) and graphene nanoribbon (GNR), for their large mean free path, excellent electrical, thermal and mechanical properties, ballistic transport, higher current density, and resistance to reliability problem like electromigration that plague metal interconnect technology. Potentially more controllable and easier synthesis and fabrication process make GNR more preferable than CNT. In this project we will model the electrical properties and material characteristics of GNR to develop efficient design methodologies and computer aided design (CAD) tools. We will specifically focus on multi layer graphene nanoribbon (MLGNR) interconnects. The electrostatic and electromagnetic interaction of layers within MLGNR will be investigated. We will develop prototypes of contacted graphene transistor and MLGNR interconnects and conduct a series of experiments as well as radiation-hardness studies to establish the feasibility of using GNR transistor and interconnects in nanoscale integrated circuits.  The results would be used for a comparative analysis of GNR devices with CNT and conventional circuit elements. Northwestern University, University of Missouri Kansas City, and the Michigan Molecular Institute will serve as subcontractors.  BENEFIT:  Graphene is believed to be the strongest (100 times stronger than steel) yet thinnest possible material with exceptional electrical and thermal conductivities. The most promising use of graphene would be to develop ultra-low-power, lightweight, high-density and radiation hardened nanoelectronic circuits for military and space applications. There are other enticing possibilities. Graphene powder, for its very large surface-to-volume ratio and high conductivity, can lead to improvements in electrical battery efficiency. Graphene based sensors would lead to new bolometers that may be used by military in night vision goggles or for thermal body imaging and may eventually be incorporated into smart phones. A new class of graphene based electrochemical super-capacitors are being investigated for applications requiring high power density such as electric vehicles, utility load-leveling, heavy-load starting assists for diesel locomotives, military and medical applications, and also low power applications such as camera-flash equipment, MP3 players, pulsed-light generators, and as back-up power for computer memory. Graphene is also being considered for flexible displays and carbon-based solar cells. Therefore, many researchers are anticipating that break through in graphene technology would solve global challenges in health, security and sustainability.",

The proposed development will focus on the following main technology areas: 1) Rad-hard, inherently scalable, bidirectional power electronics for interfacing with spacecraft distribution bus -- APEI&quot;s patent pending inherently power sharing topology will be incorporated into a suitable switching converter to interface the battery to the spacecraft distribution bus. This technology will yield inherently scalable modules at the topological level. Overall design will utilize newly emerging rad-hard GaN FETs&quot;high efficiency, high switching frequency capabilities to yield unprecedented high power density. 2) Advanced cell level balancing and monitoring circuits --APEI will develop high maturity prototype of the novel cell balancing approach based on selective cell charging through charge energy frequency spreading, and 3) Compact, structural, thermal, and electrical interface for use over a wide range of satellite programsThe objective is simplification in order to develop an elegant, standardized, and readily scalable core intelligent battery module&quot;building block&quot;which provides structural support, efficient heat removal, and straightforward electrical interconnection.  BENEFIT:  APEI&quot;s converter technology stands out from other modular approaches in that the power sharing is accomplished without the need of inter-module communication; thus, yielding a master-less, fault-tolerant, scalable power converter building block. These converters inherently share current (and thus power) thanks to a novel, patent-pending power topology. APEI&quot;s battery management power converters can be easily combined to form a multi-module arrangement for scalability and/or redundancy purposes. APEI&quot;s advanced, seamlessly scalable, multi-module power converter technology is the key enabler to making the transition from traditional custom designed systems to a standardized battery/power module building block. Our technology will provide the aerospace industry with a fully modular, practical, ready-to-deploy standardized, intelligent battery/power management module.  1) Standardized module = reduced procurement costs  2) Unprecedented efficiency and power density gains through the use of GaN FETs  3) Improved reliability/rad-hard cell balancing circuit (minimal active = device count)  Additionally, APEI, Inc. has identified high voltage hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) battery packs as a commercial application of the technology. This application open up a path to non-military commercialization of the technology which can mean huge dividends for APEI, Inc.  Specially, the selective charge of individual cells based solely on the frequency components contained in the charge power signal will minimize active device part count while yielding fast, dynamic response to individual cells&quot;state of charge. This approach has great promise not only for space battery applications but also for larger Li-ion cell stacks found in HEVs where 100&quot;s of cells in a stack preclude most traditional cell-balancing approaches from being practically implemented.",

There are number of candidate cathode and anode materials are considered promising candidates for lithium ion battery due to their large capacity and relatively good rate capability, low self-discharge and relatively good capacity retention as well as ease of monitoring state of charge.  However, their cyclic life is still far from satisfying DOD&quot;s needs for space application as stated above.     Main challenges for current cathode materials include considerable deterioration of the cycle stability due to structural changes, dissolution of transition metal and oxygen; formation of passive layer from decomposition of electrolyte, impedance growth; and thermal instability of cathode material.     In this proposed research, we will develop, evaluate and validate advanced materials (including anode, cathode and electrolyte) for use in Li-ion battery.  In Phase I, we have demonstrated that novel cathode material can deliver high initial specific energy with high capacity retention.  In Phase II, prototype Li-ion cells will be designed and fabricated with selected cathode and anode materials.        BENEFIT:   Rechargeable battery with high energy density (&gt;200 Wh/kg) and long cycle life (&gt;60,000) has application in military communications satellites.  Light weight and long lasting battery is also essential for Army battle field application, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), Navy&quot;s All Electric Ship and also all the department of defense (ex.

These conductive layers require inspection during manufacturing and throughout the life of the aircraft to ensure proper electrical performance is achieved and maintained. Current manufacturing inspections are conducted manually, are time consuming, and do not cover 100% of the transparency surface. Compass Technology Group (CTG) proposes an expanded Phase II effort to develop and demonstrate a new concept in microwave nondestructive evaluation (NDE) in support of the Air Force&quot;s requirement for transparent conductive canopy coating testing. The offered design specifically addresses the need for high-fidelity measurements of defects and manufacturing variations in aircraft windows in both factory and in-service (depot and field) environments. This recommended concept is easily automated while still providing improved sensitivity over a broad frequency range when compared to existing measurement methods, the proposed Phase II program not only develops the measurement concept but also includes advanced development of automation of the technology so that it is fully demonstrated in the manufacturing environment by the end of the effort.  BENEFIT:  This Phase 2 effort concludes with the installation and testing of a production MM-TSS at a manufacturing facility. It provides a fully operational system for immediately meeting the Air Force need for QA testing of advanced transparencies. Thus there will be a developed product line that can then be leveraged for improved QA testing of other advanced transparencies. Additionally, it provides a near-term route for realizing advanced canopy testing systems for use in Depot and Flight-line environments.

        "abstract": "Megawatt class laser systems using Diode Pumped Alkali Lasers (DPAL) could be possible because of their extremely low quantum defect which minimizes thermal loading and, like other gas lasers, the gain medium can be flowed to reduce thermal management requirements. One key to producing efficient systems is matching the absorption linewidth of the gain media to the emission bandwidth of the diodes. Absorption linewidths are typically on the order of 500 MHz while the typical edge emitting diode emission is on the order of a few nanometers (hundreds of GHz). We offer a new technology of high power Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) which has intrinsically narrow linewidth and can be modified to dramatically improve the linewidth and temperature stability so that it can be used as a pump for DPAL Systems. In phase I Princeton Optronics has demonstrated a novel approach to reduce the linewidth and stabilize the laser to reduce their temperature dependence. In phase  II, we would improve on the technolgy and deliver higher power pump lasers with this approach.",

        "abstract": "Human Social and Cultural and Behavior (HSCB) models are increasingly used to provide critical support to US military decision making. HSCB models are highly reliant on data; they need data from many sources, types, and areas of human behavior. The concomitant data streams have variable data quality and are constantly changing. Despite these challenges, HSCB applications may need near real-time access to relevant knowledge to make rapid decisions.  To promote rapid acquisition and effective use of relevant HSCB knowledge, we propose SELMA (Semantic Exploration of Large Multi-modal Archives) which automates the processes of: (1) semantic cross-modal exploration of HSCB archives (to link people, events, objects, knowledge, and actions); (2) data-mining to fill gaps in information, resolve uncertainty, and classify behaviors and events; (3) mission-critical HSCB knowledge discovery; and (4) binding and visualizing the captured HSCB insights and semantic knowledge.  Together, these components allow SELMA to offer a solution to HSCB data needs that: (1) collects, stores, and analyses mission-critical HSCB insights, (2) works autonomously for extended periods of time, and (3) actively reasons over the regional Human Terrains. SELMA dynamically creates an HSCB knowledge meta-network, explores concepts, discovers relationships with certain properties, and carries out versatile on-demand analyses.",

In addition, VICTR-E&quot;s interfaces will support the development of structured arguments. This approach will increase the transparency of an analyst&quot;s thought process, enhance collaboration among analysts, and enable the institution to capture and reuse the best of analytic thought.

        "abstract": "Marine-grade aluminum alloys (5XXX-series) are increasingly being used in naval combatants because they have high strength and high corrosion resistance. In order to decrease weight, these corrosion resistant marine-grade aluminum alloys are not painted with the conventional primer and low solar absorbance topcoats. Although 5XXX series wrought aluminum alloys generally exhibit excellent corrosion resistance, exposure to moderately elevated temperature (which is unavoidable) can cause sensitization. Once sensitized the aluminum is susceptible to intergranular forms of corrosion including intergranular stress corrosion cracking (SCC). Stress corrosion cracking is particularly threatening because the stresses sufficient for crack initiation and crack growth can be far below the stresses required for normal gross failure. The goal of this SBIR project is to develop a new protective surface treatment for currently uncoated marine-grade aluminum alloys. TDA Research, Inc has developed novel corrosion inhibitors to mitigate stress corrosion cracking in senstizied Al5XXX series aluminum. In the Phase I project we demonstrated the feasibility using these corrosion inhibitors in a thin protective surface treatment.

Featuring total submersion of computer equipment in high performance dielectric coolant, the technology replaces air conditioning and air-handling infrastructure with liquid cooling.  BENEFIT:  Containerization of submersion cooling technology from Green Revolution Cooling enables the elimination of all costly air-handling equipment associated with traditional data centers. As a result, build-up and build-out of a data center becomes up to 60% less expensive, with up to 50% less continuous energy use up to 400% more heat dissipation per square foot of data center space. The applications of the technology are myriad but the product generally will appeal greatly to data center operators that are confined by one or more of the following factors: physical space, resource cost, build-out time, hazardous environment, and compute throughput. This containerized solution, when fully developed during the course of the Phase II award, will dramatically reduce data center installation time, data center build out costs, and capital expenditure requirements for new data center space. The containerized solution will essentially be a&quot;plug-and-play&quot;data center.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This proposal details the plan for developing a prototype model of the Intra-cavity Coherent Optical Amplifier (ICOA). Wide Field of View (WFOV) high-gain amplifiers are critical components for various electro-optical systems. A fully developed ICOA will expand the use of coherent imaging systems for acquisition, tracking, identification and characterization of distant objects. The proposed ICOA architecture will provide a high level of gain (up to 50 dB) with a field of view in excess of 50 mrad with a SWaP design. The proposed approach should resolve issues associated with intra-cavity wave-front aberrations caused by a thermal load on the gain medium and super-luminescence effects in a high-gain amplifier. A phase conjugation technique will be used to compensate for residual wave-front aberrations; typical for intra-cavity amplification schemes introduced by thermal load, and other source perturbations. In Phase I of this program, AS&T performed a detailed analysis and feasibility study of the proposed ICOA technique and by assembling and testing its laboratory breadboard was able to demonstrate the concept operability. In Phase II we will perform system design, integration and construction. The program will culminate with a field demonstration of ICOA performance in a relevant environment.  BENEFIT:  The proposed system will allow coherent amplification of low-intensity complex-form wavefronts, which are urgently, required by image detection and amplification systems, for example: Military applications including high-power lasers and remote target acquisition, and tracking at low-levels of illumination. Commercial applications include processes associated with low-intensity signal detection for dynamical visualization that are often used in medicine and biology.",

In Phase I, EPIR has successfully optimized the MOEMS fabrication processes necessary for FPI fabrication and performed component and system modeling demonstrating that standoff ranges beyond 10 meters is possible.  During Phase II EPIR will further optimize the fabrication of the MOEMS FPIs and demonstrate tunable electrostatic actuation on large area membranes. In parallel, we will fabricate high performance LWIR FPAs using our in-house growth and processing facilities and commercial read-out integrated circuits. The effort will continue with the design of the electronic, optic and cooler components of the hyperspectral imager. These components will be integrated with EPIRs FPIs and FPAs elements.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The ultimate goal of this Phase II SBIR is to provide the Air Force with a game-based approach to train Air Force maintenance personnel.  Sonalysts believes that the most cost-effective solution will include:    The continued development of specifications for a SAM-T that uniquely uses game engine AI, scenario generation, IMI, IETMs, event management, performance tracking tools, and event/goal trigger mechanisms for adapting content based on performance and level of underlying knowledge about the system or subsystem.    The development of a reconfigurable SAM-T prototype system containing learning adaptation based on game AI and real-time authoring.  The prototype system will support reconfiguration to an alternate system/subsystem midway through the Phase II effort, as well as the capability for participating in a distributed mission training simulation environment.    Completion of a Phase III production SAM-T simulation system.  The SAM-T system will provide a complete training environment in which domain specific plug-ins can be developed to train a wide variety of maintenance training tasks.  These plug-ins or maintenance packages will be designed using the SAM-T Software Development Kit (SDK) to make full use of the training environment, and leverage SAM-T common libraries to provide an immersive experience to deliver training to students.     BENEFIT:  The research areas to be examined in this Phase II SBIR project by Sonalysts will have a significant impact on the effectiveness of Air Force maintenance training, long-term sustainability, and TOC.  Currently the Air Force has a maintenance training requirement to explore the training utility of developing gaming environments that incorporate adaptive approaches to tailoring learning where complex maintenance tasks can be trained in realistic scenarios and simulations.  The results of this Phase II SBIR project will satisfy this requirement with a low-cost game-based solution that provides Air Force maintenance personnel a standard framework with user sustainability tools for developing maintenance trainers for any Air Force domain.    The vision of SAM-T is to provide a robust, flexible architecture that can be applied to multiple domains.  The provided tools and SDK will enable the architecture to be used to create training packages in any domain.  Therefore, the architecture can be applied to any area that requires maintenance style training:  aircraft maintenance and support, UAV maintenance, surface ship maintenance, and submarine maintenance.    The trainer could facilitate the training for the Air Force and Navy needs and also be applicable to commercial training markets.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  We propose the development of broadband high operating temperature two-color focal plane arrays (FPAs) that will allow simultaneous detection of radiation in the visible and infrared bands from the same target points. The first band will cover the 400 nm to 4 micron wavelength range and will be based on double layer planar heterostructures technology. The backside illuminated array will have the substrate removed to allow for visible detection. The second color will cover the 4-11 micron wavelength range and will be based on Auger suppressed architecture. This architecture allows for dark currents similar with the ones observed in the first color.  During the Phase I program, we demonstrated Auger suppression for the LWIR band and diffusion limited behavior for the MWIR band. Based on the successful Phase I effort, this proposed Phase II program will transition the technology to 2D FPAs. This goal will be accomplished by optimization of the HgCdTe device geometry and architecture, grow by molecular beam epitaxy  HgCdTe heterostructures suitable for broadband detection, fabricate detector arrays through a novel mosaic process, develop indium bump formation for variable height pixels and hybridize detector arrays to the read-out circuits. A packaged FPA will be delivered to Air Force.  BENEFIT:  Single detector and small array product line would have a range of commercial applications, such as spectrometry, thermometry, high-end industrial manufacturing, and hotspot detection. Additionally, larger arrays, due to their lower costs and light weight characteristics (TE-base), will have applications in astronomy, geophysics, geology, law enforcement, remote environmental sensing, search and rescue, and emergency response including firefighting. If multistage TE coolers are used, the product would also have applications in medical systems, commercial airlines, and ground transportation. Moreover, large uncooled and thermoelectrically-cooled IR arrays have various uses in defense, astronomy, geology, law enforcement, remote environmental sensing, and emergency response. Improved high performance HgCdTe detectors without cryo-cooling requirements is of great interest to the industry since many customers who may not have access to liquid nitrogen could benefit from having improved detection capability. The lightweight, low power design of the proposed detector would create a new market for these industries, which can significantly benefit from high performance, uncooled detectors. Uncooled photodetectors designed for wide spectral detection can be useful for high sensitivity detection, particularly for low flux applications, and can replace or be used in conjunction with conventional thermal detectors.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In the proposed Phase II program, RINI will demonstrate the key attributes of a thermal management (TM) concept for High Performance Electric Actuation System (HPEAS). The TM system does not interfere with the aircraft Environment Control System (ECS) nor the aircraft Power and Thermal Management System (PTMS).  The concept is based on enhanced forced convection with autonomously controlled variable speed fans.  It is expected this approach can address essentially all scenarios encountered in electrical actuation of flight control surfaces. The TM system can function in a wide range of environmental temperature and pressure, and under a variable gravity situation.  In the Phase I, it was demonstrated that forced convection and radiation are sufficient to transport the waste heat from the HPEAS to the bay ambient air with temperatures defined in the solicitation.  Key components of the Electro-Mechanical Actuation (EMA) hardware were kept below their respective operating temperature limits for all ambient conditions.  In the Phase II program, TM systems will be designed, fabricated and applied to flight quality EMA hardware in collaboration with a prime aerospace company.  BENEFIT:  The primary benefit of the proposed technique is to greatly increase the heat transfer effectiveness from EMAs to ambient air under various flight conditions and body force.  By significantly enhancing air circulation in bays, EMAs located there can operate at much higher power without overheating.  It is anticipated the proposed TM system can find application in the cooling of electric motors and generators in hybrid and electric vehicles.  The technology developed can also be applied to many types of portable systems such as personal cooling systems, etc.",

        "abstract": "Modern computer systems are employed in numerous environments and are capable of performing a wide range of tasks. To support such capabilities economically, software developers have introduced a wide variety of functionality in modular chunks that can be rapidly reconfigured to create new applications. This leads to large, complex systems that, while providing the desired capabilities, may also include non-obvious and undesirable behavior. Such behavior can often be used to compromise the security of a computer system, leaving the system vulnerable to attacks that may disrupt the system&quot;s operation or exfiltrate sensitive information.    We propose the creation of a whole-system detection platform capable of supporting a suite of detection strategies for countering exploits that hijack the execution of a running operating system or one of its hosted applications. A critical initial component of this detection platform will be a control-flow integrity (CFI) checker. Integrity of execution control flow indicates that the execution of instructions in a software component follows a path that was intended by the developer of the softwarea property violated by many attack vectors. The proposed technology would detect such attacks by recognizing when such a violation occurs.",

CA2 builds on existing and novel analyses to give real-time feedback. CA2 will function as a second pair of eyes that watches the programmer as she makes changes. CA2 will infer, summarize, and display information about the software as it is being developed. The programmer will be alerted to such problems as they are introduced, allowing rapid investigation and mitigation while the system&quot;s details are fresh in the programmer&quot;s mind. Programmers will therefore avoid the cost overhead that comes when problems are not detected until testing or, worse, after the system is fielded.   CA2 uses modern program analysis techniques to infer properties about software; the same techniques power commercial bug-finding tools.  CA2 presents information using text and graphical representations, using whichever format can best convey a particular property.

We will extend our strong background work on developing complex device models for SiC power MOSFETs to analytical SPICE-type models that capture the unique physics of SiC devices, while at the same time can be used to simulate the electrical and thermal performance of a complex power converter circuit. The first phase of this project focused on detailed measurements of the SiC power devices, developing SPICE models for the DC and transient behavior, and testing of key circuits for model verification and calibration.

This technique uses a gas stream to fluidize, entrain and aerosol a wide variety of powder nano-materials including metal flakes.

US soldiers, airmen, and others are put through exhaustive training, and their warfighting effectiveness is directly related to the quality of the training received.  Part of this training includes live fire training exercises using&quot;drone&quot;targets to expose trainees to more realistic situations. Such targets have been in use for many years, using configurations that are reasonably limited. In particular, some targets  operate with&quot;towed&quot;configurations or on static rail lines. These existing rail-based targets are inadequate; it is difficult to emulate behaviors of real-world targets with them, and, perhaps even more problematically, they inherently beget predictability. Fortunately, current generation unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) technology provides a potential solution. In this project, we propose to design and prototype AVeTar: a Modular, Unmanned, Trackless Target System with Behavioral Capabilities. AVeTar will be highly-configurable, unmanned vehicles with sophisticated command and control capabilities and the ability to execute behaviors that emulate real-world encounters. It will be engineered to enable trainers to create and deploy scenario based content quickly and easily, and integrate within existing and future training programs. When fully realized, this technology will enable substantially more robust, useful live-fire training exercises.",

Motivated by a desire to increase our ability to reduce software flaws, we propose a new kind of programmer assistant tool, PICT (Programmer Intent Capture Tool). PICT augments the programmer&#039;s toolbox by enabling programmers  to describe code properties that can express a wide range of programmer intentions: from low level code assertions to high level design decisions. PICT analyzes and displays these properties continuously during software  development.    PICT will interactively capture code properties and allow for the managing, analysis, and display of these properties during software development.  The tool is designed to provide feedback about global analyses of the program, display feedback continuously, use and work with external code analysis tools, be unobtrusive to the programmer, and distinguish inferred properties from intended properties.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Over the last twenty years the United States has become dependent on space technology for communications, precision tracking and many other applications.  Globalization of the worlds economy, which has also dramatically increased over the past twenty years, has resulted in this same dependence in industrialized and developing nations around the world.  As a result of these trends, the space domain has become both a contested and congested environment.  To maintain United States space superiority, the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) is responsible for tasking the Space Surveillance Network (SSN) and maintaining a catalog of over 22,000 man-made objects.  This mission requires innovative technology to aggregate information from distributed, heterogeneous data sources as a means of obtaining Space Situational Awareness (SSA).  To meet this technology need, ExoAnalytic Solutions, Inc. proposes to develop Semantically Enable Event Reasoning (SEER).    SEER is significant because it uses semantic technology to store information on space objects and automatically discover relationships between space objects and space events.  The result is a persistent state of awareness for the space domain.  SEER leverages this persistent awareness to build applications that automatically quantify the degradation in space capability to rapidly regain custody of missing satellites.    BENEFIT:  SEER provides several key contributions to DoD.  Most importantly, SEER will provide the JSpOC with a robust Level 2 fusion capability necessary for accomplishing it mission.  SEER can also play a valuable systems engineering role within Air Force Space Command (AFSPC).  The SEER effort includes the development of an analytical framework for assessing performance of the data fusion algorithms.  This framework can be used by systems engineers to help define sensor specifications crucial to SSA and define new SSA quality of service metrics for use by JSpOC.  Finally, algorithms and techniques are needed in C4ISR to fuse disparate sensor data for entity disambiguation and uncovering of terrorist networks with little to no a priori knowledge due to rapidly changing techniques of the adversary.  SEERs technical approach, the inference algorithms that will be developed, and lessons learned can all be leveraged to further applied research and technology development for data fusion in the C4ISR domain, as well.",

        "abstract": "SA Photonics has developed a concept design for a wideband RF Memory which provides better than 60 dB spur-free dynamic range over an entire 20 GHz instantaneous bandwidth, far surpassing the capabilities of digital RF memories. The heart of the system is a high accuracy true-time delay unit which provides better than 10 psec time delay accuracy and better than 2 dB amplitude accuracy over all switch states. With a 4nsec time delay granularity, maximum time delay of 520 usec, and 300 nsec switch speed, the system can accommodate a wide range of Electronic Counter Measure (ECM) techniques. The signal path is completely analog with no frequency conversion, hence is free of any digital artifacts and has minimal spurious components. Since the system is based on wideband true time delay, the false target will be naturally consistent over multiple radars operating over multiple frequency bands, which is next to impossible task for a traditional DRFM system.   In this Phase II program, the baseline system design will be extended to support enhanced jamming waveform capabilities, including Doppler modulation and multiple false target generation.",

        "abstract": "To solve the Navy's need for an innovative visual display for providing variable collimation and improved 3D depth perception in rotary-wing flight simulator chin windows, Holochip Corporation is developing a new Variable-Collimation Display (VCD) system. The VCD system is based on the modification of a conventional wide-area collimated (WAC) display with Holochips new adaptive-lens based projection technology. The use of adaptive lens technology in a WAC display enables the generation of 3D images with rapidly-adjustable depth of collimation. As a result, the VCD offers variable collimation and improved 3D depth cues (i.e., accommodation, convergence and binocular disparity) for rotary-wing chin windows and cargo hatches as well as forward out-of-the-windshield (OTW) visualization channels, thus answering the Navy's requirements for a new collimated visual display. Further, the VCD system will have a physical footprint similar to that of conventional WAC chin-window displays, making it compatible with existing Navy flight simulators and allowing easy installation while minimizing the cost of the upgrade. In Phase I, Holochip designed a VCD system capable of achieving the Navys technical requirements. In Phase II, Holochip will complete the construction of a VCD prototype system and install it in a Navy flight simulator test facility.",

More specifically, ADVICE Phase II will take a synthesized approach to integrating UI design methodology, trust in automation and the Sensor-Assess-Augment human performance research paradigm to maximize SA, human performance and interaction between these two aspects.  ADVICE will contain interface abstractions that allow for new interaction techniques such as Tangible User Interfaces and Tactile Output Interfaces.

        "abstract": "DynSan will collaborate with the Purdue University to develop and test an innovative, fast digital hydraulic valve design that is insensitive to working fluid contamination. The goal is to improve the reliability of fueldraulic systems on aircraft gas turbine engines and similar applications. Current fueldraulic systems use flapper-type Electro Hydraulic Servo Valves (EHSV) to control actuator position. We propose to develop a new generation of digital EHSVs that does not suffer from the common problems experienced by the flapper-type designs such as stiction, null bias shift, and flapper damage. The new design uses an ensemble of appropriately controlled simple switching valves to digitally control an actuator. Phase I simulation and benchtop experiment results show that the new design exhibits excellent response characteristics in comparison to flapper-type EHSVs, and is insensitive to contamination. Phase II will develop a working hardware prototype and will have four focus areas: 1) updating of theoretical design tools developed in Phase I; 2) virtual prototyping, optimization and packaging of new design; 3) manufacturing and testing of a valve prototype; and 4) comparing the performance of the new digital approach to that of the currently used flapper-type valve design. Follow-on research will test the new valve on a wet rig simulator at Navy facilities. Phase III commercialization will seek to exploit the natural multi-use applicability of the developed system.",

As a result of these new systems entering the BMDS, Command Control Battle Management and Communication (C2BMC) functionality requires new algorithms for sensor resource scheduling.  These algorithms must be capable of real-time adaptation to account for sensor availability and changing threat scenes, as well as ensure sufficient data collection throughout an engagement (i.e. acquisition, track, discrimination, and hit/kill assessment).

        "abstract": "The use of commercial off-the-shelf laser systems as weapons is increasingly becoming real. Battery operated visible and infrared lasers can be purchased with powers near 1-watt, sufficient to cause permanent eye damage. Future threats may include frequency agile lasers. It is critical that countermeasure systems provide laser eye protection (LEP) across the visible and IR waveband. Self-activating (passive) devices where protection is activated by the incoming radiation (optical limiting) are the best approach to counter frequency agile and short pulse laser threats. An ideal optical limiter will have high linear transmittance for low-input-energy light and low transmittance for input energies above a user-specified threshold. An ideal optical limiter will have a picosecond, broadband response (e.g., the visible spectrum), and a large dynamic range. This performance is a challenging problem for LEP where MPE is in the J/cm2 range for visible light. Optical limiting with a nonlinear process usually requires a focal plane for this dynamic range. We propose to build optical limiters from metal-dielectric thin-film stacks using nonlinear properties of metals and/or semiconductors. These stacks are very thin and built using standard thin-film equipment on common substrates. They can be integrated into optical systems with little modification of the optics.",

        "abstract": "Refractory alloys such as tantalum-tungsten and ceramics are being pursued as a solution to high temperature erosive wear of gun barrels.  However rifling of these materials with conventional broaching and electrochemical milling is proving to be difficult.  This proposal seeks to demonstrate an innovative alternate grooving method, abrasive waterjet grooving.  Waterjets are normally used to cut completely through materials but Ormond has developed a proprietary technique and software that uses waterjets to mill to a controlled depth.   The process is being used to groove long channels in high temperature metals for scramjets, cooling channels in rocket nozzles, fluid channels in fuel cells and is even capable of milling grooves in silicon carbide and rhenium. This project will consist of designing and building a waterjet rifling machine to groove the 25 mm inside diameter of 2m+ long tubes and grooving of tantalum and silicon nitride.  The baseline geometry will be the Bushmaster M-242. Cost projections indicate that this would be a very inexpensive approach and suitable for production operations. This project will demonstrate that the tolerances and surface finish required for rifling can be achieved economically with the new waterjet grooving process.",

Often these changes are not coordinated since it is difficult to predict how one change may affect another and current requirements management and system modeling tools don't provide the type of two way traceability required. What ends up happening is that the design proceeds to the point where conflicts arises and certain requirements cannot be met. At that point, design changes are more costly and can derail an otherwise productive design team. We propose an intelligent software system which can aid in understanding the impacts of changes to requirements or system architecture and can identify nuanced interactions between them that only expert system engineers would. The proposed system is capable of understanding both system requirements and system architectures in a way which allows inferencing on proposed changes. The system uses ontological reasoning in a flexible way including potential interfaces to external ontology sources as well as a new context specific inferencing approach which leverages information about the specific issue being addressed to focus the ontological reasoning for improved results.",

Specifically, this SBIR will adapt and transition the Requirement Analysis Portal (RAP), which is a transitioned product of OGEP Phase I and Phase II research efforts developed by Securboration Inc., to facilitate interagency strategic NextGen planning, programming, and acquisition.  BENEFIT:  Improved Performance: The processes of planning, programming, and acquisition alignment are nearly impossible to accomplish by hand on a large scale due to high labor costs, time constraints, and human limitations.  Greater Reliability:  Formally modeling the AF and FAA domains provides concepts and entities with unique, machine-readable names. With this appropriate and unambiguous naming, domain models can support the analysis of linked data on a large scale.  Cost Savings:  Consolidation and collaboration can help reduce duplication and synchronize efforts across AF and FAA agencies.  This will enable the identification of joint opportunities, increase situational awareness of agency NextGen activities, and help streamline acquisition processes.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Intelligent cooperative controller capable of continuous learning from offline and online experience is of sustained interest for a team of for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to execute complex missions in a dynamic environment. Current cooperative control technologies lack learning capability. Without the ability to learn, a cooperative system may not be able to react to unanticipated scenarios or adapt to dynamically changing environments in a correct and intelligent fashion, and therefore may lead to unsatisfactory system performance or even mission failure. In collaboration with Brigham Young University, UtopiaCompression Corporation proposed to develop an intelligent solution to target tracking in urban environment using multiple UAVs. During Phase I, we integrated a cooperative path planning algorithm with a machine learning algorithm into an intelligent target tracking controller. We successfully demonstrated the feasibility of improving target tracking performance through an online learning mechanism. We set up various baseline systems and illustrated that our proposed solution outperforms the baseline systems. In the Phase II effort, we will further mature our intelligent solution to target tracking and extend it to multi-target tracking scenario. We will enhance our simulation environment to better reflect realistic scenarios and demonstrate improved performance of our solution using Monte Carlo simulations.  BENEFIT:  In support of effective operations of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in increasingly complex and uncertain missions, the proposed technology will enable UAVs to learn and adapt to the uncertain environment and changes in adversary behavior. The solution will significantly increase the UAV-to-human ratio for successful operation reducing the overall deployment cost. The proposed learning framework will provide a team of UAVs with a set of tools to react effectively to changing environment, mission objectives and sensor characteristics. The new capabilities will allow the UAVs to complete the missions while flying safely, thus reducing costs due to possible accidents and mission failure.   Within the commercial domain, the key technology areas and related applications that can potentially benefit from the proposed technology include surveillance around a critical or secure infrastructure, tracking of unknown targets and classifying their behaviors for border security, search of targets for rescue or surveillance, resupplying UAVs for aircraft carriers, Micro Air Vehicles and flying swarms for reconnaissance and remote monitoring, and civilian search and rescue. All of these applications require intelligent cooperation and decision making between UAVs, which will be enabled through our proposed hierarchical learning framework.     UC has identified numerous product opportunities within the US Military modernization effort centering on implementing C4ISR (Command, Control, Computers, Communication, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) technologies. ISR spending in the next decade is estimated at $15 billion, and depends largely on the stable and efficient control of unmanned vehicles. The UC team is particularly optimistic about the value of integrating UCs technology into the emerging smaller tactical UAVs under development and early deployment such as the RQ-7 and RQ-11 programs. Other potential application programs include the Predator UAV programs, as well as multiple FAA compliance efforts currently underway.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Phase I Versatile Structural Radiation Shielding (VSRS) Effort has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of 3D printing multifunctional spacecraft structures with integral multi-layer, multi-material, minimum-mass radiation shielding. We developed novel space-compatible materials to enable 3D printing with combinations of low-Z and high-Z materials, developed advanced FDM techniques to enable 3D printing with high-performance polymers and metal-entrained polymers.  We demonstrated fabrication of components such as avionics covers that have integral graded-Z radiation shielding.  Simulation with the GEANT4 3D model as well as irradiation testing indicate that VSRS provides shielding for with better than 3X the stopping power of aluminum shielding.  We propose a Phase II effort to mature and qualify the VSRS technology to a flight-ready level for to enable its infusion into DoD space systems.  We will integrate the high-Z materials developed in the Phase I with additional high-strength and conductive materials and develop a process for rapidly and affordably designing, analyzing, and fabricating multifunctional VSRS components that combine minimum-mass radiation shielding customized for the operational environment along with structural strength, EMI shielding, heat dissipation, electrical conduction, thermal insulation, and M/MOD protection.  We will fabricate, qualify, and irradiation test prototype VSRS components including conformal electronics covers and avionics enclosures.  BENEFIT:  The Versatile Structural Radiation Shielding (VSRS) effort will develop materials and processes for using additive manufacturing  (3D printing) with multiple materials to create spacecraft structures that integrate multifunctional capabilities, including graded-Z radiation shielding, EMI shielding, thermal shunts, multi-layer thermal insulation, and/or M/MOD protection.  VSRS will enable responsive, low-cost fabrication of spacecraft components such as conformal covers, avionics enclosures, honeycomb panels, and even spacecraft 'exoskeletons' with integral radiation shielding.  VSRS will reduce the mass required for radiation shielding compared to conventional methods such as aluminum covers, and provide a responsive, low-cost means for improving the reliability of COTS and non-rad-hard components in space systems.",

Vuzix will deliver a functioning, non-ruggedized prototype of this system by the end of Phase II. This shortened time frame allows for useful hardware to be available for field testing earlier than would otherwise be the case. The WFOV system may then be continued with the Phase II option where Vuzix proposes delivering a bench top demonstrator to show the WFOV concepts.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  We propose to demonstrate the real world performance of the systems and techniques developed under Phase I for detection and initial orbit determination of objects in low Earth orbit.  Initially we will use 0.35m optical systems assembled from off-the-shelf components and followed with the construction and deployment of custom designed wide-field optics.  Coupled with our techniques, these systems are predicted to detect LEO objects fainter than visual magnitude 12 and serve as a proof-of-concept for larger optical systems that will detect objects fainter than magnitude 14.  Follow-up observations will verify and characterize detections of both previous known and unknown objects and confirm the limits and dynamic range of our detection techniques.  BENEFIT:  Uncued detection of dim objects in LEO involves two distinctly different pieces of technology that have to work together perfectly for one to have any hope of actually fielding a viable search and detect capability.  One capability is provided by the wide field of view optical systems, the other by the image processing and detection algorithms.  This first capability can commercialized for the amateur astronomy marketplace and for college and university observatories, both customer types have expressed great interest in GGT&quot;s potential products that would stem from Phase 2.  The image processing and detection algorithms, coupled with a network of optical systems, will be of greatest interest to larger entities that have a stake in LEO, including the US government, particularly DOD, NASA, &amp; NOAA, the governments of our allies, commercial satellite operators and their insurance underwriters. Together the economic value of LEO space is measured at least in the hundreds of billions of dollars and our techniques coupled with an optical network can provide significant risk assessment and mitigation.",

For many applications, the solution to such a problem might be increasing the amount of shielding on the wires. However, for aviation platforms, solutions that add weight are typically not viable. Wires created with lightweight EMI shielding materials would solve this issue. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have the potential to offer significant EMI shielding. The overall objective of this SBIR project is to develop and demonstrate shielding options for cables, wires, housings, and connectors that have increased EMI shielding properties at lower weight. There are a number of options that will be investigated to incorporate protection from ionizing radiation and to increase the overall shielding effectiveness of the finished products.",

        "abstract": "SSCI proposes a retooling of the Intelligent Course of Action Learning System (iCOALS) that leverages the important results from the Phase I effort and remedies the deficiencies of a rule-based approach when applied to complex Pursuit Evasion Games (PEGs). This modification is critical given the utility of the proposed approach to DARPA&#039;s Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) program.  ACTUV&#039;s&quot;Track-and-Trail&quot;problem is specific, real world instance of a PEG where ACTUV attempts to maintain close in sensor contact over a period of weeks with a manned diesel-electric submarine.  This problem can be formulated as a PEG where the unmanned pursuit vehicle (ACTUV: propulsive superiority) attempts to maintain proximity with the evader (submarine: intellectual superiority). SSCI&#039;s specific approach to this problem provides an online Adversarial Autonomy (AA) engine that employs a Forward Reachability Model (FRM) formulation of a PEG game. This is important because it is impossible to formulate a rule-set that can handle all challenges from an intelligent adversary  especially one with access to external effectors (surface traffic, active/passive decoys, weapons systems, boarding parties, etc.).  Game-theoretic approaches, like FRM, model key performance parameters of the pursuer (ACTUV) as well as modeling or measuring those of the evader.  Once modeled, efficient computational search algorithms (alpha-beta) are employed to ensure optimal outcomes for the current engagement configuration in real-time. It should be noted that engagement-level optimality is precluded in a rule-based approach with a finite rule set. Upgrading iCOALS with online adversarial models will eliminate the possibility track-and-trail will be easily broken by an intelligent adversary who quickly discovers and repeatedly exploits rule-set loopholes.",

        "abstract": "Augmentor stability is critical to the operational performance of military aircraft that rely on gas turbine propulsion. Compared to early augmentor designs, the distance between the point of fuel injection and the flameholder has become progressively shorter in modern augmentors. These so called close-coupled designs help avoid autoignition issues associated with higher augmentor inlet temperatures. A negative aspect of such close-coupled designs is that the fuel is not optimally mixed in the flame holding region, leading to static and dynamic stability issues. Creare and our partners propose a new fueling approach for close-coupled augmentor flameholders that will more optimally deliver fuel for all operating conditions. Improved fuel placement will lead to more robust augmentor combustion and enhanced static and dynamic stability. The end result will be increased stability margin for current systems and enhanced potential for thrust growth. This technology could also be applied to future advanced augmentor concepts. During the proposed Phase II.5 program, we will extend development of our technology towards a future TRL 6 engine test. We will design, build, and validate an advanced fuel injector engine set for use on a F135 ground test engine.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project should dramatically improve intersection safety and mobility in a practical way. Safety is measured by the risk of collision between pedestrians, bicycles and vehicles; safety is improved by better signal timing, warnings, and possibly enforcement. Mobility is measured by vehicle delay, number of stops, and throughput; it is improved by better signal control, and adaptation to current traffic conditions. Today traffic data collected in 300,000 intersections in the US consists of manual vehicle counts conducted every couple of years; bicycles or pedestrians are almost never measured. Traffic signal settings are based on these inadequate measurements. Safety risk is measured by counting crashes; there is no account of near-crashes. Measurement of intersection performance (level of service, throughput, and delay) is rarely attempted since it requires continuous monitoring of traffic. Nevertheless major signalized intersections do detect the presence of vehicles, and do receive push button signals from pedestrians if they wish to cross. A few intersections have bicycle detectors. What is lacking is the means to collect these measurements and intelligently fuse them to estimate the traffic state in real-time. This innovation is the only system that can do this. The broader and commercial impact of this innovation is the savings in lives and lost productivity. Inefficient operation of intersections is costly. Poor intersection control causes 295 million vehicle-hours of traffic delay, and annually costs the peak-period traveler $710 in additional travel time and fuel. An estimated 2.3M crashes occurred at intersections in 2008, accounting for 40 percent of 5.8M crashes, 7,421 fatalities (including 4,092 pedestrians) and 733,000 crashes with injuries. Unless urban roads are carefully managed, these mobility and safety costs will only increase as cities try to provide convenient multimodal transportation choices to all citizens, whether it?s by driving, walking, bicycling, or transit, leading to greater interaction between the modal types. But careful management requires the ability to evaluate, predict and identify means to improve intersection mobility and safety. Today the data needed to conduct such studies on a routine basis are not available anywhere. This innovation is the only system that can provide such data in real time. It will be an exceptionally low-cost system that can be installed in a few hours, with data available the next day. This innovation will address the emerging requirements of the recent federal MAP-21 legislation.",

While X-ray is the current dominant modality for diagnostic imaging of bone anatomy, it possesses many limitations: emission of radiation, bulky, and expensive. In the Phase I project, we demonstrated feasibility of the technology with a handheld ultrasound prototype, which demonstrated 3D freehand bone imaging using an ex vivo whole pig lumbar spine model. Phase II research objectives include: 1) Design and build a preproduction ultrasound prototype; 2) Develop a model registration-based 3D bone imaging application and release a clinical software version with formal verification and validation testing; and 3) Prepare the device for clinical use with human subjects and experimentally validate in an ex vivo porcine lumbar spine model with physician testing. It is anticipated that this project will result in the demonstration of a new medical device with demonstrated efficacy for improved administration of spinal anesthesia via 3D portable real-time spinal bone imaging. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is an X-ray replacement technology based on medical ultrasound, which addresses market segments including spinal anesthesia, orthopedic, and emergency medicine. Rivanna Medical is targeting the spinal anesthesia market first because of the compelling market and clinical need. Due to lack of availability of safe, portable, and inexpensive medical imaging for bone anatomy, these procedures currently exhibit high first-attempt failure rates. Failures result in poor patient outcomes and higher costs for health care providers. In this application, our lead device, the SpineFinder, would improve success rates via real-time guidance of spinal injections at the patient?s bedside. The societal impact of a safe, inexpensive, portable bone imaging products includes more successful procedures, better patient outcomes, and lower healthcare costs. Additionally, the public would benefit by an overall reduction in ionizing radiation exposure from X-ray and a subsequent reduction in cancers.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop robust manufacturing methods to commercialize novel biobased plastics made from scrap PLA resins, resulting in a new method to effectively address end-of-life management of bioplastics, specifically polylactic acid (PLA). PLA is the industry leading bioplastic as it is compostable and made from corn. However, many PLA-based products manufactured today are land filled or incinerated at their end of life. Despite being compostable, industrial composting infrastructure for PLA and other bioplastics in the United States is very limited. Under this work, a commercial scale reactive extrusion process will be developed and optimized for the robust production of hyperbranched PLA polymers from scrap PLA. Phase I research verified that hyperbranching dramatically improves the melt strength and mechanical properties of scrap PLA. These benefits give hyperbranched PLA properties that meet or exceed those of virgin PLA. The process technology being developed will overcome the significant variability in scrap PLA feedstocks, allowing for production of resin with uniform product quality. The reactive extrusion process to impart hyperbranching is cost-effective and scalable. This process will enable a viable business to sell recycled PLA resin as a value-added material intended for durable goods applications. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development and commercialization of an important, novel, and cost effective way to meet the pressing need of making plastics more sustainable by adding value to the most broadly used bioplastic, PLA. Creating improved PLA resins from lower cost feedstock will ultimately expand commercial applications for PLA and create a new market for scrap PLA. The current U.S. market for PLA is approximately 300 million pounds and growing at approximately 15% annually. Commercial plastic processors and compounders using PLA will be able to replace or supplement use of virgin PLA with recycled PLA by using this technology. Additionally, by providing a commercially attractive method to recycle PLA, this new process will effectively incentivize recyclers to remove PLA from their waste sources. Penetration of PLA into durable goods markets has been slow due to the higher price of PLA resin. By using hyperbranched, recycled PLA as a feedstock that originates from packaging or consumable products, the materials costs for durable products can be significantly reduced. Recycling PLA by hyperbranching offers a way to significantly extend the end of life and help enable PLA achieve its full potential as a sustainable, resource renewable bioplastic.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a novel ion gate membrane with controlled pore size for redox flow battery. Redox flow battery is one of the most promising electric energy storage (EES) technologies. However, the cost of the state-of-the-art (SOA) membrane used in such battery has to come down dramatically in order to reach the overall system cost target for EES applications. Moreover, the ion selectivity of the SOA membrane is also very poor, leading to ion cross-over and lower energy efficiency for the battery. In the proposed approach, an ultra thin composite membrane will be developed to address the issues. Due to its thin thickness, tight pore size control and material selection, the membrane is expected to have excellent ion selectivity, proton conductivity and chemical stability. Once fully developed, it will be able to meet the stringent requirements of large scale redox flow batteries for EES applications. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes promoting the widespread adoption of redox flow battery as the low cost EES systems and facilitating the rapid deployment of smart grids. In order to satisfy the surging energy demand and mitigate the environment impact of fossil fuel usage, renewable energy sources are becoming more and more important in the power generation. However, renewable energy sources, such as wind power, suffer the drawback of fluctuation. To mitigate the problem, smart grids are now being proposed and developed. The EES system is considered as the key components of the smart grids. The market for such batteries is expected to grow rapidly. According to a study, the EES market could reach $52 billion if 10% of wind plants adopt EES. This work if successful will lead to a breakthrough product: a low cost, high performance ion gate membrane as a key component for the redox flow battery. Such a breakthrough product could accelerate the penetration of redox flow battery in this market. In addition, development of this innovative membrane will help maintain our nations leading position in this important field, creating new business opportunities and high tech jobs.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop fungal bioinsecticides for control of bark beetles in forestry. Bark beetles are difficult to control. With a life cycle mostly under tree bark, exposure to insecticides is limited to the short period when adults search for new host trees. Control of mountain pine beetle (MPB), one of the most damaging species, is limited to persistent chemical insecticides and pheromone repellents. Health and environmental issues of chemical insecticides limit use; pheromones protect individual trees but do not kill beetles. Phase I discoveries of formulation, application methods, and persistence demonstrated the safe, environmentally benign fungal pathogen Beauveria bassiana can compete in efficacy and cost against chemical insecticides. Natural biochemicals that inhibit boring and increase exposure to pathogen spores show promise for enhanced products. Phase II objectives are: 1) bring one fungal pathogen to commercial introduction; 2) develop improved fungal pathogen strains and/or boring deterrent; 3) isolate pathogen strains for other bark beetles. Field trials will provide the basis for use recommendations in MPB control. New fungal pathogens and continued development of boring deterrents will enable expanded MPB control strategies and development of products against other beetle species. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be innovative biological approaches to address outbreaks of both native and introduced bark beetles. Outbreaks of unprecedented scale are being driven by climate change and global commerce. Bark beetle outbreaks are devastating forests and urban trees, and impacting timber value, urban land values, and esthetics of forested public land. Phase II will contribute to the understanding of fungal pathogen host range in different genera of bark beetles and in non-target insects. Using fungal or tree derived biochemical boring deterrents to increase fungal pathogen efficacy represents an important technical innovation for developing cost effective, more broadly useful, forestry bioinsecticides. The current MPB outbreak is devastating western forests. Phase II will provide a new tool for protecting trees from MPB attack in high value public recreation areas, private forest land, and urban landscaping. A safe and environmentally benign fungal bioinsecticide will enable new strategies for broader management of MPB. Bark beetles are a large, increasing problem in forestry with multiple outbreaks of native and introduced bark beetles.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project should offer a radically new alternative to enterprises for application mobilization. The key value proposition is the ability for companies to mobilize their applications at a fraction of the cost and time as compared to any competitive offering. From a technology standpoint, the project consists of a cloud-based backend that allows for the original PC version (browser-based or thick-client-based) of enterprise applications to be run, a front-end app that runs on the mobile devices, and a purpose-built remote computing protocol called MORPH. The protocol is specifically designed to dynamically transform the application views in a manner that make them appropriate for smartphones and tablets. The platform enables mobilization without requiring any software development, mobilizes applications instantaneously, offers a unified mobilization platform for all of an enterprise&#039;s applications, and enables feature parity controllable by the enterprise. MORPH composes of two underlying technologies: 1) virtual view that virtualizes application views independent of the UI framework used into a set of UI elements and attributes that can be easily manipulated, and 2) transformation services that can be programmed onto the StarMobile platform to operate on the virtual view to realize a mobile device friendly view. The broader / commercial impact of this project is that a company can take any current enterprise applications and extend them to users on any mobile devices at 5% to 20% of the cost and time of any other solution on the market today. This should benefit the 85% of enterprise knowledge workers who are expected to have smartphones within the next few years. A recent survey of CIOs revealed that there are multiple drivers for application mobilization - the key ones being increased productivity of employees, higher revenue, and reduced paper work. Over 90% of IT managers in a recent survey indicated plans for application mobilization. Typical customers for StarMobile include Global 2000 businesses that use on-premise, web-based and / or cloud-based applications, packaged or bespoke, to support their business processes. While there is an urgent demand for application mobilization, there are no reliable, cost-effective solutions that can perform mobilization rapidly. Thus, there is a need for a solution that can achieve rapid mobilization with minimal effort on the part of the enterprise and at the same time provide the rich set of functionality that is required.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop and validate a non-invasive, multiplex urine dipstick for clinical diagnosis of Acute Febrile Illness (AFI) caused by polymicrobial infections. The target diseases include leptospirosis, typhoid fever, dengue, as well as Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax malaria, responsible for ~229M AFI&#039;s and&gt;800,000 deaths a year worldwide. Current diagnostic tools are invasive, technically complex, and thus not suitable in tropical and subtropical countries where these diseases are most prevalent, especially in rural and point-of-care settings where blood testing is impractical. The Phase I project successfully developed and validated pathogen-specific recombinant antibody reagents that demonstrated diagnostic potential in urine. This Phase II project envisages two broad objectives: (i) detailed characterization of the recombinant monoclonal antibody reagents to validate their individual and collective diagnostic utility; and (ii) to develop and validate a multiplex dipstick test device for concurrent detection of a set of leading causes of acute fever in a single urine sample. The deliverable will be a simple diagnostic device with the potential to diagnose either/both Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax and Leptospira, which combines the need to improve specific diagnosis of AFI with the need to address alternative causes of acute fever. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be the delivery of a rapid diagnostic tool that addresses a major challenge faced by people in low resource settings with high burdens of global health diseases, i.e. how to manage acute fever without the benefit of rapid differential diagnostic tests. Although individual tests for each potential cause of fever would be beneficial, it is often not feasible or practical to rapidly select, run, and interpret multiple individual tests in these settings. The cost implications for such individual testing also will be prohibitive. Therefore, a multiplex rapid device as envisaged here that will evaluate groups of symptomatically related febrile diseases is urgently needed. It will offer both medical and logistical benefits for rapid testing of leading causes of acute febrile illness in a single urine sample. It will deliver a single answer multi-disease diagnostic with broader impact, and offer differential diagnosis through a multiplexed assay rather than individual testing, most suitable in resource limited settings where diagnostic laboratory capacities are limited. This multiplex urine dipstick test is designed to be a foundational platform device to which other diagnostic reagents for acute fever can be iteratively added to suit a particular region.",

CO2 sensors are now being used to lower heating bills and improve air quality in new commercial buildings, but they have not been widely deployed in retrofits (i.e. A/C replacement), because the sensors are too expensive, and require too much power. In Phase I, Dioxide Materials has demonstrated a new design that requires 3 orders of magnitude less power, and are projected to cost a factor of 5 less than the CO2 sensors used in HVAC today. That will allow CO2 sensors to be used in building retrofits, and residential buildings saving energy, and lowering HVAC costs for a wide range of customers. These sensors use new combinations of catalytic materials that have never been characterized before. Consequently, there are significant scientific challenges in the work including 1)developing novel inks that show high catalytic activity for CO2 activation and can be printed by conventional screen screen printing processes. 2) developing technology to enhance the CO2 permeability through the electrolyte to enhance the measurement speed, 3) developing empirical models of the sensor response that can be used to develop algorithms, and later to be ported into HVAC design software 4) understanding the effects of the room environment on the sensor response and develop methods to mitigate the response. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be to enable affordable control systems. Most HVAC systems are inefficient. They run full blast when buildings are nearly empty, and over ventilate because the air quality in a building is unknown. Several vendors have developed control systems that use CO2 sensors to assess the air quality and adjust the HVAC systems accordingly. Energy savings of up to $0.31/ft2/yr (i.e. $465/yr for a 1500 ft2 house) have been demonstrated, but the systems have not been widely deployed because the needed CO2 sensors are too expensive. If successful, Dioxide Materials? new sensors will make advanced HVAC control systems affordable. Utility bills will go down. Further, utilities will not need to generate as much electricity, so greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will adapt a photonics based signal processor to propel applications in extreme bandwidth spread-spectrum wireless communications. The signal processor prototype known as the spatial spectral holographic (S2H) extreme bandwidth analyzer / correlator (EBAC) will function as a correlating receiver for low probability of intercept (covert) and interference immune spread-spectrum communications in any radio frequency/millimeter wave (RF/MMW) band. The Phase I effort proof of concept demonstrations showed correlation and demodulation of&gt;4 GHz bandwidth signals with processing gain exceeding 40 dB. The Phase II project will demonstrate continuous transmission signal generation and receiver processing prototype hardware with the ability to demodulate extreme instantaneous bandwidth up to 20 GHz spread-spectrum communications signals with long duration spreading waveforms up to 1 ms, with high data rates (1-1,000 Mb/s), and flexible frequency coverage exceeding 40 GHz. For particular intensive signal processing functions such as spectral analysis and correlation the S2H EBAC analog signal processor demonstrates higher performance and power efficiency than traditional digital signal processing. The intellectual merit of this project is in the advancement of the core technology and application to new real-world applications. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project include opportunities for major academic and commercial developments in communication technology, spectrum analysis, and spectrum enforcement with wide operating bandwidths from 0.5-40 GHz IBW. Initial commercial market would be for spectrum analysis systems with a customer base in electro-magnetic environment testing, tactical DoD next-generation wideband passive surveillance systems, law enforcement surveillance, and intelligence community spectrum sensing. In wireless communications, this technology has the potential extend the reach of spread spectrum communications to new operational paradigms. Beyond communications, commercial applications include test and measurement systems, magnetic resonance imaging, weather radar, earth mapping, navigation, and spectrum use enforcement (the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the U.S.). The enabling technology has commercial, military and intelligence community benefits in the form of geo-location, direction finding, data selection and filtering, navigation, and imaging.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the need for analyzers to detect the toxic species benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, (BTEX) and 1,3-butadiene in ambient air. These toxic volatile organic compounds (VOC) are released during incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, the manufacture of a range of chemicals, and the process of petrochemical refining. Entanglement Technologies proposes to complete development of a BTEX and butadiene vapor analyzer based on the combination of cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) and diffusion time-of-flight (DiTOF). CRDS provides extremely sensitive detection while diffusion provides specificity. The research objective of this project is to demonstrate the full capabilities of this analyzer technology. The project will comprise building a prototype CRDS/DiTOF analyzer to perform laboratory and field trials of the technology. The anticipated benzene sensitivity is 10 parts per trillion by volume in a measurement of less than 10 minutes, surpassing existing technologies. The outcome of the project will be a design for a manufacturable analyzer. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to extend the sensitivity of state-of-the-art commercial CRDS analyzers have for small molecules (e.g. carbon dioxide or ammonia) to the detection of more complex molecules. DiTOF provides the ability to distinguish among larger molecules (benzene and other aromatics, aldehydes and ketones) that CRDS alone does not possess. The CRDS/DiTOF analyzer design developed in this project will be Entanglement Technologies? commercial platform design, easily adapted to many different trace gases, including atmospheric and building-interior pollutants, and combinations of trace gases. Such a family of analyzers will impact pollution research, control, and mitigation as much as existing commercial carbon dioxide, methane, and water CRDS analyzers are currently impacting the study of greenhouse gases and climate change. In the long term, CRDS/DiTOF technology will be applied to biomedical science, industrial process monitoring, environmental remediation and explosives detection. For example, the diffusion-based selectivity will prove critical to the separation and quantification of the many hydrocarbon gas components in human breath useful for non-invasive diagnosis of disease. Similarly, CRDS/DiTOF can enable sensitive chemical analysis of liquids such as blood.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will determine the technical feasibility and the commercial value proposition for high temperature, highly processable fiber optic coatings across a range of markets to include fiber lasers, fibers for oil and gas, avionics fiber, and medical fiber. Tetramer will perform research to modify the structure of polymer coatings to provide enhanced performance which will extend the capabilities of current fiber optics. Coatings developed will advance our understanding of structure property relationships and establish new boundaries for the polymer system. During this program, Tetramer will synthesize new monomers and polymers and evaluate their properties for use as fiber coatings. At the end of this program, Tetramer anticipates it will have developed 3 new types of polymers with a set of performance characteristics which are not available from any one single material today. New fiber coatings will be developed which are capable of operating at temperatures above 300 deg C, having greater processability, and for laser applications, having lower refractive indices. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will impact society in many ways due to the various markets in which the coatings can have a meaningful impact on the optical fiber performance. Fiber optic lasers are quickly becoming the preferred method for laser fabrication. By enabling fiber lasers to operate at higher temperatures, fiber lasers will immediately see increased output powers and longer service lifetimes. With applications in industrial metal working (welding, cutting, and engraving/marking), micromachining, and medical devices, doubling power output via improved coatings will have a major impact across many industries. Higher temperature fiber coatings will improve down-hole drilling and the overall efficiency of oil drilling operations through better temperature monitoring in deep wells. This has the potential to lower prices of oil and increase oil production. Additionally, these fibers can aid in geothermal well monitoring which would provide a green source of energy. The coatings under development have the potential to generate increased revenue and profit throughout the value chain through increased performance of products and enhanced market sizes through enhanced capabilities. Tetramer will also use this Phase II program to train undergraduate and graduate level students from nearby Clemson University",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project should provide a novel cyber security solution for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) based on Power Fingerprinting (PFP) technology. PFP provides integrity assessment and intrusion detection for embedded and resource-constrained platforms by using an external device to monitor side-channel information and applying signal processing techniques to determine the execution status of a processor. Because PFP monitoring is performed by an external device, it can be applied to platforms with constrained computational resources, such as Industrial Control Systems, for which solutions based on traditional cyber security approaches are practically inexistent. There are no commercially available solutions capable of monitoring the execution and detecting intrusions directly in core ICS elements, such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). The objectives of this Phase II effort include: 1) Develop a PFP monitor prototype for ICS by integrating commercially available components, 2) Develop the necessary software tools to support ICS monitoring, and 3) Validate the prototype using representative ICS platforms used in critical infrastructure. At the end of Phase II, the prototype PFP monitor will be demonstrated detecting malicious intrusions in blind tests, serving as stepping stone to bring this technology into commercialization. The broader/commercial impact of this project is the development of an innovative cyber security solution for ICS in critical infrastructure. PFP can prevent well-funded adversaries from compromising critical systems without being discovered. The PFP monitor can assess the integrity of core elements in ICSs for which there are no commercial solutions available. PFP can be applied to embedded platforms and can coexist with traditional cyber security solutions adding an extra layer of protection in a defense-in-depth approach. These characteristics make PFP a powerful tool for detecting sophisticated covert attacks to ICS, such as the recent Stuxnet worm. Traditional cyber security approaches, such as anti-virus and firewalls, are being adapted for ICS with very limited success. Thus, PFP addresses a growing need to secure ICSs in critical infrastructure and directly monitor their execution. PFP has dual application in the commercial and government markets, particularly for resource-constrained and embedded platforms. PFP has the potential to become a fundamental player in cyber-security by protecting the nation?s infrastructure and promoting further development of the economic base and employment.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a bio-inspired contact lens that closely mimics the structure of natural tear film, and prevents contact lens-induced dry eye disease (CLIDE). CLIDE is a serious problem faced by 50% of contact lens wearers. In spite of advances in materials and lens design, an estimated 10% of patients discontinue use each year due to CLIDE symptoms of dryness and discomfort. The architecture of the proposed lens minimizes tear film disruption through the use of a high water content polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel that interfaces with the ocular environment. The unique multi-layered design will enable a new paradigm in contact lens design, which so far has relied on modifying copolymer blends rather than making use of discrete layers of bulk materials. The objectives of this research project are to develop and optimize scalable manufacturing processes to produce the lenses and validate their safety in animals. The results of this project will enable efficacy studies in human subjects. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be a contact lens that alleviates dryness and discomfort. The global contact lens market is $6.8 billion dollars annually, with an estimated $680 million dollars in revenue lost from patients discontinuing lens wear due to discomfort. In addition to the significant commercial potential, and ability to improve patient comfort, development of this contact lens will have broader impacts in the ophthalmology and medical device fields. Through better understanding of the tear film-lens interactions, more reliable, objective, and quantifiable metrics to predict success and segment patients will be possible. The new lens architecture also may enable a better understanding of the various metrics used in comparing the comfort of contact lenses. In addition, this device will validate the use of this unique material/design for other potential medical device applications. The novel processes and technology under development in this project for thin film hydrogel deposition has broad application both in clinical science and fundamental research.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate and develop technology for the roll-to-roll production of continuous graphene films. The graphene production technology is based upon innovations in the graphene synthesis and graphene handling, addressing critical deficiencies limiting industrial manufacture of graphene. The synthesis process is performed at atmospheric pressure, allowing roll-to-roll graphene formation on continuous tapes of copper foil passed through the growth region. This eliminates the need for an expensive vacuum furnace and allows fabrication of graphene films larger than the furnace size. The graphene handling process developed during Phase I enables the transfer of graphene sheets from the metal catalyst to nearly any smooth surface without any high temperature steps and without the use of harsh chemicals. Most importantly, the graphene transfer preserves the original metal substrate for reuse. The reusable substrate dramatically reduces the cost of graphene production and eliminates the largest source of waste in the process. In Phase II, we will demonstrate the continuous film processes for graphene synthesis and transfer to new surfaces and design a large area roll-to-roll graphene production system. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is through the industrial scale availability of high quality, low cost graphene sheets. Transparent, electrically and thermally conductive, strong, flexible, and gas impermeable, graphene is an emerging ?super material? with innumerable proposed applications including flexible transparent conductors for displays and photovoltaics; high frequency electronics for communications; chemical and biological sensors; corrosion barrier; filtration and water desalination; energy storage; and many more. Industrial quantities of graphene films will enable the development of these and other applications, with substantial benefit to society. The technology that we will to develop has advantages of cost, quality, and design flexibility over competing concepts. Successful completion of this SBIR project will establish Graphene Frontiers as a leading commercial supplier of high-quality graphene to the business and research communities at an attractive price. Our business model includes revenue from sale of the graphene material, licensing of our proprietary growth technology, and specialized products. Our first graphene-based product, TEM grids for electron microscopy, is already on sale with a development partner. These advances will position Graphene Frontiers to attract additional funding from investors, customers, and other non-SBIR sources.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the technology research and development necessary to bring wireless instrumentation and smartphone technology used for feedback to lower-limb amputees about their real-time performance, for rehabilitation in situ. The intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in the opportunity to transform the field of rehabilitation and to advance healthcare by enabling a fundamental shift toward low cost, ubiquitous rehabilitation that can be used away from the clinic. This proposal will research and develop the pre-market alpha- and beta-prototypes of an instrumented insole, smartphone app, and HIPAA-compliant data transfer and remote server storage and analysis system, as an essential and transformative tool utilized for physical therapy and gait training outside of the clinic. While sensors have become small, inexpensive, and highly available, many research lab applications are limited to proof-of-concept evaluations that involve tethered systems and/or post-processing of the data. This research quantifies the effect of this low-cost, personalized, wireless assistive technology that can be used away from the clinic. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for more complex rehab feedback systems, e.g. using a smartphone to detect gait and provide feedback to an orthotic or prosthetic for muscle stimulation. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes the focus on mobility limitations in persons with lower-limb amputations, which affect twice as many minorities as Caucasians. The commercial potential of this wireless assistive technology is vast: with diabetes as the major contributor to amputations, the number of amputees is forecast to triple to 3.6 million by 2050. The knowledge gained can be expanded to impact individuals with a wide variety of mobility limitations, e.g. stroke, Parkinson&#039;s disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, etc. The orthopedic market ? 773,000 total hip/knee replacements performed annually in U.S. ? is also commercially relevant, as patients must affect an asymmetric gait following fracture repair or joint replacement to reduce weight-bearing on the healing limb. Another significant group are athletes seeking to improve performance or recover from injury through precision gait analysis and real-time feedback. In this Phase II proposal, this research will quantify the effect of this wireless assistive technology by enabling persons with amputations to use individualized proprioceptive feedback and to participate in the design of the personalized feedback methods. This work will enable a wealth of information collected away from the clinic, including a way to investigate how and whether patients follow treatment protocols.",

This proposal aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel high sensitive nanosensor that can be used to determine very low concentrations of calcium in seawater in the presence of a large background calcium concentration. The sensor approach uses the benefits of nanotechnology combined with molecular recognition to achieve high sensor sensitivity and high specificity so that the measurements are not affected by other ions like magnesium. Phase I results have indeed demonstrated a calcium detection sensitivity of a 5 \u03bcM in the presence of 100 mM concentrations of calcium in seawater. It is impervious to the presence of large concentrations of interfering magnesium ions and it can work well within the time scale of a Diel cycle. These results have been obtained using seawater at laboratory conditions. The goal of Phase II is to demonstrate that the sensor will function with the same features in conditions that are relevant to the needs of NOAA \u2013 the diver should be able to take the sensor to sea depths and temperatures needed to measure, in situ, the calcium concentration close to the coral itself.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Toyon Research Corporation proposes to develop a standalone, passive stereo camera imaging system capable of rapidly and accurately measuring interpupillary distance (IPD), and outputting the user&quot;s IPD and the correct IPD setting for a Helmet-Mounted Display (HMD).  The proposed product will be compact, lightweight, low-power, and easy to use, enabling a single user with no additional or specialized training to implement; the user may look into the proposed product and push a single button to  automatically measure the user&quot;s IPD and display the correct setting without any user responsibility.  At the heart of the proposed technical solution to the IPD measurement problem are advanced image processing algorithms capable of pupil detection, as well as high-accuracy measurement of surfaces in 3D physical coordinates, based on calibrated stereo imaging.  The hardware prototype developed in Phase II will be a standalone version of the Phase I prototype, and will provide real-time IPD measurement using a combination of central processing unit and graphics processing unit hardware. Integrated performance demonstration and accuracy evaluation are also proposed.  The architecture developed for the prototype will be designed with the goal of full integration into an HMD system as a potential Phase III development.  BENEFIT:  The successful completion of this effort will result in a new capability to rapidly, accurately, and automatically measure IPD distances for adjustment of HMD stereoscopic imagery. There is the possibility of direct transition of this technology into Air Force and other DoD HMD applications, including the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program and simulated flight trainers. The technology could also be transitioned into use in the larger market of civilian aircraft flight training. There are many other similar applications in vehicle simulation training to which the developed measurement device could be applied with minimal additional non-recurring engineering (NRE) cost, including automotive or tank training simulators.  There are a plethora of other fields where stereoscopic helmet displays can be utilized for simulation training or augmented reality purposes, such as remote or robotic surgery or UAV/UGV remote piloting.  Medical applications could also benefit from more advanced 3D surface modeling and measurement algorithms, as well as the possibility of using stereoscopic displays for surgical training or utilization in remote medicine applications. Measuring IPD is a standard optometric technique for fitting glasses for those in need of corrective eyewear, and one goal of this Phase II effort is to begin to transition the developed prototype into that market as a standalone device at competitive pricing.  Adaptation to some of these new applications might require considerably more development, but the potential return on the investment is substantial.",

MFEC based Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) will convert biomass and/or bio-based carbon resources into high-quality liquid fuels with a ca. 50% reduction in Lifetime Green Gas Emissions (LGGE) compared with current biorefining processes. In the preceding Phase II effort, IntraMicron demonstrated that MFECs provided a 250-fold increase in effective thermal conductivity relative to packed beds, generating a near-isothermal temperature profile inside a 1.5&quot;ID FTS reactor. Jet fuel was produced at the maximum theoretical selectivity while meeting the desired production rate specified by ONR. By simultaneously enhancing heat and mass transfer, MFECs permit the use of reactor diameters far greater than conventional systems without sacrificing the volumetric fuel production rate and jet fuel selectivity. This enables FTS process intensification with significant CAPEX and OPEX reductions and allows green fuels to be produced at an acceptable price level for the Navy. Modular FTS reactors can be installed for fuel production at different scales, and they can be used as stand-alone systems or combined with current biorefineries for greener fuel production.",

It is of great importance that all such materials that are integrated into fielded systems are fully capable of meeting shielding requirements; however, detecting defects or flaws that compromise performance using current methods is extremely time consuming and expensive.  Nokomis has demonstrated the potential of a new approach to detect faulty material during production, which will allow for a great deal of savings as well as improvements in reliability of shielding material.  In the Phase II, Nokomis will build prototype systems based on Phase I designs, and test the systems on Air Force-relevant production lines to prove out the technology.  Nokomis&quot;Hiawatha RF sensor technology has previously been customized for manufacturing settings, and this will serve as an advanced starting point for development supporting this application.  BENEFIT:  EMI protection or shielding is of the utmost importance in military and commercial aircraft operations. In order to maintain the integrity of aircraft functions, the materials that provide the necessary shielding need to be validated as meeting specifications.  The potential of a robust, automated solution to detect the presence of defective materials during manufacturing processes to deliver cost savings to the Air Force is extensive.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This Phase-II research effort will enable propulsion engineers to design and control next generation propulsion systems (components include: combustors, augmentors, turbines, and compressors etc.) by developing a set of nonlinear analysis tools that can achieve two overarching goals: efficiently analyze large numerical or experimental data sets and provide advanced data mining techniques to more quickly identify relevant dynamical system behavior.  This will be accomplished through four key technical objectives: (a) to remove noise from large data sets thereby reducing the quantity of data that needs to be further analyzed by separating the noise from nonlinear dynamics, (b) to remove redundant information from large sets of data to reduce the equivalent of 1 TB of raw data to ~200 GB depending on the flow conditions, (c) to identify dynamically significant information within a very short amount of time to understand the underlying physics of the spatio-temporal dynamical systems, and (d) to develop a set of dynamical invariant tools to compare experimental and numerical data in order to influence the development of next generation war fighters as well as extending the life of existing war fighters.   The development of the data analysis tools are required to exploit the current state-of-the-art laser-based measurement systems, which routinely provide 2D temperature and species concentration measurements at a rate of 10 to 50 kHz, as well as to analyze reacting/non-reacting flow data generated by state-of-the-art numerical simulations.  The proposed research effort will deliver a user-friendly software module that can be easily integrated to other commercial software systems for analysis of experimental and computational data.  BENEFIT:  This research effort on the development nonlinear spatio-temporal data analysis tools would allow investigation of turbulent reacting and non-reacting flow phenomena in a real-time basis.  This tool set should also allow devising intelligent control strategies for the development of intelligent engines and will have a major impact on understanding of high-speed time-evolving phenomena related to ignition, flame growth, and stability in turbine engine augmentors/afterburners.  Hence, this research effort along with methods to analyze high-speed planar and tomographic images will make the concept of real time sensing and control of combustion phenomena a reality.  The proposed software system could be easily integrated with any on-board sensing and control system, which would have a significant impact on engine health and stability for the war fighter.  Furthermore, in the modeling of non-reacting and reacting flows, it is of great importance to study the interactions among various temporal and spatial scales to understand and predict the complex behavior under turbulent conditions. The objective of this effort is to develop various nonlinear analysis tools for the interpretation of high-bandwidth numerical and experimental data for comparison and validation. The software system should be applicable for any high-bandwidth experimental or numerical data, and as such will have a very broad commercial application covering most of the Universities, Government laboratories, engine companies, automobile companies, etc.  Renewed interest in diverse and alternative fuels makes the proposed data analysis tools particularly timely for addressing a number of important research and development needs in high-performance, clean power production from sustainable sources.",

The techniques strongly being considered after Phase I series of tests are ECN, DCPD and LPR. The modeling effort will characterize the corrosion rate from first principles using DFT and KMC techniques as well as continuum models.  TDAs vision is to develop predictive capability for environmentally assisted crack initiation in Navy specific material-environment and loading conditions in UniCorr, an easy to use software capable of simulation studies by incorporating critical laboratory tests and service data, and develop prototype sensors for corrosion monitoring and small crack detection by investigating potential combination of different NDE for damage detection.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant   This project aims to demonstrate that the evolution of plant biosynthetic pathways can be accelerated and driven to favor the synthesis of ligands which interact with a specific human target protein  This is achieved by subjecting mutant plant cells to selection pressures favoring the survival of mutants with the phenotype of interest  As an example  this approach will be used to optimize pharmacological activity in Lobelia cardinalis  which inhibits the human dopamine transporter  hDAT   putatively by its ability to synthesize the complex alkaloid  lobinaline  A stable transgenic line of L  cardinalis plant cells expressing the hDAT has been established  These cells show increased sensitivity to toxins transported into the cell by the hDAT  including the neurotoxin MPP   A large  genetically diverse  population of gain of function mutants expressing the hDAT has now been generated  and selected on medium containing    uM MPP   which kills the vast majority of the transgenic mutants  However  individual mutants that are over producing inhibitors of the hDAT have a survival advantage  so that the MPP  resistant population is greatly andquot enrichedandquot  in clones with this bioactivity  Preliminary GC MS analysis of individual MPP  resistant mutants with increased hDAT inhibitory activity indicates that many of these are overproducing lobinaline  but the rest are generating other metabolites  some of which are not detectable in the wild type plant  Phase II is designed to demonstrate that this biotechnology can be used to  a  generate novel natural products with a specific valuable pharmacology  b  provide a biosynthetic production system for these compounds in mutant plants  The process should be of particular value when a plant derived lead compound  such as lobinaline  is too complex for chemical synthesis  The first specific aim is to analyze the remaining MPP  resistant population to determine those individuals in which lobinaline content cannot explain increased hDAT inhibitory activity  Separation  assay guided preparative HPLC  and tentative identification  GC MS  of active compounds will be followed by pharmacological evaluation in vitro  in comparison with lobinaline and a synthetic inhibitor of the hDAT  The most active compounds will then be tested for functional effects on the DAT in rat brain in vivo using electrochemistry  In parallel studies  the\nmutant clonal cultures which are overproducing active metabolites to the greatest extent will be regenerated to intact mutant plants  and extracts analyzed to establish whether the pharmacological  chemical phenotype is retained  The ultimate aim is to commercialize the technology as a platform for discovering and producing novel plant derived natural products targeted on specific human CNS proteins    \n   \nPUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Plants are a major source of existing medicines  but the pharmaceutical industry has now almost abandoned this source in favor of synthetic chemicals  One reason is that plant metabolites are often too complex for synthetic methods to be used for their modification or production  The technology being developed by Naprogenix uses the plants own biosynthetic capacity to modify the active chemicals contained in the plant  It is also capable of increasing the amounts of the active chemicals that are present  The andquot directed evolutionandquot  of a plant species using this technology is capable of generating novel compounds that may be of value in many CNS diseases  for example the targets in this project are important in drug dependence and neurodegenerative disease",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The United States Space Surveillance Network (SSN) is a critical part of the US Strategic Command&#039;s (USSTRATCOM) missions and involves detecting, tracking, cataloging and identifying the numerous artificial objects of various natures orbiting the Earth. The modernization requirement of the SSN faces three key challenges: 1) how to seamlessly upgrade the SSN with modern COTS hardware without software porting; 2) how to improve the accuracy of target tracking by collaborating geographically spread sensors; 3) how to dynamically schedule tracking tasks to respond to unexpected space events. Intelligent Automation, Inc. propose a Long-term Sustainable Net-centric Framework for Space Surveillance Networks (LOSSLESS). LOSSLESS can run both legacy and new software on top of modern COTS hardware by leveraging the state-of-the-art Virtual Machine technologies. With the proposed distributed net-centric data fusion algorithm, LOSSLESS has a potential to improve the tracking accuracy of the current SSN. The dynamic tasking algorithm can be applied to maintain the SSN&quot;s day-to-day tracking missions and dynamically re-task the sensor assets to manage emergency space events. In Phase I we developed a preliminary system to show its feasibility. We will further develop a fully functional prototype system to demonstrate its effectiveness, efficiency and practicality in Phase II.  BENEFIT:  The proposed solution has great potential in various military applications. The legacy systems (both hardware and software) of the United States Space Surveillance Network (SSN) require major capital investment to re-host and rewrite the software for the upgrades. Similar cases are happening for the updates of many military weapon control hardware and software systems (e.g., F-16 general avionics computer, AC-130H gunship mission computer SKC-3007A, MH-60K mission computer AP-102A, etc.). Potential applications of our LOSSLESS framework include SSN and military weapon system. The market size of the upgrading military legacy systems is expected to grow rapidly as more and more legacy computer system cannot meet the update to date mission requirements. The dynamic tasking algorithms may add value to warfighter&quot;s dynamic resource management and mission analysis within various C4ISR systems. Beyond DOD, we also plan to transition the technologies to commercial applications, such as commercial avionics radars, weather monitoring systems, and air traffic management. The size of the market is quite large and will keep growing rapidly with the commercial demand of upgrading the system with modern COTS hardware and the needs of dynamic resource tasking of resources in modern networked environments.",

        "abstract": "The proposed effort will characterize the effect demonstrated in the preceding Phase I effort, in which energy was deposited in the air under a vehicle, in order to create low-density channels within the air. These low-density channels underneath the vehicle were demonstrated to preferentially guide high-pressure blast gases out from under the vehicle at high speed, thereby relieving the pressure under the vehicle and mitigating the upward force on it from said blast gases. In the proposed Phase II effort, we will experimentally investigate/demonstrate the effect we observed in our Phase I computational fluid dynamics effort. In addition to continuing our modeling effort, we will perform measurements to determine the degree to which the computational results capture the experimental dynamics. This will be accomplished through parametric studies, both computationally as well as experimentally, to the degree possible. For the proposed Phase II Option effort, we intend to add soil (sand), to determine its effect on the gas dynamics and our technique&#039;s ability to mitigate the effect of the blast gases under these circumstances.",

REMS measures, stores, and communicates information about radiation dose, dose rate, and angle of incidence. It also differentiates between types of radiation including all particles composed of electrons, protons, and neutrons. The small, low-power nature of REMS will have minimal logistical impact on its host platforms, and its ability to change measurement characteristics after deployment significantly increases  its long-term relevance in the event of changing regulations and updated weather models. The real-time capabilities of REMS will enable ground controllers to mitigate the effect of significant weather events on satellites.  BENEFIT:  Invocon&quot;s Radiation Environment Monitor for Spacecraft (REMS) is useful for monitoring satellites and other spacecraft to determine the real-time space weather to which they are subjected. This technology is small and low power making it useful for both large and small satellites.

The goal is to improve EMA reliability, safety, and maintainability by detecting and diagnosing equipment failure modes and remaining useful life.   Frontier Technology, Inc. (FTI), in partnership with the Moog Aircraft Group, will demonstrate in real-time, on an embedded EMA controller and actuator, under realistic operational conditions PHM technology that can detect indicators of future failures, diagnose the cause of the problem, predict mission and component impact and cause corrective action to be taken. The PHM technology developed will be compatible with sixth-generation energy optimized aircraft. The engineering team will introduce electronic and mechanical faults as realistically as possible with focus on those failure modes that are of highest priority to users of EMA technology. The assessment of PHM performance will include false alarm rate, missed faults, diagnostic and prognostic accuracy, and computational performance.  FTI will also extend the reliability analysis initiated during Phase I to show how goals of 10e-7 per flight hour for Probability of Loss of Function and 1.5x10e-5 per flight hour for Probability of Loss of Control are positively impacted by the application of PHM technology.  BENEFIT:  The application of PHM technology for real-time, accurate fault detection, diagnosis, prognosis and corrective action can enhance EMA utilization, maximize mission readiness and minimize lifecycle costs. The technology is directly applicable to EMAs used for primary flight control surfaces and engine/nozzle actuation.  It is also applicable to any electro-mechanical system critical to successful accomplishment of mission objectives (air, ground or sea) for government and industry.  Deployment of the technology begins with developers and integrators of EMAs and by operators of systems that employ them.  The Moog Aircraft Group is the projected first user of the technology.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Air Force and other DoD organizations require accurate knowledge of the ionospheric environment to understand and predict its impacts on vital radio-based systems, including communications, navigation, and surveillance systems. The DoD has placed requirements in the IORD-II document for measurements of the ionosphere that include specification of ionospheric properties such as electric fields and electron density profiles (EDP). The objective of this work is to investigate the development of a next- generation, advanced, miniature, topside ionospheric sounder (TIS) that is compatible with nano-satellite infrastructures and can be integrated with a Double-Probe E-field instrument. To address this objective we propose to:    i) Design, build, and test a 3-axis topside ionospheric sounder with loop antenna system that is 6U-CubeSat compatible.  ii) Design, build, and test a prototype rigid boom double probe electric field sensor that is CubeSat compatible.  iii) Integrate and test the TIS and DP to deliver a single CubeSat sized instrument package that can provide both the capability of traditional ionospheric sounding (remote sensing) and in-situ electric field measurements.    iv) Develop analysis software for the topside ionograms.    BENEFIT:  At the end of Phase-II, we will deliver a prototype combined Topside Sounder and Dual Probe Electric Field instrument package suitable for bench-top evaluation. Phase II work will have demonstrated the feasibility of combining and operating a topside sounder with a Dual Probe E-field instrument in a resource constrained CubeSat platform. The resulting design would provide AFRL with a new capability for space weather monitoring  fulfilling critical SSAEM ionospheric objectives. The work complements the proposal teams existing effort on the development of DIME E-field probe and expertise in the low-power FMCW systems for ionospheric sounding. The observations most needed to advance space weather for the DoD are distributed multipoint measurements of the electric field and EDP in the space environment. The combined TIS/DP instrument will enable the DoD to affordably achieve these observations by flying this low-power instrument package on a constellation of miniature satellites.",

The system will be designed with a goal of 1 kHz repetition rate and will ultimately reach a pulse energy of 100 mJ in two OPA stages. The OPA process was chosen due to its inherent 100% efficiency, i.e., all input laser energy is either instantaneously transferred to the signal and idler beams or stays in the pump. A number of novel techniques demonstrated in Phase I will increase the energy transfer into the signal and idler beams to over 90%. These same techniques will reduce the small absorption of the idler beam in the OPA crystals to less than 1 Watt each at the full 100 Watt average output power. Combined with efficiency improvements in other aspects of the laser system these techniques will reduce the required pump energy by 75%. The use of pulsed DPSS technology and other novel techniques in the pump laser will reduce the thermal load on the gain modules to a sufficiently small level to allow for 1 kHz operation.",

        "abstract": "Very low cost (pico and pocket) projectors provide an opportunity to achieve significant cost reduction for immersive visual display systems currently used in training applications. Traditional methods to achieve very large fields of view utilize expensive, high resolution display devices. The cost of these technologies force the end user to make significant tradeoffs with respect to either total field of view or resolution. Acquiring both quickly becomes unaffordable to their training budget. The implementation of new, very low cost projectors provide an appealing alternative that when combined with the proper support systems can produce affordable alternatives that can achieve both large field of view and very high resolution. Several technologies must be developed or greatly improved in order to derive a deployable, sustainable design using more display channels than the high cost alternatives.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This proposal is for Phase II continuation of research and development for an Adaptive Trustworthiness Calibration Interface (ATCI) for Cyber Warfare and Supervisory Control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. Our Phase II proposal is based on a complete understanding of the problem to be solved, a solid record of achievement in Phase I, and a comprehensive and achievable Phase II Work Plan.  The ATCI program goal is to enhance a system operator&#039;s decision making by providing trust cues so that his or her perceived trustworthiness of system matches its actual trustworthiness, thus yielding calibrated trust. Our approach to meeting this goal is to provide the operator with visualization tools to diagnose the actual trustworthiness of the system by showing the risk and uncertainty of the associated information. We measure and model the trust of the operator in real-time, and adapt the display so that an operator who incorrectly trusts too much is encouraged to trust less, and an operator who incorrectly mistrusts is encouraged to trust more.  By focusing on both individual operator&quot;s trust and the transparency of the system, we realize calibrated trust for optimal decision-making to support operators during all phases of mission execution.  BENEFIT:  In this project we are addressing these several challenges by developing ATCI tools for trustworthiness calibration in a variety of cases, including the management and control of multiple, heterogeneous UAV platforms.  Our ATCI tools will include innovative trustworthiness diagnosis displays, an adaptive interface controller, and real-time measurement and modeling of trust.  To accomplish this we will design, develop, demonstrate and evaluate the ATCI first in a developmental setting and then in scenario-based, human-in-the-loop field evaluations.  We will provide the AFRL with a standalone experimental station deliverable that will permit investigators to continue development and testing of the ATCI tools.  And finally, we will pursue specific dual-use military and civilian applications of the ATCI products to rapidly transition the ATCI technology and leverage the capabilities of operators in a variety of automated systems.",

An inherently low cost manufacturing process of coating the composite separator on a reuseable release substrate followed by delamination is shown on full scale production equipment to make the free-standing composite separator at high quality.  The heat stable properties are obtained from using aluminum oxide particles at over 75% by weight that prevent any shrinkage of the composite separator.  The mechanical strength without any brittleness is obtained from using a strong and flexible polymer with excellent lithium ion battery compatibility, so that the composite separator exceeds the tensile strength requirements while providing a high porosity and electrolyte conductivity over the battery lifetime.  This composite separator can be incorporated into lithium ion batteries using existing manufacturing processes as a direct drop-in replacement for the current plastic separators that shrink greatly starting at 120C and is generic for use with various electrolyte and electrode materials for safer, lower cost, and higher performing lithium ion batteries for vehicles and other applications.",

Our Phase I effort demonstrated, with simulated sensor data and laptop processes that mimicked on-board processors, that we could generate and apply calibration coefficients that depended on the operational condition of the sensor.  The effort proposed herein takes this demonstration to the next step, where 2-D imagery data taken under multiple operating conditions from a simulated or real sensor will be the data source, and the on-board processor will be a Single Board Computer (SBC).  BENEFIT:  The benefit to the Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) and Space Situational Awareness (SSA) remote sensing communities of a robust autonomous satellite system that can intelligently manage on-orbit recalibration is that is enabling technology for&quot;smart satellite&quot;operations with minimal ground supervision or interaction.  The&quot;smart satellite&quot;will have a process to recognize events that require recalibration, which would enable the satellite to continue its mission once the recalibration has been completed and verified in the face degrading situations that heretofore would have prevented the completion of the mission.",

        "abstract": "In Phase II of this SBIR program, Photonic Systems, Inc. (PSI) proposes to further develop its High-power Interference Canceller (HPIC), which functionally is inserted into the receive chain of a SIGINT or other receiver between the antenna and the front end.   The PSI approach is based on cancelling, instead of timing, filtering or attenuation, to reduce the deleterious effects of interfering signal(s).  A prime advantage of HPIC is that it operates continuously on interfering signals whose spectra overlap  or even coincide  with the signal-of-interest.  To enable the HPIC to be applied to existing as well as future tactical mounted and dismounted systems with severe size, weight, power and cost (SWaP-C) constraints, PSI plans in this phase to significantly reduce the SWaP-C through the extensive integration of the circuit.  To address the needs of both existing (legacy) and new radios, PSI plans to develop HPIC in forms suitable for both.  For legacy radios, HPIC will be made available in a package that connects directly to the radio and its antenna, without requiring any change to either the radio or its antenna.  For new receiver designs, the HPIC chip would be incorporated directly into the receiver front end.",

Important project milestones for the first base year of Phase II are as follows: (1) implementation of the DICOS standard including network protocol, (2) improvement of the proposed ATR algorithm in terms of explosive detection performance and computational efficiency, (3) development of plug-in ATR software with the DICOS standard, and (4) optimal parameter tuning using the receiver operating characteristics analysis. The goal of the second option year of Phase II is to be ready for the certification test by continuing improving the ATR algorithm and optimizing parameters via extensive experiments with training datasets. With the successful completion of Phase II work, we expect that our ATR algorithm will outperform existing ATR algorithms of EDS vendors in terms of PD and PFA while meeting the certification requirement of throughput. If our ATR algorithm is certified by TSL and used for EDS, it will contribute to enhance aviation security significantly. Since our ATR algorithm will be able to lower PFA while maintaining PD of the current state-of-the-art EDS, it will be also able to reduce the cost related to manual inspection of alarmed bags.",

        "abstract": "The ability to reliably track and recognize individuals inside a security perimeter is a critical component of next-generation distributed security systems. While state-of-the-art surveillance systems can reliably track pedestrians in sparse, static environments with minor occlusions and few moving subjects, performance degrades rapidly as scene complexity and crowd density increase. The problem becomes even more difficult when tracking individuals over long time scales, or across cameras with non-overlapping fields of view, a scenario which is unavoidable in most urban environments. Existing systems are also unable to re-acquire individuals who have been previously tracked in a separate location, but for whom recent track data is unavailable.\nTo address these issues, we propose a system for Remote Identification and Tracking of Non-Cooperative Subjects (REMIT-NCS). REMIT-NCS extracts stable, descriptive signatures from tracked individuals in surveillance imagery by reconstructing a tracked individual's anthropometric parameters (shape and pose) and using these to produce higher-order, viewpoint-insensitive signatures from the individual's intrinsic attributes (e.g., physical build and motion characteristics) and extrinsic attributes (i.e., outward appearance). The combined intrinsic and extrinsic signatures are then compared to a database of similarly processed tracks to identify the features most suitable for supporting long-term tracking and re-acquisition. Persons moving from one camera view to another are then re-acquired by the system via the resulting discriminative models, enabling persistent tracking of individuals throughout the facility.",

        "abstract": "Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) are tasked with exploiting X-ray inspection systems to detect potential threats. To ensure efficient operation and the safety of the traveling public, TSOs must maintain a 100% probability of detection (Pd) while minimizing screening time. To achieve these objectives, X-ray inspection systems must operate in accordance with manufacturer specifications, and be calibrated to maximize Pd and reduce screening time. The ASTM X-ray Test Object aims to evaluate image quality (IQ) with respect to Pd to support optimal system calibration. However, the ASTM is fundamentally flawed for several reasons: (1) it is prone to operator bias; (2) it is not directly representative of real-world operation; (3) it does not quantify the relationship between IQ and Pd; and (4) it cannot handle moving objects, and is therefore ineffective for exploring the use of continuously rotating conveyor belts to speed up the screening process.\nTo address these concerns, we designed, developed, and demonstrated a prototype for Objective X-ray Image Display Evaluation (OXIDE). OXIDE uses a predictive approach to assess functional IQ during normal operation, producing a single General Image Score that can cue the operator to potential image degradations. The system leverages our existing object detection and IQ technologies to achieve robust and purely objective IQ evaluation for X-ray screening systems.  The Phase I prototype accurately predicts functional IQ on real X-ray imagery that has been randomly degraded, corresponding well to a human's qualitative interpretation of relative image quality, and demonstrating the feasibility of our predictive IQ assessment approach.",

The developed algorithms will provide jitter compensation and suppression of clutter to below the level of the sensor noise, based on advanced spatiotemporal clutter estimation and rejection techniques. The developed algorithms will also provide early detection of missile launches based on near-optimal exploitation of high-frame-rate sensor data, and high-confidence detection and tracking of multiple maneuvering bright and extremely dim targets in standard-frame-rate data. The proposed detection and tracking algorithms are based on innovative development in a Bayesian track-before-detect framework. The developed algorithms will be implemented in efficient, modular software libraries which will be delivered to the government, along with a prototype software application demonstrating end-to-end operation of the developed sensor processing system. The Toyon team will support integration of the developed software libraries and prototype software application, and will perform extensive testing, algorithm evaluation, and demonstration using real-world data from high-frame-rate and standard-frame rate sensors. Testing with physics-based simulated data and semi-synthetic/semi-real data will also be performed, to address the range of applications of interest to the government.  BENEFIT:  The successful completion of this R&D will result in advanced algorithms and an efficient software implementation for detection of extremely dim signals from space-based EO/IR sensor platforms. Primary applications include early detection of missile launches and high-confidence tracking of multiple dim targets. Additional applications include airborne- and ground/surface-based sensing onboard manned and unmanned platforms. The developed algorithms and software can be directly applied to real-time processing in SBIRS ground stations. The developed technology is also expected to be directly applicable to battle space awareness and technical intelligence, and is also well-suited for transition into the PTSS and SBSS systems. The proposed technology has the potential to enable detection of target signals which were previously not exploited due to the low level of the signals, due to signal scattering and/or long sensor-target standoff ranges. Thus, the proposal technology has applications in counter-terrorism, law enforcement, and a variety of civilian applications, in addition to many military applications.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR aims to develop a novel method for detection of bondline damage in composite joints. The implementation of structural health monitoring (SHM) into aerospace applications has been hindered by component quantity, including sensors, cables, and acquisition/computation units, as well as data quality. Particularly for large-area applications such as wing skins, complexity of the implied system infrastructure can be impractical, and data effected by attenuation and EMI-pickup along analog cables. The payoff of reliable SHM would be the ability to detect/characterize in-situ damage for condition-based maintenance, thereby greatly reducing overall life-cycle costs. Metis Design Corporation has demonstrated a digital sensor-bus, which minimizes SHM infrastructure and EMI susceptibility. During this SBIR, MDC further exploited this low-mass, long-range, scalable SHM architecture to satisfy Navy requirements for detection of bondline failure for ribs and other composite joints that are inaccessible inside the wingbox. During Phase I, testing was conducted at Triumph/Vought on actual Triton wing skin segments, demonstrating the ability to ascertain the integrity of bonded composite doublers following impact events. The Phase II effort will continue to mature this technique performing system-level sensor placement optimization, calibrating damage quantification algorithms, formulating a statistical probability of detection and qualifying packaging for the operating environment.",

Based on analysis and air-gun testing, as well as legacy performance of MSIs munition, key characteristics of the explosive detection munition include over 25 square inch coverage area, 90% accuracy to 100 meters, non-lethality, and leveraging the use of an existing launcher (M-203), in addition to the objective of conveyance of various marking and/ or noxious liquids or powders.  The Phase I project starting point was a high-TRL extended range kinetic energy non-lethal 40mm munition, demonstrated to possess ballistic stability and accuracy at 100m, as developed under a previous Phase II/II Plus project funded by Picatinny Arsenal.  In A12-007 Phase I, MSI succeeded in consistently achieving the coverage area and visibility requirements specified, demonstrating explosive detection feasibility.  Phase II goals include: a) achieve TRL 6+ with special attention to statistical demonstration of coverage, accuracy, nonlethality, and manufacturability, b) expand the product to include alternate explosive material detection chemicals, and c) establish a larger family of 40 non-lethal mm projectiles to deliver IR marking material, pepper spray, etc.",

        "abstract": "The LOCUST40mm is a surveillance system that is fired from a standard M320 grenade launcher.  It provides unique capabilities not offered by other 40mm-launched systems and fills an important capability gap currently faced by ground troops.  In particular, the LOCUST40mm has significant greater range, endurance, and maneuvering flexibility than existing 40mm-launched camera systems.  It is capable of gliding unpowered for over 1km from launch, at which point a contra-rotating motor/propeller system allows the vehicle to perform both a true hover with the vehicle oriented vertically, and forward flight with the vehicle oriented horizontally like a conventional airplane.  Hovering facilitates maintaining a fixed sensor view of a stationary target and maneuvering in confined space such as inside building, while forward flight facilitates tracking of moving targets.  Optical cameras will be the first sensors integrated with the system, but a modular payload bay will allow a wide variety of sensors to be used.  The Phase II program will develop the complete guidance and control system for the LOCUST40mm vehicle, develop a 40mm round integrating the vehicle as its payload, and conduct extensive tests of both aerodynamic performance of the vehicle and launch survivability of the design.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the development of a novel self-sealing materials technology for the primary application of designing durable blood access systems for hemodialysis patients. Nearly 580,000 people in the United States alone have end stage renal disease (ESRD), and over 400,000 people are treated using hemodialysis as the primary mode of treatment. Current access systems are neither designed for repeated access nor managing bleeding after hemodialysis treatment, and as a result commonly lead to secondary complications. The research aims of the proposal are to: 1) Develop manufacturing methods for device production, 2) Determine biocompatibility of the materials technology, and 3) Develop an animal model to evaluate potential clinical impact. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will yield a unique and novel material that will create a paradigm shift from the treatment of complications due to hemodialysis to prevention. This will address clinical market needs and shift reimbursement policies to create better clinical outcomes and contain costs. Currently, $27 billion is spent on the delivery of hemodialysis treatment for ESRD patients. The materials technology under development will lead to vascular access devices suitable for nearly the entire hemodialysis patient population, thereby creating an estimated addressable market size of more than $500 million. This research will enhance scientific understanding by introducing novel engineering and manufacturing methods for a broad range of applications beyond hemodialysis where repeated access and reliable sealing is required.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will design and build a technology platform that allows cloud infrastructures to run clients&#039; tasks with full computation privacy. The cloud provider itself is unable to access to customers&#039; workloads even in the presence of malicious-intent direct physical access to the hardware itself. The technology significantly increases cloud defense capabilities, and provides strong computation privacy, and regulatory compliance guarantees to any regulatory- and security-sensitive customers. This level of security is achieved by (i) endowing a traditional infrastructure with a collaborative security layer of active transparent defense and control, a cloud ?immune system?, and (ii) new mechanisms that allow full computation privacy for outsourced tasks. The immune system has its own control network and can instantly share critical information and react independently for meaningful operation and fast recovery even under sustained attack and severe compromise. It also transparently monitors and accesses the server runtimes and can strongly react and immediately present a united defense across the entire cloud. Moreover, inherent privacy and confidentiality assurances allow safe computation execution and data hosting with full security, even in the case of a compromised curious service provider with full physical access to the infrastructure. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will manifest itself in all dimensions of our increasingly internet and cloud-reliant society and technology. Because clouds introduce significant risks, technology-backed comprehensive security and privacy assurances are essential to establish cloud computing as a truly viable alternative to in-house IT. Unfortunately, these guarantees are not achievable with any of today&#039;s offerings or research efforts, despite being direly needed by all major potential cloud adopters, including financial, governmental and healthcare markets, heavily governed by security, regulatory compliance and intellectual property constraints. As a result, rather than risk regulatory compliance breaches, and unauthorized access to proprietary business logic, these major markets have simply not adopted the cloud. Countless surveys outline security and privacy consistently as the top concern preventing adoption, and markets have reacted with strong reservations. This project develops a disruptive technology that bridges this gap and makes cloud adoption secure and attractive in all these markets. As a result it will lead to exponential cross-market growth. Finally, enabling cloud deployment with full computation privacy, regulatory compliance and data confidentiality will significantly increase enterprise agility and competitiveness.",

Phase II innovations include: extending the limits of image-based feature detection through unique algorithms based on 3D models automatically generated from photographs; isolating meaningful characters from noise across an array of surface shapes; classifying the characters of many dialects based on geometric characteristics; and performing automatic translation using graph-based algorithms and rules engines rather than traditional word-by-word methods.

Progress in biotechnology research in recent years has shown promise for cell reprogramming and extremely sensitive medical diagnostics, yet this research requires effective, precise, and gentle transfection of cells - for which a robust tool is currently lacking. The NFP-E technology is capable of filling this need by enabling single-cell electroporation for dosage-controlled transport of biomolecules, proteins, or drugs into a cell. By applying a low electric potential to a target cell, small pores in the cell membrane are generated, which allows for delivery of molecules into cells in a way that is more efficient and less invasive than any other method of transfection used today. This proposed project has three primary goals: to establish protocols for various cell types and transfection agents, to fabricate a microwell plate that couples with the NFP-E, and to develop software algorithms to automate alignment and electroporation control. These developments will create a robust system with exceptional process control and cell viability that is suitable for relatively high throughput single-cell transfection applications. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project stems from the unprecedented capabilities that the novel tool will provide to researchers and biotechnology companies for manipulation and interrogation of cellular processes, benefiting fundamental biology research and the development of personalized medicine applications. This project will enhance the scientific and technological understanding of fundamental electroporation mechanisms and single cell analysis techniques by combining nanofabrication, microfluidics, biophysics, and molecular biology aspects. The NFP-E tool will allow scientists to use primary cells for research applications, providing a more meaningful link between laboratory research and human disease pathophysiology. In addition, this new tool could make the promise of personalized medicine feasible and practical by enabling new capabilities in biotechnology and providing a robust commercial instrument for single-cell studies toward discoveries that elucidate disease mechanisms, focus drug discovery efforts, and personalize disease diagnosis and therapies.",

This integration problem can be challenging when different formats and terminology are used to describe the same entity. This problem can be addressed by a statistical learning approach that allows a system to estimate the probability of a match between entity references, rather than computing a score based on ad-hoc rules or weights. The research focuses on refinements to this statistical learning approach that will enable a system to handle diverse types of real-world data. Because the approach is based on sound statistical principles and uses evidence compiled from large datasets, it can produce more accurate results than existing commercial methods. Moreover, these advantages are amplified when handling data that that has highly variable, missing or noisy attributes, such as data extracted from websites. The broader impact of this project lies in enabling enterprises to perform more accurate and reliable data integration. Today, enterprises often have difficulty utilizing data extracted from unstructured or semi-structured source because the extracted data is noisy and difficult to integrate. This capability is critical for some of the nation&#039;s largest companies and institutions. For instance, the technology being developed in this project will reduce the cost of integrating data from hospitals and health information providers.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on a novel ultrasonic acoustophoretic separation technology that is economic, efficient, sustainable, and environmentally benign. Current technologies, e.g., hydrocyclones, and membrane filtration, suffer from problems, such as high energy costs, use of consumables, fouling, and limited efficiency in separation of micron-sized particles. The proposed technology does not generate waste, does not use consumables, operates at a low energy cost, and provides efficient separation for micron-size particles. Ultrasonic standing waves are used to trap secondary phase particles in a fluid stream, when the acoustic radiation force exerted on the particles is stronger than the combined effect of fluid drag and buoyancy. The action of the acoustic forces on the trapped particles results in agglomeration and/or coalescence of particles and droplets. Heavier than water particles are separated through enhanced gravitational settling, and lighter particles through enhanced buoyancy. During Phase I, successful prototypes were designed with a separation efficiency of more than 90% of a 1000 ppm emulsion at flow rates of 2500 Liters per minute. Phase II focuses on the development of a system capable of processing 4 gpm, with fully integrated customized electronics, and testing of the system on real-world emulsions. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the novel acoustophoretic separation technology provides for a cheaper and lower cost of energy separation of multi- component phase mixtures. It can function as a drop-in replacement for conventional separation technology, such as hydrocyclones and other methods. The societal impact is the development of separation technologies that are sustainable and environmentally benign since they do not generate any waste or use consumables. Enhanced extraction of micron-sized oil droplets from water offer opportunities for enhanced oil recovery and oil-spill cleanup and reduce the emission of micron-sized oil droplets into the environment. This project increases the science and technology behind the use of acoustic radiation force on large volume flow rate. Full numerical models will be created to use in conjunction with experimental results. Dissemination of this work will be done by publishing our results in peer reviewed journals and conferences. This project provides several internships to undergraduate engineering students, an opportunity to learn and practice engineering, innovation, and entrepreneurship at a small start-up company.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop a novel radio-frequency (RF) sensing method to provide a real-time measurement of black carbon emissions. The feasibility of this concept was demonstrated in Phase I, and engine emissions measurements are targeted in Phase II. Accurate measurement and characterization of black carbon emissions are hampered by the lack of low-cost, portable measurement systems suitable for use in the field. This information is critical to ensure regulatory compliance, and diagnose engine malfunctions leading to inefficient operation and high soot emissions. Currently there exist two broad classes of instruments used for monitoring black carbon: (1) expensive laboratory instruments, and (2) low-cost, portable devices with limited utility. This work will bridge this gap, by utilizing radio frequencies to provide a direct, real-time measurement of black carbon. The research will investigate using inexpensive RF technologies, similar to those used in cellular phones, which are ideally-suited for use in a portable measurement system. The Phase II work will build on the results of Phase I, specifically focusing on pushing the limits of this sensing method to increase low-level sensitivity, and increase functionality by identifying other particle constituents in the black carbon. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will address a currently unmet market need for the development of a black carbon emissions measurement system, which will enable further black carbon emissions reduction and provide tangible benefits to human health and the environment. Recent studies indicate a warming potential for black carbon 2,000 times greater than the equivalent amount of CO2, and have also linked the pollutant to a range of adverse health effects, including cancer. Regulators and source operators alike require tools to monitor black carbon emissions, ensure in-use compliance, and improve engine efficiency. Currently, few technologies can distinguish black carbon from other types of particulate matter. Accurate measurement systems generally range in price from $15,000 to $70,000 or more, and are ill-suited for portable use in the field. Driven by strict emissions regulations, the market for particle and black carbon measurement systems is rapidly outpacing the markets for other types of emissions analyzers. The proposed technology is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth, providing a robust, portable, and much lower-cost alternative to high-end instruments. This technology is not limited to black carbon emissions measurements, but a wide range of related applications including powder processing and nanofabrication.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS)-based moisture (dew point) measurement instrument. Trace moisture measurements are needed in a variety of industrial sectors including natural gas production and distribution, semiconductor manufacturing, pure gas supply, aerospace, and petrochemical processing. Commercially-available moisture sensors are either very expensive, or alternatively lack the required accuracy, long-term stability, and responsiveness for many existing applications. The innovative aspect of the proposed approach is the utilization of micro-electro-mechanical resonant balances coupled with a cooling element. The instrument will measure dew point using the highly accurate chilled surface technique to deposit a layer of moisture on the surface of the resonant balances, hence combining the accuracy of the chilled surface measurement technique the with small size, low power consumption and affordability enabled by MEMS. The MEMS resonant balances are capable of detecting as little as a few femto-grams of deposited moisture. Therefore, only a very small amount of gas needs to be chilled for a short period of time (i.e. low power/battery operation) to deposit sufficient water to indicate the dew point. The self-zeroing capability of the measurement technique eliminates the need for frequent maintenance and calibration. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes a significant leap forward in the moisture measurement technologies that have experienced no major development over the past several decades. The proposed new class of dew pointers offers higher accuracy, responsiveness, stability, and robustness currently unavailable at the same price range. An important immediate market with great national significance is the measurement of moisture in natural gas. In cold climates excess water in the gas pipeline can freeze the pipe shut, rendering the pipeline useless until the frozen point can be identified and cleared. Furthermore, due to the variability of the moisture content and the complete lack of suitable and affordable measurement equipment, wet gas is being used as the pricing standard in the natural gas industry, leading to pricing errors of up to 1.74%. The proposed battery- or solar-powered sensors will permit unattended operation and data transmission capability and will be installed at the natural gas wellheads as well as different points along the distribution network where these types of measurements are in high demand.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project enables an innovative high-productivity approach to manufacturing hard and brittle materials like ceramics, semiconductors, and glass. The objective of this proposal is to build on the successful Phase I feasibility study to demonstrate an efficient and productive method that could manufacture ceramic and semiconductors with excellent part quality. The process, termed Micro-Laser Assisted Machining (micro-LAM), allows a cheaper (~40-60%), faster (by two to five times), and better method of machining and manufacturing hard and brittle materials by combining the preferential heat from a laser source and extreme pressure from a diamond tool. The status quo technology for manufacturing these materials requires extensive machining hours to obtain good part quality, which is not economical. The demand for high-end ceramics and semiconductors is continuously increasing; however, high production costs have forced manufacturers to use other materials with inferior properties. The goal of this effort is to address this unmet need by commercializing the micro-LAM technology by the end of Phase II. A minimum viable product will be tested at industrial partner sites to obtain firsthand customer feedback, which is key to accelerating the commercialization process. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be felt in semiconductor (microelectronics) manufacturing, optics (mirrors and windows), and precision mechanical products (bearing and seals), where the superior properties of advanced semiconductor and engineered ceramic materials are required to achieve performance criteria. This technology will enable entirely new capabilities for production of materials and products currently not viable or achievable due to processing limitations. The micro-LAM technology also has potential applications for emerging technologies, such as wind turbines and plug-in electric vehicles, where high-power and high-temperature operation of advanced devices is required. The current target market size, including optics, semiconductor, advanced ceramics and glass parts manufacturing, is approximately $250 million, with a 15%/year growth rate. Once market acceptance is established in the target market segment, the micro-LAM tooling will be launched into the larger diamond turning machine (DTM) market, with a total size of $2.4 billion. There are approximately 10,000 DTMs in the United States alone (with ~ 500 new tools introduced per year).",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will leverage the advances we made in fabricating flexible polymer surfaces that shed water at low tilt angles while remaining superhydrophobic after abrasion. In Phase I we developed a model which correlated surface morphology with mechanical robustness. In Phase II we will apply this model to the development of a processes compatible with high speed, large-scale fabrication techniques. The roofing industry seeks material that is self-cleaning, anti-fouling and is highly resistant to weather events over time. A durable, superhydrophobic polymeric roof membrane will meet this market need. Commercial success depends on (1) qualifying production speeds up to 100 feet/min, (2) proving compliance to current product requirements and (3) showing value-add. Phase II studies will elucidate the mechanisms that contribute to the stability of the surfaces when exposed to UV light, allowing us to improve weatherability. Having demonstrated the self-cleaning properties of our polymer surfaces in Phase I, we will focus on anti-fouling properties in Phase II (i.e. low bacterial adhesion and reduced algae growth.) The broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project will be twofold. Foremost, a direct impact will be revenue and job growth in the US manufacturing sector. Secondarily, the technology will support federal policy goals on energy and the environment. Approximately $40 billion is spent annually in the US to air condition buildings. DOE funded studies show that in warm climates, substituting a cool roof for a conventional roof can reduce carbon emissions which drive climate change. Cool roofs also relieve strain on the electrical grid by reducing peak power demand. Widespread use of cool roofs can improve air quality, hence human health, by slowing the formation of smog. Superhydrophobic polymer membranes fabricated using technology developed in this proposal will help keep roofs clean and better able to reflect heat. Furthermore, coating of outdoor infrastructure equipment, such as wind turbine blades and offshore energy exploration platforms, will enable the safe operation of such facilities during icing conditions due to the ability of the superhydrophobic surface to prevent ice accretion. Field tests are underway. Food handling equipment will benefit from reduced adhesion of bacteria to surfaces, thus improving food safety.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project applies a novel design to pneumatic solenoid valves that allows 20-25% of compressed air to be recycled. Given compressed air is one of the most expensive forms of stored energy, this energy-efficient design provides manufacturers with a cost effective solution for pneumatic systems using directional control valves. The basic technology has been proven to reduce compressed air use. Research objectives for this project are designed to prove the breadth of applicability and address current design factors in selecting valves. These objectives include: 1) design, production, and laboratory testing of prototypes across a spectrum of design platforms selected from commercially available valves; 2) production of durable (metal) prototypes for life-cycle testing; 3) research on safety enhancements to the original prototype design, to further ensure commercial adoption; and 4) a full-scale field test of the technology in a manufacturing environment. These objectives provide a clear path for the delivery of an energy saving valve technology that is reliable, cost-competitive, and can replace a significant portion of the multibillion-dollar worldwide solenoid valve market. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is introducing a game-changing technology into a stagnant, mature industry - pneumatic valves. The U.S. and European pneumatic valve market is $2.1 billion. The United States comprises 27% (approximately $500 million) of this total with over 70% of all manufacturing facilities employing compressed air systems. These systems utilize pneumatic solenoid valves to control air flow to actuator devices. Existing pneumatic systems are regarded as highly inefficient. The research to date has proven that this innovation will deliver a cost-competitive energy saving valve technology with the potential to apply to approximately 60% of the multi-billion dollar directional control valve market. A 20% reduction in compressed air can save U.S. manufacturers significant energy costs each year, with a national potential for $400 to 500 million in total savings. U.S. business leaders recognize the critical need for innovation in order to stay competitive. According to the 2011 Next Generation Manufacturing Study, sustainability was identified as an important area of focus. This includes designing and implementing waste and energy-use reduction to deliver superior cost performance. The proposed energy saving technology can help U.S. manufacturers stay competitive by achieving sustainability goals and reducing costs.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the challenge of automating and scaling formal equivalence verification between architectural SystemC models and RTL Verilog models for microprocessors and ASIC microcontrollers. The complexity of industrial processors, together with the differences in semantics of SystemC and Verilog, create a significant modeling gap that makes it infeasible to verify RTL Verilog implementations against their SystemC specification models. This gap impedes the progression currently taking place in EDA, wherein designers are moving upwards in the abstraction level for modeling and verifying hardware designs. Our formal equivalence verification technology will allow automatically obtaining RTL from ESL models using high-level synthesis tools, and formally verifying the correctness of the resulting models against the specification models. It will also allow manually written RTL models to be verified against ESL models originally created for architectural simulation. Expected challenges include overcoming the spatial and temporal modeling gaps, and verifying equivalence for an unlimited depth using finite equivalence formulations. By end of project, we anticipate to prototype a software program that will represent a product for architectural validation of general purpose microcontrollers, capable of proving equivalence or finding bugs with reasonable computational resources. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to make formal verification technologies scalable and directly usable by designers at higher abstraction levels, enabling exponential growth in design complexity without exponential growth in verification cost. The products resulting from this project will provide substantial benefit by ensuring design correctness for mission-critical components such as implantable medical devices, aviation hardware, and satellite/space systems. In addition to hardware verification, the work done in this project will contribute to firmware and software verification, which has utilized similar techniques in the past. It will additionally contribute to exploring industrial-oriented algorithms and heuristics in the domain of automated reasoning and constraint satisfaction problems, used in theorem proving, machine learning, scheduling optimization, gaming, and network security.",

Neither of these approaches is truly capable of addressing the vulnerability as a whole - software solutions can be bypassed and a physical peripheral device cannot secure the data that is transmitted on the bus. The proposed technology is located next to the host, so it is capable of securing the entire bus. Our specific technical objectives include the construction of a security device capable of stopping representative attacks in the USB Threat Model that are not solved by existing solutions. Such a device would enable a disruptive improvement in the field of USB cybersecurity. The anticipated results for proposed project will be the development of the product for deployment to customers. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project would be a disruptive change to USB security. USB security has become critical for many organizations with secure networks, especially healthcare, financial, and defense institutions. The number of data loss incidents over USB has exploded with the availability of smart devices and tablets.

Despite USB bans, attacks and data loss over USB continue. The proposed device is capable of providing unprecedented levels of security to USB and a framework to build future security infrastructure. To stimulate continued innovations in security and mobile devices markets, we plan to open our platform to the greater scientific and commercial community to develop the next generation of algorithms to stop attacks and data loss over USB. Since our device provides access to USB data with an API, it can enable students and professionals to rapidly ramp up their understanding of USB without the need of expensive hardware and proprietary software.

This novel source is based on distributed feedback (DFB) terahertz QCL with a lateral waveguide dimension much smaller than the wavelength (wire laser). This optical mode extends outside the waveguide, allowing an external MEMS plunger to interact with the mode and affect tuning. A cryogenically operated motor is used to deflect the MEMS plunger allowing for electronic control of output frequency. A combination of mechanical electrical Stark shift tuning will allow frequency tuning range of&gt;300 GHz with a resolution of 1 MHz. The output frequency of the TQCL will be coarsely calibrated allowing the output frequency to be selected in software. The TQCL will be housed in a small footprint cryocooler, and will have output powers greater than 100\u00b5W.

In electrostatic surface haptics, a user&#039;s finger(s) are selectively pulled down to a glass surface by an electrostatic potential, just as a capacitor&#039;s plates are attracted to one another. The enhanced normal force leads to an enhanced frictional force when the fingers are moved across the surface. By modulating the electrostatic force in response to finger position and time, a great variety of compelling haptic percepts can be created. In previous work, low voltage techniques, thin hard high dielectric coatings, a way of avoiding the necessity of grounding the user, patterns of transparent conductor that allow different fingers to experience different sensations, and some of the software controls, were developed. In Phase II, methods of finger position sensing that are fully compatible with haptic actuation will be developed. The new methods also offer the possibility of discriminating multi-touch fingers according to same or opposite hand, or the fingers of a second person on the same touchscreen. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project stems from enriched communication with touchscreen devices. Already touchscreens are of immense commercial importance. The worldwide market for touchscreen modules grew three-fold from 2009 to 2011 with smartphones, tablet computers, and automotive display applications leading the charge. Consumers have been attracted to the versatility of touchscreens as input devices, yet the absence of haptic feedback has limited accessibility for low-vision populations, exacerbated safety concerns in applications such as driving, and prohibited the aesthetics of touch from being fully developed. Surface haptics technology has the potential to address all of these weaknesses. It can be used to make user interface elements operable by touch alone, to create new interaction metaphors, and to enhance the overall user experience. By addressing known and latent needs in the marketplace, surface haptics will foster new industrial growth.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes a fundamentally new means for biogas/landfill gas desulfurization that produces negligible waste, allows for sulfur recovery/recycling, and provides annualized operating costs that are fraction of current practice. The proposed process consists of two synergistic components: a novel oxidative sulfur removal (OSR) catalytic reactor that produces elemental sulfur and a polishing adsorbent bed equipped with a unique in-situ bed-life sensor (BLS) that permits optimal adsorbent bed operation and cycling. The OSR catalyst has high contaminant tolerance, high selectivity to elemental sulfur, high activity, and low cost. After the OSR reaction and sulfur condensation, the outlet hydrogen sulfide concentration can be reduced to below 5 ppm at a conversion above 90%. If a polishing adsorbent bed is needed to achieve lower sulfur levels, it will be outfitted with an in-situ BLS that provides real-time adsorbent capacity monitoring to maximize adsorbent utilization. This approach is particularly effective for biogas/landfill gas streams with severe sulfur concentration variations; it reduces annualized operating costs by 50% to 65%, while reducing both solid waste generation (adsorbent consumption) and footprint by a factor of 10 - 30. The Broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will drastically change the landscape of biogas/landfill gas utilization by improving desulfurization economics and reducing desulfurization solid waste generation. The low-cost, environmentally benign nature of this process will not only improve the desulfurization efficiency of typical biogas sources, but it will facilitate the development of small-scale and/or high-sulfur-content biogas/landfill gas sources for renewable fuel and energy applications. Moreover, the proposed approach can eliminate large sulfur adsorbent beds for almost all current biogas/landfill gas applications with high outlet sulfur thresholds (i.e. direct heating, power generation and combined heat and power), and shrink the size of desulfurization units for advanced applications with low outlet sulfur thresholds (i.e. fuel cells and GTL). Its small footprint and scalability make this technology favorable for mobile, small-scale applications. Besides biogas/landfill gas, other gas streams including natural gas, associated gas, petroleum gas, and syngas from a variety of sources can be desulfurized using this process. BTL, CTL, GTL, and renewable electric power generation will benefit from the success of this innovation. The proposed innovation directly addresses the energy independence and security of our nation (EISA 2007).",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:   A non-intrusive sensor system for surface temperatures in harsh environments will be adapted to enable measurements on turbine blades during engine operation. The approach involves applying a layer of thermographic phosphor on top of the thermal barrier coating (TBC) of the engine component, resulting in a sensor coating that is fully compatible with the TBC and durable enough to survive the high temperature combustion gases. A spot on the engine component is illuminated by a laser pulse, causing the sensor layer to luminesce with spectral and temporal characteristics that depend on temperature. Light from the measurement spot is collected with a probe, and the luminescence signal is transmitted through a fiber optic to a remotely located detector. Signals from the detector are analyzed to provide temperature from the luminescence decay rate. There is no physical contact with the object being measured, thus rotating as well as stationary parts can be measured. Since the method does not rely on measurements of absolute intensity, it is not particularly sensitive to window fouling, and the effects of background radiation can be mitigated by using short wavelength phosphors and time gating.  BENEFIT:  The sensor system will provide engine designers and researchers with a valuable tool for measuring turbine blade temperatures that will aid in the development of advanced turbine engines. Since engine performance is directly linked to the maximum temperature of the combustion gases, the operating temperature of turbine hot section components is a critical parameter. By enabling temperature measurements of critical components with greater accuracy, engine designers will be able to reduce the permissible margin between estimated temperature and the absolute material limit, thereby enabling higher operating efficiencies, which should lead to greater thrust, lower fuel consumption, and lower emissions.",

The microstructure of the thin films reveal both continued porosity and agglomeration of the nanoparticles, issues that if resolved in the Phase II program will enable an estimated device energy density of over 30J/cc with powder loadings as low as 10v%.  The percolative composite work was even more promicing with results showing high permitivites over 4000 coupled with breakdown strengths over 30V/um . With the hope of better dispersion and coating of the particles utilizing sol-gel and/or single layer polymer deposition in the Phase II; huge gains in energy density are projected in future work.  Powdermet estimates that the achievement of 150V/m breakdown strengths in percolative composites can be used to achieve energy densities over 250J/cc in a final device; this is truly a paradigm shift in capacitor technology if it is successful. An increase to 100V/m in the percolative composites is anticipated by elimination of the last 3% porosity in the samples by using polymers  in the matrix phase.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this DoT SBIR program is to further establish the technical foundation of low friction HybridSil\u00ae Slippery Overturn Automobile Protection (SOAP) coatings on concrete barriers for drastic reductions in vehicle rollover potential and significantly increased concrete impact durability thus, enabling the rapid commercial integration of these coatings. To meet this challenge, NanoSonic has molecularly engineered its pioneering HybridSil\u00ae technology to reduce the surface friction of concrete barriers through the selective surface enrichment of self-leveling, low surface energy copolymer domains during the initial phase of this project.  Importantly, all of the proposed Phase I technical milestones were achieved during the base Phase I DoT SBIR project. Of critical significance to vehicular impact reduction and increased concrete survivability, NanoSonic worked with National Crash Analysis Center (NCAC) Federal Outdoor Impact Laboratory (FOIL) employees to successfully complete multiple concrete barrier pendulum impact tests on Phase I optimized coatings at the FOIL facility.  The success of these tests combined with  computer  simulations of full vehicle impacts with both uncoated and coated New Jersey shape concrete barriers, also performed during Phase I, underscore the exceptional impact durability and friction reducing capability  necessary for reducing vehicle roll-over potential upon barrier impact.",

The ASLRS is specifically designed to enhance the usability of Speech to Speech (S2S) Machine Foreign Language Translation (MFLT) systems for the warfighter.  The proposed ASLRS will leverage the Teams existing language identification capabilities, experience, and expertise to fulfill the requirements of an efficient MFLT preprocessor.  Best-in-class accuracy will be achieved using a combination of techniques and fusing the results.  To meet the real-time requirements, a ground-breaking, patent-pending, multi-language phonetic dictionary capable of doing phonetic recognition in all 6 target languages in a single pass will be utilized.  An open-set solution will be provided so that the ASLRS recognizes when an out-of-domain language is spoken.  To ensure that the resulting ASLRS is generally applicable, it will be architected to be an open system, ensuring that it is inter-operable with existing MFLT solutions and that it supports the addition of new languages.  To ensure that the system provides reliable results, even in noisy environment, the system will incorporate noise robust features.  Finally, to address the shortcomings of existing solutions in real-world field conditions, the Team will integrate a learning capability into the ASLRS so that it can adapt to different accents and noise conditions that exist during field use.  At the end of Phase II, the Team will demonstrate the prototype ASLRS on a mobile device (e.g., Android smartphone). We believe the final implementation will revolutionize S2S MFLT use in the field.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The effectiveness of current and future tactical aircraft increasingly depends on their ability to exchange information.  Existing waveforms such Common Data Link (CDL) must be enhanced with mesh networking capabilities to meet desired efficiency, flexibility, and reliability requirements. In Phase I, we designed a backward-compatible Mesh Enhanced Tactical Airborne Link (METAL), and thoroughly analyzed the intrinsic tradeoffs arising from the partially upgraded network configuration. We also implemented and evaluated a prototype using IAIs RFnest wireless network emulation hardware and AGI toolkit.  Beyond showing the potentially significant improvement in throughput and reliability provided by METAL, these early evaluations in a highly realistic network environment allowed us to identify and design several important enhancements to the topology management, resource allocation and routing functionalities. In Phase II, utilizing the key fundamental design guidelines established during Phase I, along with the additional knowledge regarding the legacy waveforms, we will implement several distributed mechanisms including topology formation, scheduling and routing optimization routines. We will also create a set of detailed, representative evaluation scenarios addressing various edge cases resulting from the heterogeneous network composition and verify the improved network performance benchmarks in two incremental development and evaluation spirals.  BENEFIT:  With many DOD aircraft aging and their service life extending, combined with downward budgetary pressure, there is a need to cost-effectively enhance existing tactical aircraft instead of developing entirely new tactical platforms.  The proposed METAL system can be added as a software-only upgrade to various aircraft current using military communications waveforms (MADL, CDL etc.) such as the F-35.  The METAL system will create a significant improvement over legacy systems by removing mission constraints and communication limitations artificially imposed by current waveform design.  METAL will retain direct communication capability with legacy nodes.  This approach improves network connectivity and performance, instead of causing increased isolation or requiring gateways.  In the commercial sector, many point-to-point and spoke-and-hub waveforms are used for cellular communications, wireless data, and other consumer services.  Due to increasing consumer data demands, there is a similar drive in the commercial world to improve the efficiency of these networks without requiring new hardware at either the consumer or carrier end.  One possible application of METAL is to ease the deployment of microcells and femtocells, small-scale cell towers (e.g. a few hundred meters) that extend coverage and improve spectrum efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) with West Virginia University (WVU) are developing an innovative approach for dramatically increasing the efficiency and agility of MAVs. Hawkmoths were studied to understand, at the micro-scale, how they achieve their impressive agility during obstacle avoidance maneuvers and in recovering from upsets due to collisions and gusts.  These studies led to a focus on the micro-feathers covering their wings; in particular on in-flight clustering of the feathers.  To investigate this further bioinspired piezo-unimorph feathers were developed that act as flow sensor for detecting both the amplitude and frequency of sub boundary layer turbulence. Motion of these feathers can be used passively or actively to modify low Reynolds number flows. The location and clustering of sensor/actuator micro-feathers are critical to the phenomenological understanding and mapping to manmade system. PSI and WVU believe that correctly clustered bioinspired micro-feather covered aerodynamic surfaces (e.g. wings and rotors) will dramatically improve the efficiency and aerodynamic robustness of many classes of MAVs systems including: wing warping, hovering rotor supported, and flapping flight. In Phase II the theory behind micro-feather covered aerodynamic surfaces will be developed and a prototype system will be developed to demonstrate the enhanced efficiency and agility in real-world environments.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Joint Environment Toolkit (JET) Increment 2 architecture consists of servers at six globally distributed Operational Weather Squadrons (OWS).  Each server must handle peak demand of weather analysis and forecast information from 30-40 Weather Flights (WFs, which provide tactical weather information to pilots) in addition to 1,000 or more other operational users within their area of responsibility.  The goal of this program is to provide an elastic deployment of Air Force Weather (AFW) servers by employing advanced cloud technologies.  CEI has researched and architected a solution,&quot;GridCloud&quot;, drawing from proven distributed computing technologies (&quot;.Crunch&quot;) built by CEI for Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under prior Phase II efforts to lower development risk.  GridCloud is an architecture that defines a solution to the current data and resource sharing challenges that span the existing OWSs.  It is critical that GridCloud support interfacing with JET to maximize transition potential, and CEI&quot;s team is composed to ensure that GridCloud is compatible with, and optimized for, JET&quot;s design and ultimately supports an elastic deployment of AFW servers.  The result will be a cloud solution addressing security, interoperability, and portability for a system of data processing and storage hubs such as those used in JET.  BENEFIT:  CEI has developed software and hardware technologies for a variety of government programs, and the team has transitioned over 37 products to production for use in DoD and Government systems.  CEI also has experience commercializing technology developed under Government-funded programs.  Products are packaged as COTS items, listed on a catalog price sheet, supported with technical application notes and marketing materials, and made available for sale to both the commercial and Government markets.  CEI will promote technologies developed under this effort as part of its standard commercial product marketing and sales activities.  Additional evidence of CEI&quot;s success with the commercialization of SBIR technology can be seen in the recent presentation of the 2011 Tibbetts Award to CEI by the Small Business Administration.  This prestigious award is presented to small businesses that represent excellence in achieving the mission and goals of the SBIR and STTR program, stimulate technological innovation, and increase commercialization of Federal research.    A high priority transition opportunity that CEI will pursue during the proposed Phase II development effort is the JET program of record.  GridCloud also provides commercialization opportunities beyond JET.  The resulting prototype system represents the intersection of both grid and cloud computing that supports the unique challenges of Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS).  A cloud is fundamentally about obscuring physical components while a grid is essentially about managing physical components.  Viewed at a basic level, GridCloud enables a grid architecture that holds a series of scalable clouds, thus providing both IaaS and PaaS to the user.  The .Crunch component provides IaaS and the CrunchCloud application that runs on it is PaaS.  GridCloud&quot;s web application could be customized to facilitate specific SaaS opportunities.  There are two potential product paths that CEI will explore during Phase II: (1) licensing GridCloud as a stand-alone package, and (2) licensing GridCloud technology to a Value Added Reseller (VAR) or Integrator.",

The innovation in BSED is the system&quot;s ability to use Joint Test Action Group (JTAG)-based boundary testing to collect information about physical faults at the component and trace levels for application to a system-level diagnostic function, thus increasing the likelihood of isolating a failed WRA beyond the point that traditional functional BIT can reach. In Phase I, POC investigated the electronic systems in use by the Navy and confirmed the feasibility of BSED by demonstrating a prototype BSED system to Navy officials. In Phase II, POC plans to design a ruggedized BSED system, build and demonstrate a fully functional advanced prototype system, including a portable boundary scan controller device and associated cabling for a target Navy system.",

However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is quite low, requiring very long averaging times to obtain reasonable spatial resolution. Under the Phase I project, we designed a 0.1 T MRI system which utilizes large arrays of digital SQUIDs, based on Rapid Single Flux Quantum (RSFQ) digital logic, to enhance SNR (~100), thus obtaining both high resolution and fast imaging. Under the Phase II program and based on this design, we propose to demonstrate, with consultation by Prof. Douglas Rothman of the Yale University Magnetic Resonance Research Center (MRRC) a 4-channel MRI system with a magnetic field strength of 0.050.1 Tesla for imaging small objects and animals. Since the magnet size and strength are modest, the system can be made transportable. In addition, the same SQUID-based imaging array can also be utilized for sensitive Magnetoencephalography (MEG). We will demonstrate that the design can be scaled to 256 digital SQUIDs for a system with larger magnet bore to perform imaging of human brain or extremities.",

Modeling capabilities for composite implodables; 3. Enhancements to the functionality and usability of X-FEM in DYNA3D. This Phase II proposal addresses these three areas through the following developments.

A new software mc^2: Material Constitutive Calibrator will be developed in parallel for automated calibration of this (and other) model(s). Second, a new element  the WAI composite element  will be implemented in DYNA3D for accurate calculation of the stress field in composite implodable and therefore accurate assessment of the material failure criterion. Calibration of this element for material failure will also be performed in mc^2. Lastly, the X-FEM capabilities in DYNA3D will be improved through linkage with WAI damage model and removal of ad hoc user input parameters that make calibration problematic.

        "abstract": "It is often difficult to create autonomous robotic capabilities that match what can be achieved via teleoperation. Even though it is mechanically possible for a humanoid robot such as Robonaut 2 to perform complex coordinated tasks such as tying a knot, exchanging objects between end effectors, plugging in connectors, unscrewing a cap, opening a door, or grasping large objects with two hands, our lack of planning algorithms makes it difficult to control these behaviors autonomously. The lack of planning and control algorithms also impedes human-robot interaction as it is difficult for manipulation robots to plan arm trajectories in real-time using active sensing to avoid collisions with humans. This proposal is to develop a suite of planning and control algorithms that will enable NASA robots to perform complex manipulation behaviors in a coordinated way. This work would benefit NASA by making NASA robots more capable and useful during autonomous tasks, by enabling remote supervisors to command more complex tasks, and by enabling NASA robots to operate safely alongside humans during shared tasks.",

        "abstract": "A primary source of impact to BMDS observables results from the RF signature and IR signature perturbations caused by antennas. To combat this problem, IERUS proposes the development of optimized antenna elements for BMDS telemetry bands whose RF signature has been minimized in the BMDS radar bands (S and X-bands).  During Phase 1 of this program, IERUS demonstrated its design process by demonstrating in simulation a prototype GPS antenna with minimized RF signature in the BMDS radar bands (S- and X-bands).  The antenna signature was integrated with measured MIT sphere-cone data and shown to have little to no impact on the overall target signature.  Leveraging progress from Phase 1, the IERUS antenna design approach will provide a drop-in replacement for current generation RV antenna designs and illustrate a path forward to future builds with minimal aeroshell scarring.  The IERUS approach has been selected to provide a cost-competitive solution to antenna design. At the end of this Phase 2 effort, the proposed antenna design will have been fabricated, measured, and tested for confidence using the stringent Lockheed Martin qualification test plan in place for the current generation antenna.",

This unique feature of the PACS will allow the KW to operate for extended durations when combined with a conventional liquid or solid-extinguishment DACS.  In addition, ESP thrusters are small, light-weight, have a modular design, and are capable of providing on-demand multiple pulses.   Thrusters can be easily controlled and packaged in groups or&quot;clusters&quot;, making them adaptable to a number of KW configurations.

During the Phase I project Inovati demonstrated feasibility of depositing aluminum, bronze, and nickel alloy powders at low temperatures to simulate component repairs using the KM process. Metallurgical and mechanical testing of these simulate repairs demonstrated excellent prospects for developing this technology as a new tool for enabling repairs of consumable submarine components.

Powder formulations and repair methodologies will be developed during the Phase II project to permit dimensional and structural repairs of these components.

The proposed enzymatic fuel cell (EFC) will leverage ongoing research at both CFDRC and the University of New Mexico to provide a fully-integrated manufacturable and renewable power supply.  In Phase I, we have demonstrated multiple enzyme electrodes capable of oxidizing sugars and alcohols simultaneously, as well as a multiple enzyme cascade for 2-step oxidation of ethanol.  We have employed low-cost and flexible, paper-based passive fuel flow-through system for continual fuel delivery to the EFC.   In Phase II, we will further develop multi-enzymatic cascade design for deeper oxidation of various fuels with stable and reproducible operation.  Additionally, we will design, fabricate and test all components of the bioelectrochemical system for maximal power density.  The fully-integrated prototype will be capable of providing a proof-of-concept demonstration as a portable military low-power source in an application approved by AFRL. A multi-disciplinary team with proven expertise in electrochemical power sources, biomicrosystems, bioelectrochemistry, and system design has been assembled to accomplish these goals.  BENEFIT:  The major outcome of this project will be a bioelectrochemical system with a paper-based microfluidic flow-through system capable of utilizing single fuel type and/or a mixture of different fuels (ex. sugars and alcohols) to continuously generate power.  The ability to use multiple fuel sources will significantly increase the applicability of the device.  Additionally, high power density offered by the device will allow for recharge capabilities for various devices and may be appropriate for a wide range of military applications for remote monitoring, sensing, and surveillance.  The fully integrated system will meet a critical need in many small, mobile military systems, which are typically limited by batteries, and their inconvenient replacement/recharge requirements.  The high power EFC solution proposed here eliminates these limitations by taking advantage of readily available fuels, such as sugar sources, which have ten times higher energy density than traditional battery materials.  The paper-based platform will not only allow for thin, flexible and form-fitting design, but also provide a passive flow-through fuel delivery system for continual energy generation.    Immediate military applications for the Phase II device include recharging of commercially available batteries and powering various low power devices such as UGSs, and wireless surveillance networks.  Additionally with some adaptation, the device could be suitable for the use in microbots and other higher-power demand devices.  The Phase II project will be tailored to incorporate the requirements of lightweight, low-cost, and manufacturability needed to make commercialization possible.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  As the data rates of satellite communication links increase due to inclusion of high resolution imagery and video, a high bandwidth backbone network is required to support all uses of the network. Free Space Optical (FSO) communication links have the ability to provide very high data rates over very long propagation distances, however, due to their narrow beam divergence, they require accurate pointing and tracking of the terminal apertures. To address this need, SA Photonics proposes the AccuPoint Beam Control System. The AccuPoint system is a scalable system that supports a variety of plaforms, including GEO satellites, large and small UAVs, and mobile and stationary ground terminals.  AccuPoint utilizes a compact Optical Inertial Reference Unit (OIRU) to generate an inertially stabilized Optical Reference Beam (ORB) that traverses the entire optical path, picking up jitter errors along the way. SA Photonics&quot;proprietary high bandwidth control system measures the induced jitter which is removed from both the incoming and outgoing FSO optical beams. A closed-loop control bandwidth in excess of 1 kHz provides jitter attenuation up to 100s of Hz. The OIRU utilizes highly accurate Fiber-Optic Gyroscope (FOG) based angular rate sensors which provide angular rate sensitivity down to DC. Therefore, signals from the IRU can be used during acquisition when absolute pointing accuracy is required while the aperture scans it&quot;s transmit beam and searches for received optical power.  BENEFIT:  The AccuPoint system enables long distance FSO links by performing active stabilization of optical apertures. The AccuPoint system has very small SWaP allowing use in a variety of platforms, and is designed from the ground up for the space environment, ensuring robust and reliable operation.",

CNF Mat will be incorporated into CFRP composites with existing composite fabrication methods, fully characterized, and will demonstrate high hardness per MIL-STD-2169B for crucial military needs, including for electromagnetic shielding effectiveness, EMP and flash X-Rays, neutron activation, etc.  Prototypes will be fabricated.  The ASI CNF Mat has attracted interest from Prime Contractors due to its low-cost and ease of processing using existing manufacturing methods/equipment.  ASI will leverage this support in Phase II collaborations and through commercialization activities in concert with military contractors as well as civilian consumers of carbon nanofiber composites.

        "abstract": "The Innovation of this Phase II project is developing physics-based analytical models to analyze gearbox components for safety, longevity, reliability and cost by predicting (1) New component performance, and optimal time-to-remanufacture, (2) Qualification of used components for remanufacturing process, and (3) Predicting the remanufactured component performance. Current industry approach is to design, manufacture, operate, and retire assets based on traditional methods, which typically rely on standards-based estimates, historical data/domain experience, physical examination, testing, monitoring, and inspection. This process is extremely time and resource intensive. Further, this process often does not consider the opportunity to use remanufacturing processes to extend/enhance product performance. Sentient technology will address these issues and fulfill the industry requirements. Phase II will expand the Phase I technology to include additional gearbox materials, damage modes and remanufacturing processes in a more comprehensive design and analysis framework capable of predicting optimal time-to-remanufacture and optimizing refurbishing operations to extend the useful life of components. This SBIR technology reduces physical testing using virtual testing, and will assist in remanufacturing of high value, high demand rotorcraft, automotive and wind turbine gearbox components. Hence, it decreases the energy, material resources, and costs associated with manufacturing, and ensures that the product performance is maintained/improved. The broader/commercial impact of the SBIR technology is within aerospace, energy, and transportation industries on high dollar assets that rely on the reliable function of highly engineered (and thus expensive) gearboxes. Our new Advanced Manufacturing partnership based application provides the US manufacturing supply chain a first mover and a sustainable competitive advantage greater than the 6% offshore labor rate advantage. This advantage comes through reuse of high value-added assets optimized for maximum lifetime use, coupled with decreased time and costs associated with traditional physical testing and analysis methods. This is possible based on the high-level of detail included in physics-based models, which (conceptually) decode material information at the microstructure level just as the Human Genome Project decodes genetic information at the DNA level. Our innovation enables the customer to rapidly, cost effectively, and accurately predict a product?s lifecycle (design, manufacture, operation, degradation, maintenance, repair/remanufacture, and retirement) at the material, component, and assembly/system scales. We foresee a future opportunity due to the fact that our innovation developed under this NSF grant will give us a competitive advantage of lower costs to provide the software and service. Our cost to deploy the technology is 10X lower than traditional companies in this space.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on bringing the company&#039;s transparent conductive films to the touch panel market. The performance, cost, and durability of current touch sensors are limited by shortfalls of the current industry standard material, indium tin oxide (ITO). The company is commercializing a conductive plastic film with superior performance, cost, and durability. This study will cover expansion of its scale manufacturing capabilities, allowing it to provide both pre-patterned and customer-patternable transparent conductive films suitable for use in the market. During SBIR Phase I period, the company migrated its lab-scale prototyping methods to processes compatible with at-scale roll-to-roll manufacture of unpattenered conductive films. While each step of its process was individually scaled to high throughput, production of a final product requires that all of the steps be combined into a single process flow. This Phase II grant will allow it to combine these processes while adding the ability to produce functional circuits in addition to bulk films. It will also allow it to continue pushing its films&#039; performance higher by utilizing new techniques and materials to increase the clarity of its films. Finally, the company will thoroughly characterize the lifetime properties of its final product. The broader impact/commercial impact of this project will be significant, as it will result in a fully designed process by which the company can produce market-ready products. It will also result in functional demonstration touch panels to put into the hands of its customers. At the conclusion of the study the company expects to have secured a design win with a customer and will be in an excellent position to raise operating capital at low risk to its investors so that the company may begin shipping products. As a Silicon Valley materials technology company, the company&#039;s success in the touch panel market will help bring part of a major market back to the US that has moved overseas. This SBIR Phase II study will allow it to expand the staff and also support jobs at the US companies whose toll-coating facilities the company uses for its product development and manufacturing.",

Tetramer has developed a proprietary family of coating technologies that will be used to optimize advanced coatings for tamper-indicating seals currently in development at Savannah River National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories.  During Phase I Tetramer demonstrated a chemically and mechanically robust coating which was optically clear and strongly luminescent. In Phase II Tetramer will continue the optimization of the coating by working at the molecular level. A semi automated coating system will be developed which is capable of producing coatings with an increased level of complexity in their spectral signatures for tamper-indicating seals using a variety of active nanomaterials. In addition, Tetramer will develop prototype designs and methods for characterizing advanced spectral signals in order to authenticate legitimate seals from tampered seals.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The work performed in Phase II and Phase III will allow for any device to be coated with sophisticated films having a range of properties which can be varied by tailoring the molecular architecture of the coating.

        "abstract": "The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) is a serious threat. Preventing the spread of these nuclear weapons has reached a state of heightened urgency in recent years. Neutron  detection  is  an  important  component  of  the  overall  detection  techniques  used  in identifying WMDs. At present, there is need for an efficient detection system that would allow neutron  detection  with  the  ability  to  discriminate  gamma  from  neutron  events.  Gamma discrimination  is  critical  because  gamma  rays  are  a  common  background  during  WMD monitoring. Unfortunately, none of the available neutron detection technologies satisfy all of these requirements. Recent research at RMD has focused on novel plastic scintillators that can provide neutron/gamma pulse shape discrimination (PSD) capability.  The goal of the proposed effort is to undertake a systematic investigation of novel plastic scintillators in order to optimize and advance the fast-neutron detection technology.  To achieve this goal, the first step will be to tune the compositions including the monomers and additives as well as the optical emitters.  Polymerization conditions will be examined to produce high quality plastic scintillators.  Subsequently, we will evaluate their scintillation properties. Fast-neutron spectroscopy will be performed. Finally, neutron-gamma PSD studies will be carried out.  The research work in the Phase I was focused on the following main areas: (i) fabrication of novel plastic scintillators, (ii) characterization of their scintillation as well as neutron detection properties, and (iii) investigation of neutron/gamma PSD.  The research work in the Phase II will focus on the following five areas: (1) purification of monomers to improve the scintillation properties of the plastic scintillators, (2) fabrication of larger  plastic  scintillators  of  up  to  16x4x4,  (3)  characterization  of  their  scintillation properties, (4) investigation of neutron/gamma PSD, and (5) construction and evaluation of prototype detector systems.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The proposed detector technology will be very promising for nuclear non-proliferation. It will also be applicable to neutron imaging systems, astronomy, and non-destructive testing.",

This information is unavailable for analysis because it needs to be extracted from its analog form and put into modern digital formats. National security needs in nuclear non-proliferation, earthquake modeling, and oil and gas extraction will all benefit by creating a means by which this digital information can be accurately and inexpensively extracted.  The problem of large scale seismogram digitization is being addressed by assembling a talented interdisciplinary team of researchers in the fields of image analysis, seismology, signal processing, complex science, and computer science. Our approach merges a broad range of techniques and expertise, combining them by developing and deploying a web-based analytic package.  Our Phase I work demonstrated that seismic trace coordinates could be extracted using a variety of numerical and complexity-based processes.  Moreover, by leveraging our Phase I funding with additional state funding, we were able to include new researchers and techniques whose work went beyond the scope of our initial Phase I proposal.  Phase II will develop and deploy a web-based browser platform that will serve as a common structure under which all methodologies applied to the problem can interact in a single location. The goal is to then deploy this software platform for general users in the scientific and research community.

        "abstract": "This proposal outlines a project aimed at providing a radical improvement in ion source technology that can be applied to the mass spectrometric analysis of actinides.  The state-of-the-art secondary ion mass spectrometers (SIMS) employ the duoplasmatron ion source to create the primary ion beam for actinide analysis.  The duoplasmatron only has sufficient brightness and a small enough energy spread to create focused oxygen ion beams as small as 200nm in diameter, with a very low ion beam current of &amp; lt;1pA.  In order to analyze sub-micron actinide particles with sufficient speed, the current density needs to be increased by approximately two orders of magnitude (100x). Focused oxygen beam diameters as small as 10nm are required to provide the highest possible imaging resolution using the SIMS technique, but today this is far from possible.  Furthermore, the lifetime and reliability of the duoplasmatron can be very problematic, causing a significant amount of downtime for these very expensive instruments. Oregon Physics developed its first high density plasma source prior to this project, for pilot studies and as a stepping stone to the work being carried out here.  Hyperion has realized a factor of 10 increase in current density over the duoplasmatron and extended source life significantly. This work has been leveraged in the 1st phase of this project.  Phase I incorporated a series of detailed analytic and numeric simulations of heat transfer, electromagnetic field calculations and ion extraction optics employed with the new ion source.   A proof- of-concept (PoC) source has been engineered, built and is now undergoing detailed experimental studies.  Early data shows a significant gain in RF power efficiency and a level of thermal management that will allow for a factor of 40 increase in power density, over and above that demonstrated with Hyperion.  In Phase II, we will fully characterize this PoC source, refine the design and integrate onto our 30kV source isolator. An ion optical column will be built that is suitable for ultra-high resolution SIMS imaging, and capable of providing an oxygen beam diameter of 10nm and xenon beam diameters of 7nm.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Applications include rapid, high resolution SIMS and RIMS (resonant ion mass spectrometry) analysis of actinides.  The primary objective here is to enhance the analysis equipment used by our nations nuclear forensic scientists in their efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation amongst rogue nations and terrorist organizations. If successful, this project will reduce SIMS analysis times from hours to seconds and improve the imaging resolution by over an order of magnitude.  In addition to actinide analysis with SIMS, the ion optical column can also be used for high resolution and throughput focused ion beam machining, with a range of ion species. Applications here span the semiconductor, biomedical, energy research industries, as well as national security.",

Presently, most power conversion systems are based on Si IGBTs. However, due to the unique capabilities of SiC and advancement of power converter packaging, this work has the potential to aid in the emergence of smarter, seamless powered grids with less of a dependence on inefficient peak power plants.  Phase I work included i.) designing and building a HV discrete demonstrator capable of housing 15 kV SiC devices, ii.) demonstrating a 3 reduction in parasitic inductance in the power loop, iii.) designing 15 kV SiC half-bridge MCPM exhibiting a low junction to case thermal resistance of 0.045 C/W with an extremely low profile of 14 mm (0.57 in) in a standard footprint, iv.) performing a system analysis that highlights  a  70  reduction  in  mass  and  a  34  reduction  in  volume,  and  v.)  developing  target specifications based on customer needs and existing HV power die.  In Phase II, a HV SiC MCPM will be developed such that the assembly process can be easily transferred to manufacturing facilities.

        "abstract": "As  renewable  resources  such  as  wind  and  solar  start  to  penetrate  the  electrical infrastructure, the transient behavior of these resources requires energy storage systems, such as batteries or flywheels, to buffer the fluctuations in output.  Additionally, current silicon based semiconductor switches are limited in their ability to handle higher voltages and thus require large expensive systems to convert renewable resources.   Power conversion systems in the 100 to 200 kW range are sought to address needs on the industrial user and community level, however the cost and size of the equipment must come down to meet municipality budgets and space limitations.  The impact of a medium voltage switch could greatly shrink the weight and cost of power converters by reducing cable size, transformer size, and eliminating elaborate cooling systems all together.  United Silicon Carbide, Inc. proposes to address the need for medium voltage switches by developing a unique 6.5 kV Silicon Carbide switch platform. The proposed switch module will provide   a   significantly   smaller,   more   efficient   and   lower   cost   solution   for   power converters/inverters and will enable higher DC-Link voltages, up to 4 kV, for utility scale smart grid and energy management applications.  By utilizing an approach that does not rely on Metal- Oxide-Semiconductor technology, the proposed module can run at much higher temperatures, thereby reducing cooling requirements dramatically and increasing reliability.   The proposed module targets a high operation frequency of ~ 20-30 kHz which enables the use of much smaller transformers and magnetics.  The proposed silicon carbide switch module is based on a unipolar design and is expected to overcome the following limitations of the competing technologies: Silicon power switches are plagued by excessive cooling requirements due to high switching and conduction losses,  silicon carbide switches using metal-oxide materials suffer from long-term reliability concerns when operating at high temperatures, and silicon carbide bipolar switches which have much lower switching speeds, and suffer from a forward voltage drift problem due to defect propagation.  Phase I focused on the device, driver and module designs, proof of high voltage packaging fundamentals as well as the semiconductor material crystal growth.  Phase II will involve device processing, module assembly and proof of performance.  In addition, USCi will obtain critical application requirements by   consulting with a US based power conversion system manufacturer.   Commercialization of such powers systems in a Phase III could create an economically attractive public/private partnership that would enable a more distributed behind the meter power generation and storage approach for primary customers utilizing industrial level utilities.",

As the coolant temperature used to dissipate heat from electronics increases, the operation of power semiconductor devices becomes severely limited in order that the safe operating temperature limit of the semiconductors not be exceeded. There is a need for low-cost, integrated package-heat sink technology to support next generation high power, high reliability HEV power modules.  The Phase I effort has established a novel, low-cost integrated package-heat sink technology for use in high-temperature power module packaging and thermal management. This integrated package-heat sink technology is enabled by a unique copper-ceramic-graphite-copper substrate technology and a highly effective compact heat transfer technology. The integrated assembly provides for electrical isolation of the semiconductor and electrical components, and minimizes the thermal resistance between the power semiconductor devices and the heat sink coolant.

Both researchers and manufacturers of Li-ion batteries need a rapid and simple- to-use powerful technology that can enable nanometer-scale depth resolution chemical analysis in real time during the electrochemical cycling of the batteries. Currently available analytical techniques are extremely expensive, time consuming, labor-intense, involving very large equipment, e.g., synchrotron radiation or ultra high vacuum.  We successfully demonstrated a new optical sensor technology in the Phase I SBIR for direct, real-time measurements of the chemical composition of battery materials and electrode/electrolyte interfaces, with depth resolution down to the nanometer scale.  The technology yields real-time chemical information on lithium-ion batteries that was unattainable by other analytical techniques. The basis of the new technology is Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS); the same technology that NASA landed on Mars on the Curiosity Rover.  Our  Phase  II  research  will  provide  optimization  of  the technology  for  rapid  highly  spatially  resolved,  sensitive  2D  and  3D  measurements  of  Li-ion  cell chemistry.

        "abstract": "Dependence on dirty solid fuels and inefficient stoves for cooking, heating, and lighting by over 3 billion people in developing countries has very large negative effects on health, environment, livelihoods, gender equality, and global climate. To address this problem and fill the unmet need for robust, inexpensive instrumentation for measuring the in-field performance and usage of cookstoves, we are developing the Platform for Integrated Cookstove Assessment (PICA). Current tools for monitoring stove performance and usage, as well as other household-level impacts in the field, are generally expensive and time-intensive, failing to uniformly meet the DOEs requirements of affordability, reliability, durability, and user-friendliness. PICA is a system for managing a suite of tools to collect data at key phases of cookstove development and perform programmatic evaluation and research studies, including parameters such as household air pollution, personal exposure, emissions, and stove usage. Efficient, robust, cost-effective monitoring and evaluation tools such as PICA are critical to development and uptake of clean cooking solutions, the assessment of their impacts, and to support continued global investment in such solutions. Phase I funding was used to create pilot PICA software (the core of the PICA platform). We developed prototypes of the next generation of our UCB-PATS particle monitor, tested the new monitor as well as a commercial CO sensor, and integrated both into the PICA platform. We also used Phase 1 funding to integrate iButton stove use data into PICA and enhance algorithms for processing stove temperature data to yield useful metrics, such as the number of stove uses per day, week, or month. The first objective of Phase II is to fully develop PICAs instrument management and data management and analysis capabilities to create a proficient, comprehensive software system. Secondly, we plan to develop a fully functional, commercial PICA air quality monitor (PATS+). The final objective is to ensure that PICA is well positioned for the next generation of sensors and capabilities through continued research and development of additional sensors for measuring technology usage and energy/pollutant indicators. If the project is carried over into Phase III and beyond, the successful commercialization of PICA will allow an ever greater portion of the cookstove market to access this tool and collect cookstove data and/or track air pollution, especially the many less sophisticated users, developing country agencies, and NGOs. Three to five years from now, our goal is to also have a revenue stream from licensing some of the core technological components of PATS+ and PICA to a consumer products company that will target an entirely new market segment for real-time household air pollution monitoring.",

        "abstract": "Nearly three billion people, half the worlds population, still cook on inefficient solid biomass fires, which emit gases and particulates that are both poisonous to humans and damaging to the environment. Four million deaths are attributed to indoor air pollution from biomass cooking fires every year  twice as many as die of AIDS. Women and children are disproportionately exposed and carry the additional burden of collecting wood, which is time-consuming, physically taxing and often dangerous. In most areas where biomass cooking is prevalent, electricity is intermittent or not available at all.  This problem is being addressed by commercialization of an ultraclean, self-powered, fan assisted biomass cookstove. The stove uses our patented direct conduction thermoelectric system to convert a small portion of energy from the fire to electricity, driving the fan with sufficient surplus to power a USB charging circuit. By combining a low cost design with high performance (90% fewer emissions and 50% less fuel required) and on-demand electricity, the stove can achieve widespread adoption with globally significant health and environmental benefits.   In phase I the core technology was taken from proof of concept to a commercial-ready consumer product design. Advanced computer simulation, along with laboratory and field testing, were used to achieve the highest available emissions reductions and fuel efficiency improvements in a user-centered design.   Phase II seeks to mature the stove into a commercially viable consumer product. We will conduct a comprehensive design effort focused on high volume manufacturing and cost reduction, supported by durability testing and small field trials.  This holistic reengineering effort will minimize raw materials and processing costs, as well as downstream costs along the value chain, without sacrificing performance or compatibility with traditional cooking practices.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: When commercialized, the stove will dramatically reduce the risk of fatal respiratory disease for rural cooks and their children in the developing world with the added benefit of on- demand electricity access. Additionally, for each stove that is sold and operated, 2.5 tons CO2e will be removed from the atmosphere each year.  The cost of this reduction will be $7/ton for the life of the stove, which is 100 times more cost-effective than a Toyota Prius over its life.

Organic acid esters, produced from bio-based organic acids and alcohols, are truly bio-renewable, green chemicals that are promising replacements for halogenated and other petroleum-based solvents, lubricants, and plasticizers. This project will develop and demonstrate advanced reactive distillation concepts for esterification that reduce energy consumption and lower capital equipment costs. The governing objectives of the proposed Phase II research are: a) to develop experimentally validated design methodology for scaling the test data from MSUs pilot-plant to commercial unit; b) to demonstrate performance of integrated HIRD with side reactors and PerVap for esterification of multi-functional organic acids; c) to establish the energy and economic merits of HIRD with side reactors and PerVap membrane for manufacturing ester-based plasticizers; and d) to develop a roadmap for commercialization of HIRD with side reactors for synthesis of bio-based esters.  The Phase II work plan will advance the technology from TRL-4 to TRL-5, or perhaps to TRL-6, with focus on licensing the technology to industrial partner(s). In terms of the DOE BioEnergys Stage-Gate process, Phase II will advance the technology from Stage-2 to Stage-3.  The major tasks consists of a) development of design methodology of heat integrated reactive distillation with side reactors and PerVap membranes; b) preliminary design of a pre-commercial plant; c) pilot- plant tests; d) techno-economic analysis of manufacturing bio-based esters to replace phthalate plasticizers; and e) developing a commercialization roadmap, including holding an industry workshop.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The major benefits that will arise from this project are: a) enhanced U.S. competitiveness in manufacturing of bio-based plasticizers and solvents; and b) process intensification and energy efficiency for broad-based manufacturing of bio-based chemicals in the modern biorefinery.",

        "abstract": "The proposed program provides a new biomass conversion technology to produce FDCA, 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid, to replace hydrocarbon chemicals for production of commodity plasticizers and polyester polymers. Using todays prices, FDCA can economically replace phthalic anhydride and terephthalic acid, commodity chemicals used for production of large volume phthalate plasticizers and polyester polymers.   FDCA is derived from fructose, with 5-acetoxymethylfurfural (AcHMF) as a key intermediate.  Commercial production of FDCA is currently hindered by poor selectivity for the catalytic dehydration of fructose using current catalysts and reaction pathways.  The overall goal of the Phase II project is to commercialize an innovative technology, Intensified Catalytic and Reactive Distillation (iCARD), for highly selective production of FDCA from high fructose corn syrup.   Improved selectivity will be achieved by: (1) utilization of reactive distillation to remove water generated by the reaction, thereby suppressing degradation reactions and increasing selectivity; (2) development  of  novel  catalysts,  for  use  in  reactive  distillation  for  fructose  dehydration  with  high selectivity; (3) use of an alternative reaction pathway, through AcHMF, that further suppresses byproduct formation; and (4) catalytic oxidation of AcHMF to FDCA at exceptionally high yield.  The Phase I program successfully demonstrated the technical and economic feasibility of the iCARD technology for FDCA production at high selectivity.  The project developed new catalysts, and a novel reaction system, which successfully demonstrated fructose dehydration to FDCA with greater than 90% selectivity.  The iCARD technology for FDCA production provides exceptionally attractive economics, with an estimated payout time for a commercial plant investment of less than one year.  In the Phase II program, research and development will be completed to support immediate commercialization of the iCARD technology for FDCA production. The iCARD catalysts, reaction system, and overall manufacturing process will be optimized to provide low cost, high quality FDCA product.  Performance of FDCA-based non-phthalate plasticizers will be confirmed to meet commercial requirements. The program includes a subcontract to the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Massachusetts.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: FDCA produced by the iCARD technology will find immediate application for production of non-phthalate bio-plasticizers for PVC, and for the production of large volume polyester polymers for fibers, beverage bottles, and other products.  This will allow conversion of over 10 billion pounds per year of commodity chemical production from hydrocarbon to biomass base, resulting in reduced consumption of scarce hydrocarbon resources and improving long term U.S. competitiveness in global markets.",

        "abstract": "Up to 2700 terawatt-hours per year of geothermal electricity generation capacity has been shown to be available within North America, typically with wells drilled into geologically active regions of the earths crust where this energy is concentrated (Huttrer, 2001).  Of this potential, about half is considered to have temperatures high enough for conventional (steam-based) power production, while the other half requires unconventional power conversion approaches, such as organic Rankine cycle systems or Stirling engines.  If captured and converted effectively, geothermal power generation could replace up to 100 GW of fossil fuel electric power generation, leading to a significant reduction of US power sector pollution emissions. In addition, with the rapid growth of hydro-fracking in oil and gas production, there are smaller- scale distributed power generation opportunities in heated liquids that are co-produced with the main oil and gas products.  Since 2006, Cool Energy, Inc. (CEI) has designed, fabricated and tested four generations of low-temperature (100 C to 300 C) Stirling engine power conversion equipment. The electric power output of these engines has been demonstrated at over 3 kWe and over 22% thermal conversion efficiency for an input temperature of 300 C.  In Phase I, Cool Energy and CSU analyzed thousands of oil and gas wells for electric power generation potential, and modeled the performance of electricity generation in oil and gas production system using heat from co-produced liquids to drive a Stirling engine.  It was estimated that 470MW of electrical generating potential exists from geothermal energy in producing oil and gas wells.  In addition, CEI customized the design of a 20 kWe engine specifically for the low-temperature geothermal application by optimizing engine performance and customer value for the temperature ranges supplied by co-produced liquids.  The 20 kWe design uses novel approaches of self- lubricating, low-wear-rate bearing surfaces, non-metallic regenerators, high-effectiveness, low-cost heat exchangers, and a rotary transmission to transfer the mechanical work of the engine to the electric generator built into the engine housing.  A Stirling approach has several advantages over the current products used in these applications: smaller opportunities can be addressed, part-load performance is excellent, and Stirling engines do not use the environmentally hazardous organic fluids found in incumbent technologies.  Phase I established clear economic and technical feasibility of the geothermal-Stirling approach, and Phase II will support the design completion and prototype build of the 20 kWe GeoHeart Engine, customized for geothermal power generation.  This engine will be completed in mid-2014, and will be fully characterized in terms of thermodynamic, mechanical, and electrical power outputs, thermal-to-electrical conversion efficiency, heat draw, cooling requirements, parasitic loads, and performance under a range of operating conditions.",

        "abstract": "The main obstacle Photovoltaic (PV) industry is facing at present is the higher cost of PV energy compared to that of fossil energy.  While solar cell efficiencies continue to make incremental gains these improvements are so far insufficient to drive PV costs down to match that of fossil energy.   Improved in-line diagnostics however, has the potential to significantly increase the productivity and reduce cost by improving the yield of the process, as proven by industry leaders.  MicroXact proposes to develop a high-throughput in-line PV manufacturing diagnostic system, which will provide fast and accurate data on the spatial uniformity of thickness and refractive indices of the thin films comprising the solar cell as the solar cell is processed reel-to- reel.  The  retrieved  information  will  provide  the  opportunity  to  detect  a  wide  variety  of processing errors, including but not limited to thickness/composition inhomogeneity in any layer comprising PV device, non-uniform scribing, cracking and layer separation.  During the Phase I, MicroXact designed and assembled breadboard system prototype and unambiguously  experimentally  verified  that  the  proposed  solution  meets  all  the  expected specifications in terms of resolution, accuracy and throughput, and demonstrated defect detection on actual CIGS solar cell samples.  An advanced design of the portable system adapted to PVMC pilot CIGS PV manufacturing line was conceived and Phase II validation testing plans were developed/budgeted.  In Phase II, MicroXact will complete the design, develop and test the portable PV manufacturing diagnostics system for the 0.6m wide CIGS manufacturing line and will validate its performance initially in-house on solar cell samples from the same manufacturing line, and then will perform demonstration of PV manufacturing diagnostics on PVMC pilot manufacturing line.   The demonstration of a high-throughput in-line PV manufacturing diagnostic system at PVMC pilot line will lead to the rapid and successful commercialization of the technology in Phase III.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The target application for the proposed in-line manufacturing diagnostic system is the PV cell manufacturing lines with high production capacity ( &amp; gt;10MW/year), in which the benefits of the in-line diagnostics (such as yield improvement and cost reduction) are expected to outweigh the cost of system installation immediately. In addition, low-cost system modifications will be developed to target off-line quality assurance and quality control at smaller-scale PV cell manufacturing lines.",

        "abstract": "Novel, inline measurement techniques are needed to improve the quality and performance of new solar cells. Manufacturers today measure cell performance inline under white light conditions, but are unable to obtain the cell response as a function of wavelength without extensive offline testing. They are also unable to extract detailed spatial maps of full-spectrum spectral response. This information is fundamental to the device performance and, as device complexity increases it becomes even more important for successful process control, yield management and module power optimization.  This project helps to support the nations long-term energy goal of building higher performance, consistently robust solar devices at a lower cost to the end user.  Our phase I/phase II project is to develop the individual components needed for a new class of non- contact solar cell metrology, and then integrate them, by the end of phase II, into a fully functioning prototype at a major U.S. manufacturer.  In phase I, we developed prototype non-contact sensors and integrated them with an advanced broadband lightsource. The lightsource has 64 colors, individually modulated, to simultaneously stimulate cell response from the ultraviolet to infrared.   The response is detected via fourier analysis in one of three ways: 1) capacitive, non-contact sensors, 2) inductive non-contact sensors and 3) conventional metal contacts.  The full-spectrum measurement is completed in one second, and thus is fast enough to be used as an inline process monitor. The non-contact methods show good correlation with the contacting method, and are able to detect subtle shifts in photoresponse long before the device is completed. The resulting system was tested on both conventional and thinfilm cells, as well as high performance interdigitated back contact cells. Various sensor configurations were developed and used to measure as early as the emitter formation step, and as late as a fully encapsulated module.  In phase II, we will integrate the various sensors into an automated scanning system.  This will be tested at a customer site on mini-modules, cells and films, and will be upgraded as the project continues.  Components will be developed that lead to both higher performance and the ability to measure a broader set of materials and process steps. We will use the feedback and learning from this prototype to define the phase III product.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: 1) module scanner for failure analysis, 2) cell spectral sorting, 3) inline monitor for absorber/emitter quality, 4) substrate contamination and surface preparation control.",

One way to meet this need is to convert renewable resources such as cellulosic biomass to fuels and chemicals; however a major roadblock is the high processing cost. What are needed are technologies that can provide energy and cost saving alternatives for processing biomass.  How problem being addressed: Development of a nanofiltration ceramic membrane that can separate complex mixtures at low pH and high temperatures. The unique nanoscale features of this product enable it to provide significantly faster separation processing and higher yields under harsh process conditions, while requiring less energy and capital expense compared to conventional technologies. During Phase I we demonstrated the feasibility of creating a ceramic membrane with sub- nanometer pores using a patented method that provides straight, continuous pores for fast transport.  In Phase II the nanofiltration ceramic membrane will be further optimized. A prototype will be produced and tested at both lab scale and commercial scale. Applications of the technology of high value to commercial biorefineries will be identified by close collaboration with several key decision makers in the industry including commercial partners, national labs and research universities.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The benefits of this technology innovation are it is a clean technology, promotes energy and products from renewable resources, and reduces the production of greenhouse gases. It will contribute significant energy savings to the production of alternative fuels from renewable resources, thus making renewables more cost competitive and reducing dependence on fossil fuels",

These harsh environments include extreme temperatures (8001800C), high pressures (5001000 psi), and highly corrosive/erosive exposures. However, it has been a challenge to develop sensors that can endure these harsh environments.  Sporian Microsystems has previously developed a MEMS sensor technology for high temperature power system applications.  Sporians sensor technology is based on the combination of advance high temperature packaging and recently developed silicon carbide nitride (SiCN)  based  polymer  derived  ceramics  (PDCs),  which  possess  excellent  mechanical  and  electric properties at high temperatures up to 1800oC. Sporian proposes to develop alternative precursors, processes, packaging materials, and methods to extend the current operational capabilities of Sporians sensor technology beyond current limits to 16001800oC.  In Phase I, Sporian worked with OEMs to identify desirable applications/implementations for the technology, evaluated/demonstrated new materials synthesis and microfabrication methods, developed new packaging methods and designs, and experimentally demonstrated initial prototype sensor structures at application relevant temperatures.  Based on the results of Phase I, the Phase II will include: continued work with OEMs, the development of    two application specific sensor implementations, materials/process optimization, several rounds of full system prototyping, rigorous lab scale testing, and final test/demonstration in OEM application relevant environment test systems.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: There is an established consensus that advanced sensing systems will be essential to achieving the cost and performance targets in advanced power systems. The resultant products, high temperature, internally calibrated, temperature compensated, temperature/pressure multisensors, would be in demand for energy generation and propulsion designers and operators and there is a significant market opportunity. Equipment that could potentially benefit from the development of such  a sensor technology include coal gasifiers, turbines, advanced coal combustion systems, and other critical or high maintenance equipment commonly employed in energy and power generation systems.

        "abstract": "Gasification technologies convert coal and biomass into synthesis gas feed streams that can either be used as a fuel for highly efficient power generation cycles or converted into value-added chemicals and transportation fuels.  However, coal-derived synthesis gas contains a myriad of contaminants that may be regulated in power plant emissions and act as poisons for the catalysts used in downstream chemical manufacturing processes.  TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes to develop a low-cost, high capacity, sorbent that can remove ammonia and hydrogen cyanide (NH3 and HCN, the acid rain precursors) and the trace metal contaminants (such as mercury, arsenic and selenium) from the synthesis gas in a single process step. Unlike the commercially available gas clean-up technologies, our multi-contaminant control system operates at 240oC (464oF), above the dew point of the synthesis gas; operating above the dewpoint improves process efficiency and reduces capital costs.  In Phase I, TDA developed a new sorbent that can remove multiple contaminants from simulated synthesis gas streams with high capacity and removal efficiency.   We ran the sorbent life through 50 absorption/regeneration cycles under representative conditions without any degradation in performance. In a preliminary engineering analysis, we also showed the economic viability of the new high temperature synthesis gas clean-up system against conventional low temperature scrubbers.  During Phase II we will continue to improve the performance of our sorbent and scale-up its production using commercial manufacturing techniques.   We will demonstrate the viability of the system in a prototype slipstream test unit using actual coal-derived synthesis gas.  We will also carry out a detailed system analysis and engineering assessment to fully quantify the benefits of the new technology.

        "abstract": "About 1,700 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) were emitted from 572 coal-fired power plants in 2012 in the U.S. To reduce the CO2 emissions, CO2 capture and sequestration processes need to be implemented. In addition to CO2, these plants produce more than 72 million tons of fly ash per year, among which 40 million tons are disposed of in landfills or surface impoundments with disposal costs of $222 million per year. Any beneficial, practical utilization of CO2 and fly ash to produce high value and high volume products would greatly relieve the pressure on the power industry.  This proposed project concerns a novel and beneficial CO2 utilization technology concurrent with fly ash application. In the presence of fly ash, flue gas CO2 interacts with renewable oils to produce a high performance, low cost, highly energy efficient, and environmentally friendly biopolymer building material. Classified as a non-hazardous material, this biopolymer can be used to replace or serve as an additive to petroleum based asphalt, sealant, and polymers in the manufacture of building materials. Compared to petroleum  based  products,  this  biopolymer  has  significant  advantages,  including  substantially  lower production costs, direct use of flue gas CO2  without compression, utilization of renewable and recycled materials,  a  water-  and  solvent-free  production  process  with  no  waste  streams,  improved  thermal durability and low temperature performance, improved fungal resistance, high energy efficiency, and elimination of the odor and volatile organic compounds emissions associated with petroleum products. In Phase I, the biopolymer was successfully produced, and its properties were fully characterized. The optimal biopolymer production conditions were determined.

The overall objectives of Phase II are to bring this proven and viable CO2 based  biopolymer  production  technology  from  a  laboratory  scale  to  a  pilot  scale  process,  produce biopolymer for industrial scale evaluations at other companies, and demonstrate its commercial viability.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: An efficient transformation of CO2 and recycled waste into a high value biopolymer is of significant importance for resource utilization and pollution prevention. The success of this project will result in a high performance biopolymer for sustainable building and infrastructure construction that will bring significant cost  savings  to  the  end-users,  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  waste  disposal,  protect  the environment, reduce the use of petroleum based products, and meet the future building and infrastructure needs.",

        "abstract": "Modern gas turbines must operate at higher temperatures in order to achieve better fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. To achieve maximum performance, components must be made of Nickel super-alloys and must be cast as single crystals. Although single crystal casting yields have improved, they have not improved sufficiently to enable wide-spread use of single crystal super-alloys in industrial gas turbines (IGT), primarily due to low yields. Innovative approaches to increase the yield are needed.  Mikro Systems proposes to apply its patented Tomo Lithographic Molding (TOMO)  process  to  produce  superior  ceramic  filters  that  are  used  to  remove  the impurities  during  the  molten  metal  pouring  step  in  the  casting  process.    Improved filtration will increase the yield and ultimately lower the cost of these critical and costly high technology parts.  A 1% improvement in casting yield could lead to annual savings over $10 million in the U.S. alone.  During Phase I Mikro demonstrated the technical feasibility of producing advanced designs for pour cup and inline filters using TOMO.  Until now, these designs could not be produced due to limitations in current manufacturing methods.  Flow tests of Mikro filters demonstrated much lower variability in flow rate and pressure drop from filter-to- filter compared with off-the-shelf filters.   Flow rates during single crystal casting are critically linked to the metal solidification process, which is directly tied to production yield for turbine blades.  The primary Phase II objectives are to optimize materials and filter designs to be ready for industry standard single crystal casting.  This will include extensive testing and modeling, and will conclude with foundry casting of an advanced turbine blade to evaluate and compare the new filter performance with current filters.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Advanced filters have application in investment casting of turbine components for IGT as well as the much larger aero turbine markets. This will improve the yield and lower costs for single crystal casting and can be expanded to other casting processes and products.  Investment casting is a multi-billion dollar global market.",

The seals can significantly affect the efficiency, operability, and durability of a gas turbine engine. As such, any improvements to these seals are highly desirable. Improvements may come in the form of reduced leakage and/or improved seal durability.  The Air Riding Seal technology is a rotating-to-static seal that reduces leakages without contacting the rotor thereby increasing the performance and durability of the machine. The seal uses a hydrostatic balance of forces to maintain very small clearances between the rotor and stator sustaining low leakage.  The phase I project addressed the feasibility of the concept through laboratory testing and an analysis match to the test data. It was shown that seal clearances can be reduced by an order of magnitude over the industry standard labyrinth seals and be reliably predicted with analysis models.  The phase II project will build upon the success of the phase I project by testing the seal to capture real world anomalies and addressing seal performance in simulated engine conditions. Detailed analysis models will be created and anchored to test data then used to predict performance for specific engine applications.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: It is shown that applying the Air Riding Seal technology to a utility-scale industrial gas turbine can reduce leakage by over 2.5%, increasing the power output of the machine by over 5.5% or reducing the fuel burn 1.25%. At todays energy rates this attributes to $7.2 million in increased annual revenue for each operating unit. Commercial application of this technology is not limited to industrial gas turbine engines.

The use of steel components would be preferable but without protective coatings they are susceptible to oxidation and chromium volatilization in air and carburization and coking on the fuel side of the system. To enable the adoption of stainless steels low-cost protective coatings are required to enhance the high temperature corrosion properties.  A low cost process to apply aluminide diffusion coatings to stainless steels is being developed, as an alternative to conventional aluminization processes to satisfy the corrosion resistance requirements of solid-oxide fuel-cell system developers as well as the broader power generation market. In Phase I the applicability of the coating approach for fuel cell applications was demonstrated through application- specific performance validation. Excellent high temperature oxidation, chromium volatilization, and coking resistances were demonstrated on a range of commercially important alloys. In parallel the manufacturability and value proposition of the technology was enhanced through scaling of the process to large balance-of-plant components with complex geometries.

        "abstract": "A light water reactor is equipped with control and shutdown rods which are inserted into and withdrawn from the reactor core to control reactivity.   The positioning of the control and shutdown rods is performed in Combustion Engineering designed plants with the control element drive mechanism system, which includes a number of subsystems and components critical to safe and reliable plant operation.  Aging and obsolescence issues have resulted in failures and plant downtimes that could have been prevented or mitigated by monitoring the condition of system components.  The complex design of the control element drive mechanism system inherently creates a need for an on-line diagnostics system that can improve system health monitoring, troubleshooting, and trending capabilities. This proposal offers to benefit the plants through increased system reliability, reduced plant downtime, and improved troubleshooting capabilities.  The Phase I project established the feasibility of continuous on-line health monitoring, advanced fault detection, and diagnostic techniques for the control element drive mechanism system.  This provides a non-intrusive solution using existing plant signals for detecting component failures and degradation.  The Phase I effort resulted in many techniques and applications which will provide significant benefits to this aging system.  In Phase II, a research and development effort will prototype a comprehensive health monitoring and diagnostic solution for the control element drive mechanism system.  This prototype system will integrate automated data collection with the monitoring, fault detection and diagnostic techniques developed in the Phase I effort.  This system will be designed, developed, validated, and demonstrated in the proposing firms laboratory and at participating nuclear power plant facilities.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: This Phase II effort will result in three commercial product designs including a portable field test system, a permanently installed comprehensive system, and field testing services to evaluate the control element drive mechanism system using the techniques and tools developed under this project.  These products are currently applicable to nearly 40 existing and planned future power plants.",

Manufacturing large, high aspect ratio, components using silicon carbide composite materials presents unique manufacturing challenges to maintain dimensional tolerance and meet the performance needs for in core reactor components.  Physical Sciences Inc. will utilize our pre-ceramic polymer and laser machining expertise to develop the manufacturing process necessary for cost effective production of nuclear grade silicon carbide composite components for use in the core of nuclear systems.   In Phase I, PSI demonstrated the ability to produce high aspect ratio, thin walled tubular components greater than 2 meters in length with diameters of 1.1 cm to 10 cm that maintained tolerances of +/- 0.005cm. The components met strength and dimensional requirements. In addition, we demonstrated the ability to laser machine the components to surface smoothness of 20 microns or less.  In Phase II, PSI will develop and produce full size prototype components conforming to the dimensions of NGNP and LWRS designs. We will iteratively combine CMC process improvements and materials analysis, including transmission electron microscopy and mass spectrometry, to optimize the polymer precursor and resulting matrix for in-core nuclear reactor environments. These will be validated by radiation testing.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Silicon carbide composite reactor components will enable safer, more efficient operation of present and future nuclear systems. The radiation tolerant nature of silicon carbide composites will reduce the likelihood of component failures due to embrittlement from radiation exposure.

        "abstract": "Energy Research Company (ERCo), Savannah River National Laboratory, and Los Alamos National Laboratory propose the development of a new sensor for tracking radioactive material during nuclear fuel reprocessing.   Reprocessing spent nuclear fuel has significant safety and environmental advantages over the current predominant practice of storing the spent fuel in temporary facilities indefinitely.  However reprocessing cannot take place unless safeguards are in place to prevent the theft of radioactive materials by terrorist entities for their use in weapons of mass destruction. Currently these safeguard practices render reprocessing too slow and expensive for widespread adoption. The sensor proposed here enables near-real time accounting of radioactive material, greatly decreasing the cost of reprocessing and thereby removing a major impediment from more widespread nuclear fuel reprocessing.  ERCos sensor measures concentrations of chemical elements in- situ and in near real-time, which provides on-the-spot accountancy of plutonium, uranium, and other radioactive materials. This capability greatly restricts the potential for theft of these materials. The speed of the measurements and their coverage of all the elements at once also obviates the need for many time consuming and expensive laboratory analyses of the spent fuel, greatly improving the economics of reprocessing.  The laboratory testing apparatus built during Phase I proved the concept of this project by demonstrating highly accurate concentration measurements of relevant chemical elements, including uranium, in acid solutions representative of those in reprocessing plants.   The experiments included both single element solutions and multi-element mixtures.  ERCo, with guidance from Los Alamos National Laboratory, will build a prototype sensor based on the Phase I laboratory apparatus.  The prototype sensor will be demonstrated in a spent nuclear fuel reprocessing facility located in Savannah River National Laboratory during long term tests, and the sensors readings verified by laboratory analyses.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The benefits of reprocessing spent nuclear fuel are significant, and include reducing the volume of spent fuel that needs to be stored and safeguarded and reducing the impact of uranium mining on the environment.  Reprocessing is currently done in only a handful of plants around the world.   ERCos proposed technology will make it economical and safe to expand nuclear fuel reprocessing both domestically and internationally.",

        "abstract": "Nuclear material accounting within the nuclear fuel cycle includes preventing and detecting theft or diversion of special nuclear material. Neutron detection by use of pressurized He-3 tubes is a critical component within the scheme of safeguarding nuclear materials.  Due to the worldwide shortage  and  high  demand  of  3He  supply,  alternative  neutron  detection  technologies  are required to ensure and proper material management.  RMD has developed a new scintillation material Cs2LiYCl6:Ce (CLYC) for dual neutron/gamma detection that is enriched with 6Li, providing a higher neutron sensitivity per unit volume than a typical  He-3  tube due  to the higher  material density.   When coupled to a state-of-the-art photodetector, digitizing electronics and processing algorithms, an advanced detector module provides a plug-and-play neutron detector that is readily implemented into existing, new or complex detector systems, reducing development cost of new instruments.  The Phase-I program has demonstrated that typical sizes ranging from 1 to 5-cm cubic crystals are viable and can provide an accurate measurement within the assay time constraints within the paradigm of nuclear material accounting.  CLYC can be coupled to a variety of high-gain detectors (APDs, SSPMs, MPPCs, or PMTs), but the super bialkali photomultipliers provide the best performance.  The Phase-I program has developed a new method for identifying neutrons in a high-intensity, gamma-ray field with event rates exceeding 600 kHz.  The Phase-II program will develop the detector scheme for a modular detector that provides digital information of incident events, where the signal processing is made within the digital domain.  The detector will consist of a CLYC crystal, an analog to digital converter, an FPGA circuit, and i/o ports for control and streaming data. The hardware and software will be optimized for a CLYC based detector with a complete device evaluation using relevant nuclear materials.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: CLYC has been identified as a replacement for He-3 tubes and provides excellent energy resolutions for scintillation materials for gamma-ray spectroscopy.   This dual use sensitivity requires more processing of the signal waveforms not necessary of other types of materials, and this program solves this by implementing an adaptable framework from which to develop new instruments.   The unit developed in this Phase-II program can implemented for nuclear material security, radiation detection, gamma and neutron imaging, calorimetry or spectroscopy within the fields of security, defense, science, and medicine.",

Similarly, new methods and technologies are needed to address key issues affecting future deployments of nuclear energy, while reducing the risk of nuclear proliferation. Successfully undertaking MC &amp; amp;A requires new detectors that circumvent the current shortage of 3He.  We propose to develop a high-efficiency, low- noise, solid-state neutron detector with intrinsic pulse shape and pulse height discrimination capabilities that allows effective real-time separation of neutron signals from gamma events. At the heart of the proposed detector are novel scintillators, incorporating heavy concentration of 6Li ions, synthesized in a structured form using a specialized technique that permits large-volume synthesis of high-quality material in hours and allows creation of unconventional compositions.   Resulting sensors will be coupled to photodetectors to realize high-efficiency thermal neutron detectors with high gamma/neutron discrimination for effective operation in mixed radiation fields anticipated in measurements of spent nuclear fuels.  Two families of novel neutron sensitive scintillators demonstrating excellent pulse shape and pulse height discrimination were discovered during this highly successful Phase I. These materials  demonstrated  neutron/gamma  separation,  count-rate  and  efficiency  rivaling,  and  in  some respects exceeding, that of current state-of-the-art scintillators.   Experimental data and Monte-Carlo simulations both demonstrated their suitability for the desired MC &amp; amp;A operations.  Phase I also demonstrated unique ability of our synthesis method to create large structures suitable for portal imaging and/or neutron diffraction/radiography applications.  We plan to develop, evaluate, and deliver to DOE fully functional detectors based on the scintillators discovered in Phase I, and demonstrate their performance in terms of neutron detection efficiency, high gamma rejection ratios, and ability to perform in the presence of intense gamma backgrounds.  We will primarily focus on developing handheld instruments useful for neutron counting and spectroscopy.  Specific areas of research will include material synthesis and characterizations, and Monte-Carlo simulations to optimize the detector and moderator geometries.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Besides safeguarding nuclear facilities, ensuring effective MC &amp; amp;A in facilities, and allowing radiography/tomography in new approaches for spent-fuel storage and processing, improved scintillators and non-3He detectors are critically important to homeland security, nuclear and high-energy physics research, nuclear waste cleanup, nuclear treaty verification, geological exploration and development of new sources to effectively address our nations future energy needs.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Electromechanical Actuation (EMA) systems are becoming preferred choice in aircraft applications owing to their response time, power consumption, heat load, peak power, and weight related advantages. However, employing EMAs in critical flight control applications demands reliability assurance and capability to predict failures ahead of time. Through the Phase-I effort, Qualtech Systems, Inc. (QSI) in collaboration with Lockheed Martin Corp., and Moog Inc. developed a proof-of-concept hybrid EMA PHM scheme for real-time (and offline) detection, identification, and diagnosis of faults and degradations, their level/severity estimation, and forecasting. The Phase-II effort is geared towards advancing the EMA PHM technology to a deployment-ready state through stages of test-rig demonstration and field-validation. The PHM technology will be implemented and packaged into software by using QSI&quot;s TEAMS toolset for design and analysis of health management systems. The technology will be demonstrated for (a) real-time application by embedding on an EMA controller, and (b) post-mission PHM decision-making. EMAs used in K-Max Remotely Piloted Helicopter and Marlin Autonomous Underwater Vehicle are the candidates target systems for this effort. The goal of the demonstration is to verify and validate the performance, usability, and maturity of the PHM technology  and set off the deployment and commercialization drive.  BENEFIT:  The PHM scheme will provide a means to monitor and assess health conditions of EMAs facilitating detection, identification, level estimation of faults and degradations, and their forecasting. These capabilities are crucial for acceptance of a relatively new engineering system in safety and performance critical applications, such as control surface actuations in aviation, space, and underwater vehicular platforms. The PHM technology developed through this effort will be implemented using QSI&quot;s TEAMS (Testability Engineering and Maintenance System) software toolset. TEAMS hosts a wealth of design and analytic capabilities applicable to fault detection and diagnosis, diagnostic performance assessment, maintenance support and troubleshooting. The TEAMS-based EMA PHM software, on one hand, will be able to leverage these inbuilt capabilities, and on the other hand, will enjoy shorter maturation period  owing to the maturity of the host platform.  While the primary target application area of this PHM technology is EMAs on military air platform, it is likely to find a wide range of commercial applications. Small unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) heavily depend on EMAs, and they are being widely used in off-shore oil and gas exploration and mining applications. Remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) is another type of platform where EMAs are finding wide-scale use. Today, RPAs are being increasingly inducted into civilian surveillance and monitoring applications. EMAs are also finding way in transport and passenger aircraft (e.g., Boeing 787, and Airbus 380). Having an EMA PHM software will improve the safety and reduce the EMA related downtime in all these sectors.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The secure transmission of digital information is of extreme importance for military and commercial applications.  The need for protecting information from hostile eavesdroppers has motivated the search for novel security schemes.  The current state of the art exploits quantum mechanics for the secure distribution of keys to enable the secure exchange of information.  This Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) approach promises to provide a final solution to the problem by insuring unconditional security based upon the laws of quantum mechanics.      Numerous experiments demonstrating QKD have been conducted in both fiber and free space configurations. While the performance of these systems in terms of data rates (key rates) and distance is below that seen in classical transmission of information, the security promised by QKD makes it an enticing technology.  The last frontier for QKD is satellite to ground applications, where the need is great to have unconditionally secure method for communications.    To address this potential, SA Photonics has developed the Sphinx QKD system for LEO-to-ground applications.  By combining several innovative techniques to support high speed operation and tight temporal and spectral filtering, the Sphinx system provides high secure rates and supports operation during both day and nighttime.      BENEFIT:  The Sphinx system provides numerous benefits for both military and commercial applications.  By supporting high rate secure key distribution between LEO satellites and ground terminals, a new era of secure satellite communications is possible.  The absolute security enabled by Sphinx will allow reliable and secure information exchange for military, government and commercial applications.  In addition, they key Sphinx technology and architecture is applicable to terrestrial Free Space Optical links as well, support secure communication needs on military bases and domestic and foreign government buildings, embassies and complexes.",

In the proposed effort, we plan to continue our development of thallium bromide (TlBr), a wide\nband gap semiconductor that recently has shown great promise as a gamma-ray detector material. In addition\nto high density (7.5 g/cm3), high atomic number constituents (81, 35) and wide band gap (2.68 eV) the\nmaterial melts congruently at a modest temperature (480 \uf0b0C) and does not undergo a phase change as the\ncrystal cools to room temperature, which allows use of melt-based crystal growth approaches to produce\nlarge volume TlBr crystals. The cubic crystal structure of TlBr also simplifies crystal growth and device\nprocessing. As a result of recent progress in purification, crystal growth and processing, TlBr detectors with\nmobility-lifetime products of mid 10-3 cm2/V for electrons and mid 10-4 cm2/V for holes has been achieved.\nThis has enabled the development of TlBr gamma-ray spectrometers with thickness exceeding 1 cm. TlBr\ndetectors fabricated in our lab have exhibited < 1 % energy resolution (FWHM) at 662 keV with cooling and\ndepth correction.\nTo date, to obtain excellent long term performance of thick TlBr detector arrays, modest cooling (to ~ - 20\nC) has been required. We have demonstrated stable TlBr detector performance exceeding 9 months with the\ndetector continuously biased and operated at \u2013 18 \uf0b0C. This level of cooling is easily achieved with a\nthermoelectric cooler. Cooling however, does increase the power budget of a detector system.\nIn addition to cooling as a method to obtain long term TlBr detector stability, research at RMD and\nelsewhere has shown that surface processing, electrode materials and thermal annealing significantly\ninfluence the long term stability of TlBr detectors operated at room temperature. During Phase I RMD has\ndemonstrated 5 mm thick TlBr detectors with long term stability exceeding 90 days at room temperature. It is\nour goal in Phase II to further investigate the effects of surface processing, electrodes and annealing on long\nterm stability of TlBr detectors operated at room temperature. In addition, doping will be investigated as a\nmethod for modifying ionic conductivity. Dr. Harry Tuller\u2019s group at the materials science department of\nMIT will collaborate with RMD on this aspect of the project. Ultimately our goal is to develop TlBr\nspectrometers that are stable for more than 1 year at room temperature.\nSuch an efficient, high resolution detector will find applications in nuclear monitoring areas such as\nnuclear treaty verification, safeguards, environmental monitoring, nuclear waste cleanup, and border\nsecurity. Nuclear and particle physics as well as astrophysics are other fields of science were gamma-ray\nspectrometers are used.\nThe developed detectors should have the following advantages:\n\uf0b7 -Efficient detection of gamma-rays (better than CZT per unit volume)\n\uf0b7 -Energy resolution < 1% (FWHM) at 662 keV at room temperature\n\uf0b7 -Lower cost than CZT-based system due to lower cost crystal growth",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Temperature control has been a major concern during High Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF) processing since its introduction to the aerospace industry.  Typically, substrate temperature must not exceed 300oF to prevent heat damage/ tempering of steel alloys, and even lower temperature requirements for aluminum and titanium alloys.  Shop air cooling, most common temperature control, has proven to be inadequate for controlling substrate temperatures during many HVOF applications.  As a result, longer off-part dwell times are required to allow for component cooling that results in significant cost due to powder and gas consumptions. Traditionally temperature measuring control has been a continuous single infrared point location on the component being sprayed.  Consequently, temperature variations across the component causes inaccuracies.    Phase I and II of this effort matured the ES3 novel cooling and temperature monitoring system on 6Al-4V Ti substrate to a TRL 7 by evaluating the system&quot;s affect on fatigue and coating integrity characteristics; including Demostration/Validation testing on a C-5 slat track proving its overall effectiveness for future implementation.  Phase II.5 will focus on additional qualification testing on 4340 steel and Inc718 substrates, and develop a technical data package for engineering evaluation for implementation, maturing the overall process to a TRL 8.    BENEFIT:  ES3 anticipates the results of Phase II.5 work will qualify and validate the usage of the ES3 novel cooling and temperature monitoring system for typical alloys utilized on aircraft components qualified for HVOF coating application.

These filters are based on lumped and distributed hybrid structures and innovative microstrip designs to cover a large bandwidth. Their innovation in filtering unwanted interference without significant effects on the noise factor will enable electronic warfare (EW) radios to communicate reliably, particularly in radio frequency (RF)-challenged combat environments. The bandstop SCAB will provide the ability to remove inband (sometimes intentional) interference impinging from high-power transmitters in communication channels. The bandpass SCAB will improve receiver selectivity by reducing the bandwidth of the receiver for higher noise/interference rejection. The technology represented by SCAB filters not only maintains spectral purity in EW systems, but also improves RF interoperability with other platforms. In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of the SCAB filter by simulating and fabricating a prototype. In Phase II, POC plans to advance the design, optimize it for testing with Navy personnel, and demonstrate that SCAB filters meet the requirements for insertion loss, volume, and power consumption, for reliable communication in an RF-challenged combat environment.",

In Phase I, we achieved tangible and practical results to effectively analyze cracks already detected in metallic aircraft structures and determine the causes of failure in real time without access to the crack face. To meet Navy&quot;s specific requirements, we used a proof-of-concept INFLA prototype to differentiate the crack due to cyclic (fatigue) loading from that caused by one-time (static) overload. In Phase II, we plan to further mature and develop a full-scale INFLA system that implements integrated hardware and software to test the cracks in metal samples and/or cracks of known origins in actual flight hardware.

(www.NxGENelectronics.com), teamed with its subcontractor Linear Signal, LLC (www.linearsignal.com) has successfully completed a Phase I contract for the 2011 NASA SBIR Phase I, Topic S1.02, subtopic, &quot;Low Cost mm-wave Beamforming MMIC Receiver&quot;. These receivers, operating at 35.6 GHz and 94 GHz, are targeted for the space-borne, polarimetric, Doppler-capable radar for the NASA Aerosol/Cloud/Ecosystems (ACE) Mission, the successor to other cloud-study satellite missions such as CloudSat and EarthCare. The radar antenna itself will consist of 3.3 meter wide, 35.6 GHz and 94 GHz co-located linear antenna arrays that scan across the direction of orbit.The size of integrated receiver electronics behind each of these arrays does not extend beyond the antenna outline.  The critical physical specification for phased array antennas is the spacing between antenna elements. At 94 GHz, this implies an element spacing of 1.6 mm, while at 35.6 GHz the spacing is more generous at ~4.2 mm.   Then, for this particular configuration of 3.3 meter wide arrays the total number of receive elements is ~800 for the 35.6 GHz antenna and ~2048 for the 94 GHz antenna.  The  integrated receiver combines multiple array elements and their supporting circuitry into one integrated electronics package which results in an order of magnitude reduction in per channel cost and size.   Moreover, the decrease in package interconnect will also result in marked increase in reliability.The other main goal of this project is to meet the functional requirements for W-band receiver.  The original requirements per the Phase I solicitation is as follows:- Frequencies: 35.6, 94 GHz- Input Channels: 16- Phase shifter: 360 degrees, 5 bits- Serial phase update rate:&gt;10 kHz for all channels- Output IF: 1 channel,&lt;2 GHz- Bandwidth:&gt;100 MHz",

        "abstract": "The ideal semiconductor detector for nuclear monitoring should have good\nenergy resolution, high detection efficiency, compact size, light weight, easy\nportability and low cost. In the proposed effort, we plan to develop a detector\nmodule for nuclear monitoring based on thallium bromide (TlBr), a wide band gap\nsemiconductor that recently has shown great promise as a gamma-ray detector\nmaterial. TlBr has a number of very promising properties. It has high density (7.5\ng/cm3) and high atomic number constituents (81, 35), which promises high\nsensitivity. The electrical resistivity of the material is high (>1010 \uf057-cm) without\ndeep level doping. Furthermore, the material melts congruently at a modest\ntemperature (480 \uf0b0C) and does not undergo a phase change as the crystal cools\nto room temperature, which allows use of melt-based crystal growth approaches\nsuch as Bridgman and Czochralski to produce large volume TlBr crystals. The\ncubic crystal structure of TlBr also simplifies crystal growth and device\nprocessing. As a result of recent progress in purification, crystal growth and\nprocessing, TlBr detectors with mobility-lifetime (\u03bc\uf074) products of mid 10-3 cm2/V\nfor electrons and mid 10-4 cm2/V for holes has been achieved. This has enabled\nthe development of TlBr gamma-ray spectrometers with thickness exceeding 1\ncm. In fact, TlBr detectors fabricated at RMD have exhibited < 1 % energy\nresolution (FWHM) at 662 keV upon depth correction. These detectors were\ncooled to -20\uf0b0C to achieve stable operation.\nThe goal of this Phase II project is to build a cooled, compact TlBr gamma-ray\ndetector module using the 3-dimensional position-sensitive readout technology\npioneered by the group at the University of Michigan. The key advancement is to\ndevelop a lower power charge sensing ASIC that can digitally sample the outputs\nof an array of preamplifiers. By sampling the preamplifier outputs, the induced\ncharges on the detector electrodes can be obtained as a function of time, so that\ndigital signal processing can be used to perform gamma-ray spectroscopy, to\ndetermine the depth of interaction of individual gamma-ray energy depositions,\nas well as to measure charge drift time, electric field distribution within TlBr and\nlifetimes of electrons and holes. The digital ASIC readout system will enable both\nfundamental research on TlBr detectors and practical operation to perform\ngamma-ray imaging and spectroscopy outside the laboratory. Since TlBr\ndetectors can operate in a stable manner at \uf02d20\uf0b0C, power consumption of the\ndigital ASIC system should be minimized so that the system can be cooled to\nrequired temperature using Peltier coolers. Such an efficient, high resolution, 3-D position sensitive detector module will\nfind application in nuclear monitoring areas such as nuclear treaty verification,\nsafeguards, environmental monitoring, nuclear waste cleanup, and border\nsecurity. Nuclear and particle physics as well as astrophysics are other fields of\nscience were gamma-ray spectrometers are used.\nThe developed detectors should have the following advantages:\n\uf0b7 -Efficient detection of gamma-rays (better than CZT per unit volume)\n\uf0b7 -Energy resolution < 1% (FWHM) at 662 keV\n\uf0b7 -Lower cost than CZT-based system due to lower cost crystal growth",

The shear strengths of the SiC/Cf composite-C103 alloy joints (156 MPa) were almost 5 times higher than the highest value (34 MPa) reported in open literature.

        "abstract": "Usually the lifetime of a trailer is much longer than tractors; tractors must work with a variety types and ages of trailers over the course of their use. In many scenarios (e.g., roadside inspection, border crossing, smart parking, connected vehicle initiative, etc.), it is necessary to identify trailer(s)' VIN(s) and know their sequences attached to the powered unit.  An automated trailer VIN identification and sequencing system is proposed here, with the capability of identifying trailers' VINs and sorting their sequence without drivers/operators involved. The system is extremely low-cost and easily deployable in large scale. Advanced version of the system can interface with trailer sensors to improve the safety and productivity of the fleets. The proposed system has been tested for feasibility on a real tractor and trailer combination vehicle in Phase I.  In Phase II, the system will be further refined and improved for its functions and tested in vehicle operational environment and more complicated scenarios and tractor-trailer configurations.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Next-generation thermal management systems in advanced aircraft must utilize all available heat sinks including fuel, ram air, and third stream air flows to effectively manage aircraft thermal loads.  To this end, we propose to develop a compact, highly integrated condenser to enhance aircraft heat rejection capacity in very challenging thermal environments.  The condenser has a built-in thermal switch.  When the cooling air is cooler than the fuel, the thermal switch is turned on to allow the air flow to efficiently cool not only the refrigerant but also the fuel that serves as thermal storage.  When the air is warmer than the fuel, the thermal switch is turned off to insulate the fuel and refrigerant from the air stream while allowing the cool fuel to absorb heat from the refrigerant.  In Phase I, we proved the feasibility of our approach by defining a complete set of specifications for the condenser; designing and building a proof-of-concept adaptive condenser; and demonstrating its performance features in simulated hot and cool environments.  In Phase II we will design, build, and demonstrate a full-size condenser module under prototypical thermal conditions.      BENEFIT:  Creares adaptive condenser technology will enhance heat rejection capacities of military aircraft in challenging thermal environments and reduce the size, weight, and drag penalties of thermal management systems.  Military applications include adaptive thermal management systems for legacy and future advanced aircraft.  Commercial applications include thermal management systems for commercial aircraft, air conditioning systems, and thermal management systems for computer farms.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Warfighters need to be able to trust the systems on which their lives depend. Cases include an individual human trusting an individual computer, an individual computer trusting a server or network to which it is connecting, a server or network trusting an individual computer connecting to it, and (new here) one network trusting another with which it is inter-connecting. Military airborne networks and the emerging commercial Internet of Things and People (IoTaP) are complex dynamic environments. One problem is the need for sophisticated techniques; another is the difficulty of integrating these into a comprehensive end-to-end solution for wireless mobile ad hoc network (MANET) attestation despite $SWAP constraints. Our solution is agent/capability-based Mandatory Access Control, information dispersal complementing strong encryption, and Trusted Computing Group (TCG) Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) inspired Distributed Attestation for Mobile, Multicast & Multiple Operator Networks (DAM3ON). The goal is secure and trusted transactions in a distributed Network Centric Operations environment. TPM chips, security enhanced bootloaders, microkernels that enforce capability based access control, hypervisors, security enhanced operating systems, robust encrypted distributed file systems, scalable reliable multicast transport protocols and [zero knowledge] remote attestation protocols all exist, but no architecture integrating these and exploiting their synergies has existed heretofore.  BENEFIT:  The transition opportunities of integrating the RADTiN/DAM3ON solution into industrial and commercial networks are based upon: integrating the software solution into an existing network and data security hardware product as a licensed sale; integrating the software solution into an existing mobile platform developer as part of an NSP offering, as an OEM sale; or developing our own distribution channel to sell customized versions of the RADTiN/DAM3ON software product line as an after-market reliability and security solution. The industrial and commercial target customers would have a great deal in common with the DoD users being addressed, having to address security and trust issues with remote and/or mobile networked nodes/platforms/smartphones. The team will address these potential users (national grid network monitoring/inspection mobile networked platforms, private corporate network operators, ad hoc disaster relief organizations; border/crisis monitoring platforms, etc) with customized demonstrations based upon their most likely deployed platforms  But the most unique commercialization opportunity is in the emerging digital currency/commerce marketplace. Using the teams already existing reputation (as the enablers of the worlds first BitCoin/vending machine transaction) and relationships, the RADTiN/DAM3ON software will be demonstrated as a key enabling technology for the establishment of trust and the security of transactions between digital wallets and physical point-of-sale machines. The key to penetration in this emerging marketplace is to maximize automation (ease of operation), verified security of your smartphone and digital wallet, and trust in the sales machine, the protection of your data in motion (to the machine) and at rest (in the cloud) The ability to clearly attest to the security of your smartphone, your digital wallet, and your data before, during, and after the transaction will be of interest to the firms attempting to broaden this emerging economy. The demonstration of this technology will allow the team entry into these diverse marketplaces, and represent a unique potential commercialization opportunity for a DoD SBIR research effort.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Nu-Trek will be designing a reliability assessment system for testing RF devices, systems , and subsystems. The reliability system features a System-on-Chip (SoC) that provides high frequency (X-band and L band) test signals to the Device Under Test (DUT). The SoC also receives the signal at select test points in the DUT signal chain, and converts the amplitude of the signal at each point in the DUT to a DC signal through the use of an RF peak detector. The URel SoC measures the DC current, gain, and compression point of each test point in the DUT signal chain and sends the test data to a data acquisition card and a PC for further analysis. In Phase I Nu-Trek developed system and sub-block requirements, designed key SoC blocks, and developed a specification and top level design for the entire reliability assessment system. Upon completion of the development effort, the URel Sys will be offered in a rack mounted chassis. Each chassis will be able to test 8 DUTs. The user can rack mount as many chassis as desired, testing tens of parts simultaneously. It will be offered with custom and commercial reliability software.  BENEFIT:  Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) typically used to test RF devices, components, and sub systems are very large and cost between tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars. This constrains the amount of testing that is affordable, slowing progress on new processes and process nodes, such as GaN and small feature size CMOS.   In the proposed work, Nu-Trek is developing a System-on-Chip (SoC) based reliability assessment system that will be offered in conjunction with custom and commercially available reliability software. The compactness, robustness, and the low price point ($500 in volume for a baseline model) of the SoC-based reliability assessment system makes reliability testing much more affordable, accelerating process and device commercialization.",

Further, the process of updating an existing simulator database can be difficult and costly due to simulation database rights licensing, complex simulation host architectures, and the need to re-validate updated models. The proposed effort will address this need and overcome these limitations through the introduction of an external hardware/software host called the StallBox. With this solution, the StallBox is integrated with the existing simulator, requiring only minor changes to the existing system software to enable the communication between the StallBox and the simulator host. With the StallBox, the host database remains untouched and the aerodynamic model elements needed to provide the enhanced stall/upset model capability are introduced into the existing simulation only when the simulated aircraft&quot;s flight conditions demand it. In this manner, the existing simulation host architecture and proprietary database remain unmodified, and the validation of the existing configuration is not violated.",

This SAM system will revolutionize the construction industry by significantly increasing the efficiency and throughput of brick wall construction using automation. The SAM system will be leased or sold to masonry contractors. The core technology being developed incorporates proprietary sensing, control systems, and mortar dispensing to achieve computer aided design (CAD)-driven, highly accurate automated bricklaying capability. The Phase II project will focus on developing and integrating key technical components of the system. The main technical objectives for the Phase II grant are to (1) fully integrate a mortar pumping and measurement system, (2) achieve brick placement accuracy during all jobsite conditions, (3) develop CAD to brick mapping software, and (4) to prepare the product for commercial viability. In addition, we will perform a number of site demonstrations to prove commercial viability. This project will stretch the bounds of commercial robotics as well as expand the scope of possibilities across the construction industry. Many new technologies will continue to be developed during the Phase II project in order to progress from prototyping to testing, and eventually commercial readiness. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is a technology to revolutionize the masonry construction industry. The SAM robotic system will provide many significant societal benefits including more predictable and reliable work, less physical demand on masons, lower costs and more design flexibility for the use of brick. By reducing the physical demands on the mason and increasing the use of technology, it will provide significant health benefits, effectively increasing the work life of older masons and attracting younger masons to the industry. Brick-based construction represents a significant portion of the global and U.S. economies, with over $20 billion spent on all domestic masonry work, and over $5 billion spent on commercial brick masonry alone. The significant increase in efficiency provided by this SAM system will make brick masonry more affordable. This could potentially lead to growth of the brick industry, resulting in many environmental and customer benefits such as energy and resource conservation. Through commercialization of the world&#039;s first robotic Semi-Automated masonry system, this project will help to expand the capability of an industry and revitalize the masonry trade.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop a noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor based on a pilot clinical study correlating ocular blood pressure and blood flow parameters to ICP. The proposed novel device will combine several standard medical techniques used by ophthalmologists to gather data. The ultimate goal for this project is to develop a portable, easy-to-use unit that will be used by medical personnel on patients in the hospital, and prior to their arrival. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be to improve the diagnosis of patients with head injury by improving the diagnosis of elevated ICP, and reducing the complications associated with unnecessary invasive procedures. ICP monitoring is a common tool for physicians treating patients with acute intracranial hypertension caused by neurological disorders, trauma, and stroke. Knowledge of a patient&#039;s ICP progression aids the physician in determining the optimal medical and/or surgical treatment. Every year, these surgical procedures expose patients to significant complications. Commercialization of a noninvasive ICP monitor would significantly decrease the burden on patients and to the healthcare system in the diagnosis and treatment of head injury by determining ICP more cheaply and safely than current technologies. A non-invasive method also would address the need for additional long-term ICP monitoring data, and expand the knowledge of how mild or moderate traumatic brain injury relates to ICP.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop &quot;Low Cost Smart Window Film&quot; that reduces building energy consumption by dynamically optimizing solar gain. Low cost roll to roll processing techniques will be used to create unique electrochromic layers. The novel electrochromic layers will be scaled-up and used to construct insulated glass windows. Systematic characterization of the electrochromic film stability to UV and high temperature exposure will be evaluated and their long term reliability performance will be improved to meet the requirements. Upon successful completion of the project, the electrochromic windows expect to achieve enhanced solar modulation at fast switching speeds and manufactured at 2-3x lower cost than the currently available smart windows. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project pertains to residential and commercial buildings represent a prime opportunity to improve energy efficiency and sustainability worldwide. In the United States lighting and thermal management within buildings account for 20% of yearly energy consumption. The economic and environmental benefits of using electrochromic windows are clear: reducing one quad of energy use would yield an average savings of $10.6 billion, while eliminating about 21.5 gigawatts of power produced by fossil fuels and saving nearly 59 million metric tons of CO2 emissions. It is estimated that the use electrochromic windows in building can achieve a 50% reduction in peak energy demand and a 30% reduction in overall energy use. Still, current electrochromic windows in the market have not reached their market potential due to their high cost. Novel electrochromic windows are based on an innovative material system that increases performance while reducing production cost. Wide scale adoption of this technology will enhance market penetration for dynamic windows.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is intended to establish the feasibility of a high-efficiency, low-cost electric power generator called the C-TEC, for Concentration-mode Thermoelectric Converter. The C-TEC is an electrochemical converter that generates electricity from heat using a thermally-regenerated concentration gradient of ions across an electrolyte membrane, rather than a thermal gradient across a semiconductor material. This important difference yields a technology with the potential for the high efficiency of a fuel cell, combined with the low cost, low maintenance, and long life of a thermoelectric device. Detailed theoretical models and calculations have shown the potential for greater than 30% efficiency in similar devices, but in practice, only 15% to 19% efficiency has ever been realized. The Phase I program successfully demonstrated the key elements of a low-cost, high-efficiency design, and created a simple efficiency algorithm for developing a device capable of demonstrating high efficiency. This efficiency model will be refined using prototype verification builds during the Phase II program, and then used to design, build and test a prototype device suitable for the distributed power generation markets. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the development of low cost, high efficiency generators that can operate using any form of heat in a wide variety of applications. C-TEC generators are inherently more versatile than other technologies that require high-grade, specific fuels, such as engines (gasoline), turbines (natural gas), fuel cells (hydrogen), or solar cells (sunlight). The C-TEC makes no noise, has no moving parts, and requires no maintenance, making it ideal for long-term power generation. Clean, distributed electricity provided by microCHP (Combined Heat and Power systems at less than 5 kW electrical power) enables breakthrough electrical efficiency greater than 90% in the home, representing an important technology for the widespread adoption of the electric car. The C-TEC-powered electric car will use domestic natural gas as a bridge to renewables, reducing emissions and dependence on foreign oil and massive infrastructure development costs associated with upgrades to our grid capacity. Other technologies have been proposed as prime movers for microCHP, including fuel cells and engines, but these fall short in terms of cost and maintenance. Ultimately, the cost and versatility of the C-TEC will provide economic advantages like fast payback to drive the adoption of new clean technologies.",

        "abstract": "The innovation combines mobile technologies becoming more widely used in schools, an evidence-based beginning reading program with a long history of R &amp; D and widespread use in many settings, ongoing student progress monitoring and assessment with results and instructional recommendations delivered in real time, and instructional supports that assist teachers, paraprofessionals, tutors, and parents in implementing effective, research-based teaching strategies to efficiently help children learn to read. While substantial evidence supports computer use in education, most software used for reading provides only targeted skills practice and is &quot;non-instructional&quot;. The beginning reading curricula with student assessment and monitoring mobile applications are innovative because they (a) include a complete evidence-based reading curricula that is well-aligned with research-based teaching and learning strategies and common core reading standards; (b) incorporate regular assessment to promote mastery of reading skills; (c) adapt based on student responses and assessment data to best meet students&#039; needs; (d) include on-demand assistance to instructors to effectively implement the program; (e) provide a simple yet elegant interface that incorporates universal design features and promotes effective use of technology for teaching; and (f) remain a cost-effective alternative for efficiently teaching beginning reading skills. The broader/commercial impact of beginning reading curricula with student assessment and monitoring mobile applications is based on a demonstrated ability to change reading outcomes. Many students are at high risk for reading failure and need effective intervention in early grades. The Nation&#039;s Report Card indicates 67% of fourth graders have only partial mastery of reading skills and are struggling readers. Substantial evidence shows struggling readers are more likely to drop out before graduating, become incarcerated, and experience lifelong economic loss leading to poorer health, family, and social outcomes. Additionally, research shows that early literacy skills predict later math and science outcomes which are crucial for STEM participation. Societal implications are clear: early reading success promotes better outcomes throughout lives, while reading failure is costly to individuals and society. Yet, changing reading trajectories for struggling readers is challenging, pointing to a strong need for high-quality, intensive early reading instruction that incorporates research-based teaching and learning strategies. The beginning reading curricula with student assessment and monitoring mobile applications have clear educational and societal significance. They are cost effective, evidence-based, and provide innovative, adaptive, flexible and accessible mobile applications that parents and school staff can use to efficiently teach early reading skills.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop integrated DC-DC power converters using magnetic thin-film power inductors. Currently, microprocessors and systems-on-chip (SoCs) are powered with board level voltage regulators assembled from discrete components. As supply voltages have scaled for digital integrated circuits (ICs), this power delivery paradigm has become increasingly inefficient, as power is delivered through the resistance of the power delivery network (PDN) at low voltages and high currents. In a typical case where 100 W is delivered at 1 V, 10% of the total power delivered may be wasted in the resistance of the PDN. The objective of this project is to commercialize power converters utilizing inductors with precisely engineered laminations of high permeability magnetic material. This will enable a significant improvement in power converter current density and subsequently enable power supplies for microprocessors and systems-on-chip to be down-converted in the same package, or even on the same die. This new class of integrated voltage regulators (IVRs) will provide as much as a 20% reduction in total power consumption for digital ICs by reducing resistive losses and enabling improved power management techniques. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is a reduction in power consumption for all digital computing platforms, ranging from smartphones to data centers. The total energy savings potential for this new class of technology is estimated at 15 billion kWh within the United States alone; this is equivalent to roughly 10 million metric tons of CO2 emissions. This technology will also significantly reduce the physical footprint for digital ICs, enabling a significant reduction in form factor for all classes of computing platforms. Voltage regulators utilizing integrated magnetic thin-film inductors will have cost and performance advantages over the other voltage regulator products that are commercially available. Therefore this technology is expected to have a sizeable impact on the $10 billion worldwide voltage regulator market. Furthermore, the integration of magnetic materials with Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology will facilitate advances in other magnetic based systems, such as magnetic filters, sensors and imagers. Likewise, the experience gained from commercializing a magnetic material process module with CMOS technology will lower the technological barriers for other forms of heterogeneous integration.",

A product line will be developed, beginning with a map-based streaming media and moving objects video console. Currently available geospatial applications cannot handle real-time, dynamic Big Data. Many government and corporate customers need to combine and analyze information from multiple sources of real-time and historical data. The innovation combines advanced geospatial visualization and analytics technologies with location-based media streaming technology, to produce a map-based streaming media and moving objects video console. This system reduces information overload in accessing a multitude of video streams from moving sensors. Users can select a location, retrieve multimedia data from sensors in the area and view streaming videos in real time that are synchronized with corresponding locations on a map. The product leverages TerraFly technology developed at an NSF Center at Florida International University (FIU). The Product Line will enable complex analysis of data in geographic space and time; it will allow map-based view and control of multitudes of moving objects and data streams. Several agencies, including DHS, have documented the need for this product and are co-sponsoring TerraFly applications. The broader/commercial impact includes the potential to transform disaster mitigation command and control with easy-to-use technology that dramatically improves user&#039;s ability to know what is currently going on in specific locations should a disaster strike. This will allow these professionals to focus on the work that they need to accomplish instead of dealing with the technology, ultimately saving lives and property. This project, in collaboration with FIU, a Minority-serving University, will create high-tech jobs and careers for Florida students. International impact includes knowledge exchange via the Latin American GRID (a coalition of computer scientists led by the FIU Center), student research missions via the NSF international outreach projects at FIU, and TerraFly assistance to Haiti, Columbia, Brazil, and Chile in disaster and epidemics mapping. The system&#039;s educational module will facilitate studies of computing and the environment nationwide and within FIU coursework. The system will be disseminated via TerraFly leveraging prior exposure in scientific and popular media, including Fox TV News, NPR, New York Times, USA Today, Science, and Nature.",

Current surgical approaches for cardiac reconstruction utilize synthetic materials that do not have the ability to grow and remodel with the patient. Feasibility will be demonstrated by in-vitro and in-vivo characterization to create a perfusable cardiac-derived revascularized cardiac patch to promote faster reconstruction of functional tissue by providing a fully perfusable scaffold with a composition and architecture similar to native cardiac tissue. This product will have significant advantages over existing technologies, including: 1) full thickness, biological, cardiac-derived matrix material; 2) vascular supply to support migrating cells and remodeling; 3) superior mechanical properties; and, 4) no need for immunosuppressive therapies. Moreover, this will be the first cardiac-derived, revascularized patch available for treating ischemic areas of the heart. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, is the development of a revascularized cardiac patch to treat ischemic heart failure and congenital repair in a way that is superior to existing technologies. While medical advancements have decreased the overall mortality rate for acute myocardial infarction patients, therapeutic options are lacking to address the underlying loss of myocardial tissue, resulting in a mortality rate greater than 33% at five years. Inhibiting the onset or delaying the severity of heart failure will have a significant effect on lowering this mortality rate and reducing the treatment cost of heart failure, which currently is estimated at over $37 billion annually. The use of this product will further enhance the medical and scientific understanding of the mechanisms by which damaged cardiac tissue may be restored/repaired and patient life may be extended following myocardial infarction.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop a high-throughput, multi-analyte chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. ChIP is a widely used technique among life science and biomedical researchers seeking to understand how the epigenetic mechanism of histone post-translational modifications impacts the varied biological functions that are regulated through chromatin-protein interactions. Analysis ranges from single gene (using PCR) through to genome-wide (next generation sequencing (NGS)). As envisioned, the proposed technology will transform the lengthy and cumbersome multi-day ChIP into a high-throughput compatible single-day experiment. An antibody is linked to oligonucleotides containing NGS platform-compatible tags and &quot;bar-code&quot; sequences for simultaneous analysis of multiple DNA-protein interactions. The insertion of the oligonucleotides into chromatin at sites flanking antibody-bound chromatin fragments will enable direct detection (by PCR or NGS) of DNA fragments associated with the protein(s) of interest. Phase II efforts will focus on developing robust and reproducible methods for both antibody conjugation and technology validation with a panel of antibodies specific for varying classes of chromatin associating proteins, including histone and non-histone targets. DNA libraries produced by the novel method and that of traditional ChIP will be compared first by quantitative PCR for gene-specific analysis and subsequently genome-wide, by NGS. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be the development of a high throughput multi-analyte ChIP assay that will have significant impact scientifically and commercially in the life sciences and biomedical research arenas. In less than five years post-launch, it is projected to replace traditional current ChIP methods, which represents 20-25% of the epigenetic research tools market estimated at $175-245M in 2010. The life sciences research tool market is currently estimated at $42 billion, with the epigenetic sector enjoying high growth fueled by a shift of researchers to purchase commercial epigenetic products rather than in-house made, and by advances in NGS, which has accelerated genome-wide epigenetic analyses. The development of this method will open epigenetic analysis to virtually all researchers by eliminating technical barriers and by significantly reducing sample size requirements associated with traditional ChIP, including a potential for single cell analysis. Development of this technology will spur the creation of additional novel technologies such as homogeneous ChIP for high-throughput screening, multi-analyte ChIP, and open the door for environmental, nutrition, and toxicology disciplines to study the epigenetic profiles of any eukaryotic organism a genome wide scale.",

        "abstract": "Currently, the Expeditionary Fire Support System (EFSS) resupply doctrine is hazardous to Marines and the transport aircraft (MV-22 or CH-53) as it potentially exposes Marines and aircraft to enemy hostilities for a significant duration of time as 120mm mortar ammo is unloaded manually from the aircraft by, often, low density, high demand Marines in hot landing zones. Thus, the EFFS community requires a method that reduces the exposure of the transport aircraft and the Marines on the ground by allowing a single Marine to rapidly unload palletized EFSS ammunition from the aircraft and transport the ammunition over austere terrain from and back to the landing zone. Stratom proposes to address this need for rapid unloading and transportation of the mortar rounds, and other palletized cargo from a MV-22 or CH-53, by developing a self-propelled robotic pallet (SPRP) vehicle that is capable of rapidly transporting cargo in and out the aircraft over unimproved terrain, while requiring only minimal input and control from a single Marine operator. Furthermore, by developing a multi-use heliborne robotic vehicle the SPRP can be used in additional mission application areas such as air-to-ground or ship-to-shore resupply, and the movement of palletized cargo at forward operating bases.",

ABMS is easily expandable and stackable to accommodate various battery lot sizes. Personnel can query the State-of-Charge (SOC) and State-of-Health (SOH) of every battery with minimal effort. Moreover, ABMS technology is adaptable to any type of rechargeable battery used by the military, and is expected to be low enough in cost to make it disposable.

The GCUs would be used in a system architecture where they allow for groups of loads to be gathered under a single generator. When the overall sum of loads is low, both generators are not required to meet these loads. Traditionally, however, both generators are operated since there is no way to couple them. This leads to extra fuel consumption and wear-and-tear on the generators.  The GCU is able to connect loads from the adjacent GCU and turn off the generator attached to that GCU. In this fashion, loads can be grouped together and migrated to be connected to a single generator which would then presumably be operating at a higher part-load ratio and therefore at a better efficiency. As the loads begin to increase again, the GCU would turn the generator back on and split the microgrid so that the individual generator would power the loads to which they are directly attached.",

        "abstract": "Due to its favorable combustion properties, aluminum is the material of choice in metalized nanoparticle formulations for energetic materials; however, the full potential of aluminum nanoparticles has not been realized due to the presence of a nascent oxide layer (Al2O3) that surrounds the nanoparticles and retards their combustion. As a result, the military is looking for novel surface modification techniques that make use of the oxide layer to make the Al-nanoparticles more reactive. TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) will develop surface modification chemistry that functionalizes Al-oxide passivation layers to enhance the reactivity of Al-nanoparticles. Using nanoparticle chemistry previously developed at TDA, we will couple energetic materials to the unreactive oxide passivation layer, thereby enhancing the overall reactivity of the Al-nanoparticle. The resulting materials will be tested for a variety of applications, including their use in metalized explosive formulations.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant   The goal of this research is to develop an innovative prototypical medical device treatment system capable of detecting and visualizing three dimensional shape and tip position of a biopsy needle during Magnetic Resonance Imaging  MRI  or other image assisted interventional radiological procedures  This work will be done in collaboration with interventional radiologist Professor Bruce Danielandapos s group at the Stanford Medical School  Professor Mark Cutkoskyandapos s group at the Stanford Center for Design Research  CDR  and HeartVista  for clinical imaging platform software integration  In addition  our potential clients and strategic partners Civco  Northern Digital  NDI  and Hologic will provide guidance and other in kind contributions to help us accelerate the development of the technology and assist in the FDA approval process  Minimally invasive procedures  including biopsies of hard tumors  rely on advances in miniaturized tools and robotic assistance to reduce trauma to patients and speed healing times  Present tools lack the real time position awareness that surgeons use to an advantage in open surgery  The liver was chosen as an organ subject due to the high need to reduce positional error and minimize multiple needle passes  thus improving clinical outcomes  especially in patients susceptible to excessive bleeding due to underlying liver disease  The ability to guide biopsy of abnormalities seen on cross sectional imaging studies is well recognized in tissue diagnosis  and MRI provides a number of significant advantages over other imaging modalities  This is all the more true with the advent of new long lived contrasting agents that can only work in tandem with MRI  The principal specific aim is to demonstrate that an innovative needle design deploying fiber optic sensors for guidance  in  D  and force feedback can be used in tandem with MRI to enhance the conduct of liver biopsies  Our clinical and industry partners advise us of a growing interest towards interventional procedures  such as biopsies  ablations  and cryosurgeries performed under continual MR scanning  During Phase I  sensors multiplexed along optical fibers were embedded into    gauge biopsy needles and used to provide real time visualization of the entire needle bend shape  including the needle tip position  This was augmented by force sensing design features integrated into the same needle tip  During Phase II  the work will be extended to demonstrate reliable shape sensing through more detailed in vitro work followed by selected in vivo experiments in animal models  In addition  Phase II will integrate force sensing capability with fiber Bragg gratings  FBG  and IFOSandapos  interrogator technology to provide force feedback  Work will culminate in a prototype MRI compatible  physician controlled needle system for image guided liver procedures  The technology can be adapted to other imaging modalities  including ultrasound  US  and computer tomography  CT   The proposed work will advance the field of smart needle development for robotic surgery with potentially broad based spin off applications in oncology  biological imaging and bioengineering PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  This research aims to add miniature fiber optic shape and force sensors to biopsy needles in order to control and guide a needle to a destination located within an organ  such as a liver  to administer anti cancer drugs or take a tissue sample for later\nanalysis  The needles can be visualized during an MRI providing a new way for interventional radiologists and surgeons to conduct procedures with greater efficacy and efficiency and thus also providing a pathway towards reducing medical procedure costs  The innovative needles enhance the precision  safety and efficacy of diagnostic biopsy and minimally invasive surgical procedures on liver tissue  Patients benefit by realizing a reduced numbers of needle insertions  from precision targeting  and reduced bleeding complications by the use of ultrathin needles that create smaller holes  As a result  patient comfort is increased and better clinical outcomes are expected  During Phase I  design feasibility was demonstrated for a future treatment system  e g   FDA approved medical device  comprised of working sensors embedded in a thin gauge biopsy needle  signal processing electronics  software  image processing capabilities  and needle steering concepts  The system was used on phantom livers to demonstrate the utility and functionality of the system  The team of workers included a highly skilled interventional radiologist from Stanford University who assisted with requirements development and verification activities  During Phase II  the work will be extended to more advanced in vitro and in vivo work  culminating in a prototype MRI compatible  physician controlled needle system for image guided liver procedures  Commercial partners have been identified and are prepared to accelerate development and FDA approval processes  The proposed work will advance the field of intelligent needle development for robotic surgery tools with potentially broad based spin off applications for both oncological and non oncological medical fields",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to advance the development of the Autonomous Lost on Earth Navigation (ALOEN) technology proven feasible in Phase I. ALOEN is a stand-alone, compact (12 in. x 10 in. x 8 in.), low-weight (6.4 lb), and power-conserving (17 W) system that is capable of providing better than 2.8 m circular error probable (CEP) performance (Kalman filtered) in a&quot;lost-on-Earth&quot;scenario wherein no prior position knowledge is available. In Phase I, POC completed the design of the ALOEN system through theoretical analysis, simulation, and field testing.  In Phase II, POC will finalize the ALOEN design and build a system-level prototype. The ALOEN algorithms will be tested through a star image simulation environment that includes realistic flight, electro-optics and environment models. We will test the device and perform a flight test using a high-altitude balloon.  We will evaluate the prototype performance and demonstrate navigation precision similar to that of the Global Positioning System (GPS). At the end of Phase II, we will deliver the prototype and a comprehensive report, including simulations, to the Air Force. The Phase II result will be a technology readiness level (TRL)-4 prototype ready for transition to productization and certification.  BENEFIT:  The ALOEN system will provide a high-altitude platform with the capability to estimate its geodetic position with GPS-like accuracy in a GPS-denied environment.  This will allow the platform to perform accurate and reliable midcourse navigation corrections to minimize target location errors.  For military applications, this system could act as a backup to a GPS on a weapon, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), or even a high-altitude manned aircraft.  In the commercial sector, the proposed system could be used as a backup to GPS on passenger as well as cargo aircraft. NASA could use this system for its high-altitude vehicles, as well as for navigation on the lunar surface or surfaces of other planets where a GPS constellation has not been set up.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Metis Design Corporation (MDC) has developed a structural health monitoring (SHM) system to monitor damage in aircraft material with minimal manual intervention. During Phase I, MDC focused on pattern recognition-based algorithms, demonstrating detection of damage, discerning different damage types, and estimating severity.  The original Phase II effort focused on the development of lightweight hardware capable of facilitating both acoustic emission and guided wave methods.  Further, MDC validated the previously developed SHM algorithms using fatigued titanium lugs.  During this Phase II extension, MDC seeks to increase the system maturity such that it can be considered for deployment within ASIP.  Tasks will focus on identification of gaps that exist preventing transition into fielded applications.  This includes determining applicable airworthiness criterion and condition levels, and a thorough business case analysis (BCA) to rank parts with the highest anticipated return.  A focus will be on analytical and experimental optimization for best components as identified by the BCA, along with establishing preliminary detection statistics necessary to be considered under ASIP.  An operational concept will be developed for how such a system would be maintained at the ALC.  Finally, a gap analysis will detailing what remains and at what cost to fully field the system.  BENEFIT:  SHM technologies have the potential for many economic benefits in a broad range of commercial and defense markets.  These systems find utilization within structures ranging from military or civil aircraft, to cars, ships or spacecraft.  The first major benefit is that health monitoring eliminates the need for scheduled inspections.  A second major economic benefit is that a continuously monitoring system would allow for the use of the much more efficient condition based maintenance (CBM) design methodology of a structure, otherwise known as need-based repair.  A third benefit is the increased service time of the structure.  Finally, an SHM system could have a significant financial impact if it is able to detect the need for maintenance before a catastrophic failure, potentially saving lives and a costly vehicle.  Airlines that chose to use these systems would be able to reduce the quantity and duration of required inspections, giving them the opportunity cost to capture profit due to more up-time.  Another important aerospace market would be to facilitate launch/no-launch decisions for expendable launch vehicles (ELV), and enable quick turn around times for reusable launch vehicles (RLV).    One of the key factors to the marketability of this damage detection patch is its versatility, the potential for integration into not just new applications, but existing systems as well.  The first obvious target is the military sector, where one of these systems can reduce the manpower needed for inspection, as well as up to 30% of the maintenance costs.  Additional commercial and space market opportunities exist for the application of reliable damage detection.  These systems can reduce the quantity and duration of airline aircraft inspections, reduce the weight and increase the fuel efficiency of aircraft, and facilitate launch/no-launch decisions for spacecraft. This will likely be a critical technology for future reusable launch vehicles as well. Initially these products will be marketed towards the air and space industry, but eventually will be more broadly diffused into naval, automotive and civil infrastructure applications.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In order to provide modular, scalable, and flexible operational capabilities for future Joint Aerial Layer Networks, FIRST RF proposes developing a small, lightweight, robust, multi-band antenna concept that can be adapted to provide customizable&quot;pick-and-choose&quot;options, including spatial coverage, spectral support, polarization, and form-factor. This is dubbed the Modular Array of Multi-Band Apertures (MAMBA) concept. The MAMBA concept will provide the flexibility to support configurations including high-gain directional panel, omni-directional mast, and switched-beam directional antennas with the ability to mix-and-match support for frequencies across UHF, L, S, C, X, Ku, and Ka Common Data Link (CDL) bands. This variety of available configurations and frequency coverage options allows for support of a variety of communications protocols, including persistent/synchronous legacy CDL and directional time-division multiple access (DTDMA) protocols. Through the exclusive use of affordable, high-volume manufacturing techniques, FIRST RF&quot;s apertures remain lightweight, durable, and reliable while reducing the reliance on discrete components and custom hardware.  BENEFIT:  As a result of this SBIR, this approach will generate both near-term and long-term cost savings for Air Force and DoD, ensuring that no new development of the baseline technology is required to support integration of JALN support on new platforms. There are numerous military applications for lightweight, directional, frequency-agile, conformal antennas on land, air and sea vehicles for communication networks as well as point-to-point links. Even during Phase I, FIRST RF identified several potential transition partners across DoD. Outside of DoD, directional antennas will find commercial application in the area of networking between commercial airliners and airborne internet access (especially over oceans).",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop novel nonlinear filtering and joint decision and estimation methods for robust and persistent tracking of multiple targets with nonlinearities in measurement and dynamic model. The key innovations in this effort include i) powerful measures of nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity, ii) efficient and accurate nonlinear point estimators that outperform widely-used extended Kalman filter and unscented filter, iii) improved methods for mesh adaptation for efficient approximate density estimation based on a numerical solution of Fokker-Planck equation, iv) mathematical models defining a continuum of multi-target data association problems in complexity and problem space, and v) ensemble tracking based on a novel joint density and (point) estimation (JDE) framework. The Phase I effort demonstrated the proof of concept by developing core technologies that form the basis of the proposed algorithms. The Phase II effort will be focused towards refinement, advancement, and integration of these enabling technologies and will include development of new algorithms and measures to handle the issues identified during Phase I, transitioning of technology and prototyping, integration of technologies into an existing ISR system, detailed quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the system and its components, and demonstration of technologies in operationally representative scenarios.  BENEFIT:  Automatic interpretation of sensory data has been a persistent topic of research in the areas of information theory, sensor fusion, computer vision, pattern recognition, machine learning, and psychology, but is still in a very primitive state. Robust detection and persistent tracking of targets in the scene is a critical first step towards enabling systems capable to interpret activities in the scene and provide timely situational awareness and effective forensic analysis capabilities to the analysts.  The technologies proposed here enable persistent tracking of multiple targets with nonlinear dynamic and observation models. The proposed tracking techniques are generic and can be applied to many ISR sensors and applications that are characterized by complex models and uncertainties in the data, for example, urban surveillance from WAMI sensors, GMTI and AMTI tracking, 2D/3D particle tracking, and dynamic analysis of cellular organism in microbiology domain.    The proposed technologies can also be used to enable real-time and forensic analysis tasks that find a lot of applications in the domains of geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), persistent surveillance, and video analysis. These benefits include:    (a) Timely Situational Awareness: Timely availability of reliable intelligence is critical to support military missions and objectives. Knowledge regarding the trajectories of targets, their interactions with each other and other scene elements is a critical part of intelligence and its automated extraction from surveillance data will help expedite the dissemination of relevant intelligence to the commanders in the field.    (b) Reliable Inference:  Existing automated video surveillance and monitoring tools allow users to specify security rules in the form of tripwires and exclusion zones on maps or images. Persistent tracking of targets will enable users to receive alerts with high precision thus increasing the reliability of the overall system and user-confidence on the output of the intelligent system.    (c) Comprehensive Video Analysis:  Robust target tracking in videos is a step closer towards comprehensive video analysis, i.e., automatic extraction of a description of the elements, activities, and events in the scene.",

Particle monitoring technologies are important for better characterization of the environmental, health and visibility effects of both anthropogenic and biogenic aerosol particles. Current monitoring technologies either provideno chemical information or require extensive post-processing chemical analysis.  Based in part on previous EPA SBIR support, we developed, field tested, and commercialized the Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) to provide an affordable instrument to measure particle composition in near realtime.  As assign of its relevance to the monitoring community, we have already made 42 sales of the ACSM, totaling more then $6NM in revenue.  Here, we propose modifications of the ACSM that will upgrade its performance to provide size resolution in the ultrafine, fine and coarse modes and integratean optical particle sizer to provide size resolution for the coarse mode.  Based on our deep knowledge of the aerosol monitoring community, we are confident that these modifications will:  1) make the ACSM more responsive to EPA\u2019s mission objectives, and 2) amplify instrument sales, both to new and existing customers.  Crucially, Phase I yielded three important breakthroughs that make feasible the ACSM upgrade:  1) identification of a design modification to the aerosol inlet that extends its range beyond 1,000 nm without sacrificing its ability to detect particles smaller than 100 nm, 2) implemented a new design to obtain size particle size resolution while achieving at least 10-fold increase in sensitivity, and 3) demonstrated a new light scattering module that can determine particle size for particles larger than 1,000nm.  The Phase II Commercialization Option will be a long-term (6-12 months) field demonstration of the ACMS that will signal its utility to the aerosol characterization market as a robust and cost effective alternative to filter based measurements that lack time resolution and require substantial labor to implement.",

We obtain our water from limited and unevenly distributed surface and underground fresh water sources.

In the developing world we see the proliferation of waterborne disease\u2013 over 80 countries harboring half of the world\u2019s population are experiencing acute water shortages, with roughly 80% of all disease and 30% of annual mortality in these countries directly related to unsafe drinking water.  In the developed world, we are already spending 5% of our dirty grid energy draining, cleaning and transporting water from centralized sources, contributing to atmospheric and water pollution.  Rights pertaining to these sources are already spoken for and as populations grow, demand for water rights will increase.  With dwindling supplies, we can expect skyrocketing water costs, and dampening of economic development.  Geopolitically, our impending water woes take on frightening proportions.  DOD experts project that by 2050, over 1/3rd of the globe could be embroiled in wars ultimately rooted in access/control of fresh water resources.  There are other sources ofwater, such as the renewable and vast brackish continental reserves (slightly salty), and of course the ocean.  However, existing desalination technologies are decades old, rely on brute-force, and are cost-inefficient, requiring massive hydraulic pressures, electrical currents or heat sources derived ultimately from the burning of massive amounts of fossil fuels.  High operational, capital and infrastructure-related costs tie these energy-greedy technologies to expensive centralized water distribution models, which is at the root of why there technologies are not adopted to solve these problems.  An innovative technology for energy-efficient desalination could solve this adoption problem and change our current trajectory \u2013 not only by reducing operational costs, but by helping to change the water distribution model.  Not tethered to the electrical grid, or existing water distributioninfrastructures, an energy-efficient desalination technology could operate via a distributive model from expansive brackish or seawater sources \u2013 essentially enabling clean, cheap and plentiful water for everyone, anywhere.",

Phosphorous runoff can lead to\u201cdead zones\u201d due to eutrophication and can also cause hypoxia, leading to death of aquatic life that thrive in an oxygen-rich environment.  None commercial product is being marketed for P removal from large water sources to bring down P to ultralow levels to meet EPA requirements in an economical manner.  The upper limit for phosphate in stream discharge in typically 1mg/L and further lowering to&lt;0.1 mg/L is required to meet or exceed current EPA standards.   Synanomet, LLC has acquired exclusive license for the manufacture and use of patented and patent pending technologies for water purification from the University of Arkansas.  The technology utilizes magnetic nanocomposites made from renewable resources and is an environmentally friendly, fase and economical process.  In Phase I we demonstrated that high surface area magnetite particles embedded in wood are highly efficient in reducing P to ultra low levels (as much as 0.01 mg/L).  The adsorbed P can be recovered from the media and potentially recycled as fertilizers in the form of calcium phosphate of MgNH4PO4.  We have also shown that the media can be regenerated at least 10 times for successive P removal.  These wood based nanocomposites can also be completely carbonized to yield carbon-magnetite nanocomposites with P removal capability and for more selected applications such as odor suppression and oil recovery following an oil spill.   The scale up of these nanocomposites is needed for pilot plant studies.  Agreements are in place with Energy &amp; Environmental Research Center (EERC) affiliated with the University of North Dakota for scale up work in kilogram quantities using fluid bed continuous reactor as well as hot bed rotary kiln.  The composites will be evaluated by Parkson Corporation and AbTech Industries for P removal and media regeneration.  Norit, Inc., has agreed to evaluate the materials for odor suppression.  Field studies of the use of these nanocomposites will allow Synanomet to leverage its position in the P removal sector.

        "abstract": "In 2011, there were 60,000 dairy farms in the US.  Of there, 56,600 had herds of fewer than 500 animals.  Currently, manure digester installations are only considered economical for herds of at least 500 animals.  There require turbine or diesel generator sets of 100 Kilowatt size and larger.  The need exists for a smaller waste to energy conversion approach for implementation on small farms were methane is typically released, unburned and unutilized, to the environment.  This project evaluates the feasibility of an electrical-power-generating system based upon a steam Rankine cycle, sized and designed to burn untreated digester gas from small animal herds.   The system uses a residence-sized boiler, modified to produce higher operating temperature and pressures to improve cycle efficiency.  The steam from the boiler powers a unique turbo-alternator spinning on fluidically-damped gas bearings, also energized by system steam.  The analysis and studies conducted in Phase I showed feasibility of the steam Rankine system and fluidic bearing turbo-alternator approach.  Key features which were analyzed and/or demonstrated are a follows:  A Rankine Cycle system may be scaled to herd of only 25 cows.  A representative turbine rotor is capable of high speed operation when spinning of fluidically-damped gas bearings.  Fluidic bearing operation was demonstrated using system steam.  A closed system with fluidic bearings is capable of high efficiency, simplicity, reliability and long life.  Electrical power generation efficiency of nearly30% is achievable.  Combined Heat and Power (CHP) efficiency greater then 90% is achievable.  Price of a Rankin CHP system may be as low as $500/kilowatt.  We estimate a market for 90,000 10-kilowatt digester gas to electrical power modules for hears of 500 cows or fewer.  Our agricultural CHP unit may be applied to provide all the power needs for the farm or an average home, and it may be simply modified to also burn natural gas.  30 to 50 million homes in North America are candidates for CHP.  The high volume potential of the residential market can provide a great reduction in manufacturing costs, allowing us to meet our $500/kilowatt price target for CHP modules for small digesters.

NanoSonic designed and optimized its next-generation, green-certified Hybridsil\u00ae insulative foam to provide drastically enhanced fire resistance, thermal resilience, environmental durability, and rapid spray depositability with no free isocayantes.  NanoSonic\u2019s Hybridsil\u00ae foams gracefully convert to flexible silicates with negligible smoke toxicityto insulate underlaying substarates and prevent flame spread, unlike current SPFs that provide solid fuel to a structural fire while emitting highly toxic smoke.  In fact, compared to current state-of-the-art SPF, NanoSonic\u2019s Hybridsil\u00ae foams provide a 1,250% improvement in time to ignition and a4,165% improvement in dimensional integrity durability under a 50kW/m2 heat flux.  Equally important, independent extended emission analysis completed by Materials Analytical Services (MAS) has proven NanoSonic\u2019s optimized Hybridsil\u00ae insulative foams are compliant with the performance standard established for low-emitting insulation/sealants under the CDPH Standard Method Version 1.1, which provides the benchmark criteria adopted in green building programs such as Green Globes, LEED and the Collaborative for High Performance Schools.  To achieve this, Hybridsil\u00ae employs environmentally and health friendly reagents instead of airborne diisocyanates that lead to numerous deleterious health consequences including chronic respiratory disease, chronic bronchitis, asthma, skin allergies and irritation.  R-value determination indicates that optimized systems have thermal conductivities comparable to current state-of-the-art open cell polyurethane foams (3to 4) while still providing the aforementioned performance advantages at a competitive cost of $0.50 to $0.70/ft2.  The principal objective of the proposed Phase II SBIR program is to create a Phase III transition brige into residential and commercial insulation applications through elevated R value performance (4-7) and larger scale performance validation including full room insulation, spraying and fire testing qualification.  In that vein, NanoSonic will work with the National Association of Home Builders Research Center, Southwest Research Institute, and MAS to provide full-scale testing demonstrations that will provide a catalyst for near term commercial transition.  Further, NanoSonic will work with its local government officials in Giles County, VA to insulate a number of government buildings with Hybridsil\u00ae Insulative Foam in an endeavor that is both an extension of the technical effort and an invaluable market opportunity.",

        "abstract": "Rare earth element (REE) based Nd-Fe-B and Sm-Co permanent magnets have been widely used because of their excellent magnetic properties.  The applications of Nd-Fe-B and Sm-Co rare earth permanent magnets include hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), power generator for wind turbines, high performance industrial motors, hard disk drives for computers, travelling wave tubes for satellite communications, headphones and speakers, washing machines, and most consumer electronic devices.  An electric car like GM\u2019s Chevrolet Volt uses seven pounds of rare-earth magnets, while each clean-energy wind turbine uses more the 600 pounds of neodymiun (Nd).  China accounts of 97% of global rare earth element (REE) production and this monopoly creates a strategic vulnerability for the United States and underminesour national security and competitiveness in the defense and clean-energy sectors.  Rare earth shortages could also cause major supply-chain problems for US green energy and technology companies.  In a typical neodynium-iron-boron (Nd-Fe-B) magnet manufacturing facility, about 20-30% of the magnetsare wasted as scrap, which is an estimated 1500-2500 tons/year.  In the case of Sm-Co magnets, about 15-30% of the raw materials are wasted as scrap at a typical Sm-Co manufacturing site.  Therefore, the recycling of rare earth based magnets has gained increasing attention and importance in the permanent magnet industry.  To date, only very small quantities of rare earth elements (estimated at 1%) have been recycled from pre-consumer magnet scrap.  The goal of  this project is to develop a scalable, efficient and low-cost manufacturing method to recycle rare earth based magnets from industrialscrap into valuable magnetic alloys and high performance magnets with tailored properties for specific applications.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Conductive Composites has developed lightweight materials that provide high levels of conductivity and electromagnetic (EM) shielding for composite and advanced polymer materials systems. Conductive materials include metal coated carbon fibers and nonwovens, along with nickel nanostrands. The performance capabilities of the materials have now been extended and tested to include broadband frequency capabilities and protection in high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) environments. The proposed work shall build on the successes of the Phase I effort and continue in developing lightweight composites structures for broadband electromagnetic hardening. These next steps will include investigating the format and mass fraction of each shielding constituent in a composite, alternative composite fabrication processes, and the ability to custom fit the construction of the composite to meet specific shielding requirements. New constituent materials are proposed to improve shielding performance for high energy particles. Furthermore, Conductive Composites will work closely with suppliers and the Air Force Intellectual Property Office to ensure that the technology is adequately defined, licensed, and protected. Composite panels and tubes will be fabricated, tested for electromagnetic shielding, and delivered to AFRL/AFIT for further testing.  BENEFIT:  Lightweight broadband shielding conductive composite systems can replace heavy metallic structures while still providing electromagnetic shielding. Weight savings can be as much as 75%. The ability to fabricate composites structures that meet the shielding requirements of demanding environments enables a new field for manufacturing lightweight shielded structures.",

        "abstract": "GVD proposed to develop high performance, VOC-free and PFOA-free, non-stick mold release coating based on its novel PTFE (Polytetraflouroethylene) fluoropolymer technology. Most commercial mold release agents make use of organic solvents and vaporize during drying, creating a significant air quality impact.  Even water-based formulations often require the use of fluorinated surfactant additives to stay suspended in the liquid.  These surfactants such as PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) have been shown to be exceptionally pervasive in the environment, and are biopersistent and carcinogenic.  Drying and curing processes of wet applied releases are also energy intensive, requiring consumption of fossil fuels and the attendant emission of greenhouse gases.  The environmental problems associated with these mold release agents and tighter regulations imposed on their use are generating urgency among manufacturers to identify green alternative release agents with the same level of performance.  GVD\u2019s green polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coatings offer such an alternative.  PTFE offers an unparalleled combination of low surface energy (anti-stick), chemical resistance, and thermal stability.  GVD produces thin, conformal, environmental-benign PTFE coatings at low temperature via the innovative initiated Chemical Vapor Deposition (iCVD) process.  In this solvent-free process, GVD creates the pure PTFE fluoropolymer from reactive precursor vapors and deposits the PTFE as a uniform coating at the same time.  Using iCVD, GVD and optimize PTFE\u2019s surface energy, adhesion, and durability during deposition.  GVD\u2019s iCVD deposition process has zero hazardous emissions.  There are a wide variety of markets and application for GVD\u2019s mold release coating, including seals and gaskets, foam, automotive parts, composite part molding, and medical products.  With improved adhesion and durability, GVD will be able to access more of these applications.  In Phase I, GVD achieved the goals of improved adhesion and durability of our PTFE coatings for mold release applications.  Bench scale testing showed that changes to the PTFE coating recipe improved coating adhesion with even greater improvement upon addition of and adhesion promoter.  Initial molding tests with uncured molding materials, a challenging condition, demonstrated that the advances made during Phase I resulted in significant improvements to mold release durability.  GVD\u2019s coatings also outperformed wet-applied mold release coatings in the molding test.  In this Phase II proposal, GVD will test these formulations at industrial scale with global leaders in tire and automotive manufacturing.  At the end of this work GVD will deliver a widely applicable, commercial solution to the issue of toxic, polluting, and low-performance mold release agents.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Aircraft engine and structural components are being produced from forgings with increasingly complex geometries in a range of aerospace alloys. The forging process involves a number of steps required to attain favorable material properties (e.g., heat treatment, rapid quench, and cold work stress relieving). These processing steps, however, also result in the introduction of residual stress. Excessive bulk residual stresses can have negative consequences including: part distortion, reduced crack initiation life, and increased crack growth rates. While bulk residual stresses are often accounted for with simple approximations that ensure safety, there is an opportunity to improve the understanding of the bulk residual stress fields in forged parts and to monitor them as a routine part of quality assurance, which would reduce design uncertainty associated with residual stresses and would allow for higher performing structure. The proposed program will develop an approach for quality management of residual stresses in aerospace forgings, will develop technology to support quality system implementation, and will demonstrate the quality system in a production environment. The proposed quality system will combine advanced computational process modeling and residual stress measurement technology to establish a robust system of production control.  BENEFIT:  The proposed program offers a logical next-step in the continued improvement of structural engineering methods. Advances in residual stress technology over the past decade (or more) have resulted in improved tools for the analysis of residual stress effects on material performance. Technology is available, for example, to predict fatigue crack growth accounting for residual stress effects. By specifically accounting for residual stress effects in these calculations, designs can become more efficient and require lower safety margins. This leads to higher, more aggressive performance. One significant missing ingredient inhibiting the full accounting of residual stress in design is the fact that residual stress levels are typically not certified in the material supply chain. The development of a quality management system for residual stresses in forged aerospace components will enable material suppliers to certify the level of residual stress in their forged product, which will enable end users to specifically account for residual stress effects in design (and will result in significant positive benefit).",

        "abstract": "We propose to build a model of the Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR), configured for the Thule site, to model the effects of ionospheric scintillation on radar performance.  The results of our Phase I investigation show that the physical phenomena driving scintillation link solar energetic events to turbulence in the electron content of the ionosphere.  Although there are number of sensors used to observe these phenomena, their complexity precludes a purely theoretical approach to effectively modeling scintillation. Therefore we propose a modeling approach driven by ensemble data analysis. We will evaluate UEWR satellite measurements to identify scintillation effects in the observations. We will compile external sensor measurements from satellites and geomagnetic field sensors and compare them to the UEWR scintillation observations. These data will be used to design and implement a scintillation model configured for the Thule radar that includes correlations with solar activity. A UEWR Thule radar model will be developed based on the dBTools/dBLibs software set that simulates the effects of scintillation on radar detection, tracking, and classification. These models can be used to evaluate radar performance during times of high solar activity",

        "abstract": "Composite structures on Naval aircraft are often damaged during manufacturing or in service. Depending on the level of damage, the part will require repair or replacement to make operable and safe for flight. While there are many different types of repair methods, resin injection offers a less intrusive method of repair and does not require near the post-processing of other methods. However, this method of repair has usually only been utilized for cosmetic purposes and has not allowed the complete restoration of the structural performance of the part. This is due to many reasons including the repair resin rheology and wetting, compatibility and reactivity of the repair resin to the substrate, and mechanical properties. Accordingly, a resin having the necessary viscosity, wetting, and adhesion characteristics along with aircraft matrix mechanical properties would make a unique resin injection repair material that could enable restoration of the performance of the damaged part to its original capability. This would initially find significant use in reducing costs associated with manufacturing related flaws such as those occurring in the development program of the CH-53K heavy lift helicopter as well as other Navy aircraft.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  As future DoD budgets become more cost constrained, delivering high performance payloads in a smaller stowed package to leverage the capabilities of smaller, less costly launch vehicles becomes paramount.  The performance of optical payloads is driven by physics.  At a first order the image quality is defined by the diameter of the optical aperture, the distance to the area of interest, and the wave length being collected.  Incorporating a deployable aperture is a common way to fit a highly capable optical instrument in the relatively small cross section of a launch vehicle fairing.  While significant effort has gone into the development of deployable optics, supporting stable structures, advanced lenses, and mechanisms, a 3-Dimensional Deployable Sun Shade that is required for most deployable primary optics has received limited development.  The Sun Shade proposed herein is a lower cost and complexity alternative to existing sun shades.  MMA Design proposes to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in low risk, low mass deployable sun shades by completing development of our Minotaur IV class deployable sun shade.  The Air Force will have the final system component to field a large aperture optical system on a variety of small launch vehicles allowing significant flexibility and cost savings.  BENEFIT:  Potential benefits and impacts to the Air Force missions include:  1. Cost savings - using a deployable optical aperture system allows the use of less costly launch vehicles that can result in significant savings with similar payload performance.  The Sun Shade is less complex and fits spacecraft and fairing geometry better than existing systems.  2. Mission ISR data and quality can improve with increases in deployable aperture size.  3. Rapid development and maturation of innovative spacecraft sun shade technologies leading to low cost solutions that are adaptable and scalable to other AFRL applications.  4. A scalable system design - the MMA product roadmap envisions and plans multiple dash versions of the Sun Shade that build upon the core deployable architecture to support the fielding of apertures that are larger in diameter than the launch vehicle in multiple launch vehicle classes (Minotaur I and IV, ESPA, ALASA, etc.).  5. The MMA team offers Air Force high innovative content for revolutionizing optical ISR spacecraft technologies with high risk/reward payoffs.

Loc will then apply knowledge gained through testing and further maturation of its Quick Disconnect technology to develop one vehicle set of the Bradley Modernization Final Drive for delivery at the end of Phase II.  This drive will provide a Quick Disconnect function and contain sufficient torque capacity to meet the long term needs of both the Bradley and Paladin Integration Management (PIM) vehicle platforms.",

Partnered with NASA and Boeing, Area-I has developed the unmanned Prototype-Technology Evaluator and Research Aircraft or PTERA (&quot;ptera&quot; being Greek for wing/wing-like). The PTERA, a high-quality flight research testbed, bridges the gap between wind tunnel and manned flight testing with low-cost, low-risk flight-based evaluation of high-risk technologies. In Phase I, the PTERA was enhanced by integrating modularity and design flexibility and culminated in the design of a representative 16%-scale CRJ-700, named the PTERA-RJM for Regional Jet Model.  For Phase II, the team proposes to finalize the design, fabricate, and deliver a 17ft, 278lb PTERA-RJM that is tailored for use within NASA&#039;s Aviation Safety Program to enable experiments in vehicle health monitoring, in loss of control prevention, mitigation, and recovery, in atmospheric hazard sensing and mitigation, etc.The Boeing Company supports the proposed work, as they have great interest in the PTERA platform given its following core capabilities:1)\tA large, low-cost airframe that minimizes scaling and Reynolds number effects, yet is easily disassembled and transported2)\tA modular, reconfigurable fuselage design that enables the fabrication and assembly of fuselage configurations that maintain near geometric similitude with a wide array of &quot;tube-and-wing&quot; aircraft using existing tooling3)\tModular wing design that facilitates the integration of advanced aerodynamic treatments, split control surfaces, and aeroelastic and damage emulation mechanisms4)\tIntegrated ballast system and movable payload/avionics racks to enable the tuning of mass/inertial properties5)\tLarge payload capacity, voluminous payload bays, and large clamshell doors that facilitate the integration of avionics systems and provide access during flight testing",

Today, analysts must laboriously sift through vast amounts of data in order to&quot;connect the dots&quot;.  In this project, we propose to develop a scalable system for link analysis of data extracted from social media.   Our work considers the process of knowledge extraction, information integration and analysis. The goal is to design an integrated framework that will enable Air Force intelligence analysts to efficiently analyze data from online sources.  Probabilistic inference methods for classification, entity resolution and clustering can semi-automatically detect and link multiple aliases, document timelines, forensically analyze content, and assist analysts in identifying threats.  BENEFIT:  The Web has made it easy to access an enormous amount of open source data.  The richness and size of this data has made it a priority to develop automated analysis methods that can help analysts predict, understand, and explain events around the world. This project will produce a scalable solution that will help analysts make sense of, and monitor, events being discussed or planned online.  Analysts want to understand who the protagonists are, what they have done, and what they are planning.  They have limited time and manpower available to do this by hand, but they also have expertise and commonsense that is far beyond the present capabilities of software to replicate.  Thus, our approach is to develop semi-automated methods that analysts can intuitively interact with in order to do their job more efficiently.  The software will not only be useful for government defense and intelligence analysts, but will also address the needs of the commercial background investigation industry.",

While capable, these types of sensors come with a higher initial purchase price as well as high life cycle costs per platform.  This activity will implement a broad area hostile fire sensing architecture that uses lower cost discrete sensors which do not require cryogenic cooling assemblies.  The sensing architecture will employ a split function design to separate event detection from situational awareness notification to simultaneously cover a broader surveillance area while reducing the workload required to monitor the hostile fire sensing system for remotely piloted vehicles.  BENEFIT:  This project will greatly reduce the life cycle cost of hostile fire sensor payloads for both manned and unmanned aerial vehicles.  The solution approach will make the integration of hostile fire capability onto both military and civilian law enforcement aircraft more likely.  The autonomous event cueing  will reduce the workload on aircrew, thus enhancing aircrew safety and eliminating the need for dedicated monitoring.",

Equivalent drag (via thrust reduction) results from the strong radial pressure gradient created by swirl vanes that are aerodynamically \"invisible\" during conventional operation and introduced during a drag management maneuver. Such \"drag on demand\" enables operational benefits such as slower, steeper, and/or aeroacoustically cleaner flight on approach, addressing NASA's need for active and passive control of aeroacoustic noise sources for conventional and advanced aircraft configurations. In Phase I ATA successfully designed an integrated vane-nozzle for a NASA high bypass ratio nozzle. To advance the technology readiness level (TRL) , ATA has formed a partnership with Williams International (WI), a manufacturer of small jet engines and industry leader in the small business jet market.

        "abstract": "In the Phase I program, Busek Co. Inc. tested an existing Hall thruster, the BHT-8000, on iodine propellant.  The thruster was fed by a high flow iodine feed system, and supported by an existing Busek hollow cathode flowing xenon gas.  The Phase I propellant feed system was evolved from a previously demonstrated laboratory feed system.  Throttling of the thruster between 2 and 11 kW at 200-600V was demonstrated.  Testing has shown that the efficiency of iodine fueled BHT-8000 is the same as with xenon, with iodine delivering slightly higher thrust to power (T/P).  \n\nPlume current was also measured at a variety of operating conditions.  Preliminary design work for a new thruster to be built in Phase II was also completed.\n  \nIn Phase II a complete iodine fueled system will be developed including the thruster, hollow cathode, and iodine propellant feed system.  The nominal power of the Phase II system is 8 kW.  However, it can be deeply throttled as well as clustered to much higher power levels.  The technology can also be scaled to >100 kW per thruster to support MW-class missions.  The target thruster efficiency for the full scale system is 65% at high Isp (~3000 s) and 60% at high thrust (Isp~2000 s).  These projections are based on Phase I testing and prior testing of higher power thrusters.\n  \nIodine enables dramatic mass and cost savings for lunar and Mars cargo missions, including Earth escape and near-Earth space maneuvers.  High purity iodine is available commercially in large quantities at much lower cost than xenon.  Iodine stores at 2 to 3 times greater density than xenon and at approximately one thousandth of the pressure and may be stored in low mass, low cost propellant tanks instead.  Passive, long term storage of a fully fueled system is feasible including storage in conformal tanks which may be used to shield internal components against some types of space radiation.",

Starting from a freely supported version of the model, a two-step model reduction process is proposed to create aeroelastic models that include rigid body dynamics.

In the second step, a linear matrix inequality further reduces the order and creates a linear parameter varying reduced order model. The model includes a trimmed and parameterized description of aeroelastic forces valid over a region of the flight envelop. The same model can be used for rapid simulation and for linear parameter varying flight control design. Feasibility of this two-step process has been demonstrated in the Phase I work and a plan has been developed for a prototype implementation.

The vehicle, its payload, and facilities must be designed to withstand these loads to ensure mission safety and success.

Governments and aerospace entities expend significant resources investigating launch acoustics using a combination of predictive models, full-scale and subscale tests, and test flights. Sensors that acquire acoustic data are deployed over a limited geometry and do not sample the full three-dimensional volume exposed to the acoustic field. Launch imagery samples that three-dimensional volume. Under appropriate conditions, rapidly varying condensation features are generated by the lift-off acoustic field. A software tool will be developed to determine the three-dimensional structure of the field from imagery of these acoustically-induced features. This unique data will be compared to model predictions and will serve to either validate those models or inspire modifications to those models.

        "abstract": "NASA is keen on advancing technologies for lightweight composite cryotanks for heavy lift vehicles for future NASA missions. Two primary challenges must be overcome to enable the use of composite tanks for these new classes of heavy launchers. One is to develop novel, microcrack-resistant, polymer matrix composite materials that will enable the manufacture of 5 to 10 meter diameter composite tanks, and the second is to develop out-of-autoclave manufacturing methods. In response, CTD is developing novel matrix materials based on toughened epoxy and benzoxazines to meet these goals and exceed the performance of current state of the art materials. The end goal of the Phase II program is to advance the material systems suitable for out-of-autoclave fabrication of very large cryotank (10 meter diameter) structures from TRL 3 to TRL 4. The proposed Phase II SBIR program will be a synergistic effort between analytical assessments of material performance requirements, material and process development, testing to assess material performance improvements and the ability to manufacture these novel materials into microcrack resistant composites laminates and cryotanks.",

Decreasing the spacing between aircraft on takeoff and landing would increase the throughput of airports.  On-board sensing capability for wake vortices could allow aircraft to operate with reduced spacings. Wake vortices can be detected by a lidar located on the aircraft, but such a system needs to be small, lightweight, rugged, and require minimal maintenance. The Phase I program showed the feasibility of an intrinsically low-cost, coherent lidar that would be suitable for deployment on commercial airliners for axial wake vortex detection. The Low-Cost Lidar Test Bed was used to demonstrate measurement of aerosol returns. The program also assessed the feasibility of using the lidar for remote detection of clear air turbulence and volcanic ash clouds.  The program developed a conceptual design for a prototype system that would be fabricated and ground tested in the Phase II program.

(ASC) is a small business that has developed 3D Flash LIDAR systems for space and terrestrial applications.  3D Flash LIDAR is ideal for determining real-time spacecraft trajectory, speed and orientation to the planet's surface, as well as evaluating potential landing sites.  Flash LIDAR sensors utilize a 3DFPA and rely on the illumination of a 10nsec pulse from a diode pumped solid state (DPSSL) q-switched Nd:YAG laser.  Improvements in pulse shape and stability are crucial to improve range resolution for higher resolution landing maps.  ASC is proposing an innovative approach to the laser and thermal management to meet NASAs requirement for a compact, robust planetary landing sensor.  An innovative approach for an optically triggered \"semi-active\" q-switch will allow for increased power stability in a very compact laser design.  The semi-active fused q-switch will eliminate the need for a mechanical or electro optical q-switch by actively bleaching the passive q-switch with a laser diode.  The advantage of the Cr4:YAG crystal over active q-switches is that it can be fused directly onto the YAG laser rod creating a monolithic laser cavity reducing the number of coated surfaces and the overall size.",

        "abstract": "An Advanced Microgravity Compatible, Integrated laundry System (AMCILS) is proposed that uses a two phase water / water vapor system to allow good agitation of clothing during the wash & rinse cycle.  Drying will be accomplished utilizing microwave energy addition and \"jet\" air flow to fluff and move clothing in the washing chamber.  Operation in a two phase water / water vapor system precludes the formation of sustainable foam in the wash effluent while allowing adequate volume for agitation of clothing in a weightless environment while using a minimum amount of water.  Drying using air \"jets\" and microwave addition was proven during micro-gravity testing performed in the Single Phase Space Laundry Phase II program (NASA contract No. NAS9-18362, Jan. 1993) The Phase II effort will build upon the successful Phase I feasibility demonstration of the AMCIL concept and result in delivery of a working AMCIL prototype whose performance will be thoroughly characterized and delivered to NASA for independent testing.  \n\tThe AMCIL promises a reduction in ESM associated with crew clothing on long duration missions through the reduction of expendables.  Clothing can be re-used which minimizes ESM associated with storage of new clothing, and waste storage associated with used clothing.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Detection and precision tracking of objects in space are critical to space situational awareness.  This task is routinely carried out at night with ground-based electro-optical telescopes.  However, this capability needs to be extended to cover all times of day to detect and quantify less predictable spacecraft maneuvers to enable effective search for new, lost, or maneuvering vehicles and worldwide coverage of daytime space launches.  A portable system offering flexibility and cost effectiveness is desirable.    During the first phase of this project Optical Physics Company (OPC) designed a day/night satellite detection and tracking system that meets these objectives and demonstrated the concept with ground based daylight and twilight LEO satellite observations using an available SWIR interferometric tracker.  During Phase II OPC will fabricate the complete instrument for GEO and GTO satellite detection and tracking, including sensor, telescope, processor and software.  The unit will be installed and tested at Maui Space Surveillance Site (MSSS) to demonstrate initial operational capability.  The expected performance of the instrument as validated by Phase I ground tests is detection and tracking of 14th visual magnitude satellites to about 1 microradian (rms) angular accuracy during daytime.  Nighttime performance is better  extending to 18th visual magnitude.      BENEFIT:  Space situational awareness (SSA) is an increasing priority in a complex space environment.  The sensor developed here can be easily and cost-effectively mass produced for deployment around the globe.  This will substantially increase our ability to detect and track new launches or follow maneuvering vehicles on orbit.  This same technology can be easily scaled to detection and track of LEO objects during the day and terminator conditions as well as nighttime GEO/MEO detection and track down to visual magnitude 20 under full moon conditions.  SSA from space represents an additional application without any sky background  just star clutter.  Very compact and high performance trackers in space can use this same technology base and allow detailed mapping of debris fields.  Since all launches and nations will benefit from mapping the debris field, this sensor network might reasonably become an international project.    OPC has already demonstrated success with transitioning technologies developed under SBIR funding to ongoing research and acquisition programs.  In particular, OPC has become a preferred supplier of deformable mirrors for high energy lasers.  In case of the interferometric tracker, there are multiple avenues for technology transition.   Besides tracking dim objects of interest, the interferometric tracker can also be deployed in high precision star trackers for spacecraft guidance navigation and control (GN&C) and for GPS-independent stellar inertial navigation on ground and airborne platforms.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In this Phase II effort Silvus Technologies proposes to develop and field test fully digital beamforming techniques on a 16 antenna array integrated with Silvus MIMO radios and CDL terminals from BAE Systems. This effort will advance the TRL of both linear and non-linear digital techniques. Non-linear beamforming technique use the recent fundamental innovations in difference co-array signal processing. Depending on antenna element placement, difference co-array processing has the potential to provably create O(N^2) spatial degrees of freedom using only O(N)antenna elements. This is a huge step forward from any state of the art system. The antenna arrays elements have non-uniform (aperiodic) spacing between them to achieve the above theoretical degrees of freedom (DoFs). However unlike traditional aperiodic antenna array design which depends purely on  computational approaches, the proposed aperiodic array approaches have a closed form solution, enabling designers to cross validate experimental outcomes with theoretical predictions. In Phase II Silvus will test a prototype modular digital beamformer system in a dynamic air-to-air environment.  BENEFIT:  There are numerous applications of the ground breaking technology development enabling O(N^2 ) spatial degrees of freedom with just O(N) antenna elements in the fields of wireless communications (both commercial and military), RADAR, electronic warfare, RF geo-localization, Anti-jam equipment etc. Additional DoFs can be used to enhance spectral efficiency of tactical ad hoc networks by signaling in the spatial dimension, to compute direction of arrival of a large number of RF sources, to spatially null interference from jammers, to track a large number of targets using low SWaP RADARs etc. Today&#039;s advanced computing platforms can easily fit the required signal processing to realize such gains in DoF. Example Air Force applications: The E-3 AWACS rotodome contains a large phased array radar. The proposed technology will enable creation of small form factor phased array radars. The rotodome causes unwanted drag, a reduced size rotodome will increase the mission life of E-3 AWACS on a single fuel tank. Commercial Applications: Multi-user downlink in cellular systems uses smart antenna beamforming. The innovations described in this proposal can provide considerably higher throughput with the same antenna arrays. Silvus &amp; #1048758; expertise in MIMO and smart antenna processing is of particular value here as 5G cellular systems have adopted MIMO and cost effective and smart MIMO antennas are viewed as a future need.",

As RPAs and associated battlefield sensors proliferates, requirements for additional military satellite communications capacity will continue for the foreseeable future.  In order to provide Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance communications between the RPA, warfighter and analysts, to transfer command and control communications to the RPA, the Air Force is interested in utilizing the W-band frequency range (81-86 GHz).

        "abstract": "The development of Wide Bandgap Semiconductors such as GaN has enabled tremendous improvements in power amplifier performance such as operational frequency and output power. These device improvements have in turn enabled performance and capability improvements in the end applications such as EW systems and radar T/R modules. The advances in device technology have not come without their own set of limitations which must yet be overcome. One issue that plagues equipment designers is the need for improved thermal efficiency which is exacerbated by the continuing requirement for smaller equipment footprints combined with increased functionality. While the development of ceramic multi-layer technologies has allowed smaller footprints to be realized through embedded circuitry and denser packaging, the thermal conductivity of such packages has not kept pace with the device technology itself. With the increased power densities expected from newer device technologies, an improved and advanced multi-layer packaging technology is being developed which takes into account the substrate materials and processing, the heat spreader material and attachment method, the final package into which the modules are mounted, newer devices and attachment materials, and the manufacturing and assembly processes in order to yield a high performance, thermally efficient, cost effective packaging solution.",

The first main focus of the Phase II effort is to expand and refine the International Space Station (ISS) model library created in the Phase I. This will enable advanced energy management studies by supporting the interconnection of multiple channels. In addition, hardware validation of both component and system models will be pursued. Finally, Distributed Heterogeneous Simulation will be applied to the system models to accelerate simulation speed. The second main focus of the Phase II will be to utilize the simulation environment to investigate agent-based autonomous controls. In particular, the ability of agent-based controls to perform in scenarios that stress conventional controls will be analyzed. This ability will also be examined when communication constraints (such as sample rates and latencies) and packet loss are present. Lastly, the ISS system model will be integrated with hardware agent emulators setting the stage for hardware experimentation in future efforts.",

Other applications include infrastructure inspection for both the Navy and other commercial applications.  We have specifically examined the ConOps associated with a small air vehicle capable of autonomously travelling through a ship. We envision that an operator will command the air vehicle to go to a specific places designated by reference to a floor plan and be able to return autonomously to the operator. No special infrastructure should be necessary to enable this capability. To successfully fulfill this mission, the vehicle must localize itself in an absolute (ship based) coordinate frame and create a plan to get from its current to the final location. While travelling along the planned route, the vehicle must also detect and avoid any obstacles. The environment through which the air vehicle will travel consists of narrow passageways and hatchways that may or may not be filled with smoke or distorted by damage.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Warfare is being transformed from a closed, state-sponsored affair to distributed terrorist activities enabled by social media. In Phase I of this research, Securboration developed the prototype Link Analysis Knowledge Environment (LAKE) to enable analyst driven social network analysis. LAKE Phase I demonstrated noise reduction, link analysis, and influential node identification within massive social network datasets.  Our approach leverages Securborations existing suite of semantics-based content analysis software and research from renowned machine learning expert Dr. Carlos Guestrin and his associated GraphLab parallel processing toolkit. The result in LAKE is incomparable speed and accuracy in automatically analyzing complex social networks to identify linkages hidden deep within social media data streams. LAKE has also garnered the attention of the Combined Information Data exchange Network (CIDNE) community and the LAKE Team has attained advocacy for LAKE integration into CIDNE. Another transition path for LAKE has been initiated with the US Marshals Service to support executing outstanding arrest warrants.  Additionally, the Joint Inter Agency Task Force South has expressed an interest in LAKE for their counter narcotics mission. In this Phase II Proposal, the LAKE Team details the objectives, workplan, and commercialization strategy to ensure long-term success and transition of this research.  BENEFIT:  LAKE is a force multiplier for the intelligence community; a Cloud based mechanism to add analytical capabilities quickly without investing in new infrastructure, training new personnel, or licensing new software.  LAKE executes sophisticated learning and noise reduction algorithms within a high performance parallelized computing framework.  LAKE will provide significant benefits to both the public and private sector. In the public sector, the need to understand complex social networks is highlighted on a near daily basis, to preempt a terror event, or understand the geo-political situation within a dynamic environment (e.g. Arab Spring).   In both the public and private medical domain, link analysis can prove vital in combatting epidemics and pandemics by identifying social communities that may be exposed. In the private sector, there is significant opportunity for LAKE in the area of business intelligence. For example, Competitive Link Analysis enables a business to understand why people are linking to their competitors. LAKE can help businesses improve customer retention, cross-sell and up-sell by enabling marketers to identify social communities based on relationships between customers; measure and segment customers based on social influence; and target customers based on changes within their social networks.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Real world uncertainties all but guarantee that execution will deviate from even carefully considered plans, and therefore any effective military command will assume that resources must be reallocated to achieve desired outcomes. Unfortunately, reallocation is typically a manual process that results in sub-optimal use of resources and force effectiveness. To provide a system that can dynamically reallocate resources across air, space, and cyber domains, Charles River Analytics proposes a Phase II effort to develop and evaluate a full-scope prototype for Reallocation and Cross-Domain Optimization using Relationally-Consistent Semantic Extensions (ReCOURSE). Our approach includes four primary components: (1) a semantically rich, logically grounded representational layer that can query, integrate and control data management, analysis, and definitional information technologies; (2) a computational inference layer that takes sensor data, quantitative metrics, and other types of information as input and uses it to output definitions, descriptions, analyses, and projections of world states; (3) an empirically informed efficacy-mining function that learns resource effectiveness based on operational data; and (4) a multi-objective optimization layer that generates options and tradeoffs between solutions. ReCOURSE will provide significant value to the Joint Forces Air Component Commander, specifically supporting analyzing/approving a recommended target list received from the Joint Targeting Board.  BENEFIT:  The research performed under this effort will have immediate benefit to Air Operations Center Weapon System(s) (AOC WS) that are assigned to multiple geographic and functional combatant commands. Additionally, advances in this area of plan analysis and maintenance could help in other military domains across air, maritime, ground, and space operations. This research will also have direct application to enhance our commercial EAToolkit product, a software development kit for optimization using evolutionary algorithms.",

We propose a completely novel performance measurement network to monitor data-communication network thru packet sniffing. A flexible architecture is proposed in which both wired or wireless interfaces can be used. A distributed approach is proposed that collects and analyzes data at measurement nodes.

        "abstract": "An opportunity exists to significantly reduce the cost of low-profile fiber optic transceivers utilized in harsh environment applications by exploiting advances made in optoelectronic (OE) packaging. Presently, the cost associated with traditional hermetic can (HC) packaging dominates the overall cost of transceivers fielded in the aerospace systems such as the F-35, F-22 and B-2. While electronic components are commonly used in mil-avionics without hermetic can packaging, OE components are relatively unproven. This program addresses fiber optic system affordability by 1) reducing the transceiver manufacturing costs by eliminating expensive ceramic substrates, metalized fiber and active alignment process, 2) reducing the transceiver assembly, handling and fiber-related repair costs by adding a removable fiber connector, and 3) reduce fiber cable maintenance costs by incorporating built-in-test for health monitoring of the fiber optic cable plant.",

Crossfield&#039;s approach will provide increased bandwidth and storage capacity to on-board sensor data acquisition systems, and most importantly, enable ultra-high-speed download of data. Crossfield&quot;s proposed solution will provide more than an order of magnitude faster download speed than the current implementation (50 Gbps versus the current&lt;1.5 Gbps).    The GSE will use Crossfield&#039;s network interface to provide a pluggable fiber optic link between the on-board SSD and secondary storage. Crossfield&quot;s network interface supports 40/56G InfiniBand and 1/10/40G Ethernet network technology, with effective data transfer bandwidths up to 50 Gbps.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Mayflower proposes to develop and demonstrate next generation MANET technology namely, the Autonomous Cognitive Topology Management for highly Mobile Airborne Networks (ACTMAN). ACTMAN represents a comprehensive next generation MANET technology that provides; (1) Low Probability of Intercept (LPI)/ Low Probability of Detection (LPD) topology management which autonomously form, maintain, repair, and optimize the network; (2) Rapid authentication technology that facilitates exceptional level of security assurance in a timely manner; and (3) Effective RF radio transceiver technology that mitigates jamming signals and interferences in a contested spectrum  environment. In addition, the ACTMAN technology is designed to cope with high speed mobility, persistent topology changes, and frequent membership changes. These technology components will be implemented with low overhead and will be interoperable with legacy airborne network systems. We have also implemented and demonstrated the functional components of aforementioned capabilities in the Mayflower Tactical MANET Test bed (TMT). In the proposed Phase II SBIR program, the Mayflower team will augment and enrich the ACTMAN technology, test and demonstrate it on the Mayflower TMT with live radios, and will ensure its commercialization via Air Force field test and demonstration in Phase II by working closely with prime contractors.  BENEFIT:  There is significant interest in autonomous networking capability that can be readily deployed in the realm of disaster relief network where multiple parties may operate jointly with network merge and disconnect during the relief effort, requiring autonomous topology management, rapid authentication, and unintentional radio frequency interference mitigation. The ACTMAN technology would ensure that the networking capability is sustained at all times while protecting the network from unlawful access through secure yet responsive authentication process. The ACTMAN would also effectively alleviate RF inferences among the multiple party concurrent operations and enable opportunistic communication capability through agile spectrum fragmentation technology. Similarly, ACTMAN technology components can be applied to UAV-based ad hoc networks for surveillance and first responders, or it can be applied to home network, campus network, or small enterprise network as ubiquitous-network enabling capabilities",

Wall designs suitable with acceptable transmission and cross polarization have been fabricated as flat panel construction sample panels and have been evaluated for 0 &amp; #61616; and 60 &amp; #61616; CP incidence for the Phase I effort. The best of these flat panel designs will be chosen for the radome fabrication effort of Phase II.  The thickness, stiffness, and bird strike resistance of these designs must be the maximum possible while providing good circular polarization (CP) transmission and low cross polarization over the relatively wide range of incidence angles (0 &amp; #61616; to 65 &amp; #61616;) required for the streamlined shape typical of dorsal airborne radomes.      The object of the Phase II effort is to design, fabricate, and measure a V/W band airborne radome in order to verify the electrical and structural performance predictions that will be completed as part of the design effort.  Extension of the resin Vacuum Infusion Process (VIP) to fabricating the laminate portion of construction sample panels to radome laminate fabrication is also a significant feature of the proposed Phase II effort.    BENEFIT:  FAA certification (acceptance) of new materials for airborne applications (commercial and now probably military ) focuses on reliability and safety of flight, requiring either reference to or the creation of an extensive data base for structural coupons. The qualification of new materials for radomes which have no established FAA data base becomes time consuming and costly.  Improved electrical performance is not an element of the FAA certification for safety of flight. The proposed Phase II effort provides an opportunity to acquire structural data for new materials that offer improved electrical performance.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In this proposal we describe a highly flexible, ultra low-lower power GNSS receiver. By building the receiver from the ground up with flexibility and ultra-low voltage in mind, we are able to achieve a 5-20x improvement in energy-efficiency while providing support for a wide variety of GNSS codes. The proposed flexible code generator is able to efficiently support C/A, L2C, M, P, and L5 codes. The system firmware will execute on low-voltage, low-power RISC processing cores operating in parallel. A novel current-mode correlator provides long correlation lengths (&gt;65,000 bits) while maintaining energy-efficiency and a small silicon footprint. The Phase 2 effort is divided into two fabrication efforts: a proof-of-concept (PoC) microchip and a prototype microchip. The proof-of-concept microchip will be designed, fabricated, and tested in order to inform the design of the prototype. The PoC chip will contain test structures and/or initial designs for all of the experimental portions of the system. The prototype chip will be a full low-power GNSS receiver, which will be capable of providing a live demonstration. This project is a collaboration with the University of Michigan Integrated Circuits Laboratory, who has extensive experience with fabricating advanced integrated circuits.  BENEFIT:  The proposed receiver will achieve a 5-20x improvement in energy-efficiency over existing solutions while providing support for a wide variety of GNSS codes.  Systems containing this GNSS receiver will have reduced battery and thermal requirements, making them smaller and operate longer in the field. Low-power operation is particularly useful for handheld devices, autonomous vehicles, and asset/fleet tracking systems, where energy sources are limited.   The flexible code generator supports C/A, P, M, L1C, L2C, L5, and Galileo E1 in a single compact module, and also allows new codes to be programmed into the system as they are created, thereby adding lifetime to the system. The current-mode correlation circuit can simultaneously correlate tens of thousands of bits in compact, low energy form factor, allowing fast acquisition of weak or jammed signals, or in C/A denied scenarios. In general, almost all systems currently containing a GNSS receiver would benefit from the technologies developed in this proposal.",

(PSI) proposes to build a prototype free-space optical (FSO) quantum key distribution (QKD) link that will incorporate two key innovations: 1) a narrow linewidth atomic line filter (ALF) at 780 nm based on Rubidium vapor and 2) a 780 nm laser source based on frequency doubling a telecommunications industry standard fiber laser.  By improving the rejection of the solar background by a factor of over 50 compared with the current state of the art, the ALF will enable daytime operation that is currently not possible for the low Earth orbit (LEO) to ground scenario the Air Force is envisioning.  The frequency doubled fiber laser source will be critical for eventual deployment on a satellite where size and reliability will be key performance parameters.  Not only will this program advance the state of the art of two key component technologies, this prototype QKD link demonstrator would have significant benefit to the Air Force as a platform for evaluating both emerging state of the art hardware and novel encryption and security protocols.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Space situational awareness is often limited by the ability of sensors to produce resolved data on space objects. Large objects cannot be resolved with small low-cost telescopes; objects in geo-synchronous orbit are too remote to be resolved. The best hope of ending these limitations is to make it possible to determine important features of space objects from unresolved data, typically the temporal light curves that are produced by measuring only the integrated brightness of the space object as it passes overhead a sensor on the ground. Both supervised processing (i.e., pattern classification) and unsupervised processing (i.e., Kalman filter) of light curve data have shown success in extracting space object features. In this proposal we set forth a system that combines the merits of both supervised and unsupervised processing to more fully automate the exploitation of unresolved space object temporal light curve data.  BENEFIT:  The successful results of this project will offer Space Situational Awareness (SSA) data from low-cost deployable telescopes that can travel to the world-wide locations where USA military assets operate and can benefit from the immediate response of the simpler SSA systems offered by this technology. The Potential Commercial Applications of this project extend to the construction and delivery, maintenance and upgrade of such worldwide assets, including delivery of workstations and full SSA packages, as well as cross-over applications in areas such as autonomous navigation.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Human planners face significant challenges in attempting to coordinate and synchronize operations across the unique complexities of the air, space and cyber domains in a way that maximizes utility of the available resources for addressing mission objectives. The significant disparities in domain-specific capabilities and their inter-dependencies make it difficult to synchronize the usage of assets across domains to fulfill a large number of tasks in a complex mission. As a result, human planners may overlook critical dependencies of task across domains and may also miss many opportunities to synergize domain capabilities that would have achieved the desired effects much faster, with fewer resources and with higher probability of a successful outcome. We propose to develop the Dynamic Agent-based Reallocation and Tasking (DART) system to offer a framework for resource allocation across diverse domains with particular focus on the coordination of air, space and cyber resources in fulfilling mission objectives. Our approach leverages key elements from research in mixed-initiative planning and resource allocation algorithms and provides a scalable service based architecture with web-based user interface.  BENEFIT:  The complete DART system will offer potential benefits across a broad set of tactical scenarios where resources from diverse domains are required to achieve mission success including disaster response, counter terrorism, counter narcotics and various operations which involve coordination of air, space and cyber resources. DART will optimize the allocation of resources to best meet mission objectives and will ensure that required dependencies between tasks are effectively managed across domains. We have developed a transition strategy focused initially on disaster response working with the Center for Asymmetric Warfare and will validate the tactical utility of DART in a large scale disaster response field exercise involving DoD, DHS, state and local authority response resource planning. In addition, through integration with the AFRL Cornerstone system and support for its ontologies the DART system will readily support USAF Air Operation Center planning and integration of relevant planning systems across air, space and cyber.",

        "abstract": "HMCs approach to Phase I HLRB roller bearing design was to achieve separation of the radial and axial functions of the bearing so as to enable axial bearing movement independent of bearing rotation. HMCs rationale for this approach was that the delineation of axial and radial loads will ensure that each load bearing member can withstand the static and dynamic force vectors to which it will be exposed during numerous and frequent helo bay door operations. During Phase II work, HMC will conduct more in depth contact stress evaluations of HLRB designs under stresses similar to those in helo bay door operations. These evaluations will include Roller Hertzian calculations that determine the magnitude of subsurface stresses carried by the HLRB bearing materials of fabrication under applied loads that are more representative of helo bay door operations. During Phase II HMC also plans to fabricate and use more sophisticated testing apparatus with which to test more matured HLRB prototype design(s). This equipment will provide more representative and accurate Hertzian calculations than were available during Phase I efforts. Phase II efforts will also involve the design of advanced HLRB models that incorporate alternative bearing components and fabrication materials capable of providing greater yield strength and corrosion resistance.",

        "abstract": "Flight-testing is a crucial component in NASA&#039;s mission to research and develop new aeronautical concepts because it allows for verification of simulated and wind-tunnel experiments and exposes previously unforeseen design problems. Video is an invaluable tool for flight-testing, allowing the collection of a wealth of information such as craft position, speed, health, as well as tracking different phases of flight, capturing events, extracting performance figures, and documenting historical flights.  For several cases of interest (high-speed/high-altitude aircraft, lakebed remote landings, vehicle re-entry, smoke airflow traces, etc.) it is not feasible or physically possible to install external cameras close to the aircraft whose behavior is being filmed.  Long-range imaging equipment is typically used in these cases, but the captured footage is severely limited in quality by atmospheric effects, which are often the dominating source of image degradation, long before diffraction-related limitations occur.  In consequence, long-range imagery typically suffers from scintillation, blurring, poor spatial resolution, and low contrast.  Since these problems result from atmospheric conditions, they cannot be overcome by simply improving imaging hardware.  What is needed is a solution to combat atmospheric distortion.  In Phase I, EM Photonics demonstrated a signal processing technique based on initial research from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  We modified and implemented this core algorithm and showed its ability to enhance imagery collected from the long-range imaging systems at NASA DFRC.  In Phase II, we will evolve and integrate the prototype components developed in Phase I and deliver an image enhancement device capable of running in real time to mitigate the image distortion present in data collected from NASA DFRC&#039;s long-range cameras.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The significance of the 71-76 and 81-86GHz frequencies cannot be overstated. The 10 GHz of spectrum available represents by far the most ever allocated at any one time, representing 50-times the bandwidth of the entire cellular spectrum. With 5 GHz of bandwidth available per channel, gigabit and greater data rates can easily be accommodated with reasonably simple radio architectures. With propagation characteristics comparable to those at the widely used microwave bands, and well characterized weather characteristics allowing rain fade to be understood, link distances of several miles can confidently be realized. Our goal in Phase II is bring the benefits of solid-state amplifiers to the W-Band while achieving the better performance than the TWT amplifiers.  The benefits that we will bring to W-Band amplifier design with our solid-state approach include the realizable small size and weight you can obtain with a MMIC design even with power combining.  Our amplifier will weigh on the order of ounces and be less than a cubic inch in size. A further advantage of our approach is the ability to combine the final amplifier. The achievable power capability for our amplifier combined in unit cells is over 500W.    BENEFIT:  For unmanned systems, video data constitutes the only&quot;eyes-in-the-sky&quot;and thus the only link that a ground crew may have with what is actually going on in the vicinity of an unmanned air vehicle. A ground crew hundreds or even thousands of kilometers away, the video data link becomes absolutely critical to the safety and success of the mission. The W-Band Transmitter will solve these problems and meet the market needs. The W-Band transmitter is uniquely suited for higher bandwidth communication for multi-senor video streams and more complex command and controls.The 2012 budget for UAV predator and reaper modifications is approximately $325 million and from $475 million to $550 million for each remaining year of this decade. It is anticipated that a portion of these budgeted funds will be for SATCOM communication with the new WGS satellites, thus incorporating new W-Band transmitter into preexisting UAVs.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This proposal presents two novel approaches for characterizing manufacturing induced damage in fibrous composites. New developments include integration of discontinuous Galerkin ideas with the variational multiscale finite element methods for the modeling of interface and interphase phenomena in these material systems. The second approach is developed for a mixture theory that is governed by a homogenized set of equations. A two-level split of the deformation map into an elastic component and a phase/damage evolution component leads to two-level description with embedded interphases and damage evolution. These methods possess enhanced stability properties as compared to the standard Galerkin methods, and they come equipped with built-in error estimation modules that help distinguish modeling errors from numerical errors. A significant feature of our methods is a thermodynamically consistent damage driving criterion that relates interphase damage to fatigue life prediction in composites. Both methods accommodate p-refinement feature that leads to higher than quadratic convergence in the L2 norm with quadratic or higher interpolation functions.  BENEFIT:  The SBIR program emphasizes that the research and development effort should lead to a marketable product. With that in view, Advanced Computational Technology will perform code development parts of phase II in a modular form that can be integrated with other commercial finite element analysis packages via the User Defined Modular Interconnects. This will help in easy transfer of the developed technology to practical application in the industry. With the advanced solutions that our methods will facilitate, with integrated graphics tools for easy visualization and comprehension of the intricate stress fields, and with the orders-of-magnitude effect of the interphase on the fatigue life of fibrous composites, these computational tools will help optimize the composite manufacturing processes adopted in the industry.

        "abstract": "Under Phase I, we have designed and developed a limited-scope Mobile Agent-based Distributed Search and Analytics Tool (MADSAT) to support the Armys intelligence and operational information and analysis requirements in the era of net-centric warfare and cloud computing. MADSAT is built on: 1) agent-based, distributed execution of optimized query plans; 2) data modeling for integrating heterogeneous, distributed data sources; 3) distributed fusion for complex analytics based on Bayesian network (BN) models; and 4) web-based and customized user interfaces integrated within Ozone Widget Framework. We have demonstrated that MADSAT can query distributed SALUTE data sources and perform complex analytics via distributed belief propagation on a hierarchical BN model to determine nuclear proliferation threat. We have initiated an effort to develop cloud-based MADSAT within the Apache Hadoop framework.    For Phase II, we propose full-scope agent- and cloud-based development of MADSAT and demonstration and evaluation using actual represented data sources. We will enhance the data modeling capability in coherence with the Armys cloud data strategies, accessing DataSpace through DSMS API. MADSAT will support natural-language-based search and analytics queries. Query planning and execution in the cloud will be built on the MapReduce framework. We plan to transition MADSAT into the DCGS-A Standard Cloud (DSC).",

        "abstract": "Plume signature phenomenology plays an increasingly important role in the development of a wide variety of missile defense technologies, both at the tactical and strategic levels. With the emergence of recent threats, plume signature phenomenology is increasingly central to Missile Defense Agencys fundamental mission of development of a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). The Missile Defense Agencys modeling and simulation directorate is developing, updating, improving, and validating end-to-end modeling and simulation capabilities for the entire missile fly-out scenarios. As part of this broad objective, the simulation of the effects of vernier engines plumes for liquid propulsion systems on sensor systems has a great potential to enhance our defensive capabilities. The opportunity for MDA presented by this effort is to significantly improve flowfield-modeling approaches to better support testing of advanced BMDS sensing systems within high-level simulation environments. This effort will work out the details to correctly represent vernier interactions within plume flowfields and to provide an efficient mechanism to support incorporating these representations into the FLITES scene generation framework.",

The reactors would have an 8 to 15 year design life and should be available for a 2020 launch to support future NASA science missions.  Both 1 kWe thermoelectric and 3 kWe Stirling systems have been examined.  Heat pipes are being examined to transfer the thermal energy from the reactor to the electric conversion systems.  There are three types of wicks that can carry this power over the distance; grooved, sintered arterial and self-venting arterial.  Arterial heat pipes are the default design for spacecraft nuclear reactors; however, de-priming of the artery due to radiation is a serious potential problem.  Grooved and self-venting arterial heat pipes are less susceptible to de-priming since the liquid in the grooves is open to the vapor space and the self-venting arterial heat pipe has venting pores in the evaporator to allow trapped vapor to escape.  ACT's innovation was to examine the tradeoffs between the three heat pipe wicks and determine an optimum wick design that is suitable for fission reactor applications.  The Phase I project was successful in demonstrating that all three types of wicks can transport the necessary power.",

Regenerative CO2 removal systems are attractive for these missions because they do not use consumable CO2 absorbers.  However, these systems also absorb and vent water to space along with the carbon dioxide.  We propose to develop an innovative water recovery system that minimizes water lost from regenerative CO2 control systems without the need for low-temperature condensing heat exchangers.  This approach addresses the need for water recovery systems in long-duration missions, reduces the need for consumables by enabling use of state-of-the-art regenerative CO2 removal systems, and minimizes demands on the spacecraft thermal control system.  In Phase I we proved the feasibility of our approach through proof-of-concept tests that demonstrated efficient water recovery from a compact exchanger with low pressure losses.  Trade-off studies using our mass transfer analysis models have yielded a design for a full-size prototype that meets all the requirements for service on future spacecraft.

        "abstract": "Yb:YAG crystalline fiber lasers can have a 9 times higher power limit (16.9 kW vs 1.89 kW) for narrowband lasers than a Yb-silica fiber laser due to the higher thermal conductivity (10.7 vs 1.38 W/m C) and the reduced SBS (stimulated Brillouin scattering) gain coefficient (10**(-15) to 10**(-12) vs 10**(-11) m/W). Thus, there are many efforts underway to develop crystalline fibers using laser media such as YAG. One of the difficulties of the technique appears to consist of attaining optical quality and accurate diameter control on fiber drawing or consolidation of the green ceramic fibers.   Onyx Optics proposes producing doubled-clad true crystalline fibers and planar guides from Er-doped and Yb-doped single crystal YAG by employing Onyx Optics&quot;manufacturing technology (Adhesive-Free Bond (AFB)). A scalable manufacturing process for designs to multi-kilowatt operation is the principal objective of the proposed work. Femtosecond inscribed waveguides will be investigated. Deliverables to ARL include double clad planar and crystal fibers of various lengths. Optical and mechanical properties, including scattering and absorption losses and refractive index difference evaluations will be performed.

To provide an AOD capability for the COBRA Block I system, Arete will develop, design, implement and integrate an obstacle detection algorithm on the COBRA Post Mission Analysis (PMA) Station. The COBRA Block I system collects and analyzes Multispectral Imagery (MSI) data in the Surf Zone (SZ), Beach Zone (BZ) and Beach Exit Zone (BEZ) to detect minefields, fortifications, and obstacles on a custom Post Mission Analysis (PMA) station after the COBRA Airborne Payload Subystem (CAPS) imaging sensor has landed. Currently, Obstacle Detection is a manual, operator-in-the-loop, image review procedure performed on the PMA Station Subsystem. The lack of a COBRA AOD capability requires operators to manually open and review every multispectral image to perform visual obstacle detection. This amount of operator review to perform Obstacle Detection significantly extends the operational timelines associated with a COBRA mission. The proposed COBRA AOD capability will eliminate the manual operator-in-the-loop detection and subsequently provide for greater than 50% reduction to the current overall COBRA PMA timeline.",

The basic technique is to image part of the sky with a wide field-of-view detector. Processing algorithms will be developed to detect objects in earth orbit as they pass through the image. Slow moving objects will appear as a short streaks or points in successive image frames. Faster objects my pass completely through a single frame leaving only a streak. An initial estimate of the orbit will be made from these images. Methods to increase the accuracy of this initial estimate will be studied. Possible methods include: tasking an agile telescope or looking for the track in another, nearby staring sensor.  BENEFIT:  PDS is leveraging their experience on developing operational dim object detection algorithms for wide field-of-view (WFOV) optical system, such as Pan-STARRS and the Air Force&#039;s Space-based Space Surveillance (SBSS) system.

Our Phase II work plan will focus on developing the instrumentation suite and live-fire field test measurements to gather the data required to validate our concept. Data from multiple high-speed cameras with customized optics will be correlated and fused to derive fragment three-dimensional state (position, velocity, angular momentum) and size information. A high-speed multi-band radiometer will collect data on fireball combustion dynamics that can be combined with pressure/impulse measurements to better characterize advanced weapon blast wave phenomenology. A heat flux model, not currently included in standard damage models, will be evaluated from the radiometer measurements. The plan to integrate these data products into the Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manual Joint Weaponeering System tools will be updated with the information derived from the field measurements. Our proposed hardware/software approach will address critical debris data collection capability gaps in a timely and cost effective manner.  BENEFIT:  The proposed system will expand the amount of data being collected from current static warhead ground testing.  It will also significantly decrease the amount of time and labor required to reduce this data into a format that can be used in effectiveness models.

This class of cathode material is expected to provide significantly enhanced energy density (&gt;850 Wh/kg vs. 500-600Wh/kg of commercial products), excellent rate capability, and long service/cycle life, which will help to increase technical vehicle silent watch time by 15% or more.

In the accomplished Phase I, technical feasibility of the proposed cathode has been demonstrated successfully with high specific capacity (&gt;250 mAh/g) and promising rate capability and cycling performance. In Phase II, further optimization on material composition and processing will be conducted. Using the developed cathode along with suitable electrolyte and anode material that enable the implementation of this cathode material,   Li-ion cell prototypes (e.g., punch cell and 18650/26650 type) and the sub-scale battery packs will be fabricated and tested (&gt;1000 cycles) in order to demonstrate the benefits of the developed cathode at the system level. In addition, preliminary processing scale-up and cost analysis will be conducted, which will pave the way for subsequent commercialization of the developed cathode materials and the resultant Li-ion batteries.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Solid State Scientific Corporation (SSSC) is pleased to propose the development and demonstration of a wide area (WA) multi-threat hostile fire indication (HFI) system for remotely-piloted aircraft (RPA).  The HFI system consists of a comparatively wide field of view sensor that employs miniature optics and a custom short-wave infrared (SWIR) camera based on a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) focal plane array (FPA).  The spectral band of operation, in the SWIR, is selected specifically for detection of a broad class of weapons including artillery fire, surface-to-air missiles, man-portable missiles (MANPADS), and even rocket-propelled grenades (RPG&quot;s), mortars, and smaller arms fire.  The system will feature innovative extensions of recently-developed HFI capabilities, based on the findings of the successful Phase I study, to allow detection of energetic battlefield events from RPAs at altitudes of 15,00025,000 ft., with subsequent cueing of existing fine-tracker or high-resolution imaging systems.  For detection and discrimination of targets, the wide area hostile fire indication system will also capitalize on existing algorithm strategies based on spectral-temporal data already obtained by SSSC, suitably modified for the desired targets of interest and the operating conditions of the RPA.  In order to integrate with existing sensor pods without A-kit changes, the Phase II imager will remain uncooled and occupy a small size, weight, and power envelope without a refrigerator.  The development of this sensor represents a unique opportunity in the development of advanced aircraft survivability equipment.  BENEFIT:  The new sensor combines staring imaging technology, miniature imaging optics technology, recent developments in digital signal processing, SWIR detection algorithms designed for other platforms, focal plane array technology, and commercially available products to produce an innovative, wide-area imaging system.  The ability of the new sensor to rapidly acquire data in the extended SWIR will provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate algorithms for real-time event detection and classification based on spatial and temporal phenomenology in the SWIR.  In addition, the small physical size of the sensor will demonstrate the possibility of miniature imaging as well as the ability to integrate onto airborne platforms.  Finally, the sensor will demonstrate the ability to replace larger, heavier, and less-capable systems with a miniature, uncooled sensor, saving size, weight, power, inefficiency, and cost.     Specific applications for the proposed sensor include specific reconnaissance and cueing for RPA applications as well as self-protection for pilots and crew of rotorcraft from a broad spectrum of threats including guided missiles, unguided rockets, anti-aircraft artillery, and small arms fire.  By combining sensor data with onboard navigation data, the sensor can provide real-time situational awareness, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance for other air and ground crew in the vicinity.  Other potential applications of the spectral imaging technology for defense purposes include real-time bomb damage assessment, airborne and distant target tracking, and remote chemical analysis of engine exhaust.  In addition, we anticipate possible applications in law enforcement, homeland defense, industrial process monitoring, medical diagnostics, and medical imaging.",

        "abstract": "The AEgis Technologies Group Inc. is proposing this Phase II SBIR development effort to address the data bandwidth bottleneck that currently exists between Hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) Scene Generation computing clusters and the sensor stimulators. The existing data links use COTS based video interfaces that result in a bandwidth shortfall by at least 100x for applications in multispectral, hyperspectral, and laser radar. AEgis proposes a method of bypassing these COTS based interfaces using GPU-Direct and a custom parallel optical interface that meet and exceed the bandwidth requirements. Without this interface, it will be impossible to provide real-time, high-fidelity HWIL simulation required to adequately test these complex sensor/seeker systems.     HWIL T &amp; E allows systems to be exercised more rigorously at much less cost than can be achieved in flight testing. Thousands of scenarios can be run to test the sensor performance and the ability of the seeker algorithms to operate in real-world, non-idea operation.  However, as the sensors/seekers improve, the requirements for test instruments become more challenging. Hyper-Computing clusters are being developed for phenomenology modeling needed to produce realistic stimuli. A new data communications bus is required to interface the clusters to stimulators and device under test. This proposal addresses that challenge.",

        "abstract": "Echo Ridge and partner Rockwell Collins propose to mature, enhance and further demonstrate the out the window (OTW)-synchronized RF environment emulator technology prototyped and demonstrated in Phase I. The Phase II design and development activities will result in a deliverable prototype system capable of demonstrating functionality, value, mitigated development risk and compatibility with fielded flight trainer systems. It will be used to introduce and promote the technology towards a Phase III activity and adoption into the training community. The prototype will be capable of accurately emulating the RF environment in a manner that is synchronous with the flight path/dynamics and resultant OTW view from an aircraft cockpit as simulated in a flight simulator. The effect on communication systems, sensors and instrumentation is as though they were truly subjected to the RF operating environment encountered by the aircraft. The system calculates these characteristics on-the-fly (OTF) as the instructor/pilot operates the simulator. A primary objective of the RF path simulation is to add as much realism as possible while minimizing latency so that the RF modeling emulation is correlated with the other flight trainer systems and cockpit displays.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  As more and more advanced hypersonic weapons are developed, vehicle temperatures are expected to near 1250K (977C); as flight times increase, these temperatures are expected to saturate the entire vehicle.  Typically, forward-looking RF and IR sensors are collocated in the same protective radome, which degrades the performance of both systems.  FIRST RF proposes a significantly different approach to the challenge of High-Speed Weapon Radomes by relocating the antenna sensors to alternate regions of the weapon.    FIRST RF has developed a revolutionary new conformal, high temperature, forward-looking, high gain antenna, suitable for seeker applications in the hypersonic environment. The solution makes use of unique, end-fire antennas that are constructed from conformal, high-temperature dielectric materials.  The proposed work is targeting seeker system application for Ku- and Ka-band. The part count is low and the construction method is very simple and robust.    The proposed Phase II program will fabricate and test a small array demonstrating the performance benefits.    BENEFIT:  Thermal management is the greatest challenge to this particular application.  FIRST RF believes that we offer a practical approach to solving the antenna design.  It leverages proven radiator technology and addresses thermal impact on the antenna.    The specific benefits are: 1) Thermal impact on the antennas is managed while maintaining overall platform capability and performance.  2) The antenna design is such that the radiation pattern is optimized and efficiency is maximized, while ensuring environmental operation.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  During Phase I, FBS, Inc. developed and demonstrated a light-weight, low-power, non-thermal, ultrasound-based ice protection system for RPA wing leading edges and other metallic and composite components requiring ice protection.  Low-profile, light-weight, low-power ultrasonic actuators are strategically placed inside the wing section and activated when icing conditions are encountered to perform de-icing of the wing leading edge.  Ultrasonic de-icing is achieved by driving the actuators to create ultrasonic shear stresses at the substrate/ice interface such that the ultrasonic stresses are greater than the adhesion strength of the ice in order to promote ice delamination and cracking.  FBS expertise is applied in optimizing actuator design and frequency selection, and newly-developed phasing technologies are used to achieve dynamic focusing across key regions of the structure of concern.  The system was successfully demonstrated on a composite RPA airfoil section in freezer ice conditions during Phase I.  During Phase II, several icephobic coatings that showed potential will be further analyzed for use in conjunction with the ultrasonic de-icing system, and full-scale RPA wing section testing will be performed in a realistic icing wind tunnel.  Additional system development will include hardware and software improvements, as well as considerations for electronics miniaturization.  BENEFIT:  The proposed technology has the potential to revolutionize ice protection systems for aircraft.  Some of the popular conventional ice protection systems include icephobic coatings, electro-thermal systems, and pneumatic boot systems.  Electro-thermal systems are heavy, have demanding power requirements, are sometimes unreliable, and can cause damage to composite materials from overheating.  Pneumatic systems are also heavy and sometime unreliable.  If a coating was available that could withstand flight environments; it could be used in conjunction with the ultrasound to further reduce the size, weight, and effectiveness of the ultrasonic de-icing system. The proposed ultrasonic approach is unique in that discrete repairable actuators provide low-power non-thermal de-icing without damaging the composite structure.  The power requirements for the ultrasonic system are orders of magnitude lower than that of electro-thermal systems.  The ultrasonic actuators used for ice protection also have great potential to be utilized in the future as ultrasonic guided wave sensors to monitor structural health and even sense ice accretion for efficient driving of the ice protection mode of operation.",

RELAX (1) enables the practice of anger management strategies remotely through mobile phone interfaces; (2) integrates with evidence-based treatments through the implementation of an existing CBT anger management course; (3) provides information, direction, and feedback through physiological sensors; and (4) supports communication and direction by the therapist through a web-based therapist interface.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a novel research microscope based on coherent Raman scattering (CRS). In contrast to other techniques, CRS is a label-free method that requires excitation with two synchronized laser pulse trains (ultra-short pulse duration) with precisely tunable wavelengths (&lt;1nm). The key innovation of the Phase I proposal was the realization that the difference frequency of the two major gain media used in the telecommunication industry, Erbium and Ytterbium, corresponds to the wavelength range where most CRS imaging is performed. This provided a path to an economical laser source for CRS based on a robust all-fiber implementation of low-cost telecom components. Following successful proof-of-concept in Phase I, the Phase II proposal aims to complete the development of the laser system and integrate it into an easy-to-use and environmentally stable solution for CRS microscopy. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in the area of biological and material science research, and ultimately medical diagnostics. CRS allows microscopic imaging with chemical contrast based on intrinsic spectroscopic properties of the sample. It circumvents the issues associated with fluorescent labeling or dye staining, which can be especially problematic for imaging molecules that are smaller than typical labels or for use in vivo in patients. Wide ranging applications including studying lipid metabolism, trans-dermal drug delivery, biomass conversion to biofuel, and tumor margin delineation during cancer surgery, have been demonstrated. Current laser systems for CRS are expensive, require experienced personnel for operation, and are not robust. This greatly limits access to this exciting new technology and prevents use in medical diagnostics. The proposed integrated CRS microscopy solution aims to overcome these limitations.",

High risk regions for TD include areas where US service members are deployed.  The rapid identification of immune responses to enteric pathogens would be advantageous to discovering potential vaccine candidates and defining exposures to enteric infections of interest.  Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are the current gold standard to measure serum antibody titers in response to enteric pathogens.  However, ELISAs have significant limitations preventing their application in high-throughput screening of large sample numbers for multiple pathogens simultaneously.  The difficulty of multiplexing ELISAs in a single well leads to increased usage of serum sample as well as reagents.  Therefore, an assay is needed that can be multiplexed to detect several different pathogens in a single well and requires minimal technician time to perform.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Peel ply, sanding and atmospheric plasma treatment have been examined as alternative methods for the surface preparation of bismaleimide carbon-fiber composites prior to bonding. It was found that atmospheric plasma treatment of the composite surface decreases the water contact angle from 822 to 202. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy of the treated composites revealed a 91% increase in surface oxygen fraction with plasma exposure. This surface oxygen increase correlated to the plasmas ability to recover the knock-down in double lap shear strength observed on peel plied and lightly sanded non-peel plied samples, from 1390210 psi to 209020 psi and from 2000100 to 225050 psi, respectively. Wedge crack extension testing after a seven-day hot-wet environmental exposure revealed that adding atmospheric plasma treatment after light sanding decreases the wedge crack length from 0.197 to 0.085 inches. In addition, oxygen plasma exposure on the peel ply composites increased the percent cohesive failure from an unacceptable value of 863% to an acceptable value of 981%.  These results indicate that automated atmospheric pressure plasma treatment of organic matrix composites is a viable technology for surface preparation prior to structural adhesive bonding.  BENEFIT:  An exciting new technology is being developed for the automated surface preparation of organic matrix composites. This method will eliminate many of the problems encountered during joining of structural composites on jet aircraft, satellites, helicopters and other aerospace systems.  The new preparation method greatly reduces manufacturing time and cost, and delivers systems with much stronger and tougher joints.  In addition to aerospace, this process technology can be adapted to other industries, including renewable energy, automotive, and consumer electronics.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This proposal&quot;s objective is for Silicon Space Technology (SST) to develop a high-performance radiation-hardened design platform for building radiation-hardened Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) with a gate count&gt;10M and Total Ionizing Dose (TID) performance&gt;1 Mrad.  Meeting this objective enables building of satellites that can meet aggressive, leading-edge size, weight, and power (SWAP) goals.  SST&quot;s proprietary HardSIL &amp; #61652; technology has been successfully integrated within 250nm, 180nm and 130nm processes from multiple manufacturers resulting in hardened processes&gt;1 Mrad TID.  Requirements for an ASIC platform were developed through meetings with system prime contractors and Mil/Aero customers combined with a survey of existing radiation-hardened products.  A structured ASIC platform with metal-programmable cells and IOs will be developed using a 130nm process enhanced with HardSIL &amp; #61652; technology to provide a metal-programmable system on a chip (MPSoC) capability.  Results from modeling the MPSoC platform based upon a 130nm HardSIL &amp; #61652; enhanced process with commercial EDA synthesis and layout tools from Cadence showed a usable gate density of 90K gates/mm2.  Therefore a 10x10mm2 interior chip area would have 12M raw gates and 9M usable gates with TID performance&gt;1Mrad.  BENEFIT:  Silicon Space believes the existing or potential military requirements and military potential for the results of this proposed Phase II 130nm SOC program were touched upon within the Phase I solicitation.  Excerpts state&quot;The enduring role of semiconductors in satellite communications will continue to fuel advances in platform capabilities for the foreseeable future. Digital processing will have to operate at significantly higher data rates and consume less power per gate to meet the ever increasing demands of battlefield communications, and this objective requires a continuous push downward on the energy/operation of semiconductors, which requires attention to the optimization of the associated processes.&quot;It also stated that military space systems need much higher performance circuits than are currently available through captive rad-hard foundries. Availability of the 130nm low-power RH MPSoC cell library will allow higher performance systems in space.  Our 130nm low-power RH metal programmable system-on-a-chip cell library addresses the latch-up, total ionizing dose, and single-event effects requirements  including the&quot;tolerance to even higher radiation levels&quot;aspect.  These performance capabilities also result in improved reliability for long-term missions.  SST believes AFRL, SMC and MDA are the primary DoD agencies most likely to benefit from this project.  All three have expressed interest in related-work programs, so we believe there may be interest by at least one in a federally-funded CPP and/or Phase III effort.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Phase II will leverage the success of Phase I, as well as integrate advances from internal programs, to scale up development of mid-bandgap (1.4 eV) chalcopyrite-based PV. We will optimize chemistries of the device, as well as enable increased temperature for reduced the defect density by a combination of new substrates and refined thermal management to enable&gt;15% efficient modules on lightweight and flexible polymer substrates.  As an added benefit, mid-bandgap devices will improve the performance of CIGS-based devices for space applications by enable 30% higher performance at nominal operational temperatures due to lower temperature coefficients and reduced joule-heating losses. We will address the following: 1) optimize the thermal management of the process to enable better coupling of thermal energy to the back contact and utilize high-temperature substrates with reduced coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), 2) optimize the back contact of the device to best match electrical and mechanical requirements of this improved process, 3) optimize flexible mid-bandgap AgCIGS and buffer layers in order to achieve desired electrical and mechanical performance, and 4) optimize submodule design, patterning and printing for the new mid-bandgap material. Each of these approaches have been demonstrated to reduce defects.  BENEFIT:  We have a natural evolution of our product development through R &amp; D, Roll-to-roll Prototype/Development (within R &amp; / Engineering) and Production. Commercialization of the mid-bandgap devices will be marked by demonstration on R &amp; D&quot;s decommissioned production equipment. Mid-bandgap modules with High-Temperature substrates will likely represent the second or third generation of product from AST, the first being our production single-junction flexible monolithically integrated CIGS product. Our customers for this product will be defense agencies/contractors (space and satellite power, near space reconnaissance, battle field power solutions packs, solar powered tents, portable power), power electronics OEMs and consumer electronic products, building material solution providers, and PV system integrators for both the commercial and residential building product markets. Our lightweight, high specific power product can be incorporated into fabric, structural composites, and polymeric circuitry to present advantages over ultra-high efficiency expensive multijunction PV. In Phase II, we specifically will be able to evaluate production readiness of the thin film device, patterning and printing operations at AST, as well as supply chain readiness.",

        "abstract": "Modern marine radar systems can provide detection and tracking of various sizes of ships, and progress in signal processing has allowed for the detection of some smaller and faster targets, largely due to the wake generated by the boats. However, detection of small boats still remains a very challenging problem. Most small boats are simply not visible to a typical marine radar any more than a large breaking wave. To tackle this complex problem, we plan to simultaneously consider a number of relevant factors related to: the sensor, the radar scattering phenomenology, and the CAD geometry and CEM modeling. Each of these technical areas relies on some knowledge and interaction with the other areas to sufficiently address the detailed concepts. To be successful with this integrated technical approach, we must be diligent to maintain an overall focus on implementing solutions in the form of robust software tools, not just performing technical studies. The primary objective of this effort is to develop, integrate, and deliver commercial quality software tools for simulation and analysis of small boat and sea state problems. In addition, there are a number of study, V &amp; V, and analysis activities that will be performed to support this development.",

The mission success hinges on timely and accurate decision-making for responding to dynamic situations in the area of operations that pose considerable risks to mission assets; both personnel and equipment. However, no decision support tools are presently available for mission personnel to exploit the most up to date situation information and maximize mission performance. To fill this capability gap, we will develop a decision support system called CARPE; a Cognitive Architecture for RePlanning and Execution, that shall support decision making for MCM missions with replanning, retasking, and rescheduling capabilities, and shall interoperate with the MEDAL-EA system. We will develop novel techniques for deviation detection, interactive deviation cause analysis, minimally disruptive rescheduling, causal and plan model learning. We will implement and integrate these technologies as reasoning services with MEDAL-EA to provide a seamless decision support experience to MCM mission personnel.

While the provision of in-shoe foot orthoses (ISFOs) is commonplace in commercial athletic and outdoor footwear, the provision of similar devices that can be accommodated in an army boot has not received significant attention. The high rates of lower extremity injuries in the military point to the urgent need to close the footwear performance gap by providing military personnel with footwear and in-boot orthoses that incorporate up-to-date biomechanical knowledge and state-of-the-art materials.

The innovation in physics-based, Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA)-compliant electronic warfare (EW) object models and a robust prediction algorithm will enable JESS to overcome inherent latencies of distributed networked test and training environments and provide consistent, realistic, jamming effect replications with propagation and attenuation including terrain and weather effects. As a result, JESS offers flexible EW object models with complete geometric freedom dictated by the operator, and inclusion of both noise jamming and repeater jamming effects, which directly address the Navy requirements. In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of JESS by designing, developing, and integrating a proof-of-concept prototype for distributed simulations with 1-meter aircraft position prediction accuracy. In Phase II, POC plans to expand the validated Phase I design into a full-scale, high-fidelity prototype and validate and demonstrate it with TENA and the Joint Integrated Mission Model (JIMM).",

        "abstract": "During the Phase I SBIR Effort, Mainstream demonstrated a unique vehicle monitoring system (VMS) for tractor trailer applications.  The development was driven by the need to easily store, retrieve, and transfer key trailer parameters to the tractor and the need to electronically transfer key driver, tractor, and trailer information to roadside inspectors and maintenance personnel.  In Phase I, we demonstrated a patent-pending low-cost, easily installed VMS that enables the sharing of information between a tractor, multiple trailer(s), and users.  We exceeded all the Phase I objectives and also developed an improved communication method.  The Phase II effort includes extensive on-road vehicle field tests to continue the success of the Phase I hardware demonstrations.  Phase II will also demonstrate that this technology can be provided to the trucking industry at a minimal cost of less than ten dollars for any VMS end device.  Mainstream plans to continue to work with critical key decision makers in the trucking industry, and to incorporate our industry partners into as many vehicle-testing programs as possible.  Our goal is to demonstrate and license this low-cost technology to one of the industry players.  Mainstream has successfully licensed technology in other industries and has a detailed marketing/commercialization plan.",

        "abstract": "Image processing methods have been studied and implemented for the vehicle classification over the past decades.  The most dominant approach is the use of vehicle dimension, which requires complex processes of sensor calibration as the vehicle dimensions shown in the imagery are heavily dependent on the camera\u2019s field of view. In general, video systems have physical disadvantages related to the performance degradation under certain conditions such as occlusion, shadowing, inclement weather, sun glare and nighttime detection. In Phase II, we focused on the development of new hardware and detection algorithms, and developed three new products: MigmaMotorcycleTM, MigmaBicycleTM PB, and MigmaBicycleTM SP. Their field test results have shown that these products have the excellent performance. In this project, we will expand the core technologies developed in Phase II to the vehicle\nclassification of all 13 classes defined by FHWA. The classification problem of 13 vehicle classes can be solved by developing a few algorithm modules using IR camera and microphones. Moreover, this system is easy to calibrate and low in cost. The vehicle classification results will also be sent to Amazon Cloud and users can view the vehicle classification labels and counts on the electronic maps.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The proposed technique employs a variety of sensors that combine data to form a comprehensive picture of a situation of interest. The goal is to increase the effectiveness of military surveillance by giving a more complete, integrated picture of situations to enable a quicker response while eliminating errors from potential failures of individual sensors. In Phase I of this program, AS&T developed and performed a proof-of-the-concept demonstration of decision-support operations based on the fusion of heterogeneous data. This was done by utilizing sensors with differing modalities, some typical for imaging (visible, MWIR, LWIR) and some associated with non-imaging detection. The collected data used was to demonstrate optimal methods of identification, discrimination and tracking of the target necessary to determine various aspects of its state and features for augmented space surveillance. During Phase II, we will extend the proposed technology and enhance the operational level of the software for data fusion. By designing and assembling an FPGA-based multi-sensor data-fusion platform, AS&T will be able to verify and optimize performance of the predictive system. The program will culminate with technology laboratory tests and field demonstrations in an operational environment.  BENEFIT:  The US military relies upon a diverse array of sensing resources to achieve enhanced space situation awareness. As a result, given the vast resources providing a war-fighter with information, the military incorporates stochastic algorithms into sensor fusion systems to process the sensors' information. Military applications include, but are not limited to remote sensing, active tracking of fast-moving targets including space objects (satellites, space debris), and cross-communication systems. Commercial sectors that are effectually use the multi-parametric sensor fusion technology include robotics, geospatial information systems, business intelligence, and a broad variety of medical applications, including diagnostics, recovery prognosis and optimal recovery estimates, etc.",

There is a recent research activity in computer vision community that aims to reconstruct 3-d structure of the observed scenes relying on the content of the imagery in fully automated ways. However the research has not matured into robust systems ready for operational settings. In this proposal, a novel architecture that reconstructs the 3-d geometry of the scene in the form of a geo-registered 3-d point cloud given imagery from multiple sensor platforms is presented. The 3-d cloud is equipped with LE and CE measurements through propagation of errors in the sensor calibration and the geometry reconstruction stages. The CVG team proposes to use a volumetric probabilistic 3-d representation (P3DM) and dense image matching to reconstruct the geometry and the appearance of the scene starting from a set of images with partial calibration data.

This research leverages hardware previously developed by Metis Design Corporation (MDC), including distributed digitization hardware, piezoelectric-based damage-localization sensors, and a data accumulation hub. Collaborating with Goodrich EPP (now UTC Aerospace), during Phase I MDC investigated the feasibility of wave propagation in thick GFRP with neoprene/rubber coatings/core, leading to a demonstration using 4 MD7 digital SHM sensors mounted on a large (8 x 5) curved 1 thick GFRP fairing structure with 3 rounds of damage, including a ~1.5 kJ impact in salt-fog and rain conditions. Building on this success, the Phase II effort seeks to develop a customized system suitable for long-duration installation in a submarine environment. Major tasks will focus on the optimization of sensors placement, fabrication and testing of suitable hardware to withstand a relevant environment, development of robust algorithms to determining health state, and finally a compelling underwater demonstration of a prototype system. The Phase II Option will aim to subsequently test the prototype system through a variety of environments and loads as well as quantifying the system performance and accuracy on a real or representative composite component.",

The sensors can often determine range and relative bearing to the signal source, but without knowing its own orientation, these data cannot be converted to the geo location and ground track of the source.  There is therefore a need for a sensor to determine the UGS azimuth, roll, and pitch relative to an earth-referenced frame.  Creare proposes to complete the development, fabrication, and testing of a novel, high performance, MEMS gyrocompass based on the most accurate MEMS rate gyroscopes currently available.  The compass will provide azimuth, roll, and pitch with much better than 2 degrees of accuracy in a ruggedized package capable of withstanding the harsh environment in the field.  The sensor will be low-cost and consume little power.  In Phase I we demonstrated that the key components of the compassthe precision rate gyro and high-accuracy inclinometerscan provide the accuracy and stability needed to meet the UGS pointing accuracy requirements.  In Phase II, we will build a complete prototype MEMS gyrocompass and demonstrate its use for UGS applications.",

While this approach is effective when GPS is available, new approaches are needed that can achieve accurate navigation when operating in a GPS-denied environment.  In response, vendors are developing new navigation-aiding sensors and improving the performance of existing sensors.  However, there is currently no systematic method to evaluate tradeoffs in navigation accuracy with different sensor combinations for different scenarios, and therefore no systematic method for the Government to rapidly determine how best to invest limited budgets to achieve mission requirements.  Under this effort, we will build a navigation simulation tool that enables such tradeoffs in sensor accuracies, navigation filters, and other components of an overall systems solution.  Standard interfaces allow sensor models and other components to be easily plugged into the system.  Parameters and scenarios are defined via external files, allowing the user to perform trade studies on sensor capabilities without code modification.  BENEFIT:  The navigation simulation tool will be a product that missile system developers and Government evaluators can use to quantify the benefits of new or improved sensors, navigation filters, or other navigation components for high altitude munitions, thereby directing development efforts in a manner that is most beneficial to the end solution.

It is also possible that they may want to target a road or an airport runway to disable enemy mobility but without causing civilian casualties in the vicinity.  SBIR Phase II proposal is to develop these fast running models (FRMs) using innovative testing (and instrumentations) and analytical simulation methods is presented here.  BENEFIT:  With the concern over collateral damage caused by a conventional weapon detonation, different types of damage mechanisms must be considered. One of these is secondary debris from ejecta when a conventional weapon is partially or completely buried.  Secondary debris has the potential to cause damage/injury to collateral concerns that must be determined and minimized for all soil types. Additionally, if the weapon detonates underground next to a buried wall or structure or under a slab like a floor, sidewalk or runway; failure of that structure could result in additional damage or undesirable collateral effects.  Current analytic and weaponeering tools are unable to estimate these types of damage or undesirable side effects.  Successful completion of this project will result in an integrated approach to developing FRMs that can predict secondary debris due WBSD events.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Matrix Research, Inc. proposes to prototype, test, analyze, and demonstrate novel feature representations in multi-agent simultaneous localization and mapping (MA-SLAM) systems for enhanced navigation accuracy/reliability. The objective of this effort is to develop a framework to integrate data from various air and ground sensor systems employed for exploitation and interdiction tasks, focused on compact, multi-modal feature representations tailored for navigation applications in which low-bandwidth, low-rate communications between agents constrains data throughput. A layered sensing processing framework is needed that combines information, gleans meaning from the collected data, and re-tasks sensor-seekers in a timely manner to garner actionable intelligence and execute a course of action. This is only possible if the platforms have sufficient context and are able to jointly localize and coordinate. Initially, this effort will focus on multi-view descriptors for wide-baseline correspondence. Then it will demonstrate these methods for joint localization and coordination to accomplish an objective. Our thesis is that tightly coupled&quot;vision-based&quot;navigation will provide the necessary foundation, context, and features for MA-SLAM. We have two transition paths lined up to commercialize our results, both of which contribute to the AFRL mission. These will include both indoor and outdoor navigation demonstrations.  BENEFIT:  The primary benefit of successful completion of this effort is a revolutionary new capability for extracting features for mapping systems. This capability has numerous commercial applications in various business sectors such as defense, search and rescue, mapping, mining, and robotics.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The U.S. military has achieved unsurpassed air superiority in recent conflicts, a feat that is unlikely to continue as we face increasingly sophisticated adversaries.  Operating within an Anti-Access / Area Denial (A2AD) environment requires highly capable platforms that can coordinate to achieve a mission objective.  To support this vision, we will develop compact feature representations of scenes that enable multiplatform scene matching, geolocation, and mapping over bandwidth constrained data links.  Our approach is based on a statistical hierarchical framework that learns the representation directly from the observed data.  We will develop a both the statistical models and the corresponding algorithms for generating virtual maps from imagery, evaluate algorithm tradeoffs, and demonstrate real-time mapping and scene recognition from multiple agents.  We will evaluate both the accuracy in matching scenes and the computational complexity.  We will also evaluate the interpretability of the scene representations by humans to support human-in-the-loop control and processing.  BENEFIT:  The military is increasingly relying on autonomous agents to keep personnel safe while achieving critical missions.  Today, the military uses robots to detect and neutralize IEDs, and the Air Force is initiating research in autonomous weapons platforms.  The technology we are developing is directly aimed at supporting these missions.  In the near term, our technology is most applicable to mapping systems, for example, platforms that are mapping a region of interest.  It will also have commercial application to emergency search and rescue, remote exploration, and other robotic applications.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Infrared (IR) imaging and sensing is used extensively for military purposes. Evolving threats have motivated a drive toward sensor systems with multiple aperture and wide fields of view. As a result, there is a need to improve test capabilities for these new sensor systems. Large panoramic IR displays are required to fully test and develop new wide field of view IR sensors. IST is developing display technology that efficiently emits IR and can be scaled to very large sizes. This new display technology is based on Plasma-shells. Plasma-shells are hollow gas encapsulating devices. When the Plasma-shell device is energized the gas inside ignites into plasma. Proper selection of gas and shell material allows for efficient emission of light in ultraviolet, blue, green, red, or IR. The technology is suitable for both flat and conformable large area panoramic dome displays. Under this SBIR IST will focus on the challenge of large area geodesic dome displays emitting in the 8 -12 micron range using the Plasma-shell technology.  BENEFIT:  The proposed panoramic IR display technology is important to the military because it address a problem that previously was not solved. The proposed display will allow test and verification of wide field of view IR sensors in a realistic environment. Ultimately the technology can be expanded to multi-spectral test applications to allow testing of a full range of sensors simultaneously. Beyond military applications, the plasma based technology has commercial applications in digital billboards and signage. The proposed technology allows for large area multi color displays that are a fraction the cost of LED technology.",

Output generated by the MESM will be suitable for use with radar imaging techniques including synthetic aperture radar (SAR), inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR), and joint time-frequency analysis (JTFA). In Phase I, TSC developed an innovative method for predicting sub-millimeter wavelength radar signatures of ground targets including smooth and rough surfaces at sub-millimeter wavelengths, cavities, and surrounding terrain accurately and quickly. This signature modeling capability will enable the MESM to provide results with much faster execution than is possible using more traditional facet-based modeling approaches. TSC demonstrated excellent execution times, modeling accuracy, and modeling flexibility at sub-millimeter wavelengths for targets having smooth and rough surfaces. TSC also presented preliminary analysis of high frequency terrain backscatter data collected by the Air Force, which will be used in the MESM terrain model. In Phase II, TSC will fully develop the tool in C++ software and document the system from technical and user perspectives.

        "abstract": "Managing basis health needs in HA/DR and STTR operations is of  critical importance due to the increased risk of disease and health  crises stemming from ecological changes, population displacement,  population density changes, or the disruption of public utilities.  Despite the critical needs for rapid epidemiological surveillance,  assessment, and response in the field, very few technical aids exist  to support these efforts.  The objectives of our proposed AREA system  of handheld apps are: (1) To provide data collection that is rapid,  error free, properly directed and highly effective; (2) to provide  improved support for situational awareness, analysis and decision  making so that field users do not have to wait to analyze data and  take action; and (3) To consequently dramatically reduce delays  between data collection, analysis, decision making, and actual  disaster response.  To accomplish this, our technical approach  includes advanced in-app capabilities for data collection; machine  learning and social science based data analysis to identify health  risks, impending health crises, and to forecast disease progression;  and collaborative decision support tools for ad hoc team formation,  course of action analysis, and resource allocation.  Additionally,  accompanying visualizations help to facilitate greater situational  awareness and user comprehension.  We have a community of interested  users who are motivated to work with us in Phase II, and developed a  complete and effective strategy for rapidly transitioning the AREA  system to end users.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The DF &amp; NN team proposes to provide automated space weather (SpWx) attribution tools to characterize abnormal events detected at operational sites using the DF &amp; NN patented Enterprise Satellite-as-a-Sensor (E-SAS) system.  The DF &amp; NN Space Situational Awareness (SSA) fusion tools, Modern Technology Solutions Incorporated operational experience, Space Environment Technologies SpWx expertise, and Intelligent Software Solutions JSpOC Mission System (JMS) expertise provide the precise talents needed for this effort.  The project will develop JMS compatible SpWx attribution capabilities including visualization, integration, and validation tools at the Battlefield Evaluation Assessment SSA Testbed (BEAST), and selected E-SAS sites.  AFRL will direct the focus of the effort among the following main goals: deploy the data fusion tools in the BEAST and in E-SAS operational environments, enhance space weather drill-down visualization, validate tools on extended real data sets, add forecast capabilities to the SpWx attribution framework, integrate AFRL/RVB space weather sources and tools, provide GPS Signal-to-Noise Ratio scintillation attribution, deploy Wideband Global Services SpWx attribution at 3 SOPS, provide satellite damage assessments for DMSP, gather and fuse SpWx data from MDA&quot;s Space Tracking and Surveillance System spacecraft, assess SpWx impacts on satellite operational capabilities, and achieve TRL 5/6 for SpWx attribution on an operational system.  BENEFIT:  The competitive advantage of this Data Fusion &amp; Resource Management (DF &amp; RM)  ANOM technology is in its affordability derived from the data-driven pattern learning software, ability to automatically detect and characterize the unexpected abnormal signatures, and its extendibility/reusability derived from the Dual Node Network (DNN) DF &amp; RM technical architecture. The data-driven core of the DF &amp; NN ANOM software enables it to be easily applied to detect, recognize, and track abnormalities in any commercial or government system.  Operational prototypes of this capability are already operating on-line at to 2 satellite operations (SOPS) sites and these ANOM tools have been applied off-line to over 100 different large to enormous real data sets for over 200 combined years of data. DF &amp; NN has a pending patent on the ANOM technology and plans to commercialize ANOM to many DoD and commercial systems in collaboration with our Commercialization Pilot Program team member Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMC) for SOPS, cyber, Remotely Piloted Aircraft, and other LMC products). The space weather attribution, context assessment, and visualization tools delivered in this effort are extendable for characterization of fused multiple source tracks in all the above commercial applications.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Qunav proposes the development of GPS/INS/FeaTure-based SAR (GIFTS) navigation architecture in order to enable accurate navigation in GPS-challenged and GPS-denied environments. The architecture exploits INS as a core sensor and applies SAR measurements to mitigate inertial drift. Fusion of SAR and INS data is implemented at two levels. Data fusion at the level of signal processing derives information about inertial error states from SAR signal data (such as slow-time IQ samples). Data fusion at the measurement level utilizes local and global feature-aided inertial mechanizations. Local aiding applies changes in parameters of unknown features that are extracted from SAR images thus providing a completely self-contained solution that does not require any prior knowledge of mission environments. Global aiding uses geo-referenced landmarks for the INS error reset. Both local and global aiding are enhanced by integrity monitoring that removes SAR measurement outliers using INS-based feature tracking. The ultimate goal of Phase II is to demonstrate GPS-like performance using SAR/inertial mechanization in GPS-denied flight test environments. Phase II will fully develop all components of the GIFTS navigation mechanization. SAR and inertial experimental data will be applied to verify the system functionality and evalute its characteristics in a post-processing operational mode.  BENEFIT:  If successfully demonstrated, GIFTS has a significant potential for both DOD applications and commercial users. Numerous platforms (both military and civilian) that perform layered sensing using SARs will benefit from improved navigation robustness in GPS-challenged environments. GIFTS will provide a) precise reconstruction of the flight trajectory; and, b) accurate geo-registration of SAR images. In addition, the technology will enable a use of lower-cost inertial measurement units. This will provide a significant overall reduction in cost, weight, size and power consumption thus enabling the system&quot;s functionality on small-size platforms and creating new application cases for SAR sensors.    Commercialization for the DOD market will be based on collaboration with our subcontractor, Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems (NG ES). For technology transitioning, we envision insertion of the SAR/inertial navigation mechanization into NG ES existing and perspective embedded GPS/inertial (EGI) products. This will extend the product functionality envelope to include GPS-challenged and GPS-denied environments; and, will also lower the cost of inertial sensors. An ideal transition would include a technology spiral insertion designed to add new GIFTS capabilities to existing navigation systems.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Air Force needs a Remotely Operated Sensor, Beacon, and Navigation Aid system that can be dropped to a very precise location and provide a broad variety of information and intelligence from a denied territory in a deep Battlespace. This system has to provide real time information on the activities, weather, and dangers in the forward area, as well as, serve as a navigation beacon (or provide offset targeting) in GPS denied environments. In Phase I, McQ performed research to demonstrate conceptually a broad range of technologies for the AiR Dropped Remotely Operated Sensor System (ARDROSS).  As its name implies, ARDROSS is a beacon system and unattended ground sensor (UGS) capable of being precisely deployed via air drop in remote areas. The system will feature a modular design that allows the Air Force to deploy beaconing sensors capable of being configured to detect different targets for different missions and relay this information over a long haul communication (LHC) link to a user or backend server. The system will enable the Air Force special operating forces to understand the situation and the issues in a denied territory.  BENEFIT:  The ARDROSS can be seamlessly integrated with the OmniSense Common Operating Picture (COP) user interface technology developed under past SBIRs. McQ is supplying sensor technology and user display technology to many DOD, DOE, DHS, Counter Narcotics and Terrorism Program Office applications. These customers provide the opportunity to introduce the technology developed under this SBIR to a broad base of government customers. These opportunities will generate revenue both from the improved information fusion implementation but also from the sale of additional systems.",

        "abstract": "We will continue developing a plasmonic metamaterial with strong absorption within a narrow band that is dynamically tunable over the 8-10 micron range.  A metamaterial consisting of one or more bi-layers of thin metal and dielectric films will trap, concentrate and absorb a narrow frequency band while strongly reflecting out-of-band light. Tuning the frequency of the absorption band may be achieved either by MEMS actuation to change geometry, or by carrier density modulation to change the refractive index of semiconductor layers. The metamaterial may be fabricated with standard lithography techniques and processes that are compatible with microbolometer manufacturing. We believe that this plasmonic perfect absorber approach offers considerable advantages over a coupled split-ring and cut wire approach that is being pursued by other groups, because the material losses in real metals will always broaden out a resonance that relies on current loops in metals.  By completion of Phase II, we will have evaluated a fully integrated plasmonic absorber microbolometer system for detecting chemical and biological agents.",

The goal of this program is to eliminate the need to carry extra barrels and change them in combat. The ideal barrel would consist of a high temperature alloy with a strongly-bonded, erosion-resistant liner.

In Phase I, TPL demonstrated the ability to adapt its Barrel Armor technology to small caliber gun barrelsa clad M240 barrel was made and test fired. In Phase II, TPL will extend this technology to explosively weld refractory liners to high temperature alloys. The refractory liners are not only erosion resistant to reduce bore wear; they also help to insulate the barrel from heat. Even so, alloys with higher temperature capabilities than steel will be used as the primary barrel material, and TPL&quot;s cladding technology will permanently bond the liner to the barrel. Prototype barrel blanks will be made and machined into ready-to-fire machinegun barrels. The prototypes will be subjected to live firing tests to demonstrate their increased abilities over currently fielded machinegun barrels.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The objective of this program is to tailor and focus the capabilities of an existing software package for prediction of the rapid transient events following ignition of rocket-propelled munitions, as well as the firing of small caliber weapons. These events differ from missile plumes in that they are very fast transient events occurring at the time of weapon firing. These events are critical because they provide the first, and often the most intense detectable signal that a weapon has been fired. The aim of this work is to predict the flow-field external to these devices in sufficient detail to allow the accurate prediction of the electro-optical signature of the devices via post-processing the flow-field simulation results for integration with a radiative transfer model. This will be accomplished by upgrades and adaptation to existing software tool, and extensive validation of the software to determine the optimum numerical modeling approach, including chemical reaction mechanisms required for small caliber ammunition firing and rocket-propelled grenades. The approach will also encompass tracer bullets.  BENEFIT:  The Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) Advanced Missile Signature Center (AMSC) in support of the Center for Countermeasures (CCM) is developing a Hostile Fire Signature (HSIG) model to simulate dynamic EO signatures of small caliber weapons and rocket-propelled munitions. The HSIG program&quot;s need is to develop a physics-based computer model to produce EO signatures for muzzle flash from small caliber weapons and rocket propelled grenades (RPG) among other weapon types. The software developed in this program will provide the necessary model. Beyond the specific application to the HSIG program the software has significant potential application in numerous DoD and industrial programs that involve missiles, rockets and other space vehicles plumes and associated signatures.",

Previously, HYPRES built, delivered to US Army CERDEC, and demonstrated an advanced digital-RF receiver for military satellite communications (MILSATCOM X and Ka bands).  This was built around a custom bandpass superconducting analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that samples at 30 GigaSamples/s. The present project focuses on the development of an RF digital-to-analog converter (RF-DAC) for the corresponding digital-RF transmitter, that handles at least 1 GHz instantaneous bandwidth with an 8 GHz carrier (X-band).   This will be implemented using state-of-the-art SiGe BiCMOS chips that can sample at rates of 30 GS/s and above.

MACE will be used to drive and control the Raytheon Stirling / Pulse Tube Two-Stage (RSP2) Cryocooler.  The RSP2 is of great interest to the Department of Defense because it is the only spaceflight cryocooler available that can provide appreciable refrigeration (&gt;400 mW) at 10K.    MACE is unique from other cryocooler electronics in that it is architected to support a wide range of cryocoolers.  In addition to driving and controlling the above-described 10K cryocooler from Raytheon, MACE is equally applicable to the 35K Raytheon variant of RSP2.  With straightforward changes to the control firmware, MACE also supports comparably sized cryocoolers from other vendors.    BENEFIT:  The immediate benefit to USAF and the Department of Defense is that MACE will be the first spaceflight design cryocooler electronics for the Raytheon RSP2 Cryocooler, which is the best performing 10K Cryocooler available.  This program will yield a high fidelity brassboard with a part-for-part upgrade path to a spaceflight design, greatly reducing the risk for technology insertion.  More generally, MACE will provide the space cryocooler user community with a control electronics platform that can support virtually any cryocooler need.  MACE&quot;s 600W drive capacity envelopes the practical power range of interest.  MACE provides simultaneous temperature, vibration, and piston position control.

MDA has identified several technology needs for meeting the next generation requirements.  One of the technology needs is a higher performing Nosecone.  To address that need, San Diego Composites, Inc. (SDC) is proposing a program to use industry-available composite materials to develop a reduced weight and lower cost clamshell composite Nosecone.  The goal is to achieve a Technology and Manufacturing Readiness Level (TRL/MRL) 6 by the end of a Phase II program and to transfer the technology to the Prime Contractors for evaluation during the Production Development phase of the SM3 Blk 2B program.",

Without mitigation of these effects, there is no doubt that the natural ionosphere is a major issue in the performance of the important radar functions (detection, track, classification, intercept support) of the Thule Upgraded Early Warning radar (UEWR).  This work will develop signal processing techniques to mitigate the effects of the perturbed polar region ionosphere on the radar track function.  This will be accomplished through the development and application of a high fidelity desktop simulation that includes the combined effects of both large and small scale ionospheric structures.  These efforts will be rooted in real-world data, namely that taken as part of the MDA Ionospheric Data Collection (IDC) program and also polar region measurements of total electron content using two-frequency (Transit) satellite beacon data observed at a receiver stationed near Thule.",

Competing wireless services, self-protection electronic countermeasures (CREW), and hostile jamming can saturate the spectrum and impair essential communications. Adaptive Dynamics, Inc. has developed the novel Multiple Adaptive Generalized Interference Cancellation (MAGICTM) filter, which has demonstrated remarkable performance for protecting narrowband UHF communications by separating out multiple overpowering interfering signals while preserving the desired communications signal. This technique has been further developed and demonstrated with high fidelity simulations to be effective when applied to wideband waveforms, potentially mitigating interference levels in excess of 80dB above the desired signal. In the proposed work, Adaptive Dynamics will develop enhancements to the MAGICTM filter applicable to the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW), optimize the algorithm as a VHDL core for insertion into the baseband processing chain of an ITT Exelis Soldier Radio-Rifleman (SR-R), and perform field testing in a tactical electro-magnetic interference (EMI) environment.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  A compact night vision imaging technology will be developed that responds in the visible through the short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) and medium-wavelength infrared (MWIR) spectral range from 0.4 to 5\u00b5m wavelengths. The detectors are made using low cost deposition techniques, at atmosphere, using CMOS readout integrated circuits (ROICs). The imager does not require bump bond hybridization and is compatible with 5\u00b5m and smaller pixel pitches.  In this effort SWIR sensitive nanocrystal quantum dot (NQD) films will be formed on an existing low noise 1k x 1k format CMOS ROIC, and its spectral responsivity, detectivity, lag and other optical performance metrics will be characterized. The ability to manufacture the nanocrystals at high volumes (kg/hour), at a cost only slightly above the chemical constituents, and to print the films at atmosphere, will also be demonstrated. We will demonstrate that the innovation can be scaled to larger format arrays (e.g., 4k x 4k and larger) and to small pixel sizes (&lt;4\u00b5m). We will also demonstrate the ability to print vertical and mosaicked multi-spectral image and active/passive sensors.  BENEFIT:  The technology will benefit a wide variety of other military electro optical applications, including head mounted night vision imaging, missile seekers, and fire control systems. Commercial applications include surveillance imaging, cell phone camera, multi-spectral imaging, machine vision, industrial inspection, and others.  This technology is significant in that we have reduced the cost of a finished focal plane array (FPA) from tens of thousands of dollars per wafer to tens of dollars, making FPA development highly affordable. Facile solution processing of NQD solid imagers also allows the potential for detector developments to proceed rapidly, reducing design cycle times from the multiple months required of bulk semiconductors to just a few days. Furthermore, solution processing also enables combinatorial detector material development. We have automated the NQD fabrication synthesis and deposition process, which makes material discovery, optimization, and development proceed rapidly  tens of new materials can be made in a day.",

Such hair cells have the ability to yield information on local flow fields before those flows produce inertial effects on a vehicle.  Our university partners are leading experts in how insects fly, and have reverse-engineered the nervous systems of insects to understand how vision and hair sensors are used together to enable flight control and stability. Aurora and its partners are already collaborating on research into insect-based visual guidance concepts.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  It is widely recognized that near surface residual stresses play a significant role in fatigue performance. Tensile residual stresses are of concern because they accelerate fatigue crack initiation and fatigue crack growth relative to what would occur in the absence of residual stress. Compressive residual stresses, on the other hand, have the opposite effect and can be used to improve fatigue performance. To effectively understand and predict residual stress effects on fatigue durability or crack initiation, which accounts for the majority of the total component life under high-cycle applications, accurate and reliable residual stress data are required in the near-surface region. The proposed work plan will develop improvements to a novel near-surface residual stress measurement technique, will demonstrate the effectiveness of this measurement technique under representative conditions, and will develop technology to implement the measurement.  BENEFIT:  The proposed residual stress measurement method is a significant improvement to existing residual stress measurement technology and will fill a critical gap in capability for near-surface residual stress measurement, enabling high-quality measurements in the near-surface regime under conditions typical of the aerospace industry. This technology is important to many industries (e.g., aerospace, transportation, utilities, etc). Current design methods are evolving to include residual stress effects and these methods benefit from high quality residual stress data.",

The FPE will provide the long-lasting, low friction, impact-resistant, abrasion resistant and hydrophobic properties required and will also provide hydraulic fluid resistance and reduced drag during wet snow conditions. Enhancements of the FPE material solution have also been demonstrated by the unique hybridization of the FPE materials with specially formulated thermoset materials. The material properties will be evaluated over a wide temperature range (-50aC to 25aC). Resodyn Corporations proprietary Polymer Thermal Spray (PTS) technology and prior experience with thermoplastic and thermoset polymer coatings, specifically hydrophobic coatings, will enable delivery of a successful solution.    The complete ski coating process for the LC-130 main and nose skis will be developed including equipment and processes.  Coating repair equipment and procedures will be developed that allow on-site spot repairs that are 100% compatible with the original coating.    BENEFIT:  The LC-130 Hercules is part of a low volume-high demand inventory that can not tolerate a high frequency ski maintenance requirement. The proposed technology provides a durable and functioning coating that, if needed, can be quickly repaired in the field or at the depot with minimum interference to the aircraft operations. The tough, low friction, low drag property attributes of the coating and the unique polymer thermal spray application characteristics allows this technology to be applied to a wide range of military and industrial problems.

These challenges do not allow time for deliberation and evaluation; in fact, the ability to make quick and accurate decisions in these situations is often cited by Warfighters as key to survival. This ability is called intuition. While it has been recognized that intuitive decision making is essential for battlefield success, there are no existing training applications for improving such skills in Warfighters. There are, however, key insights from the educational and neuroscience literature that suggest how to approach the task of training intuition. Accordingly, Aptima proposes to develop immersive scenario-based training that will improve Warfighter intuition skills by: (1) presenting Warfighters with necessary opportunities to discover the underlying principles of the problem/challenge, as well as (2) providing Warfighters with strategically-scheduled feedback on relevant contextual and environmental cues that influence expert intuition. This training will enable novices to: (1) comprehend and store underlying principles more quickly and efficiently, the way experts do, (2) reduce their dependence on the surface features and rule-based problem solving, and (3) improve their intuition so that it leads to correct solutions.",

        "abstract": "Concern has been raised over the prevalence of behavioral health disorders in military personnel returning from deployment to the Middle East.  While not appearing as an overt physical injury, disruptions of a psychological nature are often as debilitating, and there is an increasing need for support tools.  Such tools should allow for standardized tracking, monitoring, and mitigation of anger and stress outside of face-to-face treatment, and enhance the overall treatment plan for individuals struggling with psychological health issues. To meet this need, Design Interactive proposes further development and evaluation of the prototype Mobile Stress and Anger management Tool (MSAT), a CBT treatment support suite that links providers and patients in a way that they never have before.  The tool meets the most critical needs of patients by providing real-time mobile support when anger/stress triggers are encountered during their day to day life by continuously tracking their stress/anger levels with physiological sensors.  An integrated provider portal provides powerful information to support practitioners in what they have deemed their most difficult task in CBT, determining the patterns that trigger anger and stress in patients.  Expansions include an upgraded, unobtrusive physiological sensor suite, real-time biofeedback, and additional mitigation and training strategies among others.",

The IMHOS is based on a POC-developed high-contrast Compton imaging tomography technique, optimized for NDI of these structures, and POC-patented X-ray imaging optics. The IMHOS is a low-dose, in-field, noncontact system requiring access to structures for inspection from only one side. In Phase I, POC successfully demonstrated the feasibility of IMHOS in experiments using the benchtop prototype in POC&quot;s X-ray lab, on honeycomb sandwich samples with imitation defects, disbonds, and liquid intrusions. In Phase II, POC will develop and test a fully functional (TRL-6) IMHOS system, demonstrating accurate detection, precise spatial localization, and measurements of disbonds and different skin and core defects of large metal and nonmetal honeycomb sandwich structures of varied geometric forms; detection of liquid intrusions; and differentiation of the type of liquid (fresh and salt water, oil, other organic liquids).  BENEFIT:  Military applications of the IMHOS system will include in situ in-field automatic NDI of large aircraft honeycomb sandwich structures for accurate identification, localization, and measurements of disbonds, skin and core defects, and liquid intrusions, including identification of the detected liquid (e.g., fresh and salt water, oil) during aircraft depot maintenance, or in-field. The IMHOS system can be incorporated by the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Army and for reliable, rapid, automatic, easy-to-use NDI of large honeycomb sandwich structures used in aircraft and other military platforms. With minor modification, the IMHOS system can also be used for NDI of parts containing light, heterogeneous, materials (e.g., explosives, adhesives, electronic components, composites, plastics). An expansion of most of the techniques developed under IMHOS in Phase II can transition to commercial applications for NDI of large honeycomb sandwich structures, and also multilayer aluminum/composite structures with complex geometries in civilian aircraft, spacecraft, light vessels, etc. With further minor modifications, the IMHOS system can also be used for detection of hidden objects inside airframe cavities in fuselages, wings, etc.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The annual cost of corrosion for Air Force aircraft and missiles is estimated to $5.4 billion with corrosion accounting for 32.2% of the maintenance budget.  Military performance requirements for materials qualification often rely on pass/fail measurements of flat panels exposed in continuous salt fog tests.  It is well know that corrosion protection systems and alloys may fail due to other corrosion processes associated with localized corrosion, galvanic couples, and mechanical loading which may not be evaluated using current practices.  Although advances have been made in the development of more representative accelerated corrosion tests, similar advancements in the test coupon design and instrumentation have not been realized.  Luna is developing a smart test coupon (STC) that incorporates multimodal measurements using affordable, advanced sensors, and monitoring techniques to improve materials evaluation in accelerated laboratory corrosion and service environment testing.  The STC system continuously monitors environmental parameters, corrosion, coating performance, and material residual strength throughout a corrosion test.  The STC system will support coating and materials technology assessment and demonstration.  BENEFIT:  The smart test coupon (STC) technology offers a unique capability that presently does not exist.  The STC technology enhances existing coupon test methods by adding existing and novel corrosion sensing technologies to achieve a powerful investigative tool.  The ability to assess the impact of coatings and inhibitors on the kinetics and cumulative damage of a wide array of corrosion processes will improve both development and qualification activities.  This will be important to researchers and users of industrial finishes for aerospace, automotive, marine, and infrastructure applications.  Significant societal benefits will be realized through more rapid and safe adoption of environmentally compliant coating systems.  The primary market for the system will be research organizations and test laboratories that perform materials development and qualification testing.  The system will also be useful for development of accelerated test methods, surveying usage environments, and validating sensor technologies for in-service monitoring.",

        "abstract": "For a selected vehicle and jet engine configuration, fuel consumption is to a significant degree dictated by the thermal efficiency of the engine. Achieving optimal thermal efficiency and minimizing fuel consumption require high temperature operation with minimum cooling of hot gas path components, including combustors, high-pressure turbine blades, and inlet nozzle (stator) vanes. In parallel, cost reduction and reliability enhancements can be achieved by minimizing system complexity, in part by eliminating or minimizing cooling and by eliminating the need for thermal barrier coatings. Currently, actively cooled superalloy turbine blades and vanes are constrained to a peak operating environment temperature of ~3000F. Successful implementation of cost-effective and reliable materials and processes with the capability for non-actively cooled operation to 3500F would result in dramatic gains in jet engine efficiency. Gains to date have in large part been achieved by evolutionary improvements in turbine blade alloys, thermal barriers, and cooling gas path designs. Anticipated gains from the use of ceramics and ceramic matrix composites (CMC) have been slow to accrue. This project is pursuing revolutionary improvements in materials and processing capabilities via the application of innovative fiber interfaces and melt infiltration processing and proven oxidation protection coatings to produce a durable and cost-effective carbon fiber-reinforced metal matrix composite (Cf/MMC) with mechanical properties and environmental resistance suited to cyclic and long-duration operation at turbine inlet temperatures to 3500F within the jet engine environment. In the Phase I base effort, conceptual design of representative composite hardware was performed; preliminary goals were identified for thermal, chemical, and mechanical properties of key turbine subcomponents; ultrahigh temperature metal matrix infiltration was successfully achieved; and test coupons were characterized. Subcomponent-scale fabrication demonstrators have been produced, and subcomponent test articles are being fabricated for testing in the Phase I option. Cumulatively, the Phase I results provide a promising demonstration of feasibility. In the Phase II base effort, a representative component demonstration will be performed followed by a cost-effective combustion environment component demonstration in the Phase II option, providing an early path to opportunities for future implementation of the technology. Project emphasis is on demonstration of turbine components, but the developed technology would also be applicable to applications for other hot section components including combustors.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:   A new knowledge-based approach is proposed to mitigate the corrosion of metallic surfaces.  The approach is based on the rational design of molecular coating materials based on a new class of phthalocyanines.  While these materials resemble fluorinated polymers in their capacity to prevent the intrusion of moisture associated waterborne ions and the diffusion of oxygen to the metallic surface, they also exhibit additional beneficial properties unavailable to fluorinated polymers.  Characteristically, all residual C-H bonds of classical phthalocyanines are replaced by C-F bonds via the inclusion of perfluoroalkyl groups insuring a high thermal and chemical stability of the materials.  The molecules are designed to bind metal ions.  The combination of metal ions and the extremely electron withdrawing perfluoroalkyl groups results in the suppression of oxidation (electron loss) and adhesion to metal surfaces via the formation of bonds between the metal center of the proposed molecules and the oxo groups (precursors to rust) present on metal surface exposed to the environment.  Taken together the above features insure water repelling (high hydrophobicity) as well as electrochemical suppression of the deleterious effects of oxygen.  In addition the coatings resist acids (acid rain) and other harsh chemicals due to the exclusive presence of C-F bonds.  BENEFIT:   An added feature is the facile manipulation of molecular structures aimed at introducing intermolecular interactions via  stacking that will enhance the cohesion of films and possibly their adhesion to metallic surfaces.  A wide battery of solutions and solid-state experimental techniques will provide insights at both molecular and solid state (film) level, while additional tests to be performed in collaboration with the corrosion group at the US Army Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ will reveal corrosion important prop-erties such as surface energy (hydrophobicity).    The experimental effort will be supported by a detailed computational analysis.   The target molecules will be investigated using computational chemistry methods designed to complement the experimental results and to predict properties that will enhance the corrosion resistance of these materials.  At a molecular level, several properties have been recognized in the corrosion literature as contributing to overall stability of molecules:  1) electron density distribution and atomic charge; 2) energy of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals;  3) per-manent dipole moment and polarizability; and 4) total (internal, potential and kinetic) energy.  Inasmuch as the target materials represent a new class of corrosion inhibitors, computational methods will be used to probe specific properties of the fluorinated phthalocyanines.  As these phthalocyanine materials will be applied as surface coatings on solid materials, their bulk and thin film properties will be examined by classical molecular dynamics.  The synergistic interactions between theory and experiment will insure a solid scientific base for the proposed explorato-ry development of a new type of corrosion resistant coating, as well as for future optimization and development efforts.    Porter Scientific Incorporated (PSI) is a North Carolina based American Indian woman owned 8(a) HUBZone small business with a distinguished award winning track record of providing environmental consulting services, and of supporting research and development.  PSI also provides information technology and facility support services to a variety of clients including the United States Departments of Defense and Transportation, the Environmental Protec-tion Agency (EPA), national commercial entities and local governments and municipalities.     Anticipated Benefits:   Protection of metallic surfaces is an ongoing economic burden and impairs service delivery in military and commercial environments.  For aerospace and infrastructure applications, this project engages exploratory devel-opment of a corrosion resistant coating that will substantially reduce the military systems annual direct cost of cor-rosion which is presently estimated at $20 billion.  The corrosion resistant coating will have substantial national de-fense relevance in reducing equipment downtime (during corrosion repair); increasing military readiness; improving equipment and systems integrity while potentially saving lives.  The feasibility and potential impact of the proposed coatings are substantial.     Potential Commercial Applications:   A corrosion resistant coating represents incredible opportunities to expand product life and reduce industry cost in maintenance, repair and replacement.   Applications include the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the transportation we utilize, the recreation activities we engage in, and the utensils we use while dining.  The commer-cialization of a polymer that extends the half-life of mineral based devices maximizes limited resources of our planet.   Product manufacturers improve service delivery by providing consumers with goods that require less direct and indi-rect cost of implementation.  The global economy benefits when resources currently used for product sustainability can be directed to other solutions, innovations or efforts.   The corrosion resistant coating will spawn opportunities throughout all forces in the Department of Defense.  Additionally, the insoluble polymer has the potential for cookware, gaskets, bearings, electrical insulators, recreational and commercial nautical and air transport systems.  From cruise ships to lawn chairs to buffet serving utensils - any dimension of user life that includes corrosion of surfaces may be dramatically impacted by expanding life of actual utilities while reducing industry cost in maintenance, repair and product replacement.

        "abstract": "Current Mine Countermeasure (MCM) operations attempt to balance risk and time via processes that are staff and time intensive. The range of experience in the MCM staff further complicates these processes. Existing tools such as MEDAL provide some support to address these issues, but those tools lack a comprehensive coverage of the process; in particular, there is no direct replanning support. Additionally, the tools do not help the inexperienced staff understand and deal with various situations. Existing tools are mostly passive, representing data, but not interpreting it, leaving issues of issue detection, option generation, and option evaluation entirely up to the staff. The Navy is interested in exploring whether cognitive architectures can help address these issues. Recent years have seen increased development of cognitive architectures, which are ideal platforms for encoding expert knowledge and interacting with users. TRUFAST (Transparent Reasoning under Uncertainty for Antimine Systems in real-Time) leverages mixed-initiative interaction, human-behavior models, explanation, and adaptation using episodic memory in order to perform its issue detection, option generation, and option evaluation functions.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This proposal outlines a scalable, low-cost procedure for fabrication of hierarchical hybrid nanomaterials that produce ultra-high pressure tolerance and surface area vessels. These vessels enable physical storage of hydrogen through compression and adsorption at densities predicted to exceed DOE 2015 requirements by 65% and 98% for volumetric and gravimetric standards. In Phase I Mainstream exceeded DoEs 2015 gravimetric requirement by 2-fold and achieved 75% of DoEs 2015 target value for volumetric storage. The hybrid nanomaterial is composed of a moderate strength structure with tunable orientation, surface area and volume. It is additionally included with high strength material to enhance vessel pressure tolerance and hydrogen physisorption without loss of volumetric storage. Furthermore, the novel storage medium comprises a safe technology that would gain immediate market penetration in the area of hydrogen storage, transportation and delivery.  Phase II will demonstrate this technology as well as demonstrate system storage densities in excess of 100 g-hydrogen/L-system and 12% g-hydrogen/g-system; well beyond DoEs 2015 targets.

A scale-up production plan, market study and market penetration points will be completed by the end of Phase II.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Avolare2 proposes to establish a 90nm metal source/drain&quot;Schottky&quot;CMOS process at Cypress Semiconductor&quot;s high volume manufacturing facility in Bloomington, MN.  Schottky CMOS will have a profound impact on the performance and reliability of most of the integrated circuits (ICs) providing critical functionality for electronic systems operating in high radiation environments. The Schottky process flow will be based on an existing conventional 90nm process already in production at Cypress. Development of high-performance digital and mixed-signal components by the design community will allow for greater levels of machine-intelligence in spacecraft, aircraft, and missile applications. Schottky CMOS is 100% compatible with current CMOS process equipment and requires fewer process steps, providing military IC suppliers with a convenient path to upgrade existing fabrication lines and offer ICs with latch-up and single event upset (SEU) immunity at faster speeds and lower power consumption. The Schottky transistor&quot;s performance and SEU immunity benefits are expected to become even more pronounced at advanced linewidths (45nm and below), ushering in a new era of component innovation for military and commercial systems alike, accelerating adoption by commercial IC foundries and enabling the development of novel computing, communication, and consumer electronic products.  BENEFIT:  Space-based systems and avionics applications require highly integrated, cost-effective, state-of-the-art integrated circuits (ICs) capable of withstanding harsh radiation laden environments.  Scaling conventional semiconductor transistors from 2000 nm to 150 nm provides the IC with speed-power-cost benefits, but the traditional transistor becomes more susceptible to radiation effects at smaller geometries.

This capability directly addresses the PEO Combat Support &amp; Combat Service Support requirements including decreased time for repair (MTTR).  In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of four SASHA design concepts (variants) via finite element analysis and moment loading and blast (shock) testing of four (4) functional SASHA applique fastener prototypes fabricated to support demonstration efforts at TARDEC.  POC also developed a relationship with a commercial armor partner to conduct further testing in Phase II.  In Phase II, POC plans to fully design, develop, and fabricate two SASHA concepts (variants) and integrate them with deployed armor systems for installation on representative light tactical vehicles.  Structural, environmental, and blast testing will be performed to validate the SASHA system at TRL-6.",

The Vescent EO scanner provides previously unrealizable performance such as sub-millisecond scanning, high resolution (sub microradian) refractive scanning, full 2-D operation with only three control electrodes, and a remarkably wide field of view (270 degrees demonstrated). The focus of this SBIR program is to mature and transition this EO scanner technology for a wide array of Navy and DoD needs. Specific goals include the development of new manufacturing processes that reliably produce high throughput (>80%), low beam distortion (M2 < 1.5), low cost, wide-angle (>50 x 15 degrees), and low SWaP scanners. In phase I we xperimentally validated new manufacturing processes for high yield production of devices with the required performance attributes.

        "abstract": "The parasite Plasmodium vivax, transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito, is the second major cause of malaria worldwide. Research focusing on P. vivax has been hindered by lack of a practical continuous culture system as the parasite preferentially invades young erythrocytes (reticulocytes), which are difficult to obtain routinely and in high enough numbers. To address this critical need, ChromoLogic, LLC  proposed and developed genetically engineered cells bearing the features of artificial reticulocytes (ArtRet) so as to provide the Army with surrogate cells that are capable of being invaded by the P. vivax malaria and ensure long term culturing of the parasite. The ArtRet prototype system was able to combine the construction and production of lentiviral vectors with transduction of four different erythroleukemic cell lines for delivery of certain genes that confers phenotypes that render them more desirable for invasion and growth of the parasite. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of cells based on reporter gene expression allowed enrichment of transduced populations. Thus this proof-of-concept has demonstrated success criteria in the feasibility of producing log9 to log10 surrogate host cells capable of continuous and consistent self-renewal and bearing essential phenotypes that allow cost-effective maintenance of the blood-stage P. vivax parasite in culture.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This Small Business Innovative Research Phase II project will develop and manufacture an active anti-ice system for use on remotely piloted aircraft (RPA). Seashell proposes to design, fabricate, and characterize an anti-ice system based on an electrothermal system that will be light weight, low power, and able to be retrofitted to existing RPA. Seashell will meet the weight, power, and retrofitting criteria by utilizing a high performance heating element and Seashell&quot;s proprietary icephobic coating. The enhanced heating element will provide superior thermal conductivity and mechanical properties while lowering the overall film weight when compared to existing technology. The icephobic coating will make the system more robust to environmental icing conditions and lower the power consumption by making the removal of ice and water from the surface more efficient. The system will be tested over a wide range of icing conditions in a commercial icing research tunnel to ensure anti-icing performance.  BENEFIT:  Anticipated Benefit:  As the use of remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) continues to grow the need for an anti icing system to extend the environmental conditions in which they operate is becoming increasingly important. The lack of anti-icing equipment on RPAs limits the use of these aircraft when environmental conditions indicate a high probability for an icing hazard. In general, RPA launches can only be made after specific environmental conditions are met that minimize icing risk. These environmental launch specifications cause unwanted delays and expense due to grounded aircraft. Designing an anti-ice system that can be retrofitted to an existing RPA will eliminate environmental launch requirements and provide both economic and productivity improvements to the military and commercial RPA users.    Potential Commercial Applications:  Outside of military use, the anti-ice system will be applicable for use on small planes. Most small planes in use today do not have an anti-ice system installed limiting their use to environmental conditions where icing is not a concern. Seashell&quot;s proposed anti-ice system will be superior to other anti-ice systems on the market by providing a solution that is more robust to icing, lower weight, more environmentally friendly (no glycol fluids), and without extensive modification for retrofitting to the aircraft.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Powder-bed based additive manufacturing (AM) technologies typically involve rapid solidification after a laser or electron beam melts a region of powder. Although parameters can be optimized for lowest cost, highest precision, or optimum microstructure, these optimizations require trade-offs between scan rate, layer thickness, bed heating, and use of support materials. The University of Louisville&quot;s (U of L) Dislocation Density based Crystal Plasticity Finite Element Method (DDCP-FEM) enhanced in Phase I for Ti64 materials to predict local and global strengths, grain morphologies, and other layer-by-layer interfacial characteristics will be enhanced for Co-Cr including a detailed Design of Experiments, and developed support structure optimization. By coupling this model with a selective laser melting (SLM) process development cell, constructed at Mound Laser &amp; Photonics Center (MLPC), parameters determined by the software will be experimentally tested, validated, and used for input in the iterative model. Upon validation between model and development cell, an OEM selected component will be fabricated using a commercial SLM station at U of L. Scientific Simulation Systems (S^3) will port the Phase II model to a high performance computing system in addition to programming a usable interface to facilitate commercialization transition.  BENEFIT:  Due to the lengthy development time and cost found in current direct digital manufacturing (DDM) technologies, the proposed work would provide savings in cost and time for fabricating complex components from a digital design. Commercial propulsion and airframe applications stand to greatly benefit from improved DDM especially by the elimination of tooling, dies, and casting molds. The time savings for engineering development in the form of rapid prototyping of designs as well as complex geometries that do not lend themselves to conventional machining techniques would greatly benefit both commercial and military applications. With the addition of a high performance computing system, the modeling process will be real-time during fabrication of components.",

It is well established that lower-limb amputees show greater metabolic demands during gait and more limited mobility compared to non-disabled individuals. Currently, there is no lower-extremity prosthesis available that can monitor the metabolic costs of the amputee. The proposed solution, code-named TEQUILA (Total Energy expenditure QUantification In Lower limb Amputees), will provide an accurate, low-profile, and convenient metabolic energy expenditure (EE) and physical activity (PA) intensity level monitor that is compatible with both transtibial and transfemoral prostheses. The TEQUILA system will also provide real-time user feedback via a wireless handheld touchscreen device; analytic software will provide more extensive details regarding EE and PA intensity levels obtained via long-term monitoring. Such feedback will be helpful to the user, for example, to establish daily activity goals and progress towards meeting them during and following rehabilitation, as well as provide a means of metabolic and kinematic data sharing with healthcare personnel (e.g., for use in assessing both physical and mental health). Furthermore, unlike traditional activity monitors that must be separately donned, the TEQUILA system will always be with the amputee, collecting EE and PA intensity level data whenever the prosthesis is worn.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  We have investigated different strategies for removing the surface porosity from out-of-autoclave (OOA) composites.   It was found that a release layer on the aluminum tool with a microstructure similar to that of woven Teflon release plies was effective at reducing the porosity.  These structures allow trapped gases to escape during curing, so that they do not generate bubbles/pores in the laminate.  Initial work yielded a decrease in porosity from 3% to 1%.  A new technology has been demonstrated for rapidly coating the Al tooling with a microstructured release layer.  During phase II, the topography, adhesion, durability, and surface energy of the coating will be optimized such that smooth, porosity-free OOA composites may be produced reliably and at low cost.  This project will solve a long standing problem with out-of-autoclave composites that will lead to their rapid adoption throughout the aerospace industry.  BENEFIT:  An exciting new technology will be developed for producing out-of-autoclave structural composites with smooth surface finishes. This method will enable the adoption of OOA composites for a wide range of commercial and military applications.  The new process greatly reduces the time and cost to manufacture OOA materials.  In addition to aerospace applications, this technology can be adapted to other industries, including renewable energy, automotive, and consumer electronics.  The phase II project proposed herein aligns well with the government&#039;s Open Manufacturing initiative, since it will dramatically reduce the expense of acquiring future warfighter systems.",

Micro tube thermal energy storage devices were shown to significantly reduce the power requirements of a radiator-cooled thermal management system bya factor of 10-20, but at the cost of weight. Micro tube TES devices reduced the power consumption (factor of 3 to 7) and weight (10% to 47%) of VCS-cooled systems. Mezzo considered several configurations for the TMS systems but determined that a split system with the low temperature components cooled by a vapor compression system and the high temperature components cooled by a radiator system was the most efficient.

Second, sources of magnetic noise such as the motor are close to the sensors and have the potential to overwhelm the sensors. Third, existing UAVs are built using magnetic materials that can degrade the performance of the magnetometers.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Computational electromagnetics and inverse methods are the foundations of modern methods of eddy-current nondestructive evaluation (NDE). In this project, we apply these methods to the problem of characterizing, in three dimensions, damage in complex aircraft structures.  As the maintenance of the structural components of aircraft moves from time-based maintenance to condition-based maintenance, there is a need to completely characterize damage in structural components made from such disparate materials as aluminum, titanium and steel alloys, and carbon-fiber reinforced polymers (cfrp), such as graphite-epoxy composites.  Further, the structural environments can be quite complex, including compound curvatures and/or multiple layers that are fastened together, with potential damage being located in each of the multiple layers.  The methods developed in this project will address all of these issues, and will be applicable to the nuclear power industry, as well as civil infrastructures and materials characterization.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Composite materials are becoming more prevalent on military aircraft such as the F-22, F/A-18E/F/G, and the F-35 Lightning Joint Strike Fighter.  Polyimide carbon fiber composites offer performance benefits and tremendous operational cost savings for the DoD due to their superior strength-to-weight ratio when compared to titanium.  To take full advantage of the weight savings of polyimide composites, a full understanding of the reaction kinetics, volatile removal, and viscosity profile for both the polyimide condensation reaction and addition crosslinking polymerization is required.    The objective of this Phase II SBIR effort will be to advance the processing science for MVK-14 FreeForm carbon fiber composites resulting in a robust manufacturing process of components for transition into DoD platforms.  Maverick will focus efforts on MVK-14 FreeForm as the polyimide resin system based on its processing ease, affordability, high-performance thermal oxidative stability at temperatures between 500F to 550F, and dual use capability for turbine engine components.  A thorough characterization of the material will lead to computational models for the kinetics and viscosity profiles.  Dielectric sensors will be used to correlate the viscosity models with autoclave processing parameters.  This will result in a robust process for the fabrication of complex MVK-14 FreeForm carbon fiber composite components.      BENEFIT:  A robust, thick-part cure cycle that has been validated with analytical data, testing, and process modeling will significantly increase the use of polyimide composites in military aircraft as well as in commercial markets that need to reduce fuel consumption.  A successful research effort would result in a complete set of processing instructions for MVK-14 FreeForm carbon fiber prepreg that could be used by high-temperature part fabricators.  The increase in manufacturing capability for this material would allow designers at aerospace companies to use more polyimide matrix composites in their applications, thus reducing weight and increasing efficiency for both DoD and commercial applications.  The combination of a robust, low-cost autoclave process along with an increase in design capability will result in significant cost savings to the Military.  In addition, the results of this SBIR will also be beneficial to the high-temperature polyimide composite community.  The methodology for the characterization and the overall understanding of thick-laminate processing for MVK-14 FreeForm would apply to other polyimide resin systems.",

Phase-I results validated the proposed concept by imaging the angle-of-polarization pattern in the sky, both in clear sky and overcast conditions, and accurately determining azimuth.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In Phase I, PaneraTech demonstrated feasibility of a Foldable Lightweight Parabolic Antenna (FLPA) that had the minimum required beamwidth and gain to view at least one GPS satellite anywhere on the earth any time of the day. We achieved significantly high gain compared to traditional GPS receivers so that Time to First Fix is expected to be improved significantly under heavy interference and low signal situations. FLPA is also shown to have an excellent gain pattern that substantially suppresses the interference. During the Phase I, we carried out an extensive analysis to determine the necessary beamwidth required. We also designed and built a prototype reflector antenna and measured its performance in compact range to demonstrate the feasibility of FLPA. Our proposed technology is based on a reflector surface made out of embroidered conductive yarns, thus enabling a low weight foldable parabolic antenna that can be carried inside a thigh holster. In Phase II, we will optimize the mechanical design and carry out necessary mechanical and RF tests to ensure the final prototype at the end of Phase II is battlefield ready (ready for 810G  certification). We will also demonstrate GPS performance of the antenna under light/heavy interference/jamming and/or low signal conditions. In the second half of Phase II, we will focus on demonstrating dual use of the FLPA for  communication applications as well. We will initially target INMARSAT as a potential communication application to demonstrate transmit/receive capability of the antenna. We will also engage potential Phase III partners along with U.S. Air Force personnel to identify another communication if necessary to demonstrate FLPA&#039;s  ability to transmit/receive for communication applications.  BENEFIT:  The proposed Foldable Lightweight Parabolic Antenna (FLPA) has tremendous commercial applications in the defense and civilian markets. While FLPA technology offers significant benefits to the DoD for GPS and communication applications, it also has a potential application as a communication enhancement technology for satellite telecom service providers such as ViaSat, Globalstar etc.  Current subscribers of the satellite telecom customers who rely on a bulky monopole antenna attached to their phones and laptops and  receive poor service due to high interference, foliage etc, will be able to use FLPA as a high gain antenna for improved  telecom service. Search and rescue teams who work in remote fields will also find this technology vital to their needs for  enhanced telecom and navigation services.  FLPA also can be used as a high gain antenna for cubesat applications as well given its light-weight and foldable/deployable structure.",

These highly accurate sensing elements will meet or exceed required accuracy of 1 to 3 mils.  The sensor will be packaged in a rugged enclosure that will fit directly onto the barrel and only needs a few minutes of sensor data integration before azimuth accuracy is achieved.  We have also developed instrumentation and methods to provide high rate data even after a mortar round has been fired and the barrel may have moved either from the blast or from repositioning.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  To provide longer operating time and reduced weight power supplies for military platforms including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and solider communication devices, transformative advances are needed to increase the electrochemical energy storage density of batteries. The energy densities of current batteries are restricted by their utilization of predominantly single electron per molecular site charge storage processes.  Vanadium diboride (VB2) undergoes an extraordinary 11 electron per molecule electrochemical oxidation process. Coupling this anode with a high capacity air cathode provides VB2-air batteries that have a theoretical volumetric energy density greater than that of gasoline. During the Phase I, Lynntech demonstrated VB2-air batteries with high capacities and rate capabilities. The Phase II project involves developing VB2-air batteries which have practical anode thicknesses and which provide current densities and capacities needed for military applications.  Specific work in the Phase II involves optimization of the material, development of thick, high performance VB2 electrodes, cell performance testing, and evaluation of cell performance under simulated conditions.  The development of VB2-air cells can provide batteries with significantly longer operation time and/or reduced weight compared to existing batteries.  BENEFIT:  High energy density VB2-air batteries have significant commercial potential based on their substantially higher energy densities compared with current primary and rechargreable batteries.  Specific benefits for DoD include extended duration unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight times, reduced carry weight for soldiers, and extended duration sensors.  The battery has a dual use for both military and civilian applications.  Military applications include UAVs, soldier power, communication systems, weapons systems, remote sensors, and surveillance systems.  Private sector applications for Lynntech&quot;s VB2-air batteries include consumer hearing aids, long endurance sensors, and a broad range of consumer electronic devices.",

Finding cross-border tunnels is a challenging task and once found, an additional challenge is secure and map the entire underground tunnel. Manned entry into these dangerous underground environments is a risky endeavor. The use of robotics offers a great improvement over human entry into these tunnels. To function effectively, tunnel robots require a wireless communications link. In our Phase I effort, we demonstrated the feasibility of a flexible and highly adaptable electromagnetic (RF) communications link for underground robotics. The link is bi-directional. We developed an adaptive parametric signal processing scheme where the relationship between data rate, communications range, power, covertness, etc. can be optimized for a given communications link because the underground electromagnetic electrical properties can greatly vary from site to site. By using a software defined radio approach this optimization can be user-adjusted or automatically optimized in the field. Frequencies of operation can range from several kHz to several MHz. Data rates will be sufficient to transmit slow scan imagery. In Phase I we showed that data rates of greater than 100 kbps could be supported at horizontal ranges of 125 meters from a tunnel that was 21.5 meters deep. This tunnel was in a copper bearing formation and represented a worst case environment for electromagnetic through-the-earth communications. In this Phase II effort, we proposed to continue developing an advanced prototype of the system, implement into an operation robot, and test the system using field demonstrations of the system at several underground tunnel test sites.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  A major challenge and expense of developing electromagnetic sensors is the custom hardware required to generate and receive electromagnetic waves. Radar sensors generate and receive electromagnetic waveforms through custom signal processing hardware called a Receiver / Exciter (REX). The REX is complex, expensive, and custom made. When sensor systems are built, the&quot;back-end&quot;signal and data processing hardware and software and the&quot;front-end&quot;antenna and REX hardware must be designed and integrated. The development of sensors is slowed and complicated by this separate but interdependent hardware and software. Furthermore, there is no capability to test software patches, configuration upgrades or waveform frequency changes without the expense of traveling to the operational site to connect with the sensor front-end hardware.  This project applies the Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) to develop a modular and open&quot;Virtual&quot;or VREX reusable subsystem. The VREX allows testing sensor software patches, configuration upgrades or waveform frequency changes without the need to modify or access the physical electromagnetic hardware. The VREX offers a reusable, commercial off-the-shelf REX module to accelerate radar innovation and lower the expense of developing, testing, and maintaining sensor systems. The VREX fills a crucial capability lapse in the current radar development and upgrade efforts.    BENEFIT:  Currently, without radar front-end hardware, test centers can exercise the mission software with digital simulation but not with the signal processing software. The VREX provides high-fidelity radar system simulation and enables signal processing testing in the test center environment without the expense of radar front-end hardware. This innovative approach reduces the time required to test a new release and reduces the need for radar and test engineers to travel to remote radar sites. The VREX also provides a design tool for system engineers to experiment with various radar characteristics before making a substantial investment in building hardware. The VREX provides a commercial off-the-shelf configurable tool supporting many radar types and thus is an inexpensive and innovative solution for designing and testing radar systems.",

(PSI) and Systems Technology & Research (STR) developed a design for an ultra-wideband, power-efficient, high-performance analog-to-digital converter (ADC) using a novel combination of electronic and photonic hardware together with digital processing software. During Phase II, we will develop a prototype with a sample rate of >10 GS/s and >8 effective bits (ENOB) at 20 GHz, which can be operated either in the classic Nyquist sampling mode or in a compressive sensing mode. The photonic ADC design developed in phase I can easily be adapted to the design of other ADCs at different points in the ENOB vs. sampling rate trade space. The PSI/STR teams innovative design meets this programs challenging ENOB, dc power, and sampling rate goals by leveraging the team members work on previous ADC programs: photonic sampling, multi-channel ADC interleaving, and signal processing algorithms for calibration, nonlinearity correction, and compressive sensing. The prototype ADC uses all-COTS parts, thereby achieving extraordinary performance using ordinary components. The approach is scalable in ENOB and sample rate as the performance of electronic ADCs improves, and its output is compatible with standard interfaces for digital data signal transfer.",

The network nodes will be capable of supporting sensors to monitor environmental variables or actuators for system controls.  The nodes will be powered via a magnetically coupled RF energy transmission system.  Resonant coupling systems will allow low power sensor nodes to be powered continuously.   Actuator nodes will require a capacitive based energy storage system that provides greater amounts of power in short pulses.  Communication with the sensor nodes will also necessitate the development of a high temperature transceiver.  This transceiver will be based on HTSOI electronics and employ a high temperature microcontroller for data management.  This microcontroller will also be used to control the actuators.  BENEFIT:  The flexibility obtained by being able to locate sensors and actuators anywhere (&lt;225\u00b0C) in an engine environment will be very valuable to the turbine industry.  Engineers will be able to employ this system to quickly make and test design changes.  This system will also be useful in health monitoring applications by allow sensor placement without regard to energy harvesting capabilities of the specific location.",

Prognostica is a new and unique tracking, sensing, and prognosticating technology that allows for exactly that. Based on the results achieved in the Phase I effort it is evident that the technology has excellent reliability and reflects the real-time fatigue conditions of the base structure in its entirety, not calculated values or strain readings from only one small area.Phase II will continue the advanced development of the prototype kit including all materials and hardware applicable to full scale component application. During the proposed effort, the CSG will be optimized, environmentally tested, and integrated into air vehicle components to laboratory test, investigate, and demonstrate consistent reproducibility, reliability, and accuracy of the CSG as it applies to air vehicle components operating environment.  BENEFIT:  The Prognostica ability to gather stress and fatigue data in a timely and non-disruptive manner will permit sampling of structural health on a far more frequent basis and thus permit accurate trend predictions, therefore providing clearer vision as to the need and timing of weapon system and vehicle upgrades.AGS intends to work together with the North American undercarriage makers, end-users and their qualified contractors during the commercialization stage as well as post commercialization activities to properly expedite and implement its developed Prognostica system. It is anticipated for the Prognostica technology to achieve an initial 0.5% market penetration in the first 3 years of commercialization following by the targeted increase to 2% over the following 7 years.An innovative use of thin flexible gauges will provide a convenient real-time look into the stress/fatigue state of any structure upon which the gauge is attached. This approach will provide many engineering sectors (Aerospace, Construction, Mining, Transportation) unparalleled visibility into the performance of their systems, thus offering significant improvements in efficiency and safety.",

The HPAs linear power is based on an adjacent channel power ratio of < -30 dB at a 1 symbol rate spacing with a 12/4 APSK modulated carrier, which will be achieved at an output power backoff  from saturation of less than 3 dB.

We propose to develop the technology for small fragmentation warhead with high lethality and low collateral damage (LCD).  We plan to achieve our goal using a powder metallurgy (PM) approach to fabricate a high reactivity, self consuming, controlled fragmentation warhead.  Our design parameters include reactive material formulation, powder particle size, warhead case design, attenuation techniques and consolidation processes.  The proposed material system will use a blend of several elemental or compound powders capable of participating in an energetic (exothermic) chemical reaction.  The existence of different powder materials will allow for tailoring of the mechanical and reactive properties of the material through engineered variations of the volume fraction of each reactant and by adjusting their particle size.  The consolidation will occur below the reaction initiation temperature to prevent any energy release during compaction and preserve the stored chemical energy of the exothermic reaction between the reactant powders.  This effort will combine our unique expertise in powder consolidation with new approaches in reactive powder design to develop a new generation of small fragmentation warhead with high lethality and LCD.  BENEFIT:  The proposed program will have dual use applications in military as well as in commercial industries.

The purpose of this proposal is to improve the detection of defects when they are obscured due to physical limitations of CT.  Lickenbrock has developed an advanced variant of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, and other algorithms, for improving fidelity of CT.  The EM algorithm is an iterative CT algorithm.  It has a limitation of long computation times with large image volumes involving 100&#039;s of CT slices.  Approaches to accelerating its computation speed involves the utilization of many parallel graphical processing units on one computer.  Algorithmic speed improvement approaches include a mathematical formulation that improves progress of the algorithm at each iteration.  Additionally, algorithms that reduce noise and artifacts that can obscure defects and are due to practical physical limitations of the CT scanner are being developed.  Phase I showed the feasibility of significantly increasing speed and significantly improving image fidelity.

In this effort, we seek to further increase the resolution of these arrays by developing technologies that will permit smaller pixels and physically larger arrays. We will also work to improve the electrical to optical conversion efficiency of these arrays by optimizing the number of quantum wells to match the RIIC capabilities. We also propose exploring methods of shifting to longer wavelengths with Type-I LED by utilizing a triple layer quantum well architecture. Finally, we will explore the potential for cascading multiple active regions for longer wavelength LEDs.  The array design will also be improved, with changes made to improve efficiency by reducing surface recombination and by increasing thermal conductivity to the RIIC. A process for high yield flip-chip hybridization will be developed and studies regarding the expected yield will be conducted on custom made passive RIIC substitutes that will permit individual control of selected pixels within the array and group control of the remaining pixels.",

CLAD supports a&quot;need-to-share&quot;paradigm to aid in historical cyber traffic analysis and cyber target discovery.  The alert-to-share capability determines if multiple analysts are continually accessing information with common entities, and alerts relevant analysts that the potential for collaboration exists.  The notification indicates to users what information may be beneficial to share and why, based on the relationship of their independent investigations.  The alert-to-share capability accelerates the discovery of knowledge and completion of investigations, enables users to benefit from analysis of previous or concurrent investigations, and reduces duplication of effort.  BENEFIT:  The alert-to-share capability connects analysts investigating similar activity, which reduces duplication of effort and improves efficiency and accuracy in determining false/true positives (by combining their historical experience/observations). Furthermore, the notifications can alert analysts to recall historical investigations, which then saves analyst the time required to start a&quot;new&quot;investigation from scratch.  Analysts performing defensive operations often do not share information with analysts performing counter operations, and alert-to-share can facilitate coordination of their efforts to accelerate the discovery of knowledge and completion of both missions.",

Filtered Rayleigh Scattering (FRS) will be used to obtain spatially and temporally resolved densities in a plane near the body of the vehicle. Scattering from windows and surfaces will be suppressed using a vapor cell&quot;notch&quot;filter. Strategies will be investigated for using the notch filter to measure temperature and pressure as well. A prototype sensor will be constructed for ground testing on a slender cone model in a Mach 4 wind tunnel, a supersonic boundary layer tunnel, and on ionized flow produced in a plasma discharge chamber. The measured density fluctuations and their distributions should enable the optical characterization of flow field, information that is needed towards the development of onboard optical sensors, and for transmitting high-quality communication signals.  To gauge the effects of the flow field on the quality of an optical beam, a laser beam will be traversed through it and the wavefront distortions measured using a wavefront sensor.  BENEFIT:  With renewed interest in hypersonic flight, Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELV) and Reusable Launch Vehicles (RLV) represent the future of space applications. A compact version of the proposed flow diagnostic using FRS would find use aboard hypersonic test vehicles and space vehicles. With private enterprises besides US Air Force and NASA entering the space launch vehicle market, there is a growing need for modular optical instruments that can interrogate flight environment under harsh conditions and thus enable the passage of high-quality communication signals.",

The monitoring and control system will collect data from multi-mode sensors related to the laser pulse interaction with the turbine component material and resulting plasma plume.   Current single mode breakthrough detection methods, which predominantly use broad band spectral sensing devices, are not considered sufficiently effective or reliable. The current alternatives are fixed pulse number per hole protocols that result in component airflow variation of up to +/- 10%. This leads to unnecessarily high numbers of defective parts from over- and under-drilling. It is estimated this multi-mode concept could reduce airflow variation from +/- 10% as currently experienced to +/- 2%-- a fivefold reduction. Tighter control of airflow results in longer turbine component life, reduced overall production cycle times and costs, and an increase in gas turbine efficiencies.",

I/Q imbalance is especially detrimental to radio SoC&quot;s that must support high order modulation and tight channel spacing, typical in current and emerging radio systems.

The main benefit of radar is the ability to detect targets at long stand-off ranges in all weather conditions. The main disadvantage is that radar  transmissions are typically easily intercepted and provides a means for an adversary to both detect, track, and potentially target blue force aircraft. A new sensor system that exploits target illumination provided by commercial broadcast stations would provide  an attractive air surveillance capability without the vulnerability of being intercepted that is inherent in traditional radar systems. During Phase I the feasibility of a new airborne passive radar system concept was established. Under Phase II the concept will be fully developed using a combination of simulated and experimental data collections.

Up to 30 dB in-band reduction of intermodulation products (IMP) up to 7th order were demonstrated in Phase I by applying a prototype MISSPEL system with 1 GHz bandwidth to a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) broadband power amplifier. No additional in-band spurious signals are introduced, and the fundamental signals remain unaffected, ensuring the high fidelity of the approach. In Phase II, fully automated prototype systems will be developed based on two implementations of the MISSPEL methodology: (1) a stand-alone software toolkit that analyzes a known signal script and generates a modified signal script that will yield greatly reduced IMP; and (2) a real-time hardware toolkit that can reduce IMP in a free-play scenario of random signals. The performance enhancement offered by the MISSPEL prototypes will be evaluated and demonstrated to the government. Successful demonstration of these prototype implementations, which are easily integrated with current Army Electronic Proving Ground (EPG) test operations, will ensure rapid transition to production-ready capability in Phase III.",

        "abstract": "High performance infrared detectors in the LWIR regime are highly needed in a number of missile defense missions. In order to image targets from long distance, it is important that imagers have high sensitivity and high resolution. This leads to technical goals of having low noise, low dark current in small size pixels in large arrays. While saturated performance levels of traditional systems based on bulk semiconductors have not quite met the requirement of applications, it is expected that novel quantum systems will bring new development stage for infrared imagers.  In recent years, Type-II InAs/GaSb superlattice (T2SL) has experienced significant development, from theoretical modeling, material growth to device processing and packaging. Performance of LWIR detector based on T2SL has become comparable, even better than that of HgCdTe. However, LWIR T2SL devices have been shown to be limited by surface leakage, especially at lower operating temperature.   This proposed effort will address surface processes in order to suppress this bottle neck of T2SL technology. By using a novel gated photodiode design and correlating the influence of structural design and material quality on surface leakage a high performance LWIR FPA with dark current below 1 &amp; #61549;A/cm2 at 67K will be demonstrated.",

Phase I work at CDI has identified first-generation actuation devices that can be tailored to enable a&quot;smart nozzle&quot;capability to mitigate exhaust noise.  Components of a compound actuation system that can simultaneously adjust nozzle exit area and enhance exhaust flow mixing have been demonstrated in pre-prototype form; these demonstration and engineering analysis of full scale versions have established that these devices can provide the required force and displacement to enable effective noise mitigation strategies.  Device actuation is provided using novel mechanisms and rapidly maturing SMA (Shape Memory Alloy) materials, in particular specialized high temperature&quot;HTSMA&quot;alloys.  Phase II will build on Phase I results to develop full scale versions of the nozzle flap actuators and variable geometry chevrons in forms suitable for eventual testing under full scale temperatures and aerodynamic loads.  The effort will involve:  adaptation of Phase I designs to meet operational specifications; fabrication of HTSMA actuators and integration with full scale hardware; aerodynamic and high temperature testing; and initial studies of integration requirements and operational suitability.  BENEFIT:  The key motivation for the effort is mitigation of noise both for aircraft now entering the inventory (e.g., F-35 and F-22) and new vehicles that will enter service in future years; reducing noise while preserving or enhancing engine performance is critical for community acceptance of military operations and ground crew health and safety.  If successful, a fielded system could yield 3-5 dB of noise reduction for legacy engines, with comparable reductions likely for next generation fighter engines.  Much of the adaptive nozzle technology to be developed is directly transferrable to civil aviation, where noise reduction for commercial jet transports is a high priority.",

Our technology enables significant improvements in analysis speed, non-invasiveness, device automation, and marked reduction in logistical burden and operating cost. In Phase I, key technology concepts were successfully demonstrated. Two different designs were developed using physics-based simulations, followed by state-of-the-art fabrication and engineering. Experiments were undertaken to demonstrate microfluidic stem cell manipulation and impedance identification of the cell differentiation state, which firmly established proof-of-concept of the technology. In Phase II, efforts will focus along two directions. First, an advanced cell sorter will be developed for separating cells of different characteristics.

To support this mission, enhanced sensors are being developed for the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) for surveillance applications.  The increased numbers of detector elements and improved sensitivity of these next-generation, wide-field-of-view (WFOV) electro-optic (EO) and infrared (IR) sensors motivates the need for advanced algorithms that can efficiently provide real-time exploitation of large volumes of data using limited processing and bandwidth resources.  SciTec has been a leader in the research and development of algorithms to exploit Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) data for enhanced extraction, tracking, and exploitation of low-observable target signatures in a timely manner to provide information that is critical for resolving ambiguities, developing tactical parameters, discriminating events and supporting battlespace awareness and missile defense objectives.  SciTec has leveraged these algorithm development experiences to identify an innovative end-to-end processing suite for the rapid detection, extraction, and tracking of dim closely-spaced targets in data from WFOV sensors viewing cluttered scenes.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The goal of this Small Business Innovative Research project is to model the ability of human listeners to detect and identify specific auditory targets within complex, real-world sound environments. Previous approaches, based on linear auditory models, have produced unsatisfactory results. Our novel approach simulates the nonlinear signal processing observed in auditory physiology, significantly extending the state of the art. By mimicking functionally important nonlinearities, we are simulating human perceptual capabilities that are relevant to predicting the detection and identification of auditory targets. During Phase I we demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In Phase II, we plan to develop an advanced computer model for predicting the capabilities of human listeners. We will 1) prototype a computer program that includes a dynamical model of the human auditory system and a decision model for predicting human performance; 2) design a new experiment using the database of aircraft and ambient sounds currently being collected by AFRL; and 3) validate the predictions of our computer model against the detection and identification performance of human listeners.    BENEFIT:  The model of auditory detection and identification we will develop will have broad implications for military, aerospace and automotive technologies. The model will predict sound source detection and identification in military environments, and will provide predictions across a wide variety of background noise configurations. This project is targeted toward a specific military application being developed at AFRL. Additionally, this model may prove useful in military training simulators, which have traditionally relied primarily on visual information and cues. In addition, the development and fielding of an auditory detection model has implications for automotive technology areas, the FAA, the U.S. Department of the Interior and National Park Service, by providing the ability to accurately predict auditory detection of aircraft and automobiles across a wide variety of locations, including residential areas, parks, and commercial zones. More generally, a technology that can successfully recognize complex sound patterns in natural environments would have significant implications for almost every application, military and civilian, that processes sound. Existing systems would be improved, deployment in new environments would be enabled, and new applications would become possible. Consumer applications would include hearing technologies, speech technologies, and music applications.",

        "abstract": "Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPAs) are becoming increasingly popular and prevalent in the military domain.  The ability to train RPA crews is a significant challenge facing the community.  A particularly vexing part of this problem is training the members of the crew to function as a team.  RPA crews must effectively interact with stakeholders who are located around the world.  Unfortunately, RPA crewmembers have essentially no opportunity to practice this coordination until they are conducting live missions.  The REmotely Piloted Aircraft Synthetic Tutor (REPAST) technology will address this deficiency by providing synthetic agents that can realistically interact with the RPA team members.  If a human is available to fill a given role, one will.  If not, a synthetic agent will be used as a substitute.  Automated and semi-automated performance assessment will enable real-time and after-action coaching.  The REPAST synthetic agents are equipped with cognitive models and natural language processing capabilities that allow them to act and communicate as integral team members.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Development and deployment of airborne multistatic radar systems and the algorithms that control them can be greatly aided by accurate modeling and performance prediction. Capturing physical, electromagnetic and environmental real-world effects of multistatics in a simulation capability is imperative to achieve the desired benefits of this effort.  Highly parameterized transmitter and receiver models with well-defined command and feedback interfaces, which are capable of real-time simulation, offer great utility to sensing system and control algorithm designers.  Providing the ability to simulate the wide array of situations multistatic systems have to face (ex. varying transmitter cooperativeness, limitations on available emissions, hostile environments where passive operation is critical) allows for critical design decisions to be assessed.  Relevant performance metrics must be developed and utilized to handle the complicated task of predicting the value of decision trades in radar design and algorithmic control. Black River proposes to develop an extensible model of passive multistatic radar with AMTI, GMTI, and SAR modes integrated with a closed-loop sensor manager simulation and tracking model, and a suite of performance measurement tools. A user interface is included to facilitate sensor architecture and system parameter trade studies, illuminator model library definition, and the construction of sensing environment test conditions.  BENEFIT:  An accurate and efficient simulation capability of airborne multistatic systems will help researchers and developers to streamline and enhance the processes of requirements definition, data collection / validation planning, and development of passive radar sensors and their intelligent control algorithms. Commercial entities could exploit this tool to identify applications where existing active sensors could be replaced with new passive systems satisfying system requirements, but which can be produced cheaper, with reduced payload (size weight, and power), and enhanced reliability.",

Currently, training material is often tied to the implementation platform and cannot be easily redeployed to new platforms or systems.

To increase the efficiency of training authoring, management, and delivery, we propose to develop and evaluate the feasibility of a Collaborative Repository and Exchange for Adaptable Training Environments (CREATE).

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This SBIR Phase I project is targeted at the development of a novel ultracapacitor using ionic liquid electrolytes. Commercially available ultracapacitors exhibit high power density, in excess of 6000 Wh/kg, but relatively low energy density of under 10 Wh/kg. Boulder Ionics proposes to develop a ultracapacitor with an energy density of over 30 Wh/kg through the use of ionic liquid electrolytes and nanostructured electrodes. Ionic liquids have very wide electrochemical stability windows, up to 6 V. As the energy density of ultracapacitors depends on the square of the operating voltage, ultracapacitors using ionic liquid electrolytes could offer energy densities three times those of commercial ultracapacitors with organic electrolytes. In Phase II, Boulder Ionics will demonstrate a novel ultracapacitor design using ionic liquid electrolytes. To address the cost-effectiveness and ultimate commercial potential of the design, Boulder Ionics will also  demonstrate an innovative high-throughput, low-cost synthesis method for the electrolyte.  BENEFIT:  The new ultracapacitor power supply will increase the lifetime and capability of advanced spacecraft. Unlike batteries, ultracapacitors can provide hundreds of thousands of cycles, increasing the lifetime and reducing the life cycle cost of satellites, particularly for those in low earth orbit. In addition, the higher power density of ultracapacitors will enable increased capability, including higher power burst communications, actuators and thrusters. Commercial applications of high-energy ultracapacitors include windmill blade pitch drives, vehicle starting, hybrid-electric vehicles, grid-scale energy storage, backup power supplies and cameras. Ultracapacitors developed in this program are expected to have widereaching impacts on U.S. energy security and balance of trade.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  High temperature applications of titanium alloys are limited by their affinity to oxygen.  In these alloys, oxygen absorption results in a brittle surface layer that has a deteriorating effect on the mechanical properties of the material. Reducing oxygen ingress into these alloys at high temperatures is essential to their cost-effective utilization in both metallic thermal protection systems and hot structure applications.  One promising approach to reduce oxygen ingress (without the application of additional surface coatings) while improving high-temperature mechanical properties is to design or tailor the microstructure in the material surface layer through carefully selected thermo-mechanical surface treatments.  The proposed work will develop and validate a new experimental-modeling framework for capturing the precise effect of the complex material&#039;s internal structure (i.e. microstructure) on oxygen ingress.  In addition, this novel framework will allow compact representation and visualization of microstructure evolution during selected thermo-mechanical processing routes, thereby enabling identification of new promising hybrid processing routes to realize enhanced performance characteristics.  The proposed work is expected to contribute a central building block for the emerging Integrated Computational Materials Science and Engineering (ICMSE) infrastructure.  BENEFIT:  The result of this project will be the first commercially-available Microstructure Informatics Database that objectively links the salient microstructure features, oxygen diffusivity, and thermo-mechanical processing in alpha-beta Ti alloys.  The overall methodology and software tools developed by MRL may also be applied to nearly any other material system with crystalline components, with an economical number of tests and rapid characterization and analysis time.  This will, in turn, open the door to the design and optimization of new high-performance materials.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The objectives of this Phase-II research effort are to perform various advanced laser-based measurements in a swirl stabilized combustor test cell, in a high-pressure combustor, and turbulent laboratory flames for various hydrocarbon fuels in order to identify suitable technologies as well as to develop a mathematical model for investigating various combustion instabilities with the aim of devising intelligent control strategies. This effort addresses the need for non-intrusive diagnostic approaches that can provide high-speed, planar, spatio-temporally resolved images of velocity, temperature, and species concentrations over data sets of several thousand images. The proposal also addresses the need for combustion instability model for various alternative fuels based on the high-bandwidth data acquired with non- invasive laser-based measurements. Two unique modeling approaches (Flamelet Dynamics Model and Chaos Theory Based Model) will be carried out for providing guidance on combustion instability and their growth phenomena with the aim of devising proper control strategies. These measurements along with the model(s) will pave the way for the development of a combustion instability model related to high-pressure combustors/augmentors utilizing alternative jet fuels during the Phase-II research effort. In particular, these experiments will shed light on to the influence of C/H ratio in modifying the dominant combustion instability behavior.  BENEFIT:  Instrumentation and instability models for measuring temperature and species concentrations in combusting flows has proven to be critical in the deployment of propulsion systems for the warfighter. Qualitative optical techniques, such as high-speed imaging, have, in some cases, proven to be instructive and have helped to guide measurement efforts. However, specific design details may require quantitative, spatio-temporally resolved information such as heat release rate, temperature, and equivalence ratios at a rate of 1 kHz or greater. Hence, the optical sensors and the instability models proposed here offer a significant potential impact through reductions in development time and the improved reliability of propulsion devices for the DoD mission. This research effort will lead to a new and improved design of advanced combustion systems for propulsion applications. The optical sensing technologies should be very valuable to various engine manufacturers as well as to power-  plant manufacturers.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop innovative simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)-based methods for accurate geo-registration of wide area motion imagery (WAMI). The proposed computational architecture and key technologies are capable of handling noisy sensor metadata, and scalable to process large-scale WAMI data in real-time using onboard, distributed processing units such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA). The key innovations in this effort are: i) development of distributed SLAM based geo-registration with centralized fusion to enable large-scale WAMI processing, ii) development of computationally efficient and FPGA-suitable feature matching approaches, iii) development of fast camera ray-to-3D terrain model intersection algorithm, and iv) development of a distributed computational framework to enable airborne processing in SWaP constrained environment. The Phase I effort demonstrated the proof of concept by developing core technologies that form the basis of the proposed algorithms. The Phase II effort will be focused towards advancement and integration of these enabling technologies and will include development of new algorithms to handle the issues identified during Phase I, transitioning of technology and prototyping, integration of technologies into an existing ISR system, detailed quantitative and qualitative evaluation at component and system levels, and demonstration of technologies in operationally representative scenarios.  BENEFIT:  Wide-area motion imagery has proven to be a critical asset for persistent surveillance and reconnaissance of large geospatial regions. However the utility and value of these assets to the analysts significantly depends on the quality of geo-registration. For example, the performance of common applications such as targeting, tracking of high valued targets, and activity analysis, all are a function of georegistration accuracy of the data. Hence the development of robust geo-registration technologies is critical for enabling truly automated real-time wide area surveillance and reconnaissance. The proposed technologies facilitate accurate geo-registration on large scale imagery in the presence of sensor noise and errors in geo-registered reference data while overcoming fundamental and operational challenges and enable many automated tools for the exploitation of WAMI data. These include:   Tracking and handoff of high-value targets to and from WAMI data.   Precision targeting.   Mission Planning   Automated Activity Analysis   Real-time monitoring, and   Forensic data analysis",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In the past, systems such as the Navy&quot;s Relocatable Over the Horizon Radar (ROTHR) used analog HF receivers.  Those receivers were expensive to manufacture, and their performance varied over time and temperature.  Advances in digital signal processing and integrated-circuit performance have made fully-digital versions of the HF receivers technically viable and cost-effective.  The objective of this project is to design and prototype an HF digital receiver (HFDR) for the next generation OTHR.  In Phase I, the high level design of the HFDR was completed, and significant progress was made in the detailed design of the digital down converter (DDC) and the analog front end (AFE).  A fully-functional HFDR DDC that meets project performance specifications was implemented, and an AFE design with excellent noise figure and dynamic range performance was completed.  In Phase II we will design and build high-performance HFDR prototypes that meet the program objectives and that can be easily transitioned to production.  Three prototypes will be created: a COTS prototype for quick delivery, a ruggedized prototype for extended field testing, and a final pre-production prototype.  Each prototype will provide an opportunity for evaluation and tuning of the technical specifications and interfaces to meet program objectives.  BENEFIT:  The HF digital receiver proposed in this Phase II project will provide a significant performance benefit to the next generation OTHR system compared to current analog designs.  In particular, the HFDR&quot;s high dynamic range will improve the system&quot;s ability to detect targets in the noisy, high clutter HF environment.  Also, its simultaneous acquisition of wideband and narrowband data supports multiple channel monitoring and instant channel switching.  The same HFDR design is suitable for other HF, VHF, and UHF radar systems that use simultaneous reception from multiple antenna elements, such as phased array or MIMO systems.  It also has potential applications in the commercial, amateur radio marketplace, where it can simultaneously monitor multiple, widely spaced frequencies and provide instant frequency switching, a relatively new and desirable feature in that market.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Close-in sensors can be used to embed reliability and functional RF test capability directly on to RF chips in order to reduce the cost and complexity associated with carrying out reliability studies and product characterization. Recent advancements in silicon technology have enabled the development of close-in sensors and stimulus components ranging from direct current (DC) to RF signals. One can envision a universal reliability system on-a-chip (RFRELIC) for RF characterization where DC and AC sensors/stimulus may be implemented monolithically to realize a low cost system. This proposal proposes a suite of test structures, stimuli and sensors to embed test capability directly into integrated circuits.  BENEFIT:  This technology has potential to revolutionize assessing complex electronics for military use. Integration of voltage regulation to supply the necessary voltages and waveforms to multiple channels; on-chip RF sources for input stimuli; and digital controllers and monitors to coordinate testing activities such as supplying power to the Device Under Test (DUT) and capturing device performance simultaneously as the stressors are being applied is possible. Beyond HTOL and acceptance testing on-chip, on-chip Built-In-Test (BIT) has other applications to increase system reliability. An integrated circuit can monitor and report state of health. In the event that a circuit within a chip has failed, the chip would re-route to an alternate parallel path and greatly extending the reliability of the chip. For example if an amplifier failed, you could switch to a parallel amplifier. If a duplicate circuit does not exist, the signal could still be re-routed to an alternate path which might yield result in a soft failure versus non-operating condition. The additional cost/size of Built-In-Test (BIT) and parallel paths in RF integrated circuit processes will be minimal given today&quot;s scale of integration.",

The PROWL deliverable  should provide both monochrome images of the visible spectrum and  thermal images in the LWIR spectrum.  We expect to demonstrate  visualization of PROWL data on the PackBot operator control unit  (OCU), which should display 2D camera info with optional 3D and  temperature overlays when desired.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  As airborne sensors become more prolific and sophisticated, the amount of data they produce overwhelms the current ability to offload that data based on the meager performance of ground station terminals.  A high gain antenna supporting Ka-Band sensor data offload and Command and Control Uplink is required.   Gimbaled reflectors are the standard choice, but their design requires very sophisticated gimbals and control algorithms.  Phased arrays have been used to simplify the mechanical steering problem as well as reduce the height, but they are expensive, less efficient and suffer from scan loss at extreme angles from boresight.    FIRST RF proposes a novel two-axis mechanically steered aperture system for the Wide Field-of-Regard (FOR) High Gain Ka-Band Data Link. This concept offers reliability and performance in a compact package that is compatible with ground-based fixed or mobile platforms, and is easily adapted to future requirements for high datarate airborne terminals for satellite uplink.  The proposed system is a beam waveguide which enables precision tracking without requiring beam motion, such as with sequential lobe (or conical scanning) systems.  The outcome of the program will be an on-the-move demonstration of the full terminal.  Both the aperture and the tracking system are transitionable technologies.  BENEFIT:  The proposed antenna is orders of magnitude lower cost than phased arrays, with no scan loss.  It is moderately lower cost than conventional two axis gimbaled reflectors, due to one key design parameter that influences the selection of motors: whereas conventional gimbaled reflectors have a center of mass that is out over the pedestal, the proposed antenna has a center of mass about the azimuth center of rotation, implying that much less sophisticated motors with lower torque and mass requirements can be used to drive the assembly.  Further, our approach employs a stationary feed which does not require a rotary joint.  This substantially reduces cost compared to other reflector-based approaches.  The proposed system maintains a compact size and footprint ideal for ground operations.  The total swept volume of this design is not much larger than the swept volume of the diameter of the aperture.   The tracking system is also of a novel design, requiring only a single transceiver and yet provides an uninterrupted receive signal throughout the receive and tracking chain.  Both the aperture and the tracking system are transitionable technologies.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI), working with Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems (NGES), proposes to develop a passive optical Identification-Friend-or-Foe (IFF) patch that utilizes the absorptive and emissive properties of quantum dots (QDs) to provide a unique signature when interrogated by a weapons targeting pod.  The patch will be a flexible, robust, and low-cost composite capable of being placed on military vehicles, soldiers, and buildings. During the Phase I program PSI evaluated, through a quantitative system model, the feasibility of detecting a passive QD-based IFF indicator at operationally relevant standoff distances using the operating characteristics of a laser targeting pod. In parallel, chemical procedures were developed that produced QDs that emit light within the wavelength range of a targeting pod&quot;s sensors.  These procedures, as well as an overcoating method that was developed to improve the emission quantum yields and stability of the QDs, provide a foundation for preparing these materials.  In the Phase II program, PSI will build upon the system model and synthetic procedures while incorporating the QDs into a polymer composite in order to deliver a prototype with a TRL value of 5 to the Air Force.  The patch will be evaluated under realistic solar and thermal conditions.  BENEFIT:  The proposed research will provide the military with a rugged, low cost, passive indicator of friendly or non-combatant individuals or entities prior to a targeted weapons deployment. The successful completion of the development program will enable the Air Force to limit or eliminate friendly fire casualties and unnecessary destruction of military equipment or non-combatant property during air-to-ground attacks. In addition, the proposed IFF patch can be extended to applications beyond its current requirements because its spectral output can be deliberately controlled. For example, the use of tunable QD emission, coupled with spectrally selective sensors and eye-safe excitation, could lead to spectral barcodes used to track high value targets tagged at a checkpoint and through an urban environment.",

By eliminating the need to wait for the ground, planning decisions can be made faster based on event and status information available onboard.  This is especially important for spacecraft where continuous communication is unavailable or for events that need a quick response to take advantage of an opportunity or to respond to a detected threat.   Onboard planning and scheduling can be particularly challenging because of limited onboard processing resources.  In the Phase I effort, Orbit Logic and Emergent Space Technologies researched algorithm options, defined high-level requirements, outlined an operations concept, and designed a modular and scalable autonomous planning architecture to solve complex and varied planning challenges within the limitations of onboard resources.  A limited prototype of a portion of the architecture was developed and demonstrated during Phase I in a simulated flight software environment.   In Phase II the same team will further refine the requirements, architecture, and design and prototype all elements of the software architecture defined during Phase I.  The Phase II prototype will be run in a simulated flight software environment against multiple relevant use cases including collision avoidance and threat verification imaging, and the scalability of the design will be analyzed and tested.  BENEFIT:  The development of this onboard planning application will provide a configurable flight software application easily modified for new missions that will enable significantly faster responses to unanticipated events including detected threats to a spacecraft's health and safety.

In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of BRECH technology by investigating commercial material performance; development, fabrication, and tests of BRECH prototypes that demonstrated a converted power density of ~380 mW/cm^2 and a Seebeck coefficient&gt;4 mV/K, which allowed a projected efficiency near 10% at the temperature range from 20 degrees C to 100 degrees C, and 20 W of electric power output at the harvested power density of ~270 W/m^2. In Phase II POC plans to develop and fabricate a portable BCSU that will be sufficiently mature for technical and operational testing, limited field-testing, demonstration, and display; demonstrate 20 W of continuous harvested power output over a 10-hour period under all environmental conditions in the field; and characterize BCSU efficiency at AM1.5.",

Endeavor proposes a Multi-layer, Ever changing, Self-defense Service (MESS) that is resilient and manageable. MESS prevents attackers from exploiting a target system by removing the static network & system attributes that simplify reconnaissance.  Continuously refreshing the target system to a new virtual instance with a known trusted state and random service attributes, this limited-time-use virtual instance is comprised of a single application and OS combination and reduces system complexity.\n\nDuring Phase II, Endeavor will develop WebPurify, a DNSSEC-aware application that will build on our successful Phase I MESS prototype. WebPurify focuses on protecting web services, including web content delivery. Today, web security products detect and block attacks by enforcing acceptable use policies, and analyzing web traffic, content, etc.  Powered by MESS, WebPurify allows multi-layer protections by deploying public interface obfuscation and live service migration technique. It conceals the public interface from adversaries and enables web services to self-defend and self-recover. WebPurify is a game-changing cyber defense system, not by detecting, but by concealing; not by blocking, but by cleaning.\n\nBy Phase II completion, WebPurify will handle high traffic volume and multiple simultaneous connections, and be ready for the pilot/field test. Endeavor will work with clients and partners like DHS, Air Force, and McAfee to outline a pilot/field test plan. We'll develop a market plan for SaaS providers who can benefit directly from WebPurify as they have large attack surfaces and extensive virtualized infrastructure.",

        "abstract": "Under this Phase II SBIR IST will extend research conducted in Phase I to demonstrate several viable configurations for UV non-line-of-sight (UV NLOS) communication. Under Phase I, IST performed a survey of literature and an investigation of off-the-shelf and emerging technology. IST also worked to optimize its Plasma-shell technology as a key UVC light emitting component of the transceiver.      It was concluded in Phase I, that currently there is a trade-off between power and performance.  System sensitivity and speed can be increased if one is willing to employ large arrays of emitters and sensitive detectors.  However, this increases power consumption and system weight.  Relatively light weight low power systems can be fabricated at the expense of distance, and communication speed.    Under Phase II IST will investigate the development of a system that employs both architectures to achieve optimum results. The system will consist of a powerful stationary hub anchored to a vehicle or building in communication with small devices attached to medical equipment or personnel.  The system will feature a networking capability that allows the small devices to communicate amongst themselves and relay messages to the hub.",

Developmental impetus for novel mat structures is based on an improved mobility need for heavily armored vehicles over soft soil expeditionary terrain. In Phase 1, XCraft down-selected WAVTRAC [wayv-trak] from several proposed candidates and demonstrated equivalent wheel loading capability / rut depth with up to 30% easier roll-up effort compared to the MOMAT baseline. Rigorous sub-element testing along with analytical and numerical models were used to demonstrate WAVTRAC capabilities for temperatures between -25F and 125F with good success. WAVTRAC, a semi-rigid 3-D undulated composite, is a similar but geometrically unique improvement of MOMAT, with easier roll-up, reduced handling abrasion, better UV durability, and lower cost. With a near-complete matting design from Phase 1, Phase 2 will emphasize rigorous sample testing for various sizes, sub-scale pultrusion manufacturing, and full scale pultrusion manufacturing. Pultrusion is the lowest cost composite manufacturing process with high throughput (feet/minute), capable of $7/ft^2 -$15/ft^2 matting Phase 3 cost.

        "abstract": "Complex skin defects, including burns and trauma, represent a major medical problem affecting both military and civilian populations. In recent military engagements, burns account for approximately 5% of combat casualties. Furthermore, approximately 1.25 million Americans each year require medical attention for complex skin defects, with 50,000 people hospitalized for burns and 13,000 requiring skin grafts. With severe skin injuries and extensive burns, skin loss must be addressed promptly to prevent life-threatening complications. However, restoration of fully-functional skin requires regeneration of the interfollicular epidermis, the cutaneous appendages, and the underlying vascularized dermis. Currently, no therapeutic approach addresses both the immediate need for wound coverage and the ultimate goal of autologous skin tissue regeneration with functional restoration. To address this unmet need, we propose to combine technologies already in development to provide an innovative alternative approach to the traditional standard of care. The proposed therapeutic approach combines the advantages of a next generation bioengineered skin substitute with the benefits of autologous tissue micrografting to 1) recapitulate the normal barrier function of intact human skin, 2) reduce time to wound closure, 3) speed wound revascularization, and 4) deliver autologous tissue for skin regeneration with functional and cosmetic restoration.",

(ESI) has an extensive background in aircraft survivability and vulnerability reduction and has specific experience in the fundamental understanding of the fire suppressant transport phenomena in highly cluttered spaces such as engine nacelles and dry bays. This opportunity allows for the development of a unique smart nozzle technology which could be used to retrofit current systems in legacy aircraft as well as compliment the design of new suppression systems in future aircraft. By incorporating an optical fire location device with a proprietary discharge nozzle, the newly developed smart nozzle will be capable of locating a fire and discharging agent directly at the fire zone within 100 ms of receiving a fire detection signal. This smart nozzle will thereby increase the overall efficiency of the suppression system by locating the fire zone and supplying agent directly to the fire. Thereby reducing the amount of agent required to extinguish a fire and minimizing collateral damage to nearby areas.  BENEFIT:  The proposed universal fire suppression nozzle offers a method of increasing the effectiveness of halon replacement fire suppression systems for DoD and commercial aircraft platforms by achieving higher agent transport efficiencies to fire regions. This universal nozzle will allow retrofit of legacy systems as well as integration into future fire suppression systems. Furthermore, due to its universal nature, the nozzle is expected to be easily marketable to several additional industries including but not limited to the following: ground vehicle suppression systems (military and commercial), building fire protection systems, solid propellant gas generation fire suppression systems, and electronic/computer equipment rooms. This multi-use marketability increases commercialization of the final product, which will result in a low cost unit, especially for DoD applications.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Deployable Space Systems, Inc. (DSS), in partnership with Emcore Photovoltaics (EMCORE), proposes the development and TRL 5/6 validation of an adhesive-less photovoltaic panel assembly, termed&quot;HSA&quot;for High Survivability Array.  Space solar array adhesives have been known to significantly outgass and become a major source of contamination, and after typical space environmental exposure will tend to have reduced optical transmission, degraded electrical dielectric and conductivity performance, and degraded elastic modulus and strength properties.  Adhesives are the biggest contributor for thermally induced CTE mismatched mechanical strains.  To mitigate these aforementioned concerns and to enable survivability under extreme high temperature threat conditions our teams&quot;proposed HSA technology has been specifically developed to utilize NO adhesives.  The proposed adhesive-less HSA technology offers superior mechanical, thermal, electrical, optical, and outgassing performance/properties, and promises to provide superior environmental stability with little degradation throughout a typical mission life or after exposure to rapid heating and/or long-term high temperature.  The HSA panel integrates onto a flexible blanket, compactly stows in z-folded or rolled configurations, accommodates standard and advanced multijunction-PV photovoltaics, and can be integrated onto conventional rigid solar arrays.  The adhesive-less construction significantly reduces panel assembly mass and dramatically increases temperature survivability to 500C+ sustainable extremes.  BENEFIT:  The proposed technology is applicable to all future DoD, NASA and commercial missions (including communications and earth observation) as a direct replacement for existing technologies.  The proposed technology potentially provides the DoD with a near-term and low-risk solar array panel assembly that could enable ultra-high survivability missions where survivability from exposure to natural or man-made events such as rapid heating and/or long-term high temperature is required.  The proposed adhesive-less technology promises to offer superior mechanical, thermal, electrical, optical, and outgassing performance/properties, and promises to provide superior environmental stability with little degradation throughout a typical mission life, and overall improved/enhanced mission capability for certain applications.  In particular, for military space applications, the enabling features of the proposed technology and predicted performance metrics are incredible improvements over current state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice technologies, and are mission-enabling for future DoD high survivability missions.  The technology has the potential to replace every currently produced state-of-the-practice rigid panel solar array that is currently used for high survivability missions or missions that require high cleanliness.  The most near military applications are a multitude of highly-classified DoD missions (which cannot be delineated herein) that demand ultra-high survivability for man-made threats and unique mission space environments.  The proposed technology will enable these DoD missions.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Deployable Space Systems, Inc. (DSS) proposed Phase 2 SBIR program is focused on the development of the mission-enabling Aladdin SmallSat solar array, and significantly maturing it through a rigorous TRL 8 qualification program, and ready it for spaceflight to support future DoD SmallSat missions.  The Aladdin solar array is a simple innovative ultra-lightweight compactly-stowable elastically self-deployable panel/structure system.  The proposed technology enables emerging missions and increases SmallSat operational capability.  The Aladdin technology is ultra-simple and has been specifically designed to inherently provide lower risk, cost, mass, and stowage volume, allowing for dramatically increased operational capability for SmallSats.  Aladdin repeatedly and elastically rolls-up or folds-up in the stowed configuration occupying an ultra-compact cylindrical or flat-planar launch package, and then reliably elastically deploys from its own strain energy to an integrated extremely-stiff planar solar array structure.  Aladdin employs high modularity and design simplicity allowing for ultra-affordability and deployment reliability.  Aladdin promises to provide revolutionary performance beyond current state-of-the-practice/art in terms of high specific power / lightweight (exceeding the 200 W/kg BOL AFRL goal), affordability (&gt;42% projected total cost savings), broad modular scalability (30W-600W+ array/wing sizes), high deployed stiffness (&gt;1Hz deployed first mode frequency for largest wing), high deployed strength capability, compact stowage volume (&gt;20-36 kW/m3 BOL), simplicity and high reliability, and operability in a 5-yr LEO or 15-yr GEO environment.  BENEFIT:  The proposed technology is applicable to all future DoD, NASA and commercial (including communications and earth observation) SmallSat missions as a direct replacement for existing technologies.  The proposed technology promises to provide the DoD with a near-term and low-risk solar array system for SmallSat applications and will provide revolutionary performance beyond current state-of-the-practice in terms of high specific power / lightweight, affordability, broad/modular scalability, high deployed stiffness, high deployed strength, compact stowage volume, simplicity and high reliability, and operability in a 5-year LEO or 15-year GEO mission environment.  The successfully developed technology will provide the end-user with mission-enabling benefits such as increased payload mass/volume capability, lower mission/spacecraft costs, and overall improved/enhanced SmallSat mission capability.  The most near-term military applications are the future SmallSat Operational Responsive Space (ORS) missions which demand ultra-affordability, high performance, and rapid supply on demand. Other military missions include literally all SmallSat missions, such as Eagle, a potential SmallSat successor to Space-Based Space Surveillance (SBSS), a potential SmallSat successor to Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), and support for ASAT systems (anti-satellite systems), as examples.  The proposed Aladdin solar array is also a potential dual-use technology for military forward operating ground-based warfighter applications (mobile or trailer based) that require terrestrial photovoltaic power production.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: PreTalen recognizes that an ongoing challenge facing the Department of Defense (DOD) and civil/commercial PNT users is the understanding of how integrated systems are impacted by degradation of key information. PNT information is a cornerstone technology that supports increased operational efficiency, productivity, precision, and safety. Because Global Positioning System (GPS) provides such a low cost and accurate method for determining PNT information, our reliance on GPS systems is critical. While some users may understand the need for a backup system, there is no clear method to determine requirements for a backup system to achieve graceful degradation. The problem is confounded by the multiplicity of applications and use of PNT information in each system that is reliant upon GPS. A clear understanding of how the integrated system (host and PNT) uses this data and the resulting effects from a degraded situation requires an in-depth investigation to fully comprehend potential impacts. Currently there is no tool or standardized methodology to evaluate or accomplish these types of assessments. The Quantitative Assessments Leveraging Effects-based analysis for degraded PNT [QUALE-PNT] system will fill this void. This HITL test asset includes algorithms for parametric setup and autonomous analysis across numerous degradation types affecting PNT systems. BENEFIT: QUALE-PNT will provide DoD, DHS, DOT and commercial PNT system users, system developers, and product testers an autonomous, repeatable, and reliable method for quantifying how integrated navigation and timing systems are impacted by degradation of key PNT information. Regarding the commercialization potential and the market interest in this technology, the PNT system manufacturers already perform many manual tests on their integrated systems, and have expressed interest in QUALE-PNT. However, they did not want to take on the non-recurring engineering and research and development to create a system like QUALE-PNT. This establishes a unique demand waiting to be filled by a small versatile company like PreTalen. DoD test and acquisition communities also conduct repetitive manual PNT system testing and have stated they would benefit from QUALE-PNT. PreTalen included many of these organizations in their stakeholder base (746th, JNWC, GPSD, Mitre, SAF/AQS). The short answer is, again, that there is a demand for this technology from government and primes, but the primes cannot compete on a price basis with a company like PreTalen.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Echo Ridge and George Mason University propose to mature, enhance and further demonstrate the PNT equipment hardware in the loop (HiTL) test asset successfully prototyped in Phase I.  The risk reduction prototyping accomplished in Phase I illustrated how efficient and automatic testing of the effects of degraded position, navigation and timing (PNT) on host systems can be done in the context of the DYnamic Spectrum Environment emulator (DYSE) technology.  The Phase II design and development activities will result in a deliverable prototype system capable of demonstrating functionality, value, mitigated development risk and compatibility with a wide variety of existing and anticipated augmentation methods.  It will be at a maturity level and documented such that third parties can operate it in a wide variety of testing scenarios.  A key innovation in the proposed research will continue to be the application of an adaptive, automated test scheduler based on stochastic multi-dimensional optimal search algorithms to efficiently produce valid test results.  In Phase II, we will couple the adaptive test scheduler with a rule-based expert system to capture subject matter expert (SME) testing methodology to promote rapid search through the universe of test cases.  We will also incorporate a data base into the design to organize and capture set up, run time and post processed information.  The test asset functionality will automatically collect data; emulate GNSS; emulate secondary PNT such as IMUs, other RF sources and assistance data such as D-GPS; emulate interference signals; emulate RF paths between GNSS/interference and PNT systems including complex urban multipath profiles; emulate PNT system host platform effects including motion; and emulate antenna patterns.  The test asset will continue to leverage technology developed through Air Force and Army Phase I and II SBIR funding for DYSE.  DYSE emulates RF environments by converting RF to/from digital samples, and synthesizing RF sources and environmental effects in the digital domain.  BENEFIT:  The direct benefit from this project will be the availability of an effective test fixture that provides an improved understanding of how augmented PNT systems operate in different environmental conditions.  Such a capability has applicability to a multitude of government and commercial markets including defense, homeland security, in-vehicle navigation and personal navigation.      Indirect benefits come from improved RF system testing functionality which will serve the greater wireless industry.  Wireless systems, for both the DoD and commercial market places, have increased functionality, applicability, capability, complexity and adaptability.  Mobile ad-hoc networks with MIMO antenna technology and cognitive radio networks, capable of carrying voice and data through packet services, are a good example of the trends.  There is an established and growing need to comprehensively test and evaluate the performance of these new devices and systems prior to general availability and approval for service use.  Traditional test methods are increasingly stressed by the proliferation and diversity of the devices and systems, and the diverse and complex operating environments.  This project provides an improved testing environment for more realistic and reliable testing.",

        "abstract": "Current bolometers are broadband detectors and tend to absorb broad IR spectrum for thermal imaging. A key issue with these systems is the lack of sensitivity of the sensors in target detection due to blackbody radiation limit. As a result, one of the many important applications such as low concentration chemical detection cannot be performed. A solution to this problem is to employ cryogenic systems where the sensors are cooled either thermoelectrically or with liquid nitrogen which can lead to higher sensitivity in detection. However, one major drawback of these systems is the size, weight and power (SWaP) issue as they tend to be rather bulky and cumbersome which have largely challenged their use in UAV&quot;s.",

Phase I activities have included development of concept designs utilizing commercially available technologies and demonstrating the ability to fabricate the necessary nano-scale components, and nano-macro interfaces, of the system.  Phase II activities will concentrate on further integration, along with step-by-step verification, of the remaining technologies required for a complete laboratory-scale system that can produce renewable liquid hydrocarbon fuels from CO2, water, and low-voltage, direct-current electrical potential that can be readily obtained using commercial solar photovoltaics.  Furthermore, the concept design will be further refined with the goal of reducing the complexity of the system to facilitate manufacturing.    The managers of this project are highly qualified to perform this work as demonstrated by their successful track record developing and commercializing similar synthetic fuel technologies for the Government in the past.    BENEFIT:  The development of a system for producing liquid hydrocarbons using artificial photosynthesis has broad application across the nation.  This technology has the potential to eventually replace some, if not all, traditional petroleum-based refinery production of transportation fuels and to dramatically reduce CO2 levels in the atmosphere.  It is likely that this technology will enable non-traditional private entities to license this technology and enter the fuel production market, thereby diversifying and increasing the competitive landscape of the fuel production market.    It&quot;s clear that, given our nation&quot;s economic and military dependence on transportation fuels that a system that uses CO2 as a feedstock and produces the exact fuel needed for our existing assets would be a technology in high demand.  The market demand for such a fuel drives M3&quot;s commercialization strategy.",

There is an acute need for improved technologies to train and assess warfighters&#039;cognition skills related to high-level tasks such as decision-making, planning and situation awareness. To this end, UtopiaCompression Corporation (UC) is proposing a suite of innovative modeling and assessment tools based on Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) cognitive architecture that can be used to intelligently train warfighters and further provide relevant and personalized training remediation. In Phase I, UC has successfully demonstrated the advantage of using neuroimaging data to develop high resolution cognitive ACT-R models that account for warfighter&#039;s affect/emotions that considerably influence decision-making in HSCB and non-HSCB environments. During Phase II, our focus is to incorporate these high-fidelity models in a simulation environment to train forward observers using BAE Systems&#039;training device. We will demonstrate the benefit of using high-fidelity models that can be personalized based on baseline subject measurements (neuroimaging and behavior data) and then be used independently to predict future trainee performance.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Freedom Photonics is proposing to develop novel photonic integrated components required to enable revolutionary new capabilities for conformal coherent LIDAR applications. Coherent LIDAR has by nature greatly enhanced capabilities in terms of available advanced systems architecture compared to the more conventional time-of-flight, photon counting LIDAR system.The developed components are key to enable low SWaP, distributed optical apertures which has the potential to greatly improve sensitivity, resolution and capability of comact LIDAR systems.  BENEFIT:  Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (SUAS) have shown to be very effective to carry out persistent Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. A significant constraint in sensor implementation is the relatively small size and weight of SUAS. Thus, high performance sensors that offer low size, weight and power consumption (low SWaP) will be in high demand and as they are deployed in SUAS, they will multiply the capabilities of our defense forces many-fold. The revolutionary technology developed by Freedom Photonics will open up the possibility of implementing a distributed aperture LADAR, leading to a high resolution system capable of distinguishing an object hidden under foliage, while remaining conformal to the surface of the aircraft. Because of the high levels of photonic integration to be attempted, this high performance can be achieved while maintaining low SWaP, such that it can be integrated in a SUAS.",

This project addresses AEDC&quot;s need for data integration and knowledge discovery of Department of Defense (DoD) weapons system engine and flight test data at AEDC.  TDAAS will provide test personnel and facility engineers with improved searching and data correlation capability to better identify and discover knowledge about turbine engine propulsion and flight testing (performance or aerodynamics assessment) and anomaly detection (test article or infrastructure). From this data, engine and flight stakeholders will be able to make assessments related to specific component behavior within the systems and comparisons of the data with other system tests for which records exist.

The ability to quickly and efficiently provide insightful analysis at all stages of an engine and flight acquisition program will reduce risk while eliminating waste and unnecessary costs (re-engineering). This will contribute to the USAF and DoD&quot;s longer-term goal to generate greater efficiencies and capabilities.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Amorphous composite (AC) coatings are an alternative coating material to the existing High Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF) Tungsten Carbide Cobalt and Tungsten Carbide Cobalt Chrome (WC-Co and WC-Co-Cr).  The purpose of AC coatings are to eliminate spalling on Low and High Strength Steel (LSS and HSS) at, or greater than component design loads.  These coatings could potentially be used on other materials that see high bending stresses such as Titanium and Precipitation Hardened steels commonly utilized in aircraft structure.  The SBIR Phase I work completed by Engineering and Software System Solutions, Inc. (ES3) focused on finding a HVOF coating more resistant to spallation when subjected to high-bending stress loads. Initial Phase II testing validated the AC coatings on LSS material used in aircraft, landing gear, propeller and engine applications.  Subsequent Phase II testing of a HSS material is studying the coatings on HSS, type 300M (280-300ksi), used on various aircraft components encountering high stresses and bending loads.    The Phase II.5 transition plan will focus on additional testing identified during Phase II; including testing for 6Al-4V titanium and 13-8Mo PH stainless steel alloys, applying the amorphous composite coatings on Dem/Val parts, creating fixturing, robot programs, adapting the repair documentation to the targeted components, and training.    BENEFIT:  Research conducted for chrome plating replacement with HVOF AC coatings on LSS and HSS, as well as titanium and PH steels are primarily used on aircraft, landing gear, engine and propeller system components.  Benefits will be similar for all aircraft usages for replacement of chrome plating where spallation concerns for high stress loads, especially under bending occur where current wear and corrosion protection needs exist.  The following lists benefits ES3 expects from use of HVOF AC coatings in lieu of chrome plating based on both industry and in-house research:   Improved wear resistance    Improved corrosion resistance   Increased fatigue life   Improved thermal properties   Eliminated hydrogen embrittlement   Improved process time   Increased service life   Improved environmental concerns   Utilize same grinding wheel as HSS substrate for machining   Reduced spallation   Reduced cost of AC powders compared to common HVOF WC-Co and WC-Co-Cr powders",

This Phase II.5 effort will apply the human system integration (HSI) considerations provided by Janus to the PEO C4I PMW 150 Maritime Tactical Command and Control (MTC2) program. The role of HSI in MTC2 is to develop logical and consistent workflows within and between applications and organizations, easy to use human-system interfaces, and proper implementation of the application designs. HSI products will be coordinated with the agile software development process, engineering teams, and the user community. These activities will reduce cost, schedule, and performance risks, and improve operational understanding and shared situation awareness. The result will not only assure greater MTC2 operational effectiveness but also will demonstrate the utility of the Janus process to a major C4I system.",

Operational features readily accommodate cooling cycles for achieving BEC. The versatility of the laser system is a critical factor in its applicability to a wide variety of physics packages, and allows end-user reconfiguration of functionality to address a broad range of applications Our compact laser system design minimizes critical component counts without sacrificing versatility. Hardware economization not only benefits the system cost and volume, but also reduces power consumption and increases stability and reliability of the system. The laser system integrates a laser module, control electronics and power supply into a single 19 rack-mount enclosure.  Our proposed Phase II effort will build the prototype laser system and perform subsystem and system testing to verify compliance with the stated specifications.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Operational airborne hyperspectral imagery (HSI) offers numerous advantages over traditional single or multiband sensing modalities for DoD intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance tasks.  The extremely high information content, which captures unique spectral signatures of targets and materials of interest, can lessen the reliance on expert data analysts and improve response time through automated processing.  However, the enormous stream of data collected with continuously operating HSI sensors far exceeds the throughput of existing real-time data analysis and telemetry systems.  This SBIR program addresses the critical HSI data-processing needs of airborne platforms by developing algorithms and software for efficient, high-fidelity compression and storage that can be implemented in real time or near-real time, thereby eliminating existing bottlenecks that limit the timely utilization of these valuable data.  Our compression system features lossless algorithms for data archival along with an innovative lossy method capable of producing compression ratios of order 50-fold.  In Phase II, the software products will be implemented and tested with onboard processing hardware, for use with ACES-HY and similar hyperspectral sensing platforms.  Structured file formats compliant with the National Imagery Transmission Format Standard (NITFS) will be developed to serve as a standardized exchange format.  BENEFIT:  The product of the proposed SBIR effort, after Phase II, will be a data compression algorithm software suite for immediate use in operational DoD and commercial hyperspectral systems and software packages for data analysis.  The software will enable efficient telemetry of the imagery to the ground, thereby overcoming existing bottlenecks that limit the timely utilization of these data and enabling efficient data archiving both on-board and on ground computing systems.  Sensors include ACES-HY and the many other military, civilian and commercial hyperspectral sensors that are or will be transmitting data from space or air to ground over the next two decades.  Potential applications are wide-ranging and include military operations, emergency and disaster management, environmental monitoring, medicine, and manufacturing process control.",

In Phase I, the MMICs were designed to predict performance capability and circuit integration. The module capability will be demonstrated and evaluated in Phase II with prototype fabrication, assembly, and testing.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Interest in bistatic radar, where the transmitter and receiver are not collocated, has historically waxed and waned, and is once again enjoying a resurgence. A multistatic system is one where multiple transmit sites or multiple receive sites, or both, are used to construct the radar picture. A passive radar system is one where the radar designer and user do not control the radio frequency (RF) transmissions. This effort will develop a capability to model and predict the performance of bistatic and multistatic radar systems using one or more airborne receivers and one or more airborne or ground-based transmitters. Radar modes to be analyzed include Air Moving Target Indication (AMTI), Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI), and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). A capability to model and predict the performance of these systems is critical to future development and deployment. Analysis of airborne multistatic systems is significantly more complex than that of ground-based systems. The problem also becomes more difficult when the goal is passive operation; however, being passive provides added survivability since there are no transmitted waveforms to be detected. Passive radar systems have traditionally been developed to exploit a particular emitter. The vision of future systems is to adapt to the local RF emitters, dynamically developing a passive radar strategy which is suitable to the local RF environment. The algorithm which does this may be referred to as an Illuminator Selection Manager, and passive radar performance prediction is a critical component. A performance prediction model will also allow an assessment of the military utility of such systems by providing inputs to higher level simulations. The models developed under this effort should include the effects of items such as apertures and receivers, transmitted waveforms, signal processing algorithms, clutter, and relative motion of the transmitter, receiver, and target. The models should allow parameters describing the various aspects of the system performance to be easily varied. With this construct the models should easily accommodate different instantiations of multistatic radar systems past, present, and future.  BENEFIT:  Anticipated benefits include increased capability to design passive multistatic radar systems, assess threat systems, and develop illumination selection managers.",

We will quantitatively show the benefit of exploiting functionality and information traditionally present in each organic application to provide mutual-benefit through tightly coupling measurements in the multifunction common SDR-cognitive network context.  ESCAPE benefits to be demonstrated will include improved communications and reduced primary user (PU) interference performance for DSA radios, improved position, velocity and time (PVT) performance for GPS, and improved robustness to unintentional and intentional interference for both applications. The evaluation and demonstration activities produce both comprehensive laboratory grade performance data as well as field demonstrations.  BENEFIT:  Commercialization opportunities for the subject technology are numerous in both the commercial and DoD sectors.  Deployment and widespread adoption of cognitive radio and cognitive radio networks is very slowing progressing in commercial uses due to the issues such as the likelihood of causing increased interference for incumbent spectrum users.  In some cases, incumbent users may be public safety personnel whose lives could be placed in danger without reliable communication and location capabilities.  The proposed technology offers to improve the cooperation between primary users and secondary users in the increasingly crowded RF spectrum.  In addition, through the development proposed, high-dividends could result from a tighter-coupling of electronic sub-systems found in GPS and software defined communications systems.  Sharing of hardware and processing could lead to lower overall costs, reduced size and power, and significantly improved communications and navigation performance.   This same technology would equally benefit the DoD, which faces increasingly scarce spectrum due to the high demands for revenue-bearing consumer applications.  Lastly, through the fusion of DSA and GPS, an unparalleled level of information assurance is offered which provides protection against electronic attacks in both communications and navigation application areas.",

Our approach is to create a&quot;template&quot;practice model in the domain of the social interaction, based on ethnographic observations, video analysis and/or role-playing. We use the template model as input, together with the sensor dataset of a social interaction, to generate a situation-specific model of the interaction. This situation-specific model will include an encoding of the participants, belief changes, activities over time, communication, use of artifacts, movement and location, that together represent the social interaction.",

Dramatic improvements in the performance of optical beam control systems for high precision pointing, tracking and lead-ahead targeting will follow. Jitter in line-of-sight image stabilization systems can be reduced by a factor of 20 relative to current state-of-the-art sensors.   Phase II will include the full development of key component technologies. This includes the following: a radiation tolerant design for a custom IC for signal detection; a radiation tolerant 24 bit ADC hybrid circuit; implementation of a new self-sensing temperature compensation method; new algorithms for linearity error correction; and new approaches to self-calibration at the next assembly level.   The system will be packaged in a small flight grade module with SpaceWire interface. It requires only a standard 28 VDC power supply. Two versions will be offered: a lower cost airborne version; and a radiation tolerant system designed to meet Level 1 quality requirements for space-based applications.   By the end of Phase II the technology will be available at TRL 8. A flight-grade unit will be built and subjected to qualification level performance and environmental tests.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Electrolytic Hard Chrome (EHC) has been used in both civilian and military aerospace as the hard wear resistant coating of choice for both high strength and low strength steels.  Due to tighter regulations there is a current requirement to eliminate the use of EHC on landing gear components for Air Force applications.  There are many benefits to EHC such as providing an excellent wear surface, a good corrosion barrier and it allows for surface restoration to dimensional tolerances during the repair and overhaul process.  EHC also provides a good sealing surface for hydraulic fluid.  However, due to EHC environmental and health hazard risks due to the presence of Hexavalent Chrome, the Under Secretary of Defense has directed all DOD Military Departments to invest in appropriate research and development on EHC substitutes and approve the use of alternatives where they can perform adequately for the intended application.    USAF has been implementing HVOF thermal spray coatings on HSS landing gear line of sight applications (ODs) for several years.  However, landing gear components still use EHC on non-line of sight areas and is in need of technology which will replace EHC for this application.  ES3 successfully completed a Phase I feasibility study that demonstrated the ability to apply coatings to non-line of sight surfaces of HSS landing gear components.  Of the three coating technologies investigate in Phase I there are two technologies that will be explored for full optimization during Phase II.   Magnetron Sputter   HVOF-ID    The objective of this effort is to develop and optimize coating systems that can replace EHC platings on non-line of sight surfaces of HSS substrates.  More specifically, numerous tests will be performed on the applied coatings to show that they posses the qualities necessary to make an acceptable coating.  The optimized coatings and systems can be specified for standard maintenance at USAF Air Logistic Centers (ALC&quot;s) and Navy Air Depots.  BENEFIT:  Research conducted to develop a coating process which can restore HSS non-line of sight surfaces of worn or damaged land gear components, focuses on military applications; however, benefits will be similar for all commercial &amp; military landing gear that need IDs restored to original dimensions.    ES3 expects the following benefits from the Magnetron Sputter or HVOF ID systems restoring the non-line of sight surfaces of HSS landing gear components based on both industry and in-house research:   Non-line of sight surfaces of worn or damage assets can be restored to serviceable condition in place of EHC.   Increased supportability of steel landing gear parts for USAF and commercial industry   Reduction in ownership cost for the USAF and commercial industry   Processes could be used to repair other aircraft parts including hydraulics",

Deploying traditional RF or microwave broadband direct line of sight (DLoS) links does not meet future warfighter needs.  A key thrust for the Air Force (AF) is Assured Access Communications.  This involves the pursuit of affordable low probability of intercept and detect (LPI/D) and anti-jam (AJ) DLoS transmission links to provide secure and survivable communications in anti-access / anti-denial (A2/AD) environments.  This capability is also critical at the tactical edge, where many legacy RF communication systems must operate in a spectrum congested environment or the warfighter faces challenging international spectrum licensing issues.  The solution will require hybrid spectrum transmission solutions which utilize advanced broadband and reliable free space optical communication systems.Space Photonics, Inc. (SPI), Harris Corporation (Harris), and SCHOTT North America, Inc. (SCHOTT NA) have partnered to address this challenge.  The overall goal is to advance SBIR funded optical tracking terminal technology (LaserFire) developed by SPI, integrate with a Harris-developed 10 Gbps dynamic buffering hybrid FSO/RF modem, and perform a demonstration at Langley AFB for ACC.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project focuses on the design and construction of a medical device that treats ischemic stroke by virtue of breaking-down endovascular occlusions using a proprietary Electro-Fluidic Thrombolysis (EFT) technology. EFT utilizes low energy electrical pulses to create acoustic micro shockwaves (along with vigorous fluidic effects) that will efficiently emulsify clot into sub-capillary size particles. This effect generates vigorous fluidic motion with no moving parts based solely on the interaction of short voltage pulses with conductive liquids (such as saline or blood). The electrical pulses are delivered via microelectrodes into an engineered tip design at the distal end of a catheter, causing a suction of the nearby occlusive material into the tip for further safe emulsification without causing any damage to the surrounding tissue. Currently available therapies to physicians offer low performance as they take hours to complete the treatment. In the case of clot-busting drugs, the added contraindications limit their use to less than 4% of the population. The expected speed and effectiveness of EFT will offer improved patient outcomes, and reduced costs; since in the case of stroke, lack of effective therapies are associated with enormous costs for rehabilitation and long term care. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the development of a disposable microcatheter that works as an intelligent delivery system along with an inexpensive voltage generator for the effective and safe emulsification of intracranial occlusions for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Ischemic Stroke remains the third leading cause of death in the US with approximately 20% of the nearly 700,000 annual victims dying shortly after the initial attack, while most survivors require full or part?time care. The understanding of the effects of short electrical pulses with conductive liquids (such as saline or blood) and the resultant mechanical and fluid-dynamic effects would be essential in transforming this technology to a true platform technology with several medical applications. Although the initial market focus is ischemic stroke, it is believed that this platform technology can also be used to recanalize coronary and peripheral vessels. The proposed approach to endovascular thrombolysis offers several advantages over drug therapy and other medical devices, including improved patient safety, more rapid recanalization and fewer contraindications.",

It uses intelligent sensing and drive control systems that work in cooperation with the driver to aid in negotiating changing terrain, avoiding obstacles/ collisions, and maintaining a straight path. Additionally, the system allows for higher-level path planning and the autonomous execution of non-linear routes of travel in a safe and efficient manner. The goal of the project is to enable active, safe, and independent living. The innovation is that as an individual begins to lose cognitive, perceptive, or motor function ? due to age, injury, or disease ? the system can augment that loss because it can interpret the user?s intent and it can ?see? out into the environment on their behalf. This exteroceptive sensing capability is enabled by leveraging the latest in 3D imaging technology. The team will exploit their experience in commercializing smart-EPW technologies (including acquiring FDA approval), and will apply the knowledge they have gained in developing autonomous driving solutions through their participation in the DARPA Urban Challenge. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will have significant impacts in the U.S. Socially, it will have a direct positive effect on the quality of life and independence of the elderly and disabled. Leveraging robotics for personal mobility can help Americans with disabilities to participate fully in basic activities such as employment, education, worship, recreation, and other activities of community life often taken for granted. Economically, a serious side effect of the rapidly growing elder population, to over 70 million by 2030, is that it will place unprecedented strains on the U.S. healthcare system. This impact can be moderated in part by enabling individuals to maintain their independence and live at home longer. It is estimated that adding a single month of independence and health to America?s elder population would save $5 billion, while decreasing hospitalization and institutionalization 10% would save $50 billion annually. As a result, technology for home-centered approaches to healthcare, such as the proposed system, are necessary. In research terms, while the immediate focus is in the field of assistive robotics, this research will be extendable to general field and service robotics as much of the work is related to 3D perception.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) Phase I project will entail the development of a microfluidic colorimetric analyzer to yield quantitative field measurements out of essential inorganic nutrients (initially nitrite and nitrate, thereafter ammonium and orthophosphate). This analyzer will primarily be used in industrial farms where algae are grown to produce biofuel. Inorganic nutrients affect not only the amount of algae biomass generated, but also its lipid content. Maximizing algae biofuel production requires a series of steps, each associated with an optimal nutrient concentration. The amount of nutrient must be measured on a frequent basis as the timescales associated with algae growth are short. Currently, nutrient concentration data is obtained at rates that are too slow to permit maximization of algae production. This problem is being addressed through the development of a small inexpensive colorimetric analyzer that will perform real-time measurement. The design of this instrument is optimized for prolonged unattended field operations, and minimal maintenance and consumption of supplies. It uses EPA-approved analytical chemistries. These have been selected because they are the least susceptible to interference from other compounds present in the algae bioreactors and/or ponds. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project effects US energy policy. The world is gradually running out of fossil oil. Renewable biofuels are increasingly seen as a key element of the US energy future. Algae, a source of oily biomass, are a leading candidate to meet biofuel needs. They can yield more fuel per acre than any other crops, they have the capability to grow in freshwater, as well as saltwater, and they are able to flourish in poor agricultural soil, which will reduce pressure on food prices. Furthermore, algae can grow using wastewater as nutrient feedstock. This reduces the ecological impact of wastewater discharges. Presently, the production of biofuel from algae is cost prohibitive due to high culturing and processing costs. Improving the management of inorganic nutrient levels in ponds and reactors where algae are grown will play a significant role in lowering biofuel production costs, ultimately making biofuels competitive with fossil fuels.",

The innovation lies in a novel thermal battery pack concept developed by Promethean Power Systems with a Phase I grant from the National Science Foundation. The battery solves a chronic unreliable electricity problem by converting and storing electrical energy in the form of thermal energy through a process of freezing and melting a material. The battery needs just five hours of grid electricity to charge and, once charged, provides constant cooling power on demand when the grid is off. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the introduction of clean energy technologies in refrigeration applications, eliminating costly spoilage of foods and providing clean energy alternatives to developing economies that currently rely on fossil-based fuels for their continued growth. In developing countries, billions of dollars of perishable foods are wasted annually because of inadequate cold-chain supply networks. A major obstacle in setting up a cold-chain network is the lack of reliable grid electricity to run refrigeration systems in villages and farming areas. In such conditions, diesel generators are often used as backup, a nonideal solution with high cost and environmental impact. Promethean?s thermal battery eliminates diesel generators and makes village refrigeration systems economically viable. This could revolutionize dairy industries around the world, especially in India, the largest producer and consumer of milk in the world, where nearly 400 million people depend on milk for their daily protein. Although Promethean?s first commercialization efforts are in India where thermal batteries are needed the most, these efforts will benefit US economy by providing a large and growing market to US products and affirming America?s leading role in spreading innovative ideas throughout the world.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project aims to engineer microbes for the cost-effective production of specialty chemicals. Currently, engineered microbial strains bear mutations that increase the production of chemicals of interest by inhibiting the cell&#039;s ability to produce off pathway chemicals. These &quot;loss-of-function&quot; mutations are critical as they effectively channel the cell&#039;s metabolic flux toward the product of interest. This both boosts the production efficiency and eases downstream purification by eliminating the accumulation of undesirable but chemically-similar contaminants. Unfortunately, these mutations may also decrease the fitness of the cells and, as a result, the growth media must be supplemented with costly nutrients. Technical research herein will assess the feasibility of applying novel regulated proteolysis technology to simultaneously direct maximal metabolic flux toward the target chemical of interest while avoiding the need to supplement the growth media. If successful, this technology would provide a great cost savings and enable fermentative production to be applied more broadly in the production of specialty chemicals. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a stable and cost-effective fermentative production route to a specialty chemical. Fermentative production of chemicals offers many advantages over traditional petrochemical or extraction-based production processes. Petrochemical production maintains the nation?s reliance on an unsustainable feedstock (oil) and also leads to national security issues as the US is largely dependent on foreign oil sources. Chemical production via extraction from plant materials also has ecological challenges. The process often uses toxic solvents, and may rely on unsustainable farming practices for many plants that are not traditional food crops. Engineered microbes fermented on sugar feedstock produced using high-efficiency agricultural practices offer a stable alternative for producing specialty chemicals, both in terms of supply and price.",

Current devices use single cell. MIM devices have significant advantages over single cell in efficiency and cost. A MIM device is composed of many sub-cells physically isolated on the same substrate. This proportionally increases output voltage and decreases output current resulting in lower internal power loss. To date there have been no publications describing MIM Ge or GaSb MIM devices. The Phase I Program demonstrated that high lifetime GaSb can be epitaxially grown on semi insulating GaAs and an IR &amp; D program demonstrated that 50 subcell MIM devices can be fabricated from epitaxial germanium on semi insulating GaAs. Combining these elements will produce an ideal device. Although the Ge MiM is suitable for TPV a GaSb MIM would give a three to tenfold improvement in performance.

Silicon emitter chips designed to transfer energy from a heat source in such a manner as to facilitate the formation of a sub-micron gap are currently being produced in a foundry as well as both single cell and MIM Ge devices. The unique housing that is required to contain these chips and allow insertion into an 1100 degree C furnace is designed/ fabricated at MTPV?s facility where power generation tests are conducted.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to further develop a novel computer vision based plant identification system for commercialization in agricultural weed control. This system will provide a cost competitive alternative to chemical herbicides, a global $20B market. Existing computer vision based approaches can segment a &#039;splotch&#039; of green vegetation from a brown background but are unable to provide the selectivity and precision necessary for mechanized, automated weeding. This project&#039;s objective is to create software algorithms that match the capability of the human eye and brain to quickly and reliably classify plants into crops and weeds in real-time. The project team will build a computer vision algorithm based on a hierarchical classifier. This classifier will utilize a field customized support vector machine (SVM) that uses point-of-interest rather than shape-based methods, a novel approach to visual object identification. The result of this research will be the creation of an algorithm integrated into an automated weeding system. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant, as the development of an alternative to chemical intensive agricultural weed control will impact technological understanding, create commercial opportunity, and positively impact society. Technologically, the project will advance the fields of computer vision and machine learning through development of a real-time, automated plant identification system based on point-of-interest and SVMs. Commercially, the system will offer conventional farmers an effective and chemical-free method to eliminate weeds, and it will offer organic farmers the first truly precise organic weed control method. The addressable market for weed control in food production is estimated to be $4B in the U.S. The system&#039;s ability to eliminate the use of chemical herbicides has a profound societal effect. U.S. farmers apply over 250M pounds of herbicide annually on corn and soybeans alone, with many unintended and detrimental side effects. Chemical concentrations in rivers, lakes and groundwater are rising, and the prevalence of herbicide resistant weeds is growing exponentially. An alternative to these chemicals limits society&#039;s exposure while protecting environmental integrity.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project focuses on the development of a high-yield fermentation route for the production of levulinic acid (LA). LA is one of the best-suited C5 building blocks for bio-refinery production due to higher value, broad applications, and likely quick adoption by the chemical industry. During Phase I, this project has designed and experimentally validated the concept of a novel fermentation pathway for the production of LA. The focus of this Phase II work will be to transition from this technical proof-of-concept to the development of a lab-scale fermentation process. The limiting enzymatic steps in the designed pathway will first be optimized to reach levels of activity consistent with the flux/yield required for economical production. Variants of the designed pathway incorporating the original and optimized enzymes will subsequently be cloned into suitable fermentation organism(s). Using computational and experimental metabolic engineering tools, knock-out and knock-down mutations will be performed to further optimize flux/yield in the pathway while optimizing for host cell growth. This work represents the first commercial application of enzyme design to rationally engineer novel metabolic pathway that do not have any natural counterpart, bringing us closer to the dream of designer cell factories. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the advancement of a U.S. green chemistry industry and to allow America to take the lead in the commercial production of a new renewable chemical building block. The lack of a high-yield alternative to costly thermo-chemical processes has been preventing widespread adoption of levulinic acid (LA). Because LA can be converted, chemically or biochemically, to synthetic rubber (through isoprene and butenes), bio-fuels (such as kerosene and HMF), polymers (for instance, nylons) and polymer additives (for changing polymer characteristics), the addressable market is in excess of $20B annually. When considered as the end product, LA trades at a considerable higher price than ethanol, the current product of most commercial bio-refineries, and thus can help diversify their product offering and considerably increase their margins.",

Current micro-turbines have prohibitively high costs due to complicated geometry and materials, but the proposed research will develop a micro-turbine with significantly lower manufacturing costs using a novel layered stackable architecture for the core micro-turbine engine. The primary research objectives are 1) to optimize micro-turbine components within the framework of the new proposed geometry using a combination of in-house numerical analysis and computational fluid dynamics, 2) to design application-specific peripherals and user interface for power generation at oil and gas wells - the proposed entry market, and 3) to build and test a field-ready prototype to validate the engine design and benchmark engine performance. The result of the proposed project is a compact, and low-maintenance 10kW micro-turbine power generator that will be produced for lower than $500 per kW. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is greatly increased commercial viability of micro-turbine power generators. The primary advantages of micro-turbines are portability, fuel flexibility, and low maintenance. Micro-turbines do not have significant market share due to prohibitively high upfront costs, but the proposed technology will bring costs down and enable micro-turbines to gain significant traction in many markets, including emergency response, oil and gas well power generation, and other remote/distributed power generation applications. Due to their portability, micro-turbine generators can be deployed quickly in emergency situations. Due to their fuel flexibility, implementing micro-turbines can significantly reduce the costs associated with the fuel supply chain, for example, associated gases that would otherwise be flared at oil/gas wells can be used to power equipment onsite. Due to their low maintenance, microturbines can be adopted where operating costs can be prohibitive for reciprocating engines. Lastly, the proposed project will lead to reduced carbon footprint by efficiently using fuel that would be otherwise wasted (as in the case of flare gas), reduce other toxic emissions via more efficient combustion.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses a critical need for accurate patient diagnosis in the development of effective therapeutics for Alzheimer&#039;s Disease and other dementias, and in patient treatment. The high variability of patients selected for dementia clinical trials, including misdiagnosis, has been a significant contributor to the high failure rates of these trials. The diagnostic under development in this grant would provide an important way to reduce misdiagnosis and patient variability. A main objective of Phase II is to expand the glucose metabolism dementia diagnostic developed in Phase I to be capable of analyzing amyloid PET images and structural magnetic resonance images (MRI), and to combine data from one or more of these imaging modalities into an optimal diagnostic and prognostic assessment. The research will include the development, refinement and testing of: single-modality analysis methods that identify the type of dementia that a patient has, single-modality analysis methods that place the patient along a scale of disease severity, methods that combine and optimize information from multiple imaging modalities, and automated software to conduct these analyses. In addition, reports will be further developed and refined with feedback from physicians and pharmaceutical partners to clearly communicate results. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the ability to address a major barrier of patient variability in achieving successful clinical trials, thus increasing the opportunity to find effective therapeutics for Alzheimer&#039;s Disease and other dementias. More than 6 million persons in the U.S. alone are affected by these dementias, with a societal cost estimated at more than $400 billion. This population is rapidly growing as the population ages, and the need to effectively identify and treat patients is urgent. The use of the technology to screen patients for clinical trials and stratify them for analysis is expected to be of immense value to pharmaceutical companies and is an initial commercial opportunity. Already, the developments of Phase I are in use for projects with two such companies. The ability to accurately diagnose patients will help to address the need to correctly treat these patients. The project will result in job creation as the initial service model and subsequent product model are implemented. Finally, by allowing characterization of the subjects in clinical trials, this project will aid in the scientific understanding of the progression of disease and its relationship to symptoms and response to therapy.",

Lithium-sulfur batteries with a long cycle-life are a potentially disruptive technology in the $11-$13 billion lithium-ion battery market because of their three to fourfold energy density advantage over existing chemistry platforms. The technical objectives of this Phase II proposal include the optimization of the electrochemical performance of Sulfur-Carbon composite materials as well developing and implementing scalable unit processes for materials and cell manufacturing. This project will assemble and test pouch cells in sufficient quantities to demonstrate&gt;600Wh/kg operation for 700 cycles with minimal product-to-product variability and reliable performance. Success in Phase II will provide an important pathway to receiving institutional venture funding and building joint-development partnerships to successfully transition NOHMs unique Li-S battery technology to commercial markets. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant. Secondary lithium-sulfur batteries employing sulfur as the cathode and metallic lithium as the anode offers the highest energy storage potential of any two solid elements. They offer more than twice the specific energy of currently deployed lithium ion battery technology with half the weight. Li-ion batteries currently have a $14 billion market and are expected to reach $44 billion by 2020. They account for close to 75% of all secondary (rechargeable) batteries used in portable electronics. If the potential of these batteries can be harnessed and scaled economically, they are expected to disrupt current lithium ion cell technology because of their higher energy density and the low cost and wide-spread availability of sulfur. Li-S batteries could transform the mobile device market, the electric vehicle market, and energy storage market, enabling greater efficiency and power in all those sectors.",

        "abstract": "To address the lack of treatment options for lymphedema patients we propose the use of nanopatterned collagen thread-like scaffolds (threads) designed to create new lymphatic channels. We have engineered these nanopatterned threads to closely mimic the native structure of vascular endothelial wall and we find that they provide a favorable environment for lymphatic endothelial cells. The nanopatterned thread aligns the endothelial cells, and regulates their migration along the direction of the nanofibrils. This morphological change is associated with beneficial functional effects, such as reduced expression of endothelial adhesion molecules, and reduced adhesiveness for inflammatory cells. The material enhances human endothelial cell survival after implantation in immunodeficient mice. Finally, the nanopatterned threads enhance perfusion in the murine model of limb ischemia, indicating that the threads may act to enhance the development of collateral channels, perhaps by serving as a favorable environment for endothelial cell proliferation and migration. The nanopatterned thread properties will be tested in rabbit and pig animal models. We plan to upgrade current manufacturing process to GMP grade, and to develop a novel minimally invasive catheter/trocar system for subcutaneous thread delivery, for example, across an area of surgical scar. The optimized nanopatterned thread may also be complexed with VEGF-C.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  We propose to develop a comprehensive, integrated software framework and toolset to support model-based engineering (MBE) of laser weapons systems.  To be effective, MBE requires robust underlying modeling and simulation technologies capable of modeling all the pertinent systems, subsystems, components, effects, and interactions at any level of fidelity that may be required in order to support crucial design decisions at any point in the system development lifecycle. Very often the greatest technical challenges are posed by systems involving interactions that cut across two or more distinct scientific or engineering domains; even in cases where there are excellent tools available for modeling each individual domain, generally none of these domain-specific tools can be used to model to the cross-domain interactions.  In order to fully support MBE for laser weapons systems we need to be able to bring all these capabilities into a single integrated framework, sharing a single unified representation of the system under development, so that design information can be effectively shared across the project, and the engineering team can function better as a team.  BENEFIT:  The proposed effort is ambitious, and the potential significance is commensurate.  If we are able to meet all of our technical objectives, and if the proposed integrated toolset then wins acceptance among laser system engineers, it could swiftly become ubiquitous and invaluable in laser systems engineering.  In civilian applications it has been shown that simulation-based development and acquisition can yield superior end-products in less time, and at lower cost.  Military applications and advanced technologies present some special challenges, but the proposed environment would address those challenges.  The net result would be shorter development times, lower development costs, and better, more robust systems.  In any application, military or commercial, this would translate into money saved; in military applications it would also translate into a more effective fighting force.",

It can be used to rapidly transform existing instructional content into an expert model and ITS.      In Phase II Eduworks will develop and optimize a prototype that implements this process. The prototype will leverage Eduworks Semantic Technology Engine and be tested in multiple domains. It will be used to produce model-tracing dialog-based tutors and constraint-based tutors. The Student Information Model for Integrated Learning Environments (SIMILE) developed by Engineering &amp; Computer Simulations, Inc. will be used to map events in virtual worlds to expert models produced by the prototype. Results will be independently evaluated by researchers at the Institute for Intelligent Systems at the University of Memphis.",

        "abstract": "Traumatic injuries, especially in the combat setting, are often associated with significant tissue loss and morbidity. Immediate reconstruction is often needed to prevent further morbidity and degradation of soldier health status. Novel regenerative medicine approaches, including grafting of engineered tissue have the potential to address this problem. However, the absence of adequate tools for testing tissue morphology and viability before grafting makes this process very difficult. Thus, there is an urgent need for a technology that will enable real time, noninvasive, three-dimensional quantitative assessment of growing ex vivo engineered tissue to assess cell state and viability, microstructure, and overall tissue state and maturity for transplantation.   In a Phase I study, Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) in collaboration with the Center for Regenerative Medicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), investigated the use of combined Raman spectroscopy-high resolution optical imaging for in vitro characterization of engineered tissue constructs. The Phase I study has successfully demonstrated the suitability of this approach for nondestructive characterization of tissue constructs. As a result, an advanced instrument, suitable for research use at MGH, Center for Regenerative Medicine is proposed to be developed and fully evaluated in a Phase II study.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Wind-turbine induced clutter is currently affecting air surveillance radar installations worldwide. The growing need for renewable energy sources will likely drive wind farm construction rates to increase over time. Energy department estimates indicate 2.3% of the current US electric energy supply is supplied by wind and estimates this to rise to 20% by 2030, representing an increase of nearly 10x the number of wind turbines. Wind-turbine induced clutter is fundamentally different from typical ground clutter in that the rotating turbines appear Doppler shifted to the radar in the same way as airborne moving targets. Moreover, wind farms present the radar system with a relatively high density of false targets.   STR&quot;s proposed approach to wind-turbine induced clutter mitigation is based on characterization of the clutter followed by adaptive filtering to simultaneously suppress the clutter and preserve target responses. This approach is designed to address the problems of multiple turbines in a single range cell as well as short CPI and asynchronous scanning.  The Phase 1 study indicates that the STR approach is well suited for this challenge. Significant clutter reduction while preserving targets was achieved and verified on measured ATC radar data. SINR improvements of over 20 dB were observed.  BENEFIT:  If the proposed Phase 2 approach is successful a software upgrade path for existing ATC radars will be designed and demonstrated that mitigates wind farm interference. This upgrade will allow for construction of wind farms near ATC radars without concerns for significant performance degradation.",

For accuracy and modeling flexibility the proposed codes are based on the fast, high-order frequency-domain algorithms put forth recently by our team-which can accurately and efficiently resolve both low- and high-frequency behavior while accounting for scattering, transmission and absorption by metallic, dielectric and magnetic components. These solvers have provided some of the most efficient PDE solution methods in existence: they can successfully tackle electrically large problems in complex engineering geometries, including problems which are significantly beyond the capabilities of the most competitive alternative solvers. Our novel parallel CPU implementations of these algorithms, in turn, demonstrate a high degree of parallel efficiency. Our overall approach to in-situ antenna optimization, finally, relies on a combination of classical gradient-based optimization methods together with a new technique based on use of&quot;low-rank electromagnetic bases&quot;, which can yield a large number of scattering solutions (and thus, enable efficient optimization algorithms) from a limited number of actual solution runs.",

Current optical transmitter solutions are composed of discrete components which are relatively large and consume too much power for meeting or scaling to the bandwidth needs of advanced communications networks.  Aurrions approach is to integrate all the optical components into a single semiconductor chip, enabling small form factor, low power transceivers with bandwidths of 100Gb/s and higher.  The overall goal of this project is to design, fabricate, and test a 100 Gb/s coherent transmitter chip which can satisfy the OIF 100G standard and is compatible with small form factor pluggable module packaging which enable higher performance networks.  In phase I, Aurrion used established modeling and design tools to validate the performance of key photonic component and circuit designs with respect to key performance metrics derived from the OIF 100G standard. Performance simulations and initial circuit layouts indicate that designs are sufficient for meeting key metrics. Phase II is focused on demonstrating the photonic components and circuits necessary to demonstrate a 100 Gb/s coherent transmitter that is compatible with the OIF 100G standard and capable of insertion into a small form factor pluggable module. Package design, optical link simulations, and experimental data will be used to assess the feasibility of commercializing Aurrions heterogeneous photonic integrate circuits (PICs) in a packaged 100 Gb/s coherent transceiver module.Commercial Applications and Benefits: If successful, the technology developed under this program will be used in telecom metro networks and datacenter communications networks. It is anticipated that the inherent size advantage that such a photonic chip would have over discrete optics solutions that exist in the marketplace would allow for much tighter integration through the use of much smaller pluggable modules and thereby enable higher performance networks.",

This technology should eliminate the power associated with driving signals outside of the package.  The component must be capable of 336 Gbps data transmission over a -55 to 100 C temperature range with less than 1.3 Watt of power consumption.  This innovation to fiber optic component technology increases the performance, reduces the size and reduces the power consumption of optical communications within dense network systems, such as advanced distributed computing systems and data centers.  VCSEL technology is enabling short-reach ( &amp; lt;100 m) 100 Gbps optical interconnections over multi-mode fiber in commercial applications.  VCSEL technology offers low power consumption ( &amp; lt; 10 mW/Gbps, un-cooled) and low cost data links.  The placement of fiber optic components within the ASIC assembly reduces the board level complexity and power consumption associated with the routing high speed signals over copper traces.  To achieve this package integration, the component must be compatible with lead-free solder reflow temperature extremes.  Concepts to reduce power through automatic measurement of the operating conditions (optical link loss, electrical eye opening, etc.) will be investigated.Commercial Applications and Benefits: This technology will address the evolution of data transmission requirements, as the trend continues to implement optical components in close proximity to the data source/sink.  The goal is to photonics to drastically increasing the transmission bandwidth available to high-performance ASICs.  In the area of high-speed data transmission, the limitations of copper as a transmission media related to the absorption and dispersion of the energy in the printed circuit board (PCB) material are evident.  Their limitations point towards fiber optics and the inherent speed and latency advantages of light in future design trends for ultra high-speed data transmissions.  It is expected that optical transmission will be the definitive solution to certain PCB connectivity issues where it will become virtually impossible to route enough bandwidth at the box-to-box, backplane, circuit board and ultimately to the ASIC.",

        "abstract": "The manufacturing and engineering industry needs more cost effective and easy-to-use high- performance  computing  (HPC)  modeling  and  simulation  tools  to  design,  test,  and  analyze innovative components and products. For 92% of the small- to medium-sized manufacturers with less than 100 employees, an HPC system is most likely not part of their development environment. This class of manufacturers typically relies on two-dimensional computer-aided design software and a limited amount of desktop modeling and simulation software. This under-utilization of HPC tools by this class of manufactures is of chief concern to the Department of Energy. The  proposed  simulation  framework  and  suite  of  tools  will  be  developed  with  one  eye  on eliminating the barriers to adoption of HPC modeling and simulation tools for manufacturing and engineering, and the other eye on increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of manufacturing and engineering practices in solving real-world problems. By using these tools, manufacturers will be able to improve their design cycles and reduce their need of developing expensive physical prototypes. In Phase I, a framework referred to as the Simulation Model Based Architecture was developed, capable of supporting the entire lifecycle of a simulation. The approach used was to leverage existing open-source toolkits wherever possible so that the resulting system could also be distributed as open-source. The system provided several mechanisms by which HPC systems can be leveraged. In Phase II, the major focus will be improving the ease of use of the system and extending its core functionality.  To  address  ease  of  use,  the  customization  capabilities  will  be  enhanced  and workflow wizards will be developed to guide the user through their specific simulation workflow. In terms of core functionality, the modeling and meshing capabilities will be enhanced and the mechanisms for data exchange with various simulation environments will be improved. In addition, more complex workflows such as design optimization will be supported. Modular frameworks such as the one proposed here lend themselves to a service business model; vendors with the skills to provide technology integration services can partner with their customers and collaborators to build valuable, competitive products and services. Such an open, modular framework provides significant business opportunities. Beyond the manufacturing community, the technology developed here will also benefit the larger scientific computing community since the code will be released under open source licenses (non-reciprocal Apache or BSD) within open source communities. Thus researchers, educators, and commercial enterprises will be able tune the suite to their particular workflow, easily research specialized areas of interest, and leverage international communities to develop leading edge technology.",

This is particularly true in regard to buildings, which account for 40% of the total energy used in America.  Currently, energy use in buildings can be assessed through energy-modeling software during the design process or during post-occupancy, once the building is commissioned. But, these metrics are often autonomous from one-another, and not comprehensive.  The overarching goal of this project is to develop High Performance Computing support tools that address energy-efficiency and performance demands in buildings.  This is accomplished by creating an executive software platform that monitors and makes decisions based on input from: (i) sensor networks integrated into a physical building; and (ii) energy-modeling simulations run on a computer, working in collaboration.  The executive program accurately calibrates the energy model to the physical building, provides fault and damage detection feedback to building managers, and establishes the groundwork for predictive controls to optimize building operation.  Phase I research produced a working and viable proof of principle prototype of the system, which has been successfully proven effective in calibration and fault detection problems against a simple and well controlled test chamber.  Phase II goals include expansion of the executive program and sensor networks to handle all of the sensor and simulation needs of large scale commercial and industrial buildings.

Also, the increasing ubiquity of parallel hardwaremulti-core  chips, parallel co-processors and accelerators, near effortless cluster computing on cloud infrastructurespush new and existing high-performance computing (HPC) users to move to parallel programming.  Unfortunately, the gap is increasing between the available performance offered by HPC systems and the available usability of the software packages used to program them.  We propose to develop a distributed HPC framework composed of three open-source software packages in the user-friendly and expressive Python language.  This framework builds on the success of Phase I by (i) continuing the development of improved PyTrilinos wrappers, (ii) by implementing a general distributed array package modeled after NumPy and, (iii) by providing functionality to easily import external routines into Python, including parallel code.  This Python HPC framework will make parallel computing easier to use by bringing the user-friendly NumPy interface to HPC, more intuitive by reducing the mental overhead required to work with parallel distributed arrays, and more useful by enabling access to parallel distributed solvers.  PyTrilinos wrappers were expanded to wrap fundamental components of the second-generation Tpetra package, providing a basis for further expansion of PyTrilinos wrappers.  The second Phase I success was that the Optimized Distributed NumPy package was designed and deemed feasible from both a technical and business perspective.  A distributed HPC framework will be created to provide commonality for parallel programming in Python and allow easy access to external HPC libraries.  This includes building on the research and development of Phase I by continuing the PyTrilinos expansion and implementing the distributed array package designed in Phase I, as well as a third package that easily integrates external code into Python and compiles specific routines.

        "abstract": "Problems of large-scale nonlinear optimization are central to the solution of difficult and novel problems that arise from the need to distribute electric power in the most efficient and reliable way. In recognition of the importance of optimization in this area, DOE &amp; apos;s Office of Advanced Scientific Computing (ASCR) has made substantial investments in research that have led to powerful, robust software for very general classes of nonlinear optimization problems. There remains however a substantial need to extend and adapt these efforts to better take advantage of high-performance computing (HPC) and to unlock their value for new users.  Power industry optimization is a particularly promising area for such an undertaking, in light of the complex decisions involved and the challenges of changing costs and technologies.  We propose to focus on three complementary areas of investigation to meet this need. First, we will re-engineer nonlinear optimization software, previously developed with ASCR support, so as to take advantage of high-performance computing (HPC) concepts that address energy efficiency problems too large for current codes. Second, we will adapt and focus software technology from previous work for ASCR to address the specific needs of power grid applications, in which HPC techniques are needed in order to re-optimize very quickly a large number of problems of similar structure. Lastly we will develop new software techniques for tackling complex, large-scale power applications that model disjunctive conditions. All of these initiatives will strengthen the internals of algorithms to give the software wider applicability in HPC settings and to better deal with greatly increased problem size and complexity due to uncertainty. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: This work will be of direct public benefit by enabling scarce and costly resources to be used much more effectively for purposes of power distribution.  The first area of investigation will be applied in particular to optimal power flow with contingencies and to short-term stochastic dispatch for systems with a high level of renewable penetration. The second area will be applied in improving grid short-term management, from both technical and economic stand- points, particularly in taking full advantage of new demand side management and generation technologies to reduce costs and environmental impact subject to security constraints.  The third area will allow for the solution of more complex power flow optimization models, including for example the ability to switch on/off various power production constraints.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses the need for new widespread datasets to help reduce uncertainties in current predictions of climate change and to improve our understanding of the health impacts of air pollutants.  The development of a new, compact instrumentation package for unmanned aerial vehicles will include modules to measure aerosol size distributions, cloud condensation nucleus concentrations, ambient turbulence and to acquire digital images.  A coupled electrical-mobility and light-scattering-based aerosol number size distribution measurement system will provide rapid airborne observations over the 0.01 to 10 micrometer diameter range.  A condensation particle counter that has already operated on-board an unmanned aerial vehicle will serve as the small particle detector. The compact cloud condensation nucleus counter allows the cloud nucleating ability of particles to be determined and will be optimized using Computational Fluid Dynamics modeling. The large particle sizer development will focus on reducing the sizing uncertainties associated with existing light-scattering techniques that suffer from multi-valued Mie scattering response. Prototypes of the mobility classifier, cloud condensation nucleus counter and optical particle counter will be fabricated and tested against conventional scanning differential mobility sizing and other systems using traceable calibration particles.  Prototypes of the turbulence and imaging systems will be constructed and tested under ambient conditions.  During the Phase II project, the prototype of the miniaturized turbulence system will be inter-compared with commercially available hot film anemometers deployed within a wind tunnel facility with controllable turbulence levels.  Imaging technology will be integrated with the instrument payload microprocessor-based control electronics to allow characterization of land and ocean surfaces during aerial vehicle flights. The overall development project will build upon six years of existing UAV instrument development, in particular the deployment of aerosol instruments (particle counter, light absorption and filter-based chemical composition measurements) on-board an unmanned aerial vehicle over the Arctic during the spring of 2011. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The new technology will help mitigate measurement limitations in applications that include creation of new and expanded data sets for climate change and urban air quality models, aerosol health effects studies, flux measurements of aerosol species from ocean and land surfaces, studies of rapid aerosol evolution in power-plant plumes, and indoor air quality monitoring for green buildings, industry and households.",

        "abstract": "In atmospheric aerosol research, size-distributed aerosol samples are often collected with airborne instrumentation, but are not analyzed in any manner until after they are brought to a laboratory on the ground. The information thus obtained is averaged for all the locations covered during the mission. A novel technology is being developed in this project to constantly measure the size-distributed mass and hygroscopic behavior of aerosols during the flight while samples are collected. This project addresses the Department of Energys interest in measurement of airborne aerosol size distributions using instruments onboard aircrafts, and addresses a key need in understanding the role of aerosols in cloud formation.  Cascade impactors are a reliable and traditional method for collecting size-distributed aerosol samples. Each stage of a cascade impactor collects aerosols of a certain narrow size range. MSPs MOUDI impactors are industry standard for research-grade impactor measurements. To address the present needs, this project has focused on incorporating a microbalance with rapid electronic measurement of the mass of collected particles on each stage of the cascade impactor. Further, we have sought microbalances that would be sensitive to moisture gain and loss by the collected sample, and measure aerosol hygroscopicity.  In Phase I of this project we evaluated the feasibility of two different approaches to meet the above need. A MEMS device was tested as a microbalance, because of the anticipated high sensitivity of the device. A highly sensitive device would have allowed us to reduce the overall instrument size. However, the MEMS devices had typically an unstable baseline reading in the presence of an air flow (e.g., while sampling) and proved to be difficult to use. We also tested impedance-based quartz crystal microbalances (IQCM) on several stages of a cascade impactor. These IQCM sensors provided sub-nanogram resolution in measuring deposited aerosols. We found that the IQCM sensors provide a cleanable smooth surface for particle deposition and one that can be exposed to high and low-humidity air without affecting the sensor performance. This attribute is ideal for measuring moisture uptake and relative humidity values at which deliquescence and efflorescence happens. Further, we developed microelectronics that eliminates noise and enables digitizing signals as early as possible and processing them at the sensor site to determine the resonance frequency within a fraction of a second in a digital form.  In Phase II, we plan to build two cascade impactors with real-time mass measuring ability on five stages covering the 10-nm to 600-nm size range. Incoming air will be heated to dry the aerosols and maintain low humidity condition. In a basic mode of operation, one of the impactors will measure the dry aerosol mass, whereas the flow to the second impactor will be humidified and dehumidified to detect the point at which deliquescence starts during the rising phase of the humidity, which would last long enough to measure the moisture uptake on each stage. The relative humidity for efflorescence will be determined during the falling phase of the humidity. These cascade impactors with the ability to measure real-time mass and hygroscopicity will be made flight-worthy and be available with a complete software package enabling a skilled user to operate the instrument and acquire the data. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Following a successful Phase II project, MSP will develop a similar product for this research market, such as MSPs current MOUDI customers. Further, a simpler and lower cost device will be developed for PM2.5 monitoring, aimed at the air quality compliance marketplace. In addition to providing the mass of fine particles (smaller than 2.5 micron), this device will have the unique ability to determine the hygroscopicity of the collected sample, enabling the user to estimate a particle-related visibility index, which is expected to become a part of future clean air standards, because it is now well-established that particulate matter is often responsible for atmospheric haze and poor visibility conditions.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this project is the development of a compact, high precision and fast response instrument that can simultaneously measure all four major greenhouse gasescarbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and water vapor.  By selecting different lasers the same instrument can measure other sets of gases.  The precision and response speed will be sufficient for emission measurements by means of correlation with wind fluctuations (eddy correlation method), or by correlation with a tracer gas.  Rapid, precise and simultaneous measurement of all the major greenhouse gases allows researchers to gain a comprehensive picture of emission processes in the natural environment, and to distinguish natural from industrial sources. Measurement of tracer gases, such as ethane and nitrous oxide along with methane, can be used to quantify emissions during natural gas drilling and production operations. The instrument is based on quantitative spectroscopy with a pair of mid-infrared lasers. This development draws upon and extends trace gas measurement technology developed at Aerodyne Research, Inc that has yielded the most precise field-ready trace gas instruments presently available, which define the state of the art.  We can routinely measure gases at the part-per-trillion level and observe changes in the concentration of gases with a precision of one part in 10,000 (0.1 per mil) in 1s. This new instrument will have reduced size optics and electronics, allowing operation of two lasers in the space currently needed for one.  The new instrument will be smaller, more capable and less costly than present instruments.  During Phase 1 we explored several approaches to reduce the size of the instrument optical system, and have outlined an innovative optical design that will be implemented in Phase 2.  During Phase 1 we have learned how to operate two lasers of different types (quantum cascade and 3 m diode) in the same instrument and have gained experience with new 3 micron wavelength lasers that allow very sensitive measurement of hydrocarbons. During Phase 1 we have employed such a 3 micron laser in a field measurement of methane and ethane, in order to identify the source of methane in an urban area.  During Phase 2 we will complete the detailed design of the new compact two laser instrument for multiple gases.  We plan to produce two different versions and employ them in two different field measurements, in collaboration with Harvard University. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The availability of a field-ready compact high precision instrument for the simultaneous measurement of four greenhouse gases (or the isotopologues of two greenhouse gases) will find wide use in research on the carbon cycle and greenhouse gases. We can change the lasers and measure other sets of gases for other research and monitoring purposes.  The same instrument will have other applications in the energy sector, such as measuring emissions of methane in natural gas production, or on-site isotopic analysis during drilling operations.",

        "abstract": "Ecological processes lead to distinctive isotope patterns.  Measuring the isotopic signatures provide answers to fundamental questions on bio-productivity and energy cycling and give clues to the origin of life and evolution. Consequently, isotopic data hold keys to predicting future climate changes that may influence global temperature, energy needs, availability of drinking water, and food supplies. Carbon isotopes are most important for understanding of biochemistry but measuring only one isotope is insufficient. Several key isotopes will provide main constraints on the processes. Currently mass  spectrometers  are  used  for  isotopic  measurements  but  they  require  deep  vacuum  and  time- consuming dissolution of samples prior to analysis. Thus, the isotopes cannot be measured in the field.  Applied Spectra invented a new technology: Laser Ablation Molecular Isotopic Spectrometry (LAMIS) that provides real-time isotopic measurements at atmospheric pressure directly in the field.  The  ability  of  LAMIS  for  simultaneous  elemental  and  isotopic  analysis,  including  depth profiling and chemical mapping makes it a useful tool for carbon sequestration in climate change studies.  The feasibility of LAMIS for carbon and nitrogen isotopes was demonstrated in Phase I. We completed calculations and experiments to verify high sensitivity of LAMIS to sub-natural abundances.  The proposed development for Phase II includes methods, sampling protocols and chemometric multivariate calibration for high accuracy and sensitivity in C, N, H isotopic measurements.  LAMIS spectra will be correlated to the standard isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). The LIBS-LAMIS hardware components and final configuration will be established in Phase II.  An overall goal is to integrate LAMIS technology in a prototype commercial instrument, providing rapid LIBS and LAMIS measurements at the same time. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: LAMIS has a significant potential for multiple commercial applications. It is poised to speed up, to simplify and to make isotopic analysis more affordable than at present. We anticipate applications in ecological and agronomical studies, carbon sequestration, natural gas and oil exploration, medical diagnostics and therapies, forensics, homeland security, paleoclimatology, material sciences, biological research and life sciences.  LAMIS will revolutionize isotopic measurements. No other technology provides isotopic ratio measurements at atmospheric pressure and without a mass spectrometer. We believe this project will be carried over into Phase III and beyond. A large area of future applications is related to the Marcellus shale gas exploration: C and H isotopes will help distinguish Marcellus organics from other organics.",

        "abstract": "Through the creation of carbon neutral biofuels and environmentally friendly methods for chemical and pharmaceutical synthesis, synthetic biology hopes to produce biology-based solutions to some of the worlds grand challengesdisease, energy supply, and pollution.  Many of these challenging problems require the discovery of genes, proteins, and metabolic pathways with new and different chemistries.   Nature is a vast repository of genetic and chemical diversity, and by extracting the genomes of microbial communities (i.e. the metagenome) from environmental samples, it is possible to identify genes for these biotechnology applications. However, gene identification currently requires both large sequencing efforts and massive screens of recombinant bacterial cells using slow and labor-intensive plate based assays.  This platform technology uses an innovative microfluidic cell-sorting technology that will revolutionize the process of gene annotation for synthetic biology. This device physically implements simple yet powerful computer search algorithms as fluidic circuits in a microfluidic chip, and has the potential to screen a single strain out of billions based on the activity of secreted enzymes. This will enable us to rapidly search libraries of millions of E. coli expressing diverse metagenomic DNA for useful secreted enzymes and other gene products.  During Phase I we demonstrated proof of concept of the device by using our prototype device to sort a single luciferase secreting yeast cell out of a heterogenous population that was not producing the enzyme.  During the grant period we built and tested the prototype microfluidic device, engineered luciferase secreting yeast and e coli strains and used them to demonstrate the power of the microfluidic device.  Lastly we created an E. coli library expressing  diverse  metagenomic  DNA  from  sites  likely  to  contain  bacteria  that  produce enzymes with lignocellulose degrading capabilities.  As part of our initial proof of concept for our device, we are using our device to discover metagenomic genes for enzymes that degrade cellulose, and more specifically lignocellulose. These enzymes are essential for cellulosic ethanol biofuel productionefficient lignocellulose catalysis is currently the bottleneck in development of this technology.   We created metagenomic libraries created from soil samples and use our device to identify variants producing enzymes for these two applications.  During the Phase II grant, we have three aims: (i) develop our core sorting technology, (ii) use it to identify microbial genes for enzymes catalyzing lignocellulose breakdown for use in cellulosic biofuel production, and (iii) develop the technology as a standalone system. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Our product and our service will both address the need for research and development of enzymes with novel functions for the $3 billion enzyme market.  We will meet this growing need by disrupting the current paradigm of one colony at a time plate-based assays; accelerating the pace of scientific discovery.",

Long-term monitoring and maintenance is one of the largest costs of environmental management.  This project is developing a compact analyzer for measuring chromium ions in ground water that should significantly reduce the cost of monitoring the presence of this metal.  The Phase I project investigated a novel detection strategy that allows sensitive measurement using a micro-cavity.  The sensitivity demonstrated in Phase I was comparable to the levels found in drinking water, fully demonstrating the analytical precision of this approach.  The Phase II research will address ways to minimize interference from other chemical species, build the optical, electronic, and sample-handling subsystems, assemble a hand-held analyzer, and characterize it in the laboratory and in the field.  Measurements at the well head will be compared to results from the existing approach, which is to send sample bottles to a lab for analysis. Ultimately an automated version of the system will be placed in the well itself, so that the labor cost of going to the well also is eliminated.  Measurements at the well head should eliminate the ongoing cost of mailing and analyzing samples, and should improve decision making and measurement quality by eliminating the four to five day wait between sampling and measurement results.

        "abstract": "Monitoring mercury contamination in groundwater, surface water, and other natural environments is challenging and expensive, and because samples have to be collected in the field and analyzed in a laboratory, there is a long delay before results are available.  The expense of monitoring limits the number of samples researchers collect, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of mercury contamination.  The delay in the availability of results makes it difficult to remediate subsurface mercury contamination, because it can take months to accurately trace a contaminant plume to its source.  The lack of mercury data leads to uninformed public health and environmental management decisions.  To address these problems, we have developed a prototype instrument that collects water samples and analyzes them for total mercury in the field.  It does not use any reagents, which makes it inexpensive to operate and allows it to run for periods of weeks to months without human intervention.  It measures mercury with an atomic fluorescence detector, giving it sufficient sensitivity and range for both natural and contaminated systems.  The instrument can be monitored and controlled and data can be accessed by Wi-Fi, cellular, or satellite data network from a web browser on a computer or smartphone.  During Phase I of this project, we built a working prototype that quantitatively measures mercury but cannot run unattended for long periods of time.  During Phase II, we will refine the design of the instrument and several components to improve its unattended runtime and prepare it for extended field testing.  We will field test one instrument near our offices in Seattle, and will send four others to potential customers for beta testing at sites around the country.  These beta testers represent a wide range of potential applications of the new instrument: from monitoring of natural surface water, to contaminated groundwater monitoring, to wastewater treatment plant optimization. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Once commercialized, the instrument will have numerous benefits for the mercury research and regulatory community and the public. It will greatly lower the cost of field sampling and analysis, which will enable much more mercury monitoring than is currently possible. It will make real-time data available both to researchers in the field and to the public via the internet. Enhanced mercury data availability will lead to better regulatory and environmental management decisions to protect public health, and will lead to a public better-informed about the water quality around them.

The research project is developing an affordable, sensitive, durable and low-maintenance in situ sensor capable of real-time, long-term measurement of hexavalent chromium in groundwater wells at contaminated sites.  The chromate ion, which is the dominant form of hexavalent chromium in groundwater, can be measured at low concentrations using near- ultraviolet absorption spectrophotometry. Interference caused by suspended particulate matter (turbidity) can be accurately compensated by measuring the amount of ultraviolet light scattered by the turbidity.

Special emphasis will be on long-term stability; automated instrument control, diagnostics, and data processing; and multi-well pilot- scale field testing and data integration.

        "abstract": "Ground and surface water contamination from anthropogenic sources is an important problem that must be monitored and remediated to protect the environment and human health.  Dangerously high levels of chromium, cobalt and uranium have been reported in groundwater and soils at multiple Superfund sites from improper waste disposal or unintentional leeching.  Contamination in subsurface environment is also a problem in industrialized areas, where waste from plating and other industries has been improperly disposed of into the groundwater.  Monitoring these heavy metals is critical to public and environmental safety, particularly if contamination enters or is at risk of entering a water supply.  The overall objective of the proposed program  is to address subsurface water and soil monitoring  needs by developing a portable, real-time electrochemical sensor for the measurement of toxic metal compounds (chromium, cobalt and uranium) in water and soil digestions/extracts, using a novel combination of an advanced electrode material with a micro-fabricated electrode geometry and a sensitive voltammetric detection  algorithm  for high sensitivity and low interference.  Current monitoring methods require collection and shipment of samples to well-equipped laboratories for chemical analysis, which is time consuming and involves expensive instrumentation operated and maintained by trained personnel.  A field-deployable monitor for determination of cobalt, chromium and uranium in water at ppb levels would avoid these problems.  The Phase I program demonstrated the feasibility of Giners electrochemical technology by real-time detection of Cr(III), Cr(VI), and Co(II) at concentration levels down to 25 parts-per-billion (ppb) in control solutions samples.  Extensive interference testing demonstrated the strength of the detection algorithms in the presence of common groundwater and soil constituents.  While challenges remain, the Phase I program successfully validated Giners approach to create a compact device for measurement of multiple heavy metals in subsurface environments.  The Phase II program will include sensor and instrument refinements and extensive field testing to study stability, reliability, and reproducibility of the portable monitoring system.  Sample treatment and metal detection protocols will be developed for on-site testing of subsurface groundwater and soil extracts for chromium, cobalt, and uranium contamination at low ppb concentration levels.  A prototype (alpha) monitor will be designed to advance the sensor to a state of technological-readiness for use in remediation and characterization at Superfund sites. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Potential commercial applications include at- home analysis of well water or groundwater and industrial self-monitoring of effluent.  Potential government applications of the sensor will include water quality monitoring of public drinking water, groundwater, surface water, rivers and water quality monitoring of contaminated sites and industrial effluent for agencies such as DOE, DOD, and EPA.",

        "abstract": "DOE is responsible for the remediation of 1.7 trillion gallons of contaminated ground water and 40 million cubic meters of contaminated soil generated at over 7000 sites from past weapons activities. This remediation includes bioremediation, where substances are injected into the subsurface to enhance microbial decomposition.  Several methods have been utilized by researchers to quantify bioremediation rates; however, these techniques require extensive sample preparation, making them unsuitable for field deployment. Improved methods are required to quantify bioremediation rates and bacterial activity.  Recent studies have shown that denitrifying bacteria produce N2O with a distinct isotope ratio (15N/14N, 18O/16O, and site-specific ratios).  By measuring the isotope ratio of N2O extracted from the soil, researchers can obtain a measure of bacterial activity and bioremediation rates.   However, current technology involves extensive sampling and isotope ratio mass spectrometery.  In this program, LGR proposes to develop a field-deployable analyzer for the accurate determination of N2O isotopes.  In Phase I, LGR demonstrated technical feasibility by fabricating a prototype for quantification of [N2O], 15N, 15N15Nand 18O with a precision of 0.05 ppb, 0.4 , 0.45 , 0.6 , and 1.2  respectively.  Measurements of calibrated standards demonstrated that the sensor was accurate to 1 ppb and 1  for N2O concentration and isotope ratios respectively with a linear response over a wide dynamic range of [N2O] = 150  10000 ppb.  The instrument was deployed with Professor von Fischer (Colorado State University) with 15N-labelling experiments to identify nitrification and denitrification pathways in soil samples obtained from NSF LTER sites.  In Phase II, LGR will develop an improved sensor for the isotope determination of ambient N2O emitted from soils and groundwater.   The sensor will include provisions for batch gas sampling, chamber measurements, and periodic calibration.  LGR will work with the IAEA (at no cost to this program) to compare the system to an established isotope measurement laboratory.  Subsequently, the instrument will be deployed for field soil studies with Professor von Fischer.  A second instrument will be deployed at the DOE IFRC site in ORNL for long-term, continuous monitoring of bacterial denitrification in soils.  LGR will also extend the instrument to measure 17O in concentrated N2O samples.  A Phase II funding commitment will be used to utilize the SBIR instrument to make isotope measurements of N2O obtained from bacterial digestion of dissolved nitrates for water pollution attribution. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: During  Phase  III,  LGR  will  sell  the  N2O  isotope  analyzers  to  isotope  measurement  laboratories, environmental research groups, global monitoring stations, and water quality management agencies.

        "abstract": "The effectiveness of synchrotron radiation science has been hindered by the limited availability of advanced diagnostics.  In many cases, the capability to produce photon fluxes has outpaced the ability to detect and measure the resultant photons.  Synchrotron applications are becoming more demanding as beamlines are being designed with brighter sources, smaller focal spots, and wider energy ranges within a single beamline.  A novel diamond-based transmission beam monitor has been shown to have unprecedented linear behavior combined with the ability to determine intensity, position, and timing suitable to meet the user demand for increasingly high flux, small focus size, and beam stability. Products based on this novel concept will provide a valuable new tool to fully utilize the worlds brightest synchrotrons.  Researchers at national laboratories have developed proof-of-principle monitors that demonstrated the core capability of the diamond-based monitors in terms of measuring beam flux and position.  The proposed program builds upon these developments and takes a broader look at the needs of the Synchrotron radiation community in contrast to the current state of development.  Phase I completed a commercial engineering study on the existing technology and determined it is feasible to produce a suite of diamond detectors to meet current and future diagnostics needs.  The research focused on developing a clear understanding of the current state of technology development, end-user requirements, manufacturing requirements, and advancements required for Phase II and beyond.  The Phase I findings indicate the manufacturing of commercial, diamond-based beam position monitors is feasible; and there is an immediate and growing demand for these devices today.  The Phase II program is designed to complete the feasibility investigations started during Phase I and advance specific manufacturing techniques to the point that they can be utilized to produce prototype devices for performance evaluation.  Three prototype devices will be developed.  These prototypes represent a cross section of the requirements studied in Phase I, and will push the technology in areas that address the more challenging future requirements.  If successful, the Phase II research will position the technology for rapid commercial deployment in Phase III. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: This program will provide commercial beam monitors with functionality not available today: an x- ray beam monitor robust enough to accommodate the high x-ray beam fluxes from 3rd generation synchrotron beamlines, while also retaining the sensitivity to observe monochromatic beams on a per pulse basis.  In addition, it will enable closed loop beam diagnostics to aid in the troubleshooting and optimization of current and future beamlines throughout Synchrotron radiation community.",

        "abstract": "The determination of the longitudinal profile of light sources requires ever-increasing precision.  As novel schemes to create bunches at the level of tens of femtoseconds become more widespread, the diagnosis of these bunches with increased resolution is necessary.  Currently available techniques have resolutions on the order of tens of femtoseconds, but there is no technique that surpasses the femtosecond barrier.  The measurement of ultrashort beams in the time domain is accomplished by encoding the temporal profile information on a transverse angular modulation of the beam.  This modulation is then observable on a distant screen using readily available imaging tools.  In Phase I, an analytical treatment complemented by simulations was developed, a proof of principle experiment was designed, and experimental measurements of key components were demonstrated including the generation of a higher-order laser mode in the far-infrared.  In Phase II we will develop the key subcomponents, including the laser modulator, laser mode driver, and observation screen.  We will integrate these components into a field ready prototype and execute the proof of principle experiment to demonstrate sub-femtosecond temporal resolution on a high-brightness electron beam. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The proposed structure will allow the study of beam events on the sub-femtosecond time scale.  This addresses needs of modern-day and future accelerators and light sources that necessitate precise resolution of longitudinal beam parameters.  The resolution of the scheme is on the order of 1/200 of the laser wavelength, which can be used in other applications, such as precision timing systems, or as an optical streak camera, or fast oscilloscope with greater than 10THz bandwidth.",

        "abstract": "In the Spallation Neutron Source, the mercury in the stainless steel target vessel experiences cavitation due to intense pressure waves produced by the almost instantaneous heating of the mercury following proton impact on the target.  To protect the vessel walls from cavitation erosion, helium micro bubbles can be added to the mercury to act as attenuators of the pressure waves and to minimize cavitation effects.  A diagnostic method is needed to monitor the gas injection technique and to measure the bubble size distribution.  This project will develop an acoustic diagnostic tool that can meet the bubble size and void fraction requirements of the Spallation Neutron Source application.  To enable use of larger amplitude acoustics waves and overcome excessive damping in the bubbly mixture, a non-linear acoustic theory and an intelligent artificial neural network using a priori knowledge from the acoustic theory will be used to extract bubble size distribution from acoustic data.  Both acoustic wave transmission and reflection methods will be investigated and used to enable measurement at a range of void fractions that are often encountered in two-phase flow applications.  During the Phase I study, significant progress was made in extending the capabilities of the acoustic bubble spectrometer hardware for a wider range of bubble sizes and void fractions, and in adapting it for the DOE mercury application.  A non-linear bubble dynamics model that extends the linear theory utilized in the present spectrometer was developed and demonstrated.  The feasibility of using a neural network based inverse problem solver to measure bubble size distribution was demonstrated using both synthetic and experimental data.  The feasibility of using reflection waves to measure bubble size distribution and void fraction was also demonstrated; and theoretical formulations to interpret reflected sound wave signals to use in the inverse problem solver development were initiated.  In Phase II the hardware of the spectrometer will be further improved to upgrade high frequency signal generation (for smaller bubble size measurements) and lower frequency hydrophones (for large bubble size measurement); and better designed integrated hydrophone for reflection tests.  This will enable development of high fidelity databases for training and validating the neural network based spectrometer.  The 3-D nonlinear acoustic model will be expanded to simulate practical geometries encountered in spectrometer operation and provide databases for training and testing the neural network in regimes where linear acoustic theory does not apply.  Finally, the acoustic reflection method initialized in Phase I will be further developed, tested, and implemented in the new generation acoustic bubble spectrometer being developed. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: A marketable acoustic instrument capable of measuring a wide range of bubble sizes and void fractions will be a valuable tool for diagnostics and control of numerous multi-phase flow and liquid metal applications.  Successful development of the proposed instrument will have wide commercial and scientific applications and benefits. In addition to the Spallation Neutron Source application, the instrument will find applications in oceanographic, biological, chemical, pharmaceutical, energy, and other industries.",

        "abstract": "Laser-driven, tabletop X-ray sources based on high harmonic generation provide unique tools with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution for application in material science, condensed matter physics, biology, and medicine.  Also such tabletop X-ray sources are much more compact and cost- efficient as compared to currently used synchrotrons and free-electron lasers.  Development of next- generation, laser-driven X-ray sources is critically dependent on power scaling of high-intensity, mid- IR stages driving the high harmonic generation.  Proposed development of a high-pulse-energy, high-repetition-rate, picosecond-scale, 2-m, Holmium-laser technology will enable the power scaling of high-intensity, mid-IR laser drivers and, in turn, X-ray power output.  The laser system will be based on a modular, all-amplifier architecture utilizing a mode-locked seed oscillator and robust, high-power, Ho:YLF solid-state amplifier modules to scale the output up to 100 mJ at ~kHz repetition rates.  Phase I effort confirmed the feasibility of the proposed approach.  A Ho:YLF regenerative amplifier allowed scaling the energy of picosecond-scale pulses up to 2 mJ at 1-kHz rate, exceeding the original target. Initial experiments with single-pass Ho:YLF power amplifier demonstrated further scaling to 7-mJ pulse energy.  The main objective of the Phase II program is to design and build a ruggedized, modular, chirped-pulse-amplification, Ho:YLF laser system based on regenerative amplifier module and a set of single-pass amplifiers with the goal of scaling the pulse energy up to 100 mJ at kHz-rate.  As the final effort a complete packaged system will be built and delivered to DoE customer. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The primary application of the proposed laser technology is as a pump source for ultra-high-intensity mid-IR lasers which drive X-ray sources based on high-harmonic generation (HHG).  There is a growing interest in applying HHG laser technology for industrial applications due to access to particular X-ray wavelengths and relative compactness of the tabletop HHG systems.  Additional applications include terahertz generation, and remote sensing and eye-safe, long-range lidar/ladar with high spatial resolution at 2-m wavelength.",

        "abstract": "Extreme temperature and non-equilibrium processes are both central to DOEs mission of addressing grand challenges in emerging energy and advanced materials; they are also crucial steps in the manufacture of many high value-add industrial products.  MDI is advancing the ability to process and study materials at extreme temperatures and in non-equilibrium conditions by developing a novel containerless processing technology.  Containerless techniques, also called `levitation, are emerging as a very effective tool to access and characterize materials at the extreme end of the temperature/stability range.  This project is developing, optimizing and benchmarking new sample manipulation techniques that will enable studies of materials under extreme conditions, particularly using high energy synchrotron radiation.  The R &amp; amp;D impacts critical technology areas including the manufacture of optical glasses, semiconductors, medical products, and energy conversion materials.  Research will be performed jointly by the small business and the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory.  The proposed solution integrates a novel containerless sample manipulator, laser beam heating, and advanced data acquisition and management with a high flux, high energy x-ray beamline.  The R &amp; amp;D will: (i) specify, optimize and construct a prototype instrument; (ii) test and characterize the instrument, including making in-situ measurements, (iii) leverage the SBIR investment to sell instruments to clients in the industrial glass and materials, basic research, and beamline instrumentation markets.  The Phase I research was completed on-time and on-budget.  Results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed approach using materials at temperatures up to 3200C and temperature dependent measurements of melt structure.  The R &amp; amp;D defined precise requirements for an advanced instrument that will be developed in Phase II to meet customers clearly identified needs.  In Phase II the R &amp; amp;D will complete the advanced instrument design based on the Phase I results.

        "abstract": "Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) is a critical emerging technology to enable fabrication of integrated circuit with sub-20 nm features.  However, the implementation and wider adoption of EUVL is limited by the lack of compact, tunable, narrow-band, directional high power sources in the EUVL wavelength range.  The present state-of-the-art for EUV R &amp; amp;D is plasma based sources at 13.6 nm that are not directional, require frequent repair, and are not easily scalable to shorter wavelengths.  This project seeks to address this problem by developing a high duty cycle Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS) source, based on the scattering of a re-circulated/re-amplified 10 m laser off a multi-bunch train electron beam produced by a photoinjector in a novel active multi-pass intracavity.  In Phase I, a thorough design study of a re-circulated ICS experiment at ATF BNL has been conducted.  All system components have been specified for implementation in Phase II.  The most risky aspect of the Phase I design study was demonstrating the feasibility of CO2 pulse re-amplification at 25-ns intervals with the equipment presently available at the ATF BNL (4 atm. amplifier).  This milestone was successfully accomplished through in depth numerical simulation of the amplifier media performance in a pulse train regime.  An unexpected finding was overall ICS system improved performance at longer laser pulses.  In Phase II, a scaled demonstration experiment of re-circulated ICS will be carried out at the Accelerator Test Facility at BNL. If successful, the output would substantially increase prospects of commercialization and long overdue market acceptance of ICS based compact light sources. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The primary application targeted by the proposed system, Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL), is on the cusp of becoming a billion-dollar industry; but, one for which the current EUV sources are inadequate for the full range of manufacturing processes and diagnostics.  The technology scales well to the X-ray range, where there are a number of other medical and industrial applications.",

        "abstract": "S-Band vacuum loads at the SLAC linac are encountering operational problems now that they have to operate under the stringent requirements of the LCLS: 50 MW peak power, 6 kW average power, and extremely tight phase stability for the linac.  Failure mechanisms have been studied which suggest an RF surface breakdown of the 200 m Kanthal layer.  We propose a novel solution which incorporates mode conversion from TE10 in rectangular waveguide to TE01 in round waveguide.  Lossy material will be placed in the round waveguide, and the selection of the TE01 mode minimizes the electric field normal to the surface of the lossy material.  This lossy material in the TE01 round waveguide will be mechanically confined in compression (without brazing), in order to eliminate operationally induced tensile stresses in the lossy material.  The wrap-around mode converter will be based upon the X-band mode converter invented at SLAC, and the TE01 waveguide load design will be based upon HOM load designs developed by Muons, Inc.  In Phase I, a novel lossy ceramic material and a mechanical system for incorporating it into an S-band dry load were designed and tested.  The dry load operates in the TE01 mode and incorporates mode converters designed by SLAC.  The lossy ceramic components are cast into cylinders and other novel shapes from slurries composed of mixtures of SiC and porcelain and processed to full densification and vitrification.   The microwave characteristics of the lossy ceramic cylinders were measured to determine the optimum mixture for various elements of the load.  During Phase II, the manufacturing of components with the lossy ceramic material will be studied to find the optimum design for low-cost manufacturing of the complete load.  This will include manufacturing processes for the mode converter, minimized post machining of the lossy ceramic material, compression techniques for various sections of the load, optimum configurations of the components to even out the heat load, high power testing and life tests. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: This dry load system will have a wide range of application from beam line HOM loads to TE01 dry loads.  Every SRF accelerator will benefit from the use of this material.  The ability to cast the material into novel shapes allows for low cost solutions which would otherwise be prohibitive due to machining costs of more traditional lossy ceramics.",

Experiments have already demonstrated the potential to generate amplified electron beams from diamond with peak current density greater than 400 mA/mm2   and average current density larger than 100 mA/mm2 but how to  optimize  the  emission from rough surfaces  with  negative  electron  affinity  is still  to be understood. Physics based simulations of diamond amplifiers can offer valuable insight into their operation, provide guidance to experimental approaches and help their design optimization, however, there are currently no available codes that offer these capabilities. General statement of how this problem or situation is being addressed. Charge generation and transport in bulk diamond can now be simulated with the three dimensional code VORPAL but it lacks algorithms for high-fidelity modeling of surface effects and electron emission from diamond. We will develop and implement algorithms for accurate modeling of electron emission from diamond surfaces with negative electron affinity, surface physics phenomena (including quantum mechanical effects), and metal-semiconductor contacts within VORPAL to enable end-to-end simulations for design of diamond-amplified electron sources. What was done in Phase I? We investigated and implemented two proof-of-concept algorithms for electron emission with realistic surface potentials.   We verified the prototyped algorithms and compared results from VORPAL simulations with them to experimental data. These results demonstrate the importance of the new capabilities to better understand the physics of electron emission from diamond surfaces. What is planned for Phase II? We will complete the implementation of accurate, quantum mechanical, modeling of electron emission processes, surface region localized states and space-charge effects, surface roughness, and varying electron affinity to enable realistic investigation of electron emission from diamond via simulations. New experiments are being designed to collect data for validation of the implemented models.   We will run extensive simulations to compare with experimental data and investigate energy distribution, emittance, and time response properties of electrons emitted from diamond. Commercial applications and other benefits The proposed new modeling capabilities will aid researchers in developing electron sources that meet or exceed the desired operational parameters for future DOE facilities.   This project will produce commercial quality software, including a state-of-the-art graphical user interface, and will allow the VORPAL  code to increase its potential for generating further commercial revenue when used in the industry to design both diamond cathodes and semiconductor devices.",

In this project we will develop a compact and much less expensive coherent terahertz source that allows generation of high peak and average power.  The approach uses microbunching provided by the beam compression in an alpha-magnet, beam pre-bunching in the RF gun, and resonant Cherenkov radiation in a robust radiator.

The laser design uses hybrid-integration to directly incorporate carrier phase envelope (CEP) stabilization in the femtosecond modelocked laser oscillator cavity.   This design eliminates all mechanical adjustments or moving parts that are currently used in CEP systems and require periodic alignment using mechanical motion. Most of the large free-space optical components currently used in femtosecond laser systems are replaced with waveguide chips that implement all the optical functions required for long term stability in a small compact footprint. One of key design features of our technology is the ability to lock the laser modelocking repetition rate to an external clock frequency.  This capability is key for all of the anticipated DOE applications. In the Phase I program we successfully completed a proof-of-concept demonstration of the proposed modelocked laser system and the hybrid-integration technology platform. All of the Phase I objectives have been accomplished.  The proposed Phase II project will develop a prototype of a fs modelocked laser oscillator and a chirped pulse amplified (CPA) system to achieve a stable modelocked pulses with 0.1-1 microJoule energy per pulse.  This system can then be inserted into high-energy CPA regenerative amplifier to obtain pulse energies in the mJ range with &amp; lt;100 fs pulse widths.

        "abstract": "The Department of Energy seeks the development of advanced laser systems for current-enhanced self- amplified spontaneous emission (ESASE) free-electron lasers for ultra-short x-ray generation.  Improvements in the technology will come from the use of driving lasers operating at wavelengths longer than those from Ti:sapphire-based systems.  To function, the lasers must achieve the state-of-the-art in short-pulse duration, phase stabilization, and coherence.  Current laser systems suffer from complexity due to the use of multiple nonlinear stages to achieve the desired wavelength and have issues with power scaling.  Q-Peak proposes to develop a novel, mid-infrared 50-fs pulse, high-pulse-energy, femtosecond oscillatorregenerative chirped pulse amplifier (CPA), hybrid laser system utilizing fiber and solid-state lasers.  The high peak power, femtosecond CEP-stabilized output pulses at 2.5 m can be used as driver for ESASE.  All the elements of the system proposed are based on technology that has undergone significant development at Q-Peak and continues to be advanced for applications in both Government and commercial systems.   In the Phase I program we demonstrated fiber laser-pumped femtosecond mid-IR solid-state oscillator with 109 fs pulse duration. Supercontinuum generation was demonstrated with a chalcogenide fiber taper and it enables a carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) stabilization of the system.  This laser is suitable as a seed source for high-power mid-IR amplified femtosecond laser system.  In the proposed Phase II program Q-Peak will develop a diode-pumped femtosecond oscillator-regenerative amplifier laser system with 5 GW peak power output at a 10 kHz repetition rate.  The system will be CEP stabilized to be suitable for ESASE and other high field physics applications. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The proposed laser system will be a new tool for x-ray free-electron laser-based light sources.  It will also demonstrate a path to scale the laser system to the TW peak power level.  We also propose to develop a commercial prototype of a frequency mid-IR comb generator based on a diode-pumped femtosecond oscillator and fiber supercontinuum generation.  This product can be used in a variety of applications such as environmental analysis, remote-sensing, spectroscopy, medicine and astronomy.",

Typical techniques to decrease surface impedance are to use shields of superconducting Nb, however, as these shields move they produce particulates that can be detrimental to operation if they find their way into the storage ring.  Alameda Applied Sciences Corporation has demonstrated high-quality Nb coatings on flexible metal bellows.  This superconducting layer leads to a decrease in the surface resistance at cryogenic temperatures and a decrease in the power consumption of the bellows.  AASC will further engineer this superconducting layer by improving the film adhesion to the bellows and further investigating the RF properties of a superconducting bellows.  In Phase I, two stainless steel bellows were coated with Nb and RF measurements were performed to determine the Q of the resonant structure from 300 K to 5 K.  Additionally, initial tests to determine the adhesion of cathodic arc films to stainless steel were carried out.  In Phase II, further adhesion tests will be performed and process variables will be optimized with film adhesion in mind.  Cryogenic RF tests will be carried out to further understand the behavior of a superconducting thin film bellows in a simulated environment.

        "abstract": "The inability to dynamically image solid-state materials at atomic resolutions and perform spectroscopy at the same time in changing liquid and gas environments is a significant impediment to the advance of multiple areas of science.  Recently Hummingbird Scientific has developed commercially viable in-situ continuous flow liquid and atmospheric pressure gas transmission electron microscope (TEM) sample holders for observations of interactions of materials in fluid environments.  These holders have already opened up new avenues of research in material reactions through real time observation and imaging of nano-scale material interactions.  However, these systems do not allow the full potential of the TEM to be used, as they currently do not allow routine spectroscopic analysis to occur in the TEM.  The electron cross-section of the liquid/gas cell is limiting the use of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy filtered TEM (EFTEM) and the geometric constraints on being able to seal the liquid and gas cells have also inhibited the use of energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS).  This project will fully develop and bring to market new liquid and gas cell in-situ TEM holders that are specifically designed to allow spectroscopic analysis (EELS, EFTEM, and EDS) to occur while imaging materials in fluid environments at high resolution.  In Phase I we have successfully built and tested prototypes of these systems. This will be a crucial technique in opening up the possibilities of in-situ fluidic research inside the TEM. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the availability of a characterization technique that can image solid/liquid and solid/gas interfaces up to atomic resolutions while at the same time performing spectroscopic elemental analysis. This technique has a broad range of impact over several scientific and engineering fields.  It will allow biological structures to be imaged at nanometer resolutions in the native environment and will provide new insight on the structure-function relation in biological systems. In materials science and chemistry, it will provide new insight into the growth and synthesis of nano-structures, which are important for future generations of electronic devices.  Finally, it will create insights for catalysis research under relevant environmental conditions, as well as offer a new understanding of the fundamental processes in corrosion.",

        "abstract": "If the energy resolution of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) carried out in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), with an atom-sized electron probe, could be improved to 10 meV or better, a new way of studying materials at the atomic scale, by recording and analyzing their vibrational energies, would become possible.  No STEM system capable of such performance has yet been developed.  Up to a few months ago, the best energy resolution that could be obtained with monochromated EELS systems capable of forming a small probe was about 40 meV, i.e. a factor of 4 too poor.  Using a new monochromator we have recently built and an improved Gatan spectrometer, we have shown that resolution of 10 meV and eventually 5 meV will become possible, if the spectrometer part of our new instrument is brought up to the same design standards as the new monochromator.  Building such a spectrometer is what we plan to do in the proposed project.  In Phase I we built and brought up a monochromated STEM that uses a new type of a Nion- designed monochromator, and achieved unprecedented levels of performance. The spectrometer used in this project was Gatans latest design, the Enfinium, with two enhancements for extra stability.  The system was able to reach 12 meV energy resolution in spectra taken with very short acquisition times, but not in spectra taken with acquisition times of around 1 s.  Pushing the whole system to reach unprecedented levels of energy resolution has taught us what is and what is not important in ultra-high resolution EELS.  We used this knowledge to design a new spectrometer with improved electron optics, and detectors optimized for detecting weak spectral features next to an intense zero loss peak.  The newly designed spectrometer will be built, in two stages during Phase II.  Stage A spectrometer will be built in the first year.  It will reach 10 meV energy resolution at 60 keV, and it will provide a test bed for key design elements of stage B. The Stage B spectrometer, which will be mostly built in the first year and brought up and optimized in the second year, will be designed to reach 5 meV energy resolution. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Elements as light as hydrogen will become detectable, and their bonding arrangements determined from the observed vibrational energies. This will increase our understanding of energy conversion and storage devices needed for a green economy.  The new spectrometer and the associated equipment (a complete monochromated scanning transmission electron microscope) will open up a new market segment in research instrumentation, which we estimate will be worth about $20M per year for Nion.",

Statement of How the Problem or Situation is Being Addressed Adelphi Technology proposes to design, fabricate, and test a magnetic lens to refract and focus thermal and cold neutrons. The new lenses will have larger apertures with no intervening material that can scatter and absorb the neutrons. The lenses also have the added benefit that they provide polarized neutrons, which can be used to probe magnetic and superconducting materials, and achieve higher resolution than non-polarized beams.

Economical and environmentally benign production and storage of hydrogen for energy markets remains a challenge.  The proposed project leverages anion exchange membranes, enabling elimination of the highest expense materials in the cell stack, while the new catalyst formulations provide higher efficiencies than existing state-of-the-art.  The goal of this Department of Energy sponsored project is to demonstrate the feasibility of hydrogen generation from electrolysis to meet the DOE hydrogen production targets of $3-4/kg H2.  The Phase 1 project focused on improvement in MEA materials for lower oxygen evolution over-potentials. Pyrochlore catalysts were successfully synthesized and characterized, and were demonstrated to provide improved performance over the baseline materials.  In Phase 2, the catalyst and anion exchange membrane (AEM) formulations down-selected from the Phase 1 project will be studied in more detail in order to understand the fundamental parameters driving performance.  These materials can then be extensively optimized to yield robust electro-catalysts and electrolytes for advanced electrolyzer testing and manufacture.  On the catalyst side, the emphasis will be on using advanced processing strategies to yield high turnover frequencies and stability to over 1.8V. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The proposed project could result in a step change improvement in cost, accelerating implementation of hydrogen infrastructure for not only bottled gas markets but also other markets using traditional delivery of hydrogen.  Specifically, the laboratory industrial gas market is extremely price competitive.  Hydrogen is being substituted for helium as a carrier gas for analytical equipment, and onsite generation is attractive from an OSHA perspective based on the lack of stored inventory and elimination of bottle transport.  Proton has established lab channels and thus has a logical market entry point for the proposed alkaline exchange membrane technology. Longer term, this research and development effort is designed to transform hydrogen-based energy storage into an enabling technology for the reduction of fossil fuel use, by overcoming the present economic constraints preventing its widespread application.  Hydrogen via electrolysis is ideally suited as a grid-buffering technology to pair with renewable energy sources to maintain steady power delivery.  For commercial energy markets, the main roadblock to implementation is the capital and operating cost of the Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer.  While PEM electrolysis technology is competitive in many industrial markets, systems still utilize noble metal catalysts and expensive semi-precious metal flow field components.  In the proposed work, transformative research to overcome these materials constraints will be applied in order to enable this technology at a commercial level for energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Ethylene and propylene are the primary feedstocks for the manufacture of polyethylene and polypropylene, respectively.  These olefins represent a major component of the polymer manufacturing cost. Consequently, there is significant economic benefit in minimizing losses of unreacted olefin from the process.  Some olefin loss is a result of the need to remove paraffin from the polymerization reactor. Low concentrations of paraffin are present in the feedstock (ethane in the case of ethylene feed and propane in the case of propylene feed).  The paraffin builds up in the reactor as the olefin is consumed by reaction and reactor effluent is recycled.  This makes it necessary to vent some of the reaction mixture in order to limit the buildup of paraffin.  The vent stream carries both paraffin and the valuable olefin.  A membrane that can efficiently separate the olefin from the paraffin would provide substantial economic benefit to these polymerization processes.  Membrane processes have been previously evaluated for separating ethylene/ethane or propylene/propane.  In many cases, silver salt facilitating agents have been incorporated into membranes to preferentially transport ethylene or propylene.  While good separations have been demonstrated in the laboratory, membrane stability problems have prevented development of commercial systems. It is proposed to combine the stability features and high gas transport of Compact Membrane Systems  proprietary  membranes  with  stable  transition  metal  facilitating  agents  to  create  a  stable facilitated transport membrane.   The facilitating agents proposed in this program are resistant to deactivation through reduction reactions.  Routes to adding stable transition metal transport facilitators to the polymer have been identified in Phase I. When incorporated into the membrane polymer these facilitators  will  enable  both  high  permeance  and  high  selectivity  for  ethylene/ethane  and propylene/propane separations. In phase I, a stable transition metal transport facilitator was successfully incorporated into the polymer membrane.  The facilitator was shown to be in the desired chemical form in the membrane and the membrane was shown to exhibit high olefin permeance and high olefin/paraffin selectivity with a mixture of propylene and propane.  The membrane was further demonstrated to provide stable separation performance over a period of 147 hours with no measurable decrease in permeance and selectivity. In the phase II program, an alternative approach to incorporating the transport facilitator into the membrane will be investigated   and facilitated membrane composition will be optimized for olefin/paraffin separation performance.  The process to produce the facilitated membrane material will be scaled up to larger quantities (10x greater).  A prototype membrane will be fabricated and tested for stability in extended pilot tests. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The estimated combined production of polyethylene and polypropylene by U.S. manufacturers in 2011 is about 29 million metric tons.  Annual reactor vent stream losses of the olefin feedstocks are estimated to have a value of $330 million and represent an equivalent energy loss of 16 trillion Btu.  The proposed membrane can drastically reduce these costs by recovering olefins from vent streams for reuse in the reactor.  The processes that produce the ethylene and propylene feedstocks can also benefit from the proposed membrane.",

Current dewatering methods (e.g. centrifuge, press filter) consume much energy and are less effective for separating high value micro-particulate.  One promising method for very low energy dewatering is capillary solid-liquid separation; but its processing rate for the most valuable microparticle because the small pores that trap particles also present too much resistance to water flow.  This SBIR project is developing a novel microhole separation membrane that combines high water flow with the need small pore size.  In Phase I, advanced laser micromaching techniques were used to create and optimize versions of this microhole membrane.  These were tested at bench scale in conjunction with capillary separation and showed performance far superior to existing membranes for dewatering and capturing microalgae 5 microns and smaller.  In Phase II the speed of fabrication will be increased to commercially affordable levels, and the membrane will be turned into a prototype belt for demonstration on a pilot scale capillary separation machine. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: If successful, this technology will enable scaling of low energy capillary separation to address dewatering, harvesting and water purification in a wide array of industries.  Capillary separation exploits the principals of liquid adhesion and was originally developed with support from US Department of Energys Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA-E).  It has been described as transformative because of its ability to dewater suspended solids using less than a tenth of the energy of incumbent methods like centrifugation.

        "abstract": "New and innovative designs for advanced nuclear power plants, such as General Atomics EM2, require solutions to significant material challenges. Current zirconium alloys and other metals are incapable of being considered as core materials due to increased temperatures and high neutron fluence. Stoichiometric SiC/SiC composites for cladding and other core structures have been identified as the only non-metallic material candidate to allow these new reactor designs to come to fruition.  This DOE Phase II SBIR seeks to demonstrate high purity, stoichiometric SiC/SiC CMC components made with commercially available SiC fiber and USAs first low cost, stoichiometric silicon carbide (SiC) ceramic fibers for next generation gas cooled nuclear reactors and the retrofitting of current Gen III LWRs.  High purity beta-SiC, from the processes outlined in this proposal, are considered for fuel cladding and in-core structures capable of prolonged operation at temperatures above 1000C in high neutron flux environments, while maintaining strength and chemical inertness over those of alloys, such as Zircaloy. MATECH will produce a number of CMC test articles and conduct rigorous testing and evaluation to qualify high yield, crystalline SiC CMCs.  General Atomics (San Diego, CA), for the proposed nuclear applications, and Lockheed Martin Corporation (Palmdale, CA), for non-nuclear aerospace applications, will both be evaluating CMCs produced under this proposed DOE Phase II SBIR program. In Phase I,MATECH fabricated a total of seven distinct SiC/SiC CMC panels by three principal CMC processes, the polymer-impregnation pyrolysis (PIP) process, the chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) process, and a hybrid process of both CVI and PIP.  The hybrid manufacturing approach showed the most promise for further development and optimization in the Phase II SBIR program.  In Phase II, MATECH proposes a novel Hybrid CVI/PIP CMC processing route, developed and demonstrated in the successful Phase I program, to manufacture high purity stoichiometric SiC CMCs utilizing both commercially available Japanese fiber and MATECHs low-cost SiC-1900X stoichiometric fiber.  The goal of this Phase II is to ultimately manufacture test and demonstration panels in the Phase II that are high TRL/MRL. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The US currently generates 20% of its electricity from 104 nuclear power plants.  This technology can simultaneously reduce Americas reliance on foreign sources of energy and the formation of greenhouse gases.

        "abstract": "Alternative energy sources, such as wind and solar are inherently variable.  Steady power to the grid can be achieved by the use of redox flow batteries to store and release power.  Redox flow batteries are batteries that use a solution of redox active material that can flow past the electrodes, become charged, and then be stored in an auxiliary tank. Such a battery can have a storage capacity that is much larger than conventional batteries and separates the usual connection between energy and power.  Current technology for flow batteries is largely based on sodium/sulfur chemistry which requires high temperatures, or on the aqueous redox chemistry of vanadium.  Our project is dedicated to producing redox flow batteries based on organic redox chemistry that can provide high energy density at lower cost, and avoids the use of toxic metals. Our redox chemistry is based on a single substance being both oxidized and reduced, and this is a considerable advantage due to the problems of crossover when two distinct active materials are separated by a membrane.  In our Phase I project we prepared new materials for use in a single-substance organic based redox flow battery that were of much higher solubility, affording higher energy density, than the previous examples of this type. This was accomplished by variation of the side groups attached to a redox active core and solubility as high as 2 M was observed.  We tested the electrochemical properties, verified the feasibility for use in redox flow applications, and developed a synthetic method for producing these materials on a large scale.  The goal of this Phase II project is to demonstrate prototype redox flow batteries based on new, single substance, organic active materials.  The overall technical goal will be reached by pursuing three research and development objectives.  These objectives are to: (i) optimize these novel organic systems with respect to cycle life duration and efficiency, (ii) select the most effective electrode and membrane combination, and (iii) scale-up the syntheses and do prototype validation.  The prototypes will be fabricated at two levels, 3.8 W and 40 W.  The 3.8 W prototype will be a single cell device to demonstrate the advantage of the single substance active material and allow optimization of membrane and electrode selection. The 40 W prototype will have a multi-cell stack and will provide data for overall validation of efficiency and durability. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The data obtained will be input into modeling software to obtain design parameters for 1-10kW devices.  The 10kW device will be offered to customers and investors in the Phase III commercialization.  A system at this scale will be a cost effective addition to management of the power grid.",

Ultramet, UCLA, and Digital Materials Solutions (DMS) propose the development and testing of a cellular solid breeder structure at &amp; gt;85 vol% overall breeder density with an engineered and stable internal network of interconnected microchannels for efficient release of tritium.  The advantages of this approach are a robust free- standing breeder material structure with a high tritium release rate, higher tritium breeding ratio, high thermal conductivity, elimination of large breeder/structure interface temperature drop, elimination of pore closure due to sintering, minimal bed reconfiguration, and very low production cost.  In Phase I cellular, solid breeder structures of multiple breeder materials were fabricated with an engineered network of interconnected microchannels.  The nominally 85 vol% dense structures produced represent a 20% increase in breeder density over pebble beds.  Analysis showed a twofold increase in thermal conductivity and nearly twofold increase in tritium release rate at much lower temperatures compared with an equivalent pebble bed breeder.  Analysis also showed a more than twofold increase in span between coolant walls for a typical U.S. ITER solid breeder test blanket module design. These promising results indicate the potential for substantial performance improvements in solid breeder blankets.  In Phase II, microengineered cellular breeders will be optimized and demonstrated that offer substantial performance and lifetime improvements relative to current pebble bed breeders.  This will be accomplished through breeder materials and structures development and fundamental properties testing at Ultramet, design and analysis at DMS to establish the optimal combination of breeder material, density, and thermomechanical properties, and materials characterization and testing under prototypical operating conditions at UCLA, which is a leader in development and design of the U.S. ITER solid breeder test blanket module. Commercial applications and other benefits: Nuclear fusion offers a replacement for increasingly scarce fossil fuel energy sources.  Alternatives to fossil fuels (e.g. wind, solar, geothermal) cannot generate sufficient energy to meet current needs.  Fusion, with its low generation of radioactive waste, is ideal for large-scale energy generation.  Development of advanced solid breeder materials is necessary to enable the U.S. industrial base to participate in near-term commercial applications of fusion energy (e.g. ITER test blankets, DEMO, and beyond).",

        "abstract": "The United States Department of Energy is developing several devices to advance the development of fusion energy.  Plans for future major fusion machines will undoubtedly utilize superconducting magnets which operate at 4K or below.  Magnets for smaller fusion research devices may also be built using normal copper conductor magnets that operate at temperatures up to 422 K (150C).  The availability of electrical insulations with higher shear strengths and radiation resistance, and the ability to operate at extreme temperatures will be critical in achieving this goal.  High-strength electrical insulations will be developed to address the needs of future fusion energy devices.  These insulators will be designed to provide high mechanical strength and radiation resistance, and will be compatible with state-of-the-art magnet fabrication processes.  In Phase I the addition of polyimide to cyanate ester-epoxy blended resin showed improved shear properties as well as reduced heat of reaction (energy released) during the curing of the material.  In addition, nanomaterial fabric treatments were used to improve the shear fatigue performance of composites made with these resins.  The Phase II effort will continue to improve and optimize the performance of these resins and the application of nanomaterial fabric treatments for use with resins for VPI processing, as well as to explore their application to ceramic/polymer hybrid insulation system and for insulating coatings for high temperature superconducting materials and tapes. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: In addition to providing improved products for use in the construction of fusion magnets, the advanced electrical insulations to be produced in this will likely also used be used in medical devices such as cancer therapy and imaging systems, high-field accelerator magnets, and motors and generators that operate under extreme conditions.",

        "abstract": "Available 2D multi-wire proportional counters (MWPC) are limited by their low global count-rate capability and are insufficient for imaging X-raycrystal spectroscopy (XCS) experiments.  Solid state X-ray pixilated array detectors have been shown to overcome this problem.  However, large area solid state 2D detectors with higher performance, increased functionality, and programmable, dual-threshold capabilities are needed to achieve the energy windowing necessary for thermonuclear fusion and plasma physics instruments.  Because of the harsh environment inside the tokamak vacuum vessel, these detectors must also function and perform with high reliability in conditions not previously encountered by diagnostic technology, including high gamma and neutron environments.  Voxtel is developing a large area single photon counting CMOS imager for X-ray imaging spectroscopy.  Each pixel of the X-ray photon counter is configured with spectroscopic amplifier features, including low-noise signal amplification with programmable gain/bandwidth preamplifier, and pulse shaping circuits. Enhanced X-rayphoton counting functions include two programmable pulse discrimination circuits (comparators) and two programmable, separately-gateable 15-bit counters.  The counters can be operated individually, each connected to the high and low energy comparators, respectively; in this configuration, they can also be gated individually, or the counters can be configured as a single 30-bit. The threshold comparators can be programmed using column-specific global digital-to-analog converters, and each pixel includes additional 3-bits of programmability.  Another included feature is `integrate-while-read, which makes the dead time between frames negligible.  The readout integrated circuits (ROICs) are designed to be mosaiced, to form a monolithic detector with no dead space between individual ROICS.  The imager is specifically designed for operating in the high gamma and neutron environments of a tokamak.  In Phase I, Voxtel tested a prototype dual-threshold X-ray imager and its performance, including noise and linearity.  We designed and fabricated programmable test camera electronics, the ROIC specifications where shown to meet the application requirements, and we made thick, fully-depleted detectors using high-resistivity Silicon.  We identified a number of product enhancements, and designed and simulated the Phase II imager circuits. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The innovation has application to a range of high energy physics, nuclear physics, and other science applications. The innovation also has applicability for medical applications, including digital mammography, PET, SPECT, and others.

Numerical stability analysis of plasma equilibrium is one of the most important steps in evaluating feasibility of different plasma confinement approaches.  An efficient numerical Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability analysis tool of axisymmetric equilibria is required for an accurate analysis of plasma confinement.  FAR-TECH, Inc. proposes to parallelize code MARS, to extend its capabilities and to significantly improve its performance.  MARS calculates eigenmodes in axisymmetric toroidal equilibria within MHD  kinetic plasma models.  A feasibility study of parallelization of the MARS code was performed in Phase I.

        "abstract": "Eden Park Illumination, Inc. performed research for the development and commercialization of lamps comprising large arrays of microcavity plasmas capable of generating light in the UVB and C wavelength ranges in a slim and flat form factor.  UV light is an efficient light source for a number of chemical processes and disinfection methods available commercially.  It is known to be extremely effective for neutralizing pathogens (bacteria, viruses, cysts) and drugs such as hormone regulators that are of increasing concern in municipal water supplies.  The primary drawback of conventional UV light sources is their limited form factor and the environmental concerns regarding the use of mercury.  Microplasmas are non-equilibrium, low temperature plasma sources and they have high power loading (several 100 kW/cm3) which enables them to excite gases and form UV-generating excimer molecules efficiently.  Additionally, they contain no toxic substances and the microcavity technology enables them to be nearly as efficient as their mercury-containing counterparts.  This Phase I program has been focused on leveraging low temperature, microcavity plasma technology developed at the University of Illinois and Eden Park Illumination to realize low temperature UV lamps that are flat and designed to have a scalable, slim form factor (total thickness less than ~5 mm).  Each microcavity (having a diameter of a few tens of microns to a few millimeters) was fabricated on a window substrate by various microfabrication technologies, and its electric field distribution was tailored by various electrode geometries to reduce power consumption and efficiently excite Xe gas.  Light tiles capable of producing up to 50 mW/cm2 at 172 nm (UVC) from Xe gas were demonstrated with a UV conversion efficiency higher than 20 % in Phase I, and Phase II will develop and demonstrate large scale microcavity UV lamps having areas up to one square foot and their power supplies well matched to the lamp.

        "abstract": "Numerical simulations play a crucial role in the DOE High Energy Physics (HEP) Cosmic Frontier program. They provide a theoretical framework with which to compare observational data from surveys.  Through such comparisons, significant breakthroughs are made.  These breakthroughs can guide scientists in calibrating the underlying cosmological model, to produce simulations that match the observed sky, which enhances our overall understanding of the universe.  Science requirements for such surveys demand simulations of extreme scales.  The ability to perform these simulations,however, is limited by the scale at which we can store, manage, and process the resulting data.  Chief among the pressing challenges are: (i) the explosive growth of data, (ii) the lack of domain-specific analysis algorithms, and (iii) the disconnect between simulation (theory) and observation (experiment).  Large-scale simulations are also used in manufacturing to reduce design costs.  Therefore, these challenges are reflected across multiple scientific domains and not just in cosmology.  The goal of the work proposed herein is the development of an open-source, in situ analysis framework targeting large-scale simulations.  The library will address the explosive growth of data by employing in situ analysis.  Science-aware algorithms will be implemented to address the lack of domain-specific solutions.  Lastly, to bridge the gap between simulation and experiments, the library will also be integrated with a data management system that leverages web-based mining and visualization technologies to simplify scientific workflows.  In Phase I, CosmologyTools was successfully developed as a lightweight in situ analysis framework and it was coupled with HACC (Hybrid/Hardware Accelerated Cosmology Code), one of the core DOE gravity-only N-Body codes.  The Phase I effort has demonstrated the feasibility of our technical approach.  By employing in situ analysis, the data is reduced to the features of interest, I/O overheads and associated costs are minimized, and the scientific workflow is simplified.  Lastly, the Phase I effort clearly demonstrated the need for data management to enable direct comparisons of simulation and observations.  The Phase II project will focus on the development of a full-featured, production-level, in situ analysis library with a number of advanced features including novel feature identification, extraction, and tracking.  Further, the library will be integrated with data management to enable direct comparison of simulation results and data from experiments.  The team will also develop web-based technologies for data mining and visualization to simplify scientific workflows. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Upon completion of Phase II, the resulting infrastructure will have a number of key benefits and broader impacts in science and manufacturing in general. Specifically, it will (i) enable analysis of massive scientific datasets, (ii) enable scientists to glean insights not available before by embedding analysis within the simulation, (iii) enable direct comparison of simulation data and experiments, and (iv) simplify data management and scientific workflows.",

The final structures were assembled and bench tested.  One structure has been installed with a solenoid at the NRL X-band magnicon.

        "abstract": "The problems with current pure niobium (Nb) superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities are that manufacture is expensive; cavity performance is often poor; and manufacturing results are inconsistent.  These problems stem primarily from three factors: (i) the high cost of pure Nb, (ii) a poor and inconsistent microstructure in the starting niobium material, and (iii) seam welding to manufacture cavity strings.  Severe plastic deformation (SPD) processing will be used to produce Nb and bi-metallic Cu-Nb tubes having fine-grains and a uniform/consistent microstructure for hydroforming into SRF cavity strings.  Careful selection of Cu-Nb tube architecture, the plastic strain route, and heat treatment conditions during tube fabrication steps will lead to microstructures with favorable texture giving improved hydroformability and overall lower SRF cavity-string manufacturing costs.  Phase I work included (i) SPD processing bulk RRR Nb, (ii) transforming the microstrructure in high purity (RRR grade) Nb tube for better hydroformability, (3) microstructure examination and mechanical testing of processed tube to assess quality for hydroforming into SRF cavities, (iv) trial extrusions of bi-mertallic Cu-Nb tube, and (v) design of procedures and scale-up equipment for Phase II.  The most remarkable result was successful fabrication of Nb tube with a fine-grain uniform and repeatable microstructure with mechanical properties suitable for hydroforming.  Phase II work will include construction of scale-up equipment for fabricating pure Nb and CuNb bimetallic tubes, SPD processing prototype scale thin wall Nb and CuNb tubes, hydroforming the processd tubes into prototype SFR cavities, and performance testing of the prototype SRF cavities.  Cavity manufacturing and performance experiments will enable an evaluation of tube quality and commercialization potential.  A cost/benefit analysis will assess economic viability of the new technology.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The commercial application is to apply this technology to the production of Nb and CuNb tubes for lower cost superconducting radio frequency cavities.

A design was produced for the 500 kW L-Band, including detailed simulation of the diode type electron gun, interaction circuit consisting of 7 individual cavities, and an RF output window.  In addition, a design was produced for the 5 MW S-Band PPM focused klystron with an efficiency of 49%.  This is higher than that produced by the CLINAC solenoid klystron. Individual designs were realized for all of the critical components.  In Phase II we will complete the design of the 5 MW PPM klystron, optimizing critical parameters such as electron gun, electron beam focusing, PPM structure, interaction circuit, collector, and RF output window.

The application of the SRF cavities for manipulation of the beam properties in the transverse direction finds more and more applications.  The use of superconducting structures helps maximize the electric field gradient, a highly desirable feature for applications involving manipulations of the charged particle beams at the point of delivery, such as Final Focus point of large synchrotron rings.  Application of the parallel bar superconducting structure in future SRF accelerators will allow a further increase over existing machine performance.  This proposal will develop a fully functional horizontal cryomodule for a 400 MHz superconducting parallel-bar crabbing cavity prototype for tilting a proton beam at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  The crabbing cavity uses a significant transverse asymmetry of the electric field distribution of the fundamental mode, which requires a respective asymmetry of the power coupler.  Three competing designs for the crab cavity are currently being evaluated at CERN.  The downselect is planned for April 2013.  Niowave has fabricated all three initial prototypes of the cavity designs, and is ready to implement a cryomodule for the selected design. This proposal will finalize the design and develop the transversely asymmetric power coupler &amp; amp; pickup, the HOM dampers, both slow and fast frequency tuners, and the microphonic mechanical dampers.  All other systems needed for a functional cryomodule (eg: helium transfer lines, magnetic shielding, etc) will also be a part of this project.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II program will allow MetaMateria Technologies to further improve process methods for preparing Bi 2212 powder in order to establish a stable source of reliable starting powder for Bi-2212/Ag wire manufacturers and equipment developers.  One objective of the High Energy Physics (HEP) magnet development program by DOE is the design and development of dipole magnets with fields greater than 15T.  Promising candidates for high field applications in the 15T regime are the so-called High Temperature Superconductors (HTS), such as Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox (Bi-2212) and YBa2Cu3Ox (YBCO) due to their high upper critical field.  MetaMateria utilized a chemical synthesis approach using solution based techniques developed during a Phase I SBIR, which showed the most promise for making a high quality powder and this will be the focus during Phase II.  A reliable source of powder with definable properties is needed for the stabilization of the wire manufacturing process, particularly to avoid the JE limiting defects are tied to the type of powder used for the Bi-2212/Ag wires.  Performance of a wire depends upon the interplay between powder characteristics, wire drawing process variables and configuration, and thermal processing of the wire.  The goal is a reliable starting powder to allow downstream stabilization of the wire manufacturing process.  During Phase I, powder from different batches showed uniformity in composition and purity, however, carbon content was found to be higher than desired and several approaches will be used to lower this below 50 ppm during Phase II and hydrogen below 100 ppm.  The resulting powder will be used by our partner OST (Oxford Superconductor Technology) will use to fabricate standard round filament wires that will then be characterized and tested.  Efforts to minimize porosity due to gas evolution during thermal processing of wires will also be made.  The microstructure and the performance of the wire will then be correlated with the powder characteristics.  The engineering critical current density, JE, as a function of magnetic field will then be measured at 4.2 K.  In phase II, the composition will be optimized to increase the current carrying capacity of the Ag-Mg sheathed Bi-2212 wire, since lack of time did not permit optimization studies in Phase I.  Once processing conditions are established for making a higher quality powder, MetaMateria will scale up its processing techniques to make larger batches of powder (2-5 Kg).  OST will further enhance the performance of the wire by examining alternative methods for preparing wires. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The successful completion of this SBIR program will address direct needs for the HTS conductor development community, where a growing concern exists for stable sources of starting powder that can provide performance required for high field magnets.  Successful completion of the proposed program will enable availability of a reliable domestic source of stable powder which is critical for downstream process stabilization of Bi-2212/Ag composite wires.",

        "abstract": "Both superconducting and conventional accelerating structures require fast electronic control of the input rf power.  A fast controllable phase shifter would allow for example the control of the rf power delivered to multiple accelerating cavities from a single power amplifier.  Nonlinear ferroelectric microwave components can control the tuning or the input power coupling for rf cavities.  Applying a bias voltage across a nonlinear ferroelectric changes its permittivity.  This effect can be used to cause a phase change of a propagating rf signal or change the resonant frequency of a cavity.  The key is the development of a low loss highly tunable ferroelectric material.  The focus of Phase I was development and measurement of the dielectric properties, phase composition, and microstructure of new low-loss nonlinear BST(M) ceramics with the required properties.  Design and simulation of a prototype phase shifter (to be built and tested in Phase II) based on these materials were performed.  Argonne, Brookhaven, Oak Ridge have shown interest in ferroelectric based components for high power management applications.  The planned RHIC 1.3 GHz ERL linac upgrade uses superconducting RF cavities and requires fast tuning of the cavity coupling to the RF feed line.  The ferroelectric tuning devices proposed here will enable the required fast phase correction and control.  In Phase II of this project, the BST(M) ferroelectric tunable components will be used in a prototype L-band phase shifter. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The new BST composition will definitely find a variety of large-signal commercial and military applications like radar antenna elements, electrically-controlled phase shifters, and switching devices.",

Future systems, such as the International Linear Collider (ILC), will require a polarized electron beam intensity at least 20 times greater than produced by strained GaAs, which is used in the current generation of photocathodes.  Additionally, the degree of electron polarization needs to be increased beyond the 80% currently attainable and intrinsic material properties related to improving the surface charge limit must also be addressed, and the photocathodes should be more robust in an RF gun environment.  The end result of the combined Phase I and Phase II efforts will be a new generation of robust photocathodes capable of yielding intense, highly polarized electron beams for use in advanced electron colliders.  We have previously achieved &amp; gt; 85% polarization using a strained superlattice formed from alternating layers of GaAs and GaAsP approximately ten monolayers thick. For this program we will apply a novel superlattice concept utilizing antimony- and arsenic-based material which should overcome material limitations of the GaAs/GaAsP alloys.  In Phase I we designed and fabricated an Sb-based strained superlattice structure grown by molecular beam epitaxy.  The Phase I program optimized the growth conditions to achieve the desired alloy composition and interface quality.  Photocathode structures were fabricated, and their polarization and quantum efficiency were measured at Jefferson Lab.  In Phase II, the novel Sb-based SL photocathodes studied in Phase I will be further optimized by investigating parameters that can affect the polarization and quantum efficiency of these photocathodes for high current electron guns.  We are also planning further improvement on QE.  And finally, the performance of the optimized cathodes will be evaluated in realistic gun environment by Jefferson Lab. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: A successful project will produce a highly efficient polarized electron source for use in experimental research at DoE Jefferson Lab, SLAC, and other electron collider facilities.

With collaborators from the Department of Energy (DOE) laboratories, InnoSense, LLC (ISL) will develop high- temperature-capable solid catcher materials for use in the pre-Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) to improve yields of rare isotopes as atomic or single-species molecular vapors.  ISL will develop refractory yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) porous monoliths as catchers, which retain open porosity after extended vacuum heating at high temperatures.  The goal is to ensure that the YSZ disks retain open paths for effusion of atoms or molecules from the catcher to the ion source to harvest unused rare isotope beams.  Simulations will be used as a predictive tool for the non-equilibrium processes for the transient species of interest.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of fabricating porous YSZ disks (2-3 mm) retaining open, interconnected porosity on the meso- to macro-scale upon heating to 1600 C for up to 24 hours.  These disks remain mechanically robust to handling and extended heating.  In Phase II, we will refine the YSZ formulations to increase porosity and minimize sintering during vacuum heating at 15002000 C.  Phase II will also be geared to scaling up prescreened YSZ disks off-line and conducting in-beam evaluations of release times during long-term heating (24168 hours).  Modeling refractory compounds to optimize the selective release of specific elements as molecular sidebands is planned.  Molecular species (oxides of carbon) are targeted in these measurements.  Trace additives will be optimized to enhance selective release of important elements as molecular sidebands.  Project team will compare the experimental release studies with the simulations.  Engineering efforts to complement product commercialization activities for the DOE entry and spin-off markets will also be undertaken. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The immediate market need for these hot catcher materials is the DOE and installations like FRIB that have powerful and unique techniques for rare isotope production. Other commercial markets are electrodes in ultracapacitors and electrolytes in solid oxide fuel cells.",

        "abstract": "In several instances during the upgrade of existing facilities or designing new facilities in the Nuclear Physics or High Energy Physics communities, it is found that magnets made with neither copper coils nor conventional superconducting NbTi coils can offer an acceptable solution.  Copper coils limit the performance of the machine and consume large amount of power, whereas NbTi require 4 K cryogenic facilities.  This is particularly applicable in those Nuclear Physics machines where the magnetic field requirements are rather modest.  One such case has been found in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) where an e-lens system is under construction to increase RHIC luminosity.  In this case, magnesium diboride (MgB2) operating at 10-25 K seems to offer an exciting and practical solution.  MgB2 based magnets, however, have never been a part of a major accelerator system.  Several critical issues related to extended reliability, field quality, and protection system must be demonstrated before such magnets can be inducted in RHIC or any such future accelerator or medical facility.  In Phase I, we designed and fabricated an MgB2 solenoid coil based on coil modeling and magnet designsdeveloped by Brookhaven National Laboratoryfor replacing an existing e-lens GS1 coil with MgB2.  The coil was characterized at Ohio State University, achieving 72 A and 0.6 T at 14 K.  The main objective in the Phase II is to demonstrate the reliability and robustness of the MgB2 coil technology is ready for use in RHIC and other user facilities.  We will do this by fabricating several MgB2 coils and by conducting an exhaustive series of lifetime cycle tests.  The tests will involve about a thousand ramp-up and ramp-down cycles, about 20 over-current or thermal-excursions hitting the quench limit and about 10 thermal cycles.  Phase II will begin with a design modeling effort of the MgB2 coils for the e-lens system with enough detail so that the magnetic, thermal, and stress requirements can be understood for the fabrication and testing of representative MgB2 coils.  After the technology is proven in Phase II for reliability, we will propose to use this in Phase III to upgrade RHIC e lens system for improved luminosity performance and expect more applications will follow in other accelerator and medical facilities. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The success of this SBIR will lead to the development of improved superconducting magnet systems for Nuclear Physics and for other DOE applications in Fusion and High Energy Physics. It will accelerate the development of MgB2 superconducting magnets in commercial applications such as MRI, fault current limiters, and wind turbine generators.",

        "abstract": "Rare isotope facilities serve a critical need for a rapidly expanding area of nuclear physics research.  Existing rare isotope facilities already provide enough intensity that conventional detector systems have trouble with counting rates while future rare isotope facilities, like the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), will provide particle beams with unprecedented intensities and rates.  Clearly, a challenge exists for particle detectors which will only worsen with time.  The major advantages of using diamond detectors in this application are: (i) the use of simpler water-cooled systems and greater thermal stability; (ii) faster response with low noise, capacitance, and leakage current; and (iii) much longer lifetime because of its excellent radiation hardness.  CVD diamond particle detectors present an advantage over the silicon detectors currently in use because of far superior thermal and electrical properties, and radiation hardness.  During Phase I, we developed several techniques for improving the electronic properties of thin, polycrystalline diamond.  These improvements were followed by the successful fabrication and testing of a time-of-flight detector for NSCL.  During Phase II, we will build on this work by making a large area (200mm x 20mm) focal plane detector for NSCLs fragment separator.  This detector will require advanced control of diamond thickness in addition to the improved electronic properties.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The proposed approach has the potential for a significant impact on particle accelerators used for nuclear physics experimentation around the world.  The development of CVD diamond suitable for detector applications will also provide significant advances over other materials for neutron detection in oil exploration and nuclear power generation, and in beam monitoring and diagnosis in 3rd and 4th generation synchrotron facilities.",

        "abstract": "The majority of radioisotopes used in the United States today come from foreign suppliers or are generated parasitically in large government accelerators and reactors.  Both of these restrictions limit the availability of radioisotopes, especially short lived ones, and discourages the development and evaluation of new isotopes and radiopharmaceuticals.  Studies from the nuclear medicine community have been recommending development of dedicated accelerators for production of radiopharmaceuticals for over 15 years (Institute of Medicine, 1995; Reba, et al, 2000; National Research Council, 2007).    A high power electron linear accelerator (linac) can create both proton and neutron rich isotopes by generating high\\energy x-rays that knock out protons or neutrons from stable atoms or by photofission of uranium or thorium atoms.  Recent advances in superconducting electron linacs have decreased the size and complexity of these systems such that they are economically competitive with nuclear reactors and high energy proton accelerators.  Niowave, Inc. is developing a radioisotope production facility based on a super conducting electron linac with multiple liquid metal targets.  These electron linac based production facilities are expected to cost between $10-15 million with minimal licensing hurdles. This would allow the siting of many units around the country that are close to large metropolitan areas to supply a broad range of isotopes reliably and economically. This SBIR proposal will identify radioisotopes of commercial interest and design the electron linac required.  In addition, the isotope production targets, hotcells and radiopharmaceutical production  facility  will  be  designed  in  collaboration  with  experts  from  Michigan State University, Idaho State University and Fermilab.  Finally, by collaborating with leading research universities, this proposal will educate and train the next generation of scientists, engineers and technicians involved in isotope production.",

It has favorable nuclear properties for both imaging and therapy. However commercial quantities of the isotope at high specific activity are not available. Supply of commercial quantities of high specific activity Sn-117m would be of high interest.  Sn-117m has traditionally been made in significant quantities in reactors, but the low specific activity ( &amp; lt;10 Ci/g) produced by this method inherently restricts its applications.  The difficulty of producing high specific activity Sn-117m has been a barrier to entry for this isotope into the field of nuclear medicine.  In recent years, accelerator produced material has been demonstrated with high specific activities ( &amp; gt;1000 Ci/g); but, producing and purifying commercial quantities at a reasonable cost remains a challenge.  We plan to provide a reliable commercial source of accelerator-based, high specific activity Sn-117m radiochemical for new medical products anticipated to enter the medical markets over the next few years.  This will make it possible to prepare a variety of Sn-117m labeled compounds ranging from small chelates to large proteins such as monoclonal antibodies that target cancer.  Our Phase I work demonstrated the principle that very pure, high specific activity Sn-117m and chelates can be produced to have potential medical applications.  This work now needs to be extended in Phase II to demonstrate commercial feasibility by increasing the quantity and range of Sn-117m based products.  In order to achieve this, we propose a Phase II SBIR that expands on our successful Phase I project to include the following specific aims: (i) To adequately supply high specific activity Sn-117m to R &amp; amp;D activities over next 2-3 years we will reproducibly prepare the Sn-117m in high enough quantities to perform chelation and conjugation experiments that could be used in human clinical studies; (ii) To develop Sn-117m labeled chelates/molecular versions of pharmaceuticals that are/will be in clinical use and would benefit from substituting Sn-117m; and (iii) To define the pathway to a future large-scale commercial production facility, we will show it is possible to scale up the production of Sn-117m to commercially relevant quantities, prepare a market study for the anticipated demand in Clear Vasculars products (radiochemical and pharmaceuticals) and detail a clear pathway to realization. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:   Clear Vascular, Inc. and other companies and research groups are presently developing Sn-117m based radiopharmaceuticals for imaging and therapy for a number of medical conditions.

For such applications, damage free, ultra-smooth chemical vapor deposition diamond substrates of large area are required.  Though large area polycrystalline diamond substrates are currently available in the market, the surface damage of the material makes it undesirable for detector applications.  The company has developed a novel rapid chemical mechanical polishing process to polish poly-crystalline diamond crystal surfaces.  This method is based on enhanced chemical action in a tribological environment resulting in damage-free, ultra-smooth surfaces.

In Phase I the company successfully demonstrated excellent detector performance obtained from diamond plates finished with this polishing method.  This achievement represents the first demonstration of production of damage-free diamond polished surfaces on bulk substrates.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The current AF aircraft maintenance system has a high operational cost of unplanned, premature, and missed maintenance.  The&quot;red&quot;operational anomaly detection thresholds are not adaptive to individual aircraft history nor to changes in operations causing&quot;ringers&quot;and missed detections. Abnormal correlations in aircraft health sensor data that can be precursors to catastrophic failures are not automatically looked for. The proposed Data-Driven Condition-Based Predictive Maintenance (DCPM) system will be developed based upon a proven data-driven abnormality detection system, ANOM, for spacecraft that is operational at Schriever AFB and at TRL 6 at National site. This system learns normal and detects unknown-signature abnormal behavior for thousands of variables in real-time.  ANOM provides context for abnormal clusters with characterizations to which recommended responses can be tagged for historically detected abnormal behaviors.  ANOM is affordably adaptive via retraining for changing operational states with automated cluster specified new training sets over time. The abnormality detections from each source will be fused for each aircraft and across aircraft using our Bayesian Fusion Node (BFN) proven software.  The BFN will also be used to detect and track relationships amongst these events across the fleet. Our Performance Assessment and Process Management software will evaluate DCPM performance.  BENEFIT:  The key competitive advantages of the technology in this proposal are affordability, effectiveness and rapid deployment all made possible via a data-driven approach.   DF &amp; NN&quot;s Data-Driven Condition-Based Predictive Maintenance (DCPM) technology leverages pattern learning software to automatically discover, detect and characterize unknown abnormal signatures.  The technology is extendible and reusable because it is based on the generic Dual Node Network (DNN) DF &amp; RM technical architecture. The data-driven core of the DF &amp; NN ANOM software enables it to be easily applied to detect, recognize, and track abnormalities in any commercial or government system.  Operational prototypes of this capability are already operating on-line at to 2 satellite operations (SOPS) sites and these ANOM tools have been applied off-line to over 100 varied and massive data sets for over 200 combined years of data. DF &amp; NN has a pending patent on the ANOM technology and plans to commercialize ANOM to support many DOD and commercial systems in collaboration with our Commercialization Pilot Program team member Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMC) for Space Operations Squadrons (SOPS), cyber, Remotely Piloted Aircraft, and other LMC products.",

Our unique approach of leveraging the accuracy afforded by the CSAC to minimize both PHY and MAC transmissions lead to an extremely energy efficient handheld solution that can provide voice, text and data communications over a 10 km range for a 72 hour mission without requiring a single battery refresh.  In addition to the extreme battery efficiency, the proposed Phase I solution delivers in excess of 21 dB of LPD at the PHY layer through an aggressive fast frequency hopping system design all implemented on a low cost all COTS hardware solution.   In the proposed Phase II effort we look to develop a TRL-5 hardware prototype of the solution arrived at under the Phase I effort. By leveraging a unique multi-antenna MIMO SDR platform developed at Silvus along with expertise at Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in the use of CSAC we will be able to quickly bring up a robust and reliable hardware platform on which the Time Lancer firmware/software will be ported. The final Time Lancer Phase II prototype will be fully validated in mission relevant environments and CONOPS at such venues as Camp Roberts, CA (as part of the USSO-COM/NPS TNT experiments) and the Aberdeen Test Center.",

        "abstract": "Detectors utilized in high energy and nuclear physics research have, historically, been instrumented with FET amplifiers operated in the cryogenic environment. These amplifiers require heated operation, suffer from large 1/f noise, are very sensitive to microphonic pickup, and dissipate high power. More recently, analog SQUIDs (Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices) have replaced FETs and have solved all of the problems associated with FETs. However, analog SQUIDs are extremely sensitive to magnetic fields, require sophisticated read-out electronics, and in their present configuration are not suitable when large fields are present. In addition, the complexity of peripheral electronics has prevented widespread use of analog SQUIDs in imaging applications that require hundreds of channels. The proposed digital SQUID integrates an analog SQUID with a superconducting pickup coil and an on-chip digital processing circuit. The front-end analog SQUID provides the best energy resolution whose output is digitized on-chip for further processing by room temperature electronics. The analog SQUID is coupled to two highly balanced pickup loops for rejecting large uniform fields. One of the loops is utilized to couple to detectors, magnetically polarized beams, or to other magnetic signals of interest. The second loop is utilized to measure and cancel large background fields. Digital outputs are instrumented with simple peripheral electronics facilitating data acquisition for multi-channel systems. Under the Phase I SBIR project, a novel approach for implementing a digital SQUID for high performance multi-channel applications was developed and demonstrated. This approach can be utilized for multiplexed systems operating at 40 GHz. Such a high frequency operation allows this multiplexed digital SQUID array to be easily implemented with high density detector arrays. The digital SQUID chip was designed, simulated, fabricated, and allits components were successfully demonstrated. The objective of this Phase II SBIR program is to develop a complete multiplexed ultra-low noise digital SQUID magnetometer/amplifier system. The system will be designed for read-out of detectors in unshielded environments and detection of magnetization of polarized nuclei in a magnetic field, and to act as a receiver for Magnetic Resonance Imagining systems. As the first prototype, the system will consist of a 4-channel digital SQUID --each coupled to its own pickup loops--and a single set of peripheral electronics for simultaneous data acquisition of all four channels. The system will be designed and implemented cost-effectively in a modular form so it can be easily extended to a higher number of channels. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The availability of low-cost, multi-channel SQUID systems would result in their wide-spread use in high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy, detector array imaging, particle identification systems, electron microscope systems (for material surface characterization studies), medical imaging, and non-destructive evaluations.",

The goal of high accuracy and robust navigation for mobile soldiers requires a flexible system design that makes use of all available information. A network of soldiers must be able to move seamlessly from operating individually to team-wide navigation to share fundamental measurements. To accomplish this, the soldier worn navigation solution must distribute navigation computation to the individual soldier (taking into account the limited computational ability available on soldier equipment).  This system must also leverage the available communications (to other squad members and optionally to ground sensors, vehicle based navigation systems and command) to share dynamic and timely information to improve the navigation solution.  The final system must have size, weight, power, and cost appropriate for a soldier worn system.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The high-strength steels (HSS) used for landing gear components have a relatively low fracture toughness, and, therefore, once a crack is formed in a HSS component, it may grow rapidly, potentially leading to catastrophic failure of the part and potential loss of the aircraft. This SBIR program will demonstrate the capability of JENTEK Sensors&#039;substantially improved MWM-Array flexible eddy current technology to detect early stage fatigue damage in high-strength steels used for landing gear. In Phase II, JENTEK will implement enhancements in the measurement and data processing procedures, scanning apparatus, and most importantly, a new GridStation instrument that is expected to dramatically improve early fatigue damage detection capability.  Fatigue tests will be performed on HSS coupons and subcomponents to demonstrate the MWM-Array&#039;s capability to image fatigue damage associated permeability changes for HSS. Early fatigue damage identified by MWM-Array imaging will be verified using methods such as scanning electron microscopy and fractography. A scanning fixture will be adapted for MWM-Array imaging of a landing gear component to support demonstration on an actual landing gear component or representative subcomponent.  Coupon and subcomponent tests will include selected features such as shot peening, coatings and geometric complexity to address specific Air Force needs.  BENEFIT:  Landing gear is a critical, non-redundant system in military and commercial aircraft. The capability to inspect for early fatigue damage with the MWM-Array technology is expected to enable reduction in inspection frequency, increased margins of operational safety, transitioning to a condition-based maintenance paradigm and the corresponding life extension of landing gear components. These benefits could be achieved on both military and commercial landing gear and any other application with high value HSS components. The technologies developed will be readily adaptable to rotorcraft, ship, and ground vehicle drive trains, and to ferrous steel elements in commercial aircraft and other critical structures.  Because maintenance and support tasks account for the largest portion of total ownership costs, significant savings can be realized over the lifecycle of these systems with condition-based maintenance.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  We propose to develop a systematic framework for constructing 3D scene knowledge from EO/IR video sequences to provide accurate 3D change detections, informative shadow/occlusion masks for target tracking, and geo-location and compression indicators.  We construct 3D scene models at a range of fidelities to support robust modeling over a broad range of imaging geometries and viewpoint diversities.  3D models are constructed efficiently by leveraging scalable distributed processors as well as a sparse volumetric reasoning algorithm that separates parallax from ground motion using just a few image frames.  The 3D modeling processing is extendable to integrate data from other 3D sources and the 3D change detection processing is extendable to integrate change indications form multiple sensing modalities.  The 3D scene modeling and analysis capabilities provides a practical and rich source of high-fidelity spatial constraints that is fully up-to-date and immediately exploitable for downstream scene understanding applications that require accurate target detection, tracking, and/or geolocation in urban and high relief environments.  BENEFIT:  The automated development of 3D models from aerial video data will enable high performance ISR applications in complex urban and high terrain relief environments.  3D scene models provide strong spatial constraints for focusing target detection on areas of interest, such as the ground plane, confidently identifying parallax effects, and predicting occlusion and shadowing effects.  Keys to the success of a practical tool to accomplish these functions is the integration of 3D data from multiple viewpoints and modalities, ability to process video data from arbitrary collection geometries, and efficient processing of computationally complex 3D modeling algorithms.  The 3D modeling and analysis tool will generate of actionable 3D-derived data products  such as 3D change detection, 3D geolocation, shadow projection, occlusion projection, and compression quality indicators  for use in a wide range of defense, security and geographic information system applications.",

The core components of the system: (a) Smartphone application which leveraged new wireless technologies including WiFi and GPS (b) RSE Algorithms were developed and demonstrated as part of the final deliverable. The smartphone application was designed to provide the user with audio, visual and haptic alerts about the various pedestrian phases on the selected crosswalk. It also provided alerts to pedestrian if the system detects vehicles in a conflicting path. \n\nIn Phase II, the primary technical objective is to develop a commercially deployable and sustainable SmartCross system that not only serves as a pedestrian signal alert system but also ties into the Connected Vehicle Research. This allows the system to evolve with time and developments to ensure greater safety at the traffic intersections. The SmartCross system is not only an application on the smartphone but the entire framework needed to ensure that the pedestrians and cyclists are warned of any potential threat at the intersection. The system is designed to be fully scalable and to be integrated with various types of intelligent traffic signal systems. \n\nIn Phase I, a proof of concept system was deployed, its basic functionality and future scope was clearly demonstrated. In Phase II, the proof of concept will serve as the starting point upon which further development will be carried out based on the feedback from various user groups. One of the user groups for whom this system will be of great use and significantly impact their lives is people with visual impairment. Their enthusiasm for this system was clearly shown during the SMARTDrive Connected Vehicle demonstration by the Maricopa County DOT (April 26, 2012).

Phase Two will involve workshops with focus groups to ensure that the team understands and addresses the needs of the end user. The Concept of Operations document developed during Phase One will be revised and will serve as the foundation for Phase two.

With the existing optical technology, it is increasingly difficult or impossible to meet the new goals and requirements of AF, ORS, and other modern DoD missions.  In particular, (a) rapid fabrication, response to needs, (b) ultra-lightweight optics, (c) compact size, miniaturization, (d) athermal performance, and (e) low cost are all key requirements for DoD missions.  The development of these existing space mirror systems have reached their limit since these technologies require long lead times for fabrication and exceed the mass requirements for future lightweight telescope systems.  New solutions are needed for the imaging telescope systems envisioned for nanosat and near-space payloads.  In this proposal, we offer such a solution without the need for investment in further process or material development.  We propose a path for developing EO/IR imaging telescope mirrors using composite materials which addresses these needs.  Our proposed CFRP telescope mirrors are modular, ultra-lightweight, flexible in design, thermally stable, and rapidly fabricated on ORS tier-2 and tier-3 timescales.  This technology, coupled with a COTS camera system, will lead to high quality, space platform, ultra-lightweight imaging system at drastically reduced cost.  The program proposed here will demonstrate the key, mirror technology.  BENEFIT:  The Ultra-lightweight CFRP mirror technology will drastically reduce the cost and timescale for space platform imaging systems.  This will benefit military application of responsive space and laser communications.  Commercial imaging applications utilizing portable telescope systems will also benefit from this technology.",

However, there is currently no clear and definitive definition of frangibility (with respect to force and energy) for an ILS Glide Slope tower; or any other airfield support structure outside of a single-pole mast. This opportunity provides a basis for collection of comprehensive baseline frangibility data, including previous testing methods and results; and seeks to develop a unified approach and roadmap to frangibility that can be applied to multiple platforms and impact scenarios. SES&quot;approach will be to collect comprehensive frangibility data to share with the international frangibility community for the purposes of refining the definition and specifications governing frangibility on airfields. Additionally, SES will develop and employ a Tower Structural Integrity Program (TSIP) designed to collect field data of frangible composite structures under operational conditions. Data collected will help support the development of field inspection and repair techniques.  BENEFIT:  The collection, evaluation, and resultant frangibility data from this effort will affect commercialization potential of frangible composite structures on global commercial basis. With a better understanding of the definition of frangibility and development of improved test methods, commercial vendors worldwide will be better able to design, manufacture, and implement frangible solutions.

The base station connects to a Prognostic and Health Monitoring Unit (PHMU) located within the existing HUMS Integrated Vehicle Health Monitoring Unit (IVHMU). The Smart Rod End does not require any other modification of the rotor assembly or HUMS and it provides fully autonomous functionality because it harvests energy locally at the rod end to power the sensor system.

Silica based HC-PBG fibers have been produced with low losses, high beam quality and high damage thresholds for wavelength to 2 um, makes them suitable for near-infrared BDS.

(PSI) will demonstrate the rapid prototyping and roll-to-roll (R2R) fabrication of microscale copper metal on dielectric polymer film based metamaterial (MTM) architectures during the proposed Phase II program. We will calculate a broad range of optimized RF attenuators by tuning our microscale MTM geometry and properties. We will then fabricate a range of radio frequency (RF) absorbing MTM films providing at least 99% attenuation at the selected design frequencies. The versatile MTM will provide broad or narrow band attenuation. During the Phase I program PSI demonstrated the low cost, rapid MTM architecture production on a small scale and verified the performance of our unique design via RF testing with an NRL arch configuration. We also showed a 12&quot;wide R2R process for patterning the substrate with the unique MTM architecture. We expect to demonstrate batch fabrication of 24&quot;by 24&quot;prototype MTM panels on the Phase I Option program. During the proposed Phase II Base program, we will construct a 24&quot;wide continuous R2R process for the MTM fabrication. On a Phase II Option PSI will package the MTM to demonstrate the environmental and mechanical stability required for shipboard topside use.",

        "abstract": "With continuing emphasis on transportation sustainability and fiscal stewardship, utilizing existing loop detector infrastructure to obtain more accurate, reliable and comprehensive traffic system performance measures is desired by many transportation agencies. In Phase I study, we found that the capability of the Inductive Loop Detector (ILD) signature technology to re-identify and classify vehicles along a section of roadway creates numerous business opportunities for commercial development. Therefore, in this Phase II project we will design and develop a cost-effective loop signature card for data collection, enhance the vehicle re-identification and classification algorithms investigated in Phase I, and develop a high-definition traffic performance monitoring system (Traffic Monitor HD) for both freeway and arterial applications. Traffic Monitor HD has a web-based interface for real-time traffic monitoring, historical performance analysis, and report. Compared to the traditional performance measurement system, Traffic Monitor HD provides more accurate performance measurements, such as travel time, vehicle class, estimates on emission, and alerts on problematic detectors. To commercialize Traffic Monitor HD, we will develop a commercialization strategy plan to rapidly move the proposed system to widespread commercial use. We will also demonstrate the capability and the applicability of the system in real-world implementations.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  To address the Air Force need for a liquid shim application system for automated advanced fighter assembly, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) developed the Interpolated Liquid Shim Application System (ILSAS), which has demonstrated the ability to apply highly precise amounts of liquid shim that achieve perfect squeeze-out of cured material. Studies with the system demonstrate a 300% reduction in material use, a 450% reduction in touch labor, a 450% increase in production speed, improved uniformity by the virtual elimination of the possibility of trapped voids, and reduction of operator variability through automation, compared with the current process. A cost savings analysis projected a $5.7M savings for liquid shim application on the advanced fighter alone, with larger savings projected for masking, post-cure machining, and extension of the system to gap fill, fuel tank sealant application, and hard shim forming. The fully developed Phase II ILSAS, which POC plans to integrate into Northrop Grummans (NGCs) integrated assembly line (IAL), will be an affordable, production-ready, automatic system that will dramatically reduce cost, increase the rate of production, and improve product quality.  BENEFIT:  Testing of the ILSAS has demonstrated a 300% reduction in material use, a 450% reduction in touch labor, a 450% increase in production speed, improved uniformity by the virtual elimination of the possibility of trapped voids, and reduction of operator variability through automation, compared with the current process. A cost savings analysis projected a $5.7M savings for liquid shim application on the advanced fighter alone, with larger savings projected for masking, postcure machining, and extension of the system to gap fill, fuel tank sealant application, and hard shim forming. Beyond meeting the Air Force manufacturing needs, the ILSAS has the potential to become the new standard in advanced adhesive application.",

Areas such as harbors and other close quarters navigation and operation are an expanding area of mission requirements. Specifically, surface, underwater and buried mines pose one of the most serious threats to US Navy vessels operating in littoral and very shallow waters (VSW), denying access by the Navy to critical seaways and ports such as those in the Middle East and the Pacific. The Navy needs enhanced capability beyond the performance of currently available anti-mine systems to detect, localize and neutralize such mines.  Boston Engineering proposes to meet the Navys requirements for shallow water, complex environment missions with an advanced autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). This AUV, GhostSwimmer, underwent limited sea testing in summer 2012 and is ready for the next step. Our proposed program is aimed at advancing the technology, as well equipping it with the appropriate sensor/payload package, with a particular focus on littoral and VSW operational conditions.",

The long-term goal of this SBIR project is to maintain the microbial stability of IM ration components over a three-year shelf life while increasing the pH and aw values for an improved organoleptic profile by incorporation of First Generation Controlled Release Bacteriocin/Antimicrobial (FGCRB/A). The specific objective of this Phase II application is to develop microspheres for continuous, controlled-release of antimicrobials capable of maintaining the microbial stability of IM rations with improved organoleptic characteristics after exposure to all of the relevant food manufacturing processes. This approach will provide for a safe, high-quality IM ration platform that satisfies the Warfighterfs demand for variety and palatability while reducing the amount of chemical preservatives.  Orbis is uniquely qualified to achieve this objective because of our microparticle fabrication expertise, patented particle fabrication technology, and partnership with shelf-stable food experts at RDI Foods.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will perfect a proprietary batch-scale processing technique for fabricating ultrahard and ultrasharp atomic force microscopy (AFM) tips. The new process involves two steps. First, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is used to coat the tips with a chemically inert, highly conductive, and extremely hard material. Second, a patented process that we have developed, field directed sputter sharpening (FDSS), sharpens the probe tip to atomic dimensions (1- 4 nm radius of curvature at the tip apex). Hard, sharp tips are of considerable scientific and market interest because tip geometry and mechanical properties significantly impact the results of AFM measurements. The current project will carry out research to perfect a batch wafer-scale process able to manufacture hundreds of tips at once. In order to bring the technique to market, the following research and development tasks will be carried out: (a) optimization of process conditions to reproducibly sharpen arrays of AFM probes fabricated on 4-inch wafers, (b) investigation of the ability to coat and sharpen AFM probes with a variety of hard film materials, and (c) assessment of the performance of batch-fabricated probe tips for market-driven probe microscopy applications. The broader/commercial impact of the project arises from the development of robust, reproducible, and durable tips that are more resistant to wear (due to the high hardness) and have favorable characteristics for AFM imaging (small radius of curvature, controlled aspect ratio, and electrically conductive). The project will benefit the academic and industrial communities who use scanning probe microscopy imaging. Although AFM and related probe microscopies have many advantages over electron microscopy (e.g., they can be used under ambient conditions and they can be easily interfaced with optical spectroscopy), one significant drawback is that the probe tips have limited lifetimes owing to wear during use. The development and commercial introduction of probe tips that are ultrasharp, very hard, conductive, and relatively inexpensive will significantly enhance the capabilities of AFM and related techniques such as scanning capacitance microscopy (SCM), a technique of great interest to the microelectronics industry because it is useful for the on-board testing of integrated circuits for delay faults. The research will also be of benefit to those who image insulating surfaces such as polymers and other soft materials where static charge build-up limits efficacy, and to those developing multi-tip probe arrays for lithographic and nanomanufacturing applications.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build a real-time detection instrument for conformational change. Conformational change is a change in the structure of a biomolecule such as a protein. For a given protein, different structural changes produce different functionals effect in a biological cell, for example turning biochemical networks on or off. Virtually all biological processes, and all diseases, are mediated by a particular conformational change or the lack of one. Conformational change is thus a topic of enormous scientific and medical importance. In this Phase II project, multiple improvements will be made to the existing in-house prototype instrument, in software, mechanical and optical design, and fluidics handling, to produce an instrument with high precision and robustness. The research objective of this Phase II project is to create an instrument that can be used by scientists, an important milestone in the development of the technology. The broader impact and commercial potential of this project is to create an instrument that will significantly increase scientists? basic understanding of how conformational changes work, and also enable scientists to discover better or new medicines for diseases. In particular, three-quarters of all proteins known to cause or contribute to disease, due to some mutation, cannot be addressed using conventional techniques. Thus, no effective medicines exist for many diseases. Cancer is one such example. The instrument will enable scientists to find better and new medicines for these diseases. Thus this innovation has great societal and scientific potential. Commercially, this Phase II project will play a critical role in the development of the innovation. It will enable to transition the technology funded by NSF from the current lab prototype to an instrument that will be robust, reproducible and comprehensive enough in its capabilities to enable scientists to use it independently. This important and necessary step is the first on the path to commercialize the innovation.",

Lactate, or equivalently, lactic acid, is the precursor of the biodegradable plastic polylactic acid (PLA). The following Phase I goals were achieved: (i) the creation of a cellulolytic B. subtilis strain with an enhanced cellulolytic ability, (ii) the demonstration of lactate production from pretreated biomass without the use of cellulases, and (iii) the secretion of large-size heterologous proteins in B. subtilis. This Phase II project will further engineer strains with enhanced cellulolytic ability, and will seek to increase product yield, productivity (i.e., its space time yield), titer, and purity using systems biology and synthetic biology tools. At completion of this project, the goal is to have industrially-ready CBP strains that can hydrolyze pretreated lignocellulosic biomass efficiently, with product yields of&gt;90% based on mixed biomass sugars and&gt;95% based on glucose, a titer of ~150 g/L, and a productivity of ~1 g/L/h. Such Bacillus strains will be ready for large-scale fermentation as a continuing commercialization phase. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the production of a key building-block chemical from biomass. New proprietary recombinant cellulolytic B. subtilis strainsdeveloped in this project will provide an ultra-low-cost platform for producing L-lactate from the non-food biomass, with many advantages over other developing CBP microorganisms. Large-scale production of L-lactate from pretreated lignocellulosic biomass will enable the development of other CBP microorganisms that could produce PLA, biochemicals (e.g., succinate) and advanced drop-in biofuels (e.g., isobutanol, jet fuel) in the future.",

        "abstract": "The innovation in this project comes from the novel call audio analysis techniques that can be used to create a fingerprint of the source of a telephone call. Such fingerprints can reveal valuable information about the call source, including the type of the calling device (landline, Voice-over IP or mobile), its geographical location and the networks over which the call audio may have been transported prior to it reaching the called party. To detect potentially fraudulent calls in real-time with such fingerprints, this proposal plans to extend the identification of the geography of a call source and the creation of an active call analyzer that performs audio analysis in real-time. The focus of this Phase II project is on exploring design options for an active call analyzer; including accuracy, scalability and timeliness tradeoffs and its integration in call center infrastructures. The call analyzer will also be used to build a phone fraud intelligence service that proactively detects phone numbers used for committing fraud. Such a service, including mechanisms for sharing of intelligence with partners and customers, can help secure the telephony channel from a variety of attacks. The broader impact and commercialization potential of this project can be seen readily from the observation that phone fraud is already a serious problem for multiple sectors, including banking, healthcare and even law enforcement. Also, because fraudulent calls are already responsible for considerable financial loss, customer agents in call centers are asking multiple knowledge-based questions to authenticate a caller. This leads to higher costs for call handling and also degrades customer experience. A successful active call analyzer solution that can automatically generate a risk score for caller authentication will have broad impact because the entire service sector relies on call centers for customer contact and it could reduce costs and improve customer experience. The project will also enable Pindrop to play a leadership role in organizing the broader community to launch a phone anti-fraud alliance similar to the anti-phishing working group. The thought leadership provided by such a group will be necessary to define the telephony security challenges and approaches for addressing them. Again, this will ensure broad impact of the project across several industries.",

Masonry manufacturers cannot meet the construction industry&#039;s needs with their status quo product and are therefore losing market share. The industry seeks products with higher quality, consistency and performance that address environmental concerns, while remaining cost competitive. The material which has been developed meets or exceeds all required performance standards, and its high recycle content and low embodied energy significantly reduce production costs. The research objectives for this Phase II project include scale-up of this process via extrusion and expansion of the usable waste glass supply. The transition to extrusion will require increasing the plasticity of our material and research will result in extrudates that are compatible with masonry production equipment. The effort will also explore the impacts of contamination on the microstructure and mechanical performance of glass materials sintered at low temperature; this work will be the first of its kind. The ultimate project goal is successful development of the first high-recycle content glass composite paste that is ready for industrial manufacturing via cold extrusion. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant. Successful completion of the Phase II activities will have a positive impact on both the glass recycling and construction industries. One key result will be the development of a novel, high-efficiency glass manufacturing process. This work will contribute to the scientific understanding of plasticity theory and mechanical behavior with respect to glass composites and porous materials. The evaluation of organic and inorganic contaminants, as they relate to advanced glass processing technologies, will be the first research of its kind. This research will provide a commercial outlet for waste glass, particularly the vast quantity that cannot currently be recycled, and therefore is simply hauled off to landfills. This material will allow manufacturers to adopt high-value, cost-competitive product lines and will also bring value to the construction industry by providing a truly green alternative to traditional facing materials.

        "abstract": "FPGAs are widely used in nearly every DoD electronics system because of their processing capabilities, low NRE costs, field programmability, and time to market advantages over ASICs. However, FPGAs&quot;greatest strength  reconfigurability  is also the source of their low performance and high power consumption limiting functionality and battery life of mobile applications.  GoofyFoot Labs has developed the AMP FPGA, a low risk architectural breakthrough that simultaneously achieves the Army&quot;s goals of enhancing tactical radio performance, connectivity, and survivability with significantly reduced power consumption.    The AMP FPGA achieves unprecedented performance operating at a maximum of 1.73 GHz.  The AMP FPGA&quot;s novel architecture does not just achieve theoretical improvements; implemented circuits operate on average 3.7x faster on the AMP FPGA than cutting edge conventional FPGAs.    Without sacrificing performance, the AMP FPGA reduces static power consumption by 10x and dynamic power consumption by 25x when compared to conventional FPGAs, enabling 2.5x longer mission runtimes and reduced recharge downtime with existing battery technologies. Furthermore, the AMP FPGA is inherently robust to harsh environmental conditions.    The AMP FPGA is well suited for SDR, radar, video/image processing, electronic warfare, and signals intelligence applications, and provides breakthrough capabilities for both mobile and ground-based systems.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This program develops a Modular Propulsion system design and demonstration test bed that continues the efforts of the Phase I program that established the feasibility of a green propellant based modular propulsion system.  Two reduced toxicity propellants will be considered: LMP-103S and AFM-315E.  The mission type and the spacecraft size strongly impact the details of the modular propulsions design such as the number and size of thrusters to be used.  Small 1-N thrusters best suited for attitude control activities while thrusters like the 5-N and 22-N thrusters with their more efficient use of propellant are better suited for high delta-V maneuvers.  A modular propulsion housing will provide a stable mounting platform for tanks, valves, thrusters, plumbing, etc.  A Gen 3 ASIM will be developed that allows the whole propulsion system to be commanded as a single device. The ASIM will be commanded by a Propulsion Activity Agent that can take a time referenced position and velocity command and compute the thrust vector and total impulse required.  A brassboard test bed will be created that incorporates the structure, ASIM, Propulsion Activity Agent, our spacecraft simulation with HWIL capability, associated xTEDS, and propulsion components such as valves, transducers, piping, and tanks.  BENEFIT:  Development of a green modular system provides the small satellite industry with more capable missions. The use of propulsion on small platforms can be prohibitive because of overall cost and propellant handling restrictions.  The combination of a modular approach coupled with higher energy density and green aspects of either HPGP or AFM-315E can address both of these issues making propulsion enabled small satellites more viable for a wider user and mission type base, e.g., DoD, NASA, commercial space (both domestic and international), university sponsored programs.  Additionally, such a product type complements rideshare opportunities such as ESPA.  For example, ESPA-class satellites will be able to take advantage of lower cost access to space, but can have the ability to modify their orbits since they are enabled with meaningful propulsion capability.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The proposed portable, hand-held laser tool will enable efficient field or depot maintenance of specialty coatings and outer mold line (OML) materials on advance Air Force weapon systems. Laser pulses are scanned over a coated surface with optimal power, energy and positional control to remove a specific thickness without risk of damage to the substrate material. In Phase 1, the contractor demonstrated the feasibility of using closed loop electronics to automatically remove operator-specified layers of multi-layer coatings. The operator selects the surface color for removal and designates a specific removal area. When the system is triggered, the laser produces pulses at a rate of 10,000 per second, and optics in the tool move the laser target point so that the pulses cannot dwell on one spot. Between pulses, sensors interrogate the surface and electronics compare the sensor signal to an operator-specified criterion. The Phase II system concept will not involve robotic positioning, but a COTS counter-weight positioning device will be included in the design to relieve the operator of the requirement to lift the tool, its umbilical, and waste collection hose. The operator will receive graphical interface information from position tracking sensors to place the tool in the optimum position for coatings removal. To focus SBIR funds on product development, the contractor will provide a legacy laser but conduct product design for a state of technology COTS laser. The goal of the project is to build and demonstrate a field-worthy production prototype with a capability of at least TRL 7.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The goal of the Space Test Program is to enable the US Air Force to rapidly develop emerging space technologies by providing economical flight opportunities to increase a technologys TRL. Over the past decade, the CubeSat form factor has emerged as an economical platform for testing technologies that can be packaged within the 10x10x30 cm form factor. However, the lack of a programmable SGLS/USB transceiver sized for these and other small satellite platforms has hampered the use of the flight-proven ground stations in the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN). Due to the rapid mission design and launch cycles as well as the lengthy frequency allocation process, the spacecraft must be often designed and built well before AFSCN SGLS/USB communication frequencies are allocated. Drawing upon its experience building and flying CubeSats, TUI proposes to leverage its existing SWIFT SDR platform to implement a programmable SGLS/USB transponder use on CubeSat and nanosatellite missions. Our Phase I effort has successfully validated the viability of our proposed approach, which enables simultaneous communication with both SGLS ground stations and newer USB ground stations. In the Phase II effort, we propose to design, build, and qualify a functionally complete SWIFT-AFSCN transceiver.  BENEFIT:  The CubeSat platform has recently become the focus of significant investment by AF, SMDC, SMC, NRO, SPAWAR, and other military organizations due to its low cost and frequent launch opportunities. Prior CubeSat missions have had relatively low downlink throughput due to the low number of ground stations as well as the relatively low gain of their antennas. The SWIFT-AFSCN transponder can provide a secure, high-reliability, high-availability communication link between CubeSats and small satellites with a dramatic increase in collected data, and a decrease in data product latency.",

        "abstract": "Raytheon Missile Systems Gen 4B W-band submodule for its Solid State Active Denial Technology system currently uses liquid coolant, specifically a water-ethylene glycol mixture, for thermal management. Future active denial systems are expected to use up to 1024 of these submodules. Because each submodule has both an inlet and an outlet, the coolant path of each active denial system will have up to 2048 O-ring seals, with the overall system design incorporating a complex set of manifolds for distributing coolant to the submodules. Every seal and coolant line junction in the electronics enclosure must be 100% reliable with no potential for leakage. An alternative, advanced thermal management system could eliminate the use of liquid coolant, thereby greatly improving reliability. Ultramets open-cell foam heat sink technology allows the liquid coolant to be replaced with air, eliminating the risks to the electronics from liquid leakage at the O-ring seals.   In Phase I, Ultramet modeled, designed, fabricated, and tested low-cost, high-performance heat sinks for actively cooled high-power electronics. A novel graphite foam was developed based on processing methods used in long-established, ongoing commercial manufacturing of vitreous carbon foam at Ultramet. The resulting open-cell graphite foam acts as a high thermal conductivity, high surface area cooling fin, and was tested under a range of heat flux and air flow conditions. Graphite was chosen based on its high thermal conductivity and excellent corrosion resistance. The foam ligaments act as an extended surface for heat dissipation. By forcing cooling air through the foam, heat is removed very rapidly due to the high thermal conductivity and the extremely high surface area of the foam structure. Heat transfer testing was performed both with and without foam, and the data showed that for a given power dissipation and coolant flow rate, the foam-based heat sinks yielded surface temperatures 100-150C lower than those without foam. Similarly, for a given Reynolds number, the measured heat transfer coefficients were more than 200% greater when foam was present.   In Phase II, Ultramet will perform additional analysis, design, and testing to further improve heat transfer in the submodule heat sink by utilizing foam-based strategies while minimizing pressure and volume pumping requirements. Ultramet will work with Raytheon to design and fabricate hardware and perform submodule testing to fully evaluate the potential of this thermal management approach. A system-level demonstration will follow, with a complete coolant system to be designed and built for Raytheons active denial system and a 1000-hour test performed to determine volume and pressure capability as well as identify any erosion. Finally, the coolant system will be interfaced to a 100-W submodule setup for heating via surrogate load, packaged complete with instrumentation and any other supporting equipment, and delivered to the Army for evaluation.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  QuinStar proposes to develop an efficient, linear solid-state power amplifier (SSPA), operating over the 81 to 86 GHz band, for high data rate communications between Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and satellites. We will accomplish this by employing state-of-the-art wide-bandgap gallium nitride (GaN) HEMT devices in conjunction with several circuit innovations. First, we will employ a quasi-switching mode of operation for the MMIC amplifier to improve its efficiency. Phase I results presented in this proposal indicate that with this technique, drain efficiencies of up to 71% are possible. Second, we will utilize Envelope Tracking (ET) and Digital Pre-Distortion (DPD) to linearize the resulting switching-mode amplifier and extend its efficiency over a wide dynamic range. During Phase I, we demonstrated the power and versatility of this approach by using measured GaN MMIC data in conjunction with simulations. We were able to improve the amplifier average efficiency by more than a factor of 3, while simultaneously meeting the -36 dBc ACPR linearity requirement. Finally, to realize the 50W power levels required, we will employ innovative power combining techniques. We are proposing a 2-tier, 64-way combining structure with the 1st tier consisting of a new 4-way combining network and the 2nd tier, a 16-way radial combiner. With this combination, simulations indicate an overall 85% combining efficiency.  BENEFIT:  Future warfighters will require increased SATCOM capacity for improved situational awareness. Current SATCOM bands are already overly congested indicating the need to exploit nontraditional frequency spectra, such as the E-band up and down links at 81-86 GHz and 71-76 GHz, respectively. This proposal addresses the uplink requirement by proposing a 50 W high-efficiency linear power amplifier for the transmitter. High efficiency is required to reduce the UAV prime power requirements and to reduce self-heating. This, in turn, will increase the amplifier&quot;s reliability or lifetime (MTTF). Linearity (-36 dBc ACPR) is required in order to handle advanced spectrally efficient modulation schemes, such as 32-QAM, without distorting the information or generating adjacent channel interference. In addition to SATCOM UAV applications, this linear, high-efficiency SSPA technology can be utilized in space-based applications including broadband RF cross-link communications in satellite constellations and the Air Force&quot;s V/W-band communications system. Specific examples include the Joint Arial Layered Network (JALN) and AISR architectures. Furthermore, this high-efficiency power MMIC technology can be readily applied to other military/NASA missions in the adjacent frequency bands, V and W. NASA needs high-efficiency, W-band power amplifiers for many of its space-based missions. High-efficiency W-band amplifiers are required for the LO multiplier chain for the Scanning Microwave Limb Sounder on the Global Atmospheric Composition Mission and for SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy). The output power levels and efficiencies for these NASA applications are in line with the requirements of this program. Finally, QuinStar is currently supplying the transmitter for the AARGM missile and the W-band high power amplifier technology described in this proposal is directly applicable. QuinStar, as a merchant supplier of high-rel microwave and millimeter-wave components, is uniquely positioned in the marketplace to capitalize on this opportunity to become a major supplier of high-rel, linear, high-efficiency SSPAs for airborne, space and terrestrial applications.",

        "abstract": "With the current state of world events, the threat of buried explosives used against military vehicles is more pronounced than ever before. The introduction of the MRAP and MTVR vehicles have helped mitigate this threat to a degree, but military personnel continue to suffer from both death and serious bodily injury as a result of IED/mine explosions. To address this need, improved comprehensive simulation capabilities are needed to help design improved safety components for vehicle occupants. The proposed effort, which builds on previous work performed under US Army funding, will develop next-generation simulation capabilities to better predict the effects of buried explosives on ground vehicles and occupants. Blast and soil modeling will be performed using advanced simulation tools developed as part of the DoE ASCI program at the University of Utah and the vehicles will be modeled with the LS-DYNA FE code. Occupant modeling will be performed using LS-DYNA. The final product of the Phase II will be a micro-coupled MPMICE-LS-DYNA model, which leverages the best capabilities of each simulation tool. Comparisons will be made between simulations of the MTVR exposed to a buried threat and live-fire test data for the same configuration.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Warfare is changing at increasingly rapid rate.  What was once advanced technology has become simple and inexpensive for our adversaries to obtain.  These contemporary truths complicate the U.S. military&quot;s training requirements and result in training solutions that often lag behind the current fight.  Current standard simulation technology is typically designed to address a prerequisite set of tactical problems and allows minimal flexibility outside of predetermined constraints. This simulation is focused primarily on recreating what has been observed and perhaps expanded to include some variable conditions also predicated on our observations. The resultant simulation often leaves us mastering the skills of yesterday&quot;s fight and addresses only known threats and observed behaviors in an environment with relatively static adversarial decision making.     Future simulation must be as flexible as our adversaries.  To this end, BSI proposes the continued development of our Common Cognitive Decision Architecture (C2DA) as a means to help our distributed simulation frameworks rapidly and accurately represent agile, reactive, and adaptable threats.    The new Phase II capabilities will give the end-user the tools to perform complex analyses, assessments and calculations, determine available and applicable options, present choices to the user, and inject dynamic behaviors into the target simulation environment.     BENEFIT:  In Phase II, BSI will leverage and significantly extend the capabilities demonstrated by the BSI Phase I prototype of the Common Cognitive Decision Architecture (C2DA) to empower the non-programmer end-user with the tools to rapidly develop and deploy a highly extensible set of even more powerful and capable rule-based Battlespace Assessments (BAs), Decision Factors (DFs) and Decision Responses (DRs), and control over how those assets are executed, to deliver an exceptional level of dynamic realism to distributed battlespace simulations. The new Phase II capabilities will give the end-user the tools to create and use these BAs, DFs and DRs to perform complex analyses, assessments and calculations, determine available and applicable options, present choices to the user, and inject dynamic behaviors into the target simulation environment.     The market for distributed military simulation is vast and increasing as more and more training moves into the simulated realm.  Many hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on DIS-capable simulations, including weapon system trainers (WSTs), full-motion trainers (FMTs), image generators, and a wide variety of SAFs.  In short, the market is many orders of magnitude larger than required for BSI to thrive with just a small market share.    The first product that will incorporate the C2DA is BSI&#039;s Modern Air Combat Environment (MACE).  MACE is BSI&quot;s flagship product is the Modern Air Combat Environment (MACE), a DIS-based entity generator and threat environment.  Within six months of the initial release of MACE in April of 2011, MACE had been sold to USAF, ANG and USSOCOM units, educational institutions and to companies in the private sector.    We believe that a fully developed C2DA will make MACE (and third party CGF/SAFs) even more capable and attractive to our customers, as it externalizes and empowers the end user to dynamically affect entity behaviors, increasing the realism and efficacy of entity interaction in a distributed simulation framework.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Satellite intelligence information is being used increasingly for real-time operations.  This requires satellites that can be quickly tasked for new objectives and that can respond to opportunistic situations and external threats.  Unfortunately, today&#039;s satellites rely on ground operators to control them.  This means there is a large delay between when a new task is requested, or a new threat or target of opportunity is identified, and the response by the satellite. TRACLabs proposes the The HAMMER system, which is designed to operate on-board a satellite, controlling the satellite&quot;s goal-oriented activities  and responding to threats even when it is not in communication with the ground or when time constraints require immediate response to threats and faults.  The HAMMER system attempts to meet mission objectives even in the face of threats and faults.   HAMMER prioritizes multiple, competing user goals and requests and determines a satisfactory ordering of satellite tasks to conserve resources and maximize capability.  HAMMER autonomously executes the tasks by issuing commands to the host satellite system.  BENEFIT:  We believe that HAMMER provides the following benefits to the Air Force: 1) Rapid and continuous response: does not require ground to be in the loop; 2) Self-defense responses to threats; 3) Immediate mission replanning due to disturbances or opportunities; 4) Guaranteed safety (from modeled threats, given defensive response capabilities); 5) High-level tasking of spacecraft: planning and execution framework fills in fine-grain command details; and 6) Increased spacecraft productivity: more observations, more tasks accomplished. This work has commercial applications in enabling the automation of vehicles such as satellites, unmanned vehicles (e.g., unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), etc.), and manned vehicles (e.g., aircraft, spacecraft, ships, etc.). This work also has commercial applications in the oil and gas industry and in the industrial robotics industry.",

        "abstract": "The current approach to airframe design is to select materials and structures for mechanical and thermal load performance based upon initial properties. The reality is that environmental influences cause materials to degrade over time, coatings and paint systems are applied to slow down this degradation. However, the coatings themselves eventually degrade or are damaged in service. Areas of inadequate protection or high galvanic activity cannot usually be identified until the design is completed and fielded. In Phase 1 we successfully demonstrated that the FEA approach to galvanic corrosion prediction is a sound method and delivers excellent qualitative results on corrosion locations and relative severity. The current GalvanicMaster software is an excellent prediction tool for the initial corrosion state when used with metallic materials, coatings and to some extent anodized layers. However, most Naval systems are protected by complex paint systems, which the software currently does not accommodate, nor does the model include the effect of corrosion product build-up on the surface. Phase 2 will fully develop the approach into a usable design and prediction tool, incorporating paint systems, coating degradation, coating damage and corrosion product build-up.",

Non-Cooperative targets must be addressed with radar sensors that detect, acquire, track, and determine the targets collision potential as well as support the clearing maneuvers.   ADS-B signals lack encryption and can be readily spoofed for drug trafficking, identity denial and false target generation purposes. Spoofing can translate the position of drug traffickers away from drop zones. Enemies may want to hide the identities of military aircraft as commercial traffic or flood the skies with false targets to stress or overwhelm the system to hide ulterior activities.

Even in objective-driven game design, serious games with cognitive learning objectives can lack effective, customized feedback.  Tutoring systems, such as AutoTutor, create opportunities for learners to elaborate on answers they have given in response to a tutor&#039;s questions, prompts for information, suggestions for actions, etc.  One way to incorporate performance feedback in serious games is to embed a tutoring system with similar functionality into the virtual environment.  CHI Systems, a small business innovator in simulation and training, completed a Phase I SBIR called Game-based Architecture for Mentor-Enhanced Training Environments (GAMETE), demonstrating an architecture and modular interactive framework for pairing games with tutoring technologies, using as exemplars AutoTutor and vMedic in a Soldier-centered domain. Our Phase I effort established a foundation for creating a comprehensive interface tool for enabling training developers to integrate tutoring capabilities into games.

The method allows braid unit cells to be individually activated and deactivated after each braiding cycle for applications where changes in part cross section require the addition or removal of yarns. For parts having a cross section that changes in shape while maintaining a similar area, yarns may be moved in any of four directions to simply relocate them to new positions within the integral braid. The ability to incorporate interlocking yarns in two directions enhances the preform&#039;s integrity during handling and subsequent processing. Compactness of machinery and high carrier density reduce fiber damage and maintain uniform braid density throughout the part&#039;s cross section. The flexible apparatus can be modularly built up in differing complexities, thus keeping costs low.

One such database is the JSC Equipment, Tactical and Space (JETS) database maintained by the Joint Spectrum Center. This project will take advantage of equipment databases for reliable cosite interference modeling and simulation by enhancing the cosite simulation tool EMIT to enable it to take full advantage of existing RF equipment databases such as JETS.",

        "abstract": "In Phase I, SDC demonstrated feasibility of lightweight and low cost technologies for containerizing and vertically launching multiple missiles simultaneously for the EAPS system. The next step, in Phase II, is to continue the component and design trade studies to develop the lightest and most cost effective canister system possible for EAPS, manufacture full scale EAPS canister assemblies, qualify the canisters with relevant environment testing, and provide full scale EAPS canister assemblies to the EAPS prime contractors for qualification testing and final system validation. The overall goal of this SBIR program is to enter into a Phase III effort with the EAPS prime contractor to produce lightweight and low cost canisters that meet all EAPS requirements in order to benefit the Army and the warfighter. This SBIR program has a unique opportunity in which the small business, SDC, is fully capable, based on experience and legacy, of developing and producing production canisters for an existing platform, the potential missile program prime contractors are engaged, and the missile development and canister development schedules are aligned. The Phase II effort is a vital step required to bridge the gap between the feasibility shown in Phase I and Phase III platform integration.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The high costs and inherent dangers of live training with air platforms have motivated the increasing use of simulation-based training. However, selecting a system to effectively meet training objectives can be challenging, particularly one that must blend multiple disparate technologies. Among these challenges is the need to acquire visual display systems that optimally support training objectives. To support this need, Aptima, Inc., proposes to develop a prototype Decision Support System (DSS) known as SAGES (System Acquisition Guidance from Expert Systems), a model-based solution intended to provide insight into the relationships between visual display attributes and training objectives. The SAGES system will include tools to characterize visual display systems, specify training objectives, and explore the tradeoffs for how well a system meets a set of training objectives compared to another system. An expert system will be at the center of this solution to analyze and prioritize systems based on a data-driven model.  BENEFIT:  The SAGES system will offer extensive benefits to both acquisition professionals and training communities. Acquisition professionals will be able to make informed decisions on the tradeoffs of visual display system purchases with minimal time and effort, which both facilitates optimal training and maximizes the impact of dollars spent on simulation-based training equipment. Training communities will be able to better understand existing training technology to improve the success rates for meeting training objectives. Furthermore, the commercial applications for SAGES are promising. All sectors of the Department of Defense rely on virtual environments for air platform training, and must carefully select visual display technology to meet training objectives. A similar application for SAGES can benefit the commercial aviation industry as it addresses the impact of HR5900 Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010. Finally, the medical simulation market, which also requires high visual fidelity for effective training, continues to grow and thus requires support in determining visual display technologies to meeting training objectives.",

Its applications range from radars to electronic warfare (EW), surveillance &amp; communications, etc. Its important applications to other military and commercial systems and platforms are obvious. For decades, wideband wide-scan planar phased arrays have faced highly challenging technical difficulties and high costs. The proposed Navy SBIR Phase-II research program, Topic N111-040, is to develop a linearly-polarized array element design that can operate from 2 to 12 GHz, with a wide scan angle of 60 degrees or more. This wideband array can replace several arrays in S-X bands on a platform of limited surface area suitable for antenna mounting, thus potentially achieving a reduction of 70% or more in both acquisition and life-cycle costs. The feasibility of the proposed approach has been demonstrated in Phase-I effort at Wang Electro-Opto Corporation (WEO), supported by the ElectroScience Laboratory (ESL) of the Ohio State University (OSU). The design approach will be optimized by computer simulation and breadboard verification. A small phased array panel will be developed and its beam-scan capability will be demonstrated using a beam-steering network of limited angular range.

        "abstract": "Detection, tracking and identification of targets, and subsequent prosecution is very challenging in dynamic environments. Traditional methodologies rely on an operator to analyze all the available information to identify what is actionable, and subsequently modify asset tasking. The operator workload associated with the use of traditional methodologies can rapidly become overwhelming when the sensor contact density increases to levels that are considered modest in comparison to typical littoral environments. Consequently, it is highly desirable to automate the decision processes to the greatest extent possible using the available information from all on-board and off-board platform resources (sensors, DTED, intelligence, etc.). The results of the automated decision processes can range in utility depending on platform capabilities and mission objectives, and in a general sense comprise a tactical decision aid (TDA) with a tiered level of operator involvement. The scope of the automated decision processes that reside within the TDA can range from adjudicating relatively simple target threat profiles to conducting contact behavior analysis for anomaly detection or attention focus filtering via some level of hypothesis testing. All these types of capabilities can be considered attributes of a TDA that ultimately serves the end purpose of maximizing mission success. The combination of a TDA and a dynamic sensor resource manager (RM) can be considered to constitute a sensor exploitation management system (SEMS). The hierarchical organization of autonomous and semi-autonomous control is fundamental to LSI&#039;s ongoing efforts to develop a RM for airborne radar applications with the overarching objective of a RM eventually becoming kernelled within a TDA is a component of the bigger picture that guides proposed effort. The attributes of LSI&#039;s RM algorithms are guided by overarching OPSIT/TACSIT considerations that in turn motivate the satisfaction of a TDA objective (or a mission objective). Upon specific criteria being satisfied, a TDA/RM or SEMS would automatically adopt the next course of action while minimizing operator workload.",

Overall morbidity associated with such wounds could be reduced substantially if the infectious etiology of these infections was clarified rapidly, especially for the presence of select multidrug-resistant pathogens. Current methods for diagnosing wound infections are too time-consuming to be relevant, and so new diagnostic tools are required.    In our Phase I, we developed and demonstrated a new optical biomarker that can detect bacteria at clinically relevant concentrations.  We demonstrated the efficacy of this biomarker by accurately characterizing the presence/absence of bacteria in the plasma of blood obtained from hospitalized febrile patients.  We also demonstrated a UV Raman modulation scheme that could be used to distinguish different pathogens.  In the Phase II proposed here, we will extend this biomarker to characterize wound infections.  We will show that we can accurately detect, characterize and distinguish the presence of MDR pathogens in the milieu of commensal bacteria that are often present at a wound site.

        "abstract": "Naval ships require several thousand valves ranging in size from  to 10 in pipe diameter. Many of these valves carry seawater or other corrosive fluids. The valve packing gland is used to prevent water from leaking past the stem. The corrosion occurring on the valve stem can compromise the packing gland and lead to a leaking valve. The packing is a graphite bushing that is relatively soft and capable of sealing around the valve stem when compressed by a packing nut. The current procedure to stop a leak through the valve stem is to simply tighten the packing nut and compress the packing more. However, severe corrosion of the stem causes the valve to leak and the packing nut can only be tightened so many times before the valve is rendered unusable and requires maintenance. To solve this problem, Mide developed a method to isolate the fluids from entering the valve stem. Mides Valve Stem Isolation design will prevent fluids from entering the valve stem and prolong the life of a valve without affecting performance. This solution significantly reduces the Total Ownership Cost (TOC) of the valves.",

They key technologies that will be developed in this program to make this project successful include: (1) reticule stitching of the required large-area high-voltage VLSI driver chip, (2) The development of polymer MEMS structures to support the membrane mirror atop the large rectangular chip, and (3) the development and implementation of an off-axis Three-Mirror, Anastigmatic (TMA) optical readout system to eliminate stray light and thereby optimize the contrast ratio of the system.  The electronic interface to the VLSI-MMLM will also be updated to be fully compatible with the large-format VLSI chip and to support its operation.

We showed that it could scan from zenith down to at least 15 degrees above the horizon, superior to any existing phase array designs. Our design also features a single PCB (RT/Duroid) and a standard-size coaxial feeding cable with feature sizes that can be manufactured with advanced PCB manufacturing techniques.     In Phase II, we will further optimize/refine the array design and demonstrate its key performance parameters such the bandwidth, wide scan angle, polarization, etc. on a prototype array with measurements at the anechoic chamber. We will also develop a roadmap for low-cost mass-fabrication of the array for faster transition to the market.

While those pixels offer the analyst the eye-in-the-sky, today&#039;s systems rely on the analyst to interpret the scene without the benefit of additional context that can be obtained from readily available data types, such as terrain and elevation information, roadways, points of interest, Controlled Airspace Symbology, Restricted Airspace Boundaries, FAA Centers, radar, and LIDAR data.  Our goal under this proposed effort is to augment the user experience by adding geo-registered layers from these information sources. In Phase I of this project, ObjectVideo demonstrated prototypes of all the necessary components and core technologies of a viable real-time overlay system. For Phase II, ObjectVideo will focus on refining and extending the core technologies and integrating these components into an end-to-end overlay system. OV will also implement novel features including utilization of external reference data for improved overlay accuracy, optional rendering of occluded overlay elements, and an expanded context view providing greater situational awareness of regions surrounding the UAV&quot;s field-of-view. The system will provide users with critical single-click, single-glance information on any client capable of displaying video.  BENEFIT:  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are a critical component of Intelligence,  Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for all branches of the armed forces, but the limited viewing angle and resolution of typical UAV video can limit the ability of users on the ground to act. The proposed system would increase the situational awareness of users by providing important contextual and targeted information, overlaid onto the video in a clear and accurate manner, in real-time.   The enabling technologies proposed have the following benefits, within this project and in future efforts:   Performance and Scalability: The system takes full advantage of COTS GPU hardware to render multiple overlay streams in real-time.  System architecture allows scalability in several dimensions.   Accuracy: advanced computer vision based techniques correct for common errors in sensor metadata and yield far more accurate overlay results than nave approach.   Low-Cost: COTS PC and GPU hardware   Flexibility: The system can be configured as a scalable client-server architecture, or deployed on a single laptop for stand-alone use.  The standards-based client-server architecture allows interoperability with a wide variety of client platforms, including mobile devices.    Extensible via SDK: Overlay and VDMS SDKs allow developers to add data types, custom overlays, or incorporate the system into new applications   Compatibility: Standards-based approach allows interoperability with a wide variety of data and applications.   Intuitive User Interface: Easily leveraged by novice users.    The completed system will provide an inexpensive, high-performance overlay system which provides valuable situational awareness to consumers of UAV video feeds.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project of ?No Heat Spray Drying? fundamentally changes the process of spray drying liquids to powders by eliminating the use of heat. Typically, a liquid emulsion consists of a high value liquid ingredient that is emulsified with a carrier system that when dried captures the liquid ingredient in a powdered form. High temperature spray drying remains the preferred method of drying many thermally sensitive materials such as foods, chemicals, probiotics, pharmaceuticals, and in many other applications where the production of a free-flowing powder is required. The current spray drying process employs air heated up to 400\u00b0 Fahrenheit to dry the liquid into a powder. Exposing sensitive, volatile liquid ingredients to high temperatures causes molecular degradation that negatively impacts performance. By eliminating the use of heat the end result is a significantly improved powder in terms of product quality, solubility, stability and overall performance. Our research will be focused on improving our proprietary technology through dryer optimization and atomization development. This research should yield an innovative, commercially viable ?no heat? spray drying technology with the ability to manufacture significant amounts of powdered products. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project spans markets including food &amp; beverage, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, infant formula, coffee, vitamins and numerous other segments where the production of a free flowing powder ingredient is desired. The challenge: how to eliminate the use of heat in converting liquids to powders. By eliminating the use of heat in the manufacturing process, we create significantly improved powder products. Our process is more economical, delivers products with longer shelf life, better encapsulation and improves solubility. Our technology has several societal benefits including decreasing energy consumption and preventing the evaporation of volatile ingredients into the atmosphere. Our technology may be able impact the bioavailability of drugs, decrease tablet sizes, deliver stable Omega 3 ingredients and improve dried milk powder. We are only beginning to explore the potential applications of our revolutionary process technology",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will deliver a system that can continuously process advanced refractory metal alloys from elemental, scrap or preprocessed feed stock into powder or small castings. The advanced hybrid plasma arc induction furnace uses the latest in clean melting techniques maintaining the full theoretical properties of these promising materials. This is a direct processing route for near net shape products. Advanced titanium alloys, for example, require special processes to maintain their material properties. This process will allow the development of specialist alloys without the cost and complexity of large and expensive foundry processes and rolling mills. The process developed takes pure elemental material and produces castings or powder in one direct cycle. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the creation of new methods for development of specialist and advanced reactive and refractory alloys. Currently there is no economically viable route for these alloys to move from small, lab-scale experiments to use in large-scale commercial applications. This new process will speed the process of transitioning these materials into emerging applications. The overall objective of this project is to create a pilot-scale plant to produce castings and powder of these specialist materials. Some selected material systems where this new process will have a potential impact include advance titanium-based shape memory alloys and intermetallics such as niobium?]silicide based compounds. These new materials will create value for customers and users in the medical and aerospace industries, among others. The new process will be commercialized via the sale of a toll production service for castings and powder, and also via direct sales of the resulting equipment. Finally, the ability to easily produce pilot-scale quantities of novel alloys more cost-effectively will enhance the scientific understanding and application of these materials.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop an 840 nm spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) system for intravascular imaging applications. The system will be designed to provide images equal to or better than what is currently clinically available, and will have higher imaging speeds with lower cost. Intravascular OCT is poised for clinical acceptance and commercial growth, but is still limited by availability and cost. Increasing system speed and reducing cost will accelerate clinical use of intravascular-OCT. The Phase II research will move the system toward commercial readiness by including in vivo imaging in a porcine animal model. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be the availability of a new imaging tool for the identification and treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD affects an estimated 16 million Americans and is the primary cause of heart attacks and strokes, which killed over 631,000 and 137,000 people, respectively, in the United States in 2006. Intravascular OCT provides detailed imaging information on plaque assessment, stent implantation, and stent monitoring over time. Identification and treatment of unstable plaques and other intravascular conditions will reduce the morbidity and mortality rate from CAD. Billions of dollars are spent on imaging and treatment of CAD. An OCT system with increased imaging capability and competitive cost will provide a significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop a new signal amplification system that, while being inexpensive and simple to use, can be combined with antibodies or other probe molecules and can increase detection limits of conventional Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) by 100 to 1000-fold. ELISA has been used both in science and diagnostic for more than 40 years. ELISA is simple, reliable, and inexpensive technique. However, because of the nature of enzymes used in this technique as signal-generating and amplifying device, it has a relatively low sensitivity. During Phase I, it was demonstrated that substitution of these enzymes with phages that can propagate and simultaneously generate light signal substantially increases the sensitivity of ELISA and simultaneously reduces cost of the assay without complicating its protocol. In Phase II, the goal is to further improve sensitivity and response time of the system and create two types of products: 1) components that can be plugged-in into conventional ELISA system, and 2) kits designed for detection of specific toxins and other pathogens. The broader impact /commercial potential of this project is expected to impact the areas of basic research, biodefense, and medicine. The proposed system will allow very sensitive and inexpensive detection of antigens of choice. For those involved in basic research, the proposed immunoassay will allow a significantly more detailed analysis of biological processes, possibly even opening the doors to monitoring those processes and molecules previously undetectable. In biodefense and medical diagnostics, increased sensitivity will mean an increased security by allowing earlier detection of harmful pathogens, as well as pathological changes in the human organism.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will build upon the data compiled during Phase I in which Selenium Ltd. worked with university and commercial partners to develop a novel anti-biofouling technology to be deployed in water filtration membranes and membrane spacers. The technology explores the use of organo?]selenium compounds and their ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) while being covalently bound to a substrate. As biofouling remains one of the largest problems to be solved in water filtration, the integration of the proposed technology into numerous filtration components at the point of manufacture emphasizes the technology?fs flexibility and capability to mitigate this problem in a commercially viable and economic way. The objectives in this Phase II project will be to optimize integration strategy specific to the manufacturing parameters of each filtration component (i.e. feed spacers, polyamide reverse osmosis and polysulfone ultrafiltration membranes, etc.). Further objectives will be to integrate organo-selenium compounds into pilot scale modules, developing a data set measuring antifouling capabilities in real world scenarios with the help of commercial partners. Selenium anticipates the results of this project will concretely identify the technical integration strategy and added value for delivering produced water at reduced costs. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is based on the notion that mitigating the industry problem of biofouling will reduce energy and maintenance demand, thus decreasing the costs associated with water filtration and produced water. Furthermore, the technology has broad applicability to a number of other filtration markets such as pharmaceutical and oil and gas, which could benefit equally from the reduction in biofouling. As the necessity to produce drinkable water from a growing number of sources emerges as a leading societal need, the ability to reduce costs positions the technology to be deployed worldwide allowing for populations across the world to benefit. By increasing the efficiency to produce drinkable water from sources such seawater and wastewater, water producers may produce drinkable water at reduced costs with less cleaning. The ability to combat biofouling continues to be an ongoing area of development. While a broad spectrum of technologies have been employed to explore antifouling properties, few have had much success. Should the technology substantially reduced the problem of biofouling while proving viable in the commercial manufacturing of filtration equipment, it could be considered one of the most influential innovations the filtration market has seen in the past decade.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project enables an innovative low cost approach to reaction bonded silicon carbide (RBSC). RBSC is a preferred material for mechanical seals, which are critical, costly components in many major manufacturing lines. The high cost of RBSC limits its use in favor of cheaper, shorter lived materials. A microwave heating process, combined with lower cost raw materials addresses RBSC cost issues. Phase I research identified a process range for producing RBSC with flexural strength above the industry average. The Phase II research will yield reliably high strength RBSC. The key objective for Phase II is optimization of all-carbon preform formation, and microwave infiltration methods, to fabricate prototype mechanical seals for industrial evaluation. The new RBSC will be characterized according to mechanical seal industry approval specifications. Innovative forming processes including 3D printing will be studied for the ability to quickly form complex, custom, near net preforms for infiltration. The anticipated result is a commercially ready, lightweight, high strength RBSC that will be preferred for existing and new applications. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will include significant cost reductions for wear resistant applications. A low-cost, superior performance mechanical seal will improve efficiency, with fewer costly production shut-downs due to pump failures. RBSC provides a longer overall lifetime than tungsten carbide, graphite, or alumina parts, further reducing life cycle costs. Mechanical seals cost on average $750 per inch of diameter, ranging up to 15&quot; across. This research will enable a 50% reduction in RBSC cost, developing a viable, high performance product, along with market demand. Recent consolidation of major silicon carbide suppliers provides an opening in the market to support a new, independent RBSC source. The RBSC process uses a greener microwave process, with time, energy and greenhouse gas reductions of 50 to 80%. The commercial demonstration of microwave RBSC product will provide a needed boost to encourage other manufacturers to uptake cleaner, efficient microwave processing. The project also supports Science Technology Engineering Mathematics (STEM) education through high school projects and at least four undergraduate engineering co-op students.",

This battery chemistry utilizes an air-stable, earth-abundant, robust, and non-lithium materials set that is manufacturable by print-based processing and is scalable to large dimensions with sheet or web manufacturing.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a process to produce high quality soy protein concentrate (HQSPC) as a fish meal replacer in aquaculture feeds, while providing a binding agent for extrusion and an immunoprophylactic for disease control. Increased demand for fish protein and reduced wild captured fish has facilitated rapid growth of aquaculture (9% per year). This has dramatically increased demand for fish meal (the primary component in aquaculture feeds), causing overexploitation of this resource and rapidly escalating prices. There is considerable market opportunity for a high quality, economical plant protein concentrate to completely replace fish meal in aquaculture feeds, thus providing broad impact. The proposed innovation is a microbially-based process to economically produce HQSPC by converting soybean carbohydrates into protein, yield an exopolysaccharide for pellet binding, and provide an immunoprophylactic. Phase II objectives include generating sufficient quantities of HQSPC for feeding trials with yellow perch to assess technical and economic feasibility. The HQSPC is anticipated to have&gt;70% protein to replace fish meal, while providing desirable growth rates and conversion efficiencies. Bench-scale production costs should be less than current SPC ($0.30/lb), but with an intrinsic value closer to that of soy protein isolate ($1.50/lb). The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to improve the nation?s second largest trade deficit for natural resources, fish protein, by providing a complete fish meal replacement. Soybean meal or soy protein concentrates (SPC) have been used to partially replace fish meal, however the solvent extraction process used to produce SPC is expensive, the separated oligosaccharides do not have a valuable use, and the quality of SPC (65% protein) is insufficient to permit complete replacement of fish meal. Soy protein isolate (90% protein) requires a more costly protein extraction method. The proposed microbial process converts soybean carbohydrates into additional protein, along with sufficient gum to serve as a binding agent, and a probiotic to induce an immunostimulant effect. Preliminary data shows the proposed microbe will metabolize the individual carbohydrates in soybeans, which will enhance scientific and technological understanding of this mechanism. To demonstrate technical and commercial feasibility, extrusion and enzymatic saccharification will be used to solubilize carbohydrates in soybean white flake, followed by incubation with the gum producing microbe, and recovery of solids for use in yellow perch feeding trials. International aquaculture feed manufacturers would be prospective customers for the HQSPC or the conversion process itself.",

This Phase II project builds upon Phase I development of prototype puzzle-based math games as an extension of a K-5 mathematics curriculum developed with prior support from the National Science Foundation and currently in use in K-5 schools. The games leverage puzzle solving, collaborative play, as well as puzzle creation to build mathematical fluency. Teachers and students in classroom as well as casual users tested the Phase I games and provided feedback that will inform the Phase II project. The Phase II project will involve development of more puzzle-based games with collaborative and creative components. It will also include an evaluation of the effectiveness of these games for math learning, as well as their ease of incorporation into classroom instruction. Phase II will also extend existing tools for training and supporting teachers in the use of these games for classroom instruction. The broader/commercial impact of this project is a new form of interactive learning that integrates formal classroom-based instruction with informal game-based learning within a social online environment. This new form of interactive learning keeps pace with how students interact with technology and engages them to develop deeper understanding and fluency in the subject matter at hand through games and puzzles, collaboration and competition, as well as content creation and sharing. While this Phase II SBIR focuses on the application of these methods on mathematics, the research results will be useful as a model for other subject areas as well. As the $8.2 billion textbook market in the US enters the digital age, this project will set a standard for integrating existing curriculum with digital medium that goes beyond rote memorization and drilling to building mental infrastructure and in-depth understanding. In addition, the visual nature of game-based instruction will reduce barriers to use for bilingual students and those with special needs. Finally, the market potential of this project will benefit significantly from the development of new mechanisms to measure student outcomes articulated with online tools for teachers that provide professional development and support.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-II project will create the technological components, operator interfaces, and integration necessary to achieve practical Personal Service Robots. Personal service challenges robots with unstructured, cluttered, and ever-changing environments, and requires execution of complex tasks. Our novel approach allows autonomous algorithms to request human assistance as needed. Across multiple tiers, assistance can range from simply identifying a partially occluded object, to selecting an appropriate grasp configuration, or even to unsticking a wedged object by direct teleoperation; however, sustained operator involvement should only occur infrequently. This approach enables imperfect autonomy to complete full tasks while minimizing manual labor needs as compared to classical teleoperation. Efforts during Phase I established the feasibility of this combined approach while demonstrating the execution of typical household tasks. Developments under Phase II will focus on reducing the human workload. Major innovations will occur from three elements: (a) creating and optimizing distinct operator interfaces for different assistance needs, (b) refining autonomy to reduce the need for assistance, and (c) narrowing applications and support algorithms to relevant and desired service tasks. These developments will allow individual operators to support multiple robots in parallel, with the multiplicative effect amplifying manual labor savings. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project addresses the fact that the U.S., like many industrialized nations, is seeing its demographics shift to an older population. This implies a shrinking workforce as well as rising labor needs to support the older adult community, which will require greater assistance with tasks of daily living as they age. Robotics is often considered a solution to stretch a limited labor supply. The company specifically target personal service robotics to support older adults via either home care providers or assisted living facilities. By reducing operator workload and allowing a single operator to assist multiple robots performing personal service tasks, this R &amp; D effort can increase the productivity of service labor and provide a higher quality of personal service than traditionally possible. This robotic approach can also more easily distribute the labor across physical distances. This will allow older adults to age in familiar housing, retain greater independence, and reduce their expenses at home or in assisted living facilities.",

        "abstract": "The use of a Prosthetic Replacement of the Ocular Surface Environment (PROSE) device is a revolutionary treatment for military patients that have lost their eyelids due to 3rd degree facial burns as well as for civilians who suffer from a host of corneal diseases. However, custom manual fitting is often a protracted painful, inexact process that requires multiple fitting sessions.  Training for new practitioners is a long process. Automated methods to measure the complete corneal and scleral topology would provide a valuable tool for both clinicians and PROSE device manufacturers and would help streamline the fitting process.   After successfully completing the Phase I program feasibility study, Physical Sciences, Inc. proposes to further develop the OCT-based anterior eye segment profiler. A clinical prototype of the profiler will be designed and built based on the approach demonstrated in the Phase I program. The optical head containing the scanning hardware and optics will be designed such that it can be mounted both on a slit lamp and on a mobile arm attachable to a bed for imaging supine patients. Further refinements in Phase II will allow for clinical testing of the device on human subjects.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Space-based space situational awareness (SSA) for the surveillance and reconnaissance of deep space (DS) resident space objects (RSOs) requires advanced compression algorithms. Due to downlink availability and bandwidth limitations, gross loss compression is performed prior to transmitting mission data on the downlink towards the ground station. The on-board image processing methods currently used in space are unsuitable for SSA applications due to lossy compressions and high computational requirements. In order to meet the Air Force&quot;s requirements for high performance electro-optic image transmission from space to ground, Broadata Communications, Inc. (BCI) proposes a Bandwidth-Adaptive Lossless Inter-Channel Compression (BALIC) System, based on our extensive experience in data processing, compression, and bandwidth-/processor-efficient transmissions. The proposed BALIC efficiently integrates our three novel innovationshighly sensitive detection of stars and streaks, efficient lossless image compression focusing on the regions of interest in the data, and bandwidth efficient TCP/IP. These innovations achieve superior compression performance, improve detection, tracking and estimation of remote targets, and provide processor- and bandwidth-efficient image delivery over space-to-ground dynamic communication links. Our approach can be used to tune both the compression ratio and transport operation adaptively based on intelligent network measurements. BALIC can work perfectly independent of the underlying network conditions.  BENEFIT:  Anticipated Benefits: The key benefits of the BALIC system include:   High data-compression: BALIC achieves compression of the order of 106 (estimates based on analysis of data supplied by the government) by eliminating the redundancy in the image data and including only the regions of interest.    Significantly enhanced accuracy and robustness for autonomous space activity detection. BALIC can achieve low false alarm rates with 1% or lower. It significantly outperforms current approaches with 10~50% of miss alarms over the benchmark test videos.    Real-time performance and fast initial system/software configuration. BALIC significantly reduces the system processing time from seconds/frame in existing approaches to&lt;0.05 sec/frame, achieving about 20 folds of performance gain over other state-of-the-art solutions.      Commercial Applications: The commercial potential of the BALIC technology is tremendous. The image analysis technology developed in BALIC can be used in a wide variety of surveillance applications such as e.g., airports, borders and commercial, and residential buildings, and at any other place where security is important. The proposed BALIC technique can also operate 24/7 with little human intervention and provide automated notifications of significant events to local security personnel. Critical infrastructure, including such items as optic fiber backbone networks, bridges, railways, and cross-country electricity transmission pylons and cabling, can also greatly benefit from BALIC technology. The Motion detection algorithms developed in BALIC. These algorithms can be generalized as image change detection algorithms for wider commercial applications. Detecting regions of change in images of the same scene taken at different times is of widespread interest due to a large number of applications in diverse disciplines. Important applications of change detection include video surveillance, remote sensing, medical diagnosis and treatment, civil infrastructure, underwater sensing and driver assistance systems.",

        "abstract": "The web has experienced a huge increase in the amount of content published daily, forcing users to cope with information overload. This challenge,however, is not limited to just web content. More recently, an explosion in social content and social connections on the web have lead to a new challenge: social overload.   The DoD is also faced with similar information and social overload challenges: an intelligence analyst must wade through huge amounts of possible documents, both from classified sources and from the web. Similarly, from a&#039;&#039;social&#039;perspective, there many be a number of different analysts working on similar or related tasks. If these analysts could collaborate effectively, each of their individual assessments could be more accurate and timely. However, it is very difficult to discover such shared context and to form the associated groups.   In the proposed effort, we will develop and deploy a general tool, Flashgroup, for addressing such information and social overload challenges. In particular, our system will be able to quickly model a user&#039;s intention or context, recommend documents that are most appropriate for their current goals, and suggest groups of users, or flashgroups, who share a common interest to enable engaging and rewarding collaborations.",

        "abstract": "The trend of replacing hydraulic and pneumatic drive systems with power electronics and electrical drives has led to significant increases in the on-board power requirements in military aircraft. Although electrical systems are typically highly efficient, still a significant portion of the electrical energy is eventually converted into heat, thus leading to considerable thermal management challenges. Moreover, the efforts to outfit aircraft with directed energy weapons (DEW) heighten the thermal challenges. Since these weapons are highly inefficient, a considerable portion of the energy required to operate them is converted into waste heat, and this heat must be efficiently transferred to a suitable heat sink in order to be able to deploy these systems and other power electronics on aircraft. We propose using a new heat exchanger configuration that should result in more compact and lighter weight components by generating higher heat transfer coefficients at lower pumping power than other heat exchanger geometries. In Phase I an aircraft condenser based on this technology was estimated to be 69% smaller and 61% lighter than a state-of-the-art conventional condenser, and the PAO-side pressure drop was reduced by 66%. We will be working with Honeywell Aerospace and the University of Maryland during Phase II.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Surface-to-air missiles (SAM) represent a serious threat to both military and civilian aviation.  However, development of more effective countermeasures requires realistic simulation of the missile plume to improve recognition capability.  Accordingly, the purpose of this program is to design and build a next generation pyrophoric fluid valve (PFV) for the Towed Airborne Plume Simulator (TAPS) to improve its reliability and performance in plume simulation.  This initiative will insert Active Signal Technologies high frequency actuation and valve technology into the TAPS to provide the required dynamic range and frequency capability to modulate the pyrophoric fluid flow.  A development effort lasting approximately 24 months is envisaged to mature the technology and transition it to Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC).  A working prototype capable of delivering the necessary flow rates over the frequency band will be built and tested in the AEDC wind tunnel prior to construction and delivery of the final working device.  Deployment of the new valve aboard the TAPS will enable the Air Force to conduct airborne tests of its Advanced Infrared Countermeasures (IRCM).  This will enhance range capabilities at the Center for Countermeasures (CCM) at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) with the goal of improving Aircraft Survivability.

A microprocessor was also designed and built for recording and processing the strain wave signals. Combining the innovative wave recovering mechanism and the microprocessor with a battery and a protection gear, an instrumented projectile was completed. In order to validate the accuracy of the instrumented projectile, a special facility was also designed and constructed. Experimental studies successfully demonstrated the capability and accuracy of the instrumented projectile in recording impact-induced force histories. In the Phase II study, it is required to refine the instrumented projectile for more advanced applications. For example, instrumented projectiles with smaller diameter and higher impact velocity are necessary to simulate the harsh environments encountered by the small arm projectiles used in military&quot;s operations. In order to meet these requirements, additional considerations, such as wireless transmission and non-stand-alone designs will also be explored.",

Current Infrared resistor array projectors are silicon based with a maximum temperature simulation capability of around 750K, causing it to  fall short of the capability to simulate high temperature thermal objects, e.g., the missile plumes and countermeasure with a blackbody apparent temperature (BAT) as high as 3,000K. The current SBIR program with Kent Optronics has demonstrated adequate performance of the infrared scene projection (IRSP) display for both MWIR and LWIR. However, the LCoS display panels in the IRSP experienced shortfalls due to the manufacture pre-maturity. This SBIR Phase II proposal seeks to overcome that shortfall and deliver the 2-color MW/LW IRSP to the government.  BENEFIT:  The Multi-spectrum will be integrated into the KHILS facilities in Eglin AFB for simulation in hardware-in-the-loop.  Both MDA and the U.S. Air Force are the primary customers.  The benefit is obvious: it saves millions of dollars cost by reducing the real flight tests.  In addition to KHILS, Aviation and Missile Command, Army unit such as USAAMCOM, ATEC, DTC, ATTC, as well as NASA, and NATO members are also potential customers.

Currently, land-based operations are depicted accurately from takeoff to landing with incredible fidelity. But, an as-yet untried extension to this concept, important due to the maritime nature of U.S. Navy operations, is to provide the same fidelity for operations in which landing occurs aboard a moving platform. Doing so requires the integration of the ships position and movement with those of the aircraft. Therefore there is a need to correct, compensate and display merged moving vehicle (ship and aircraft) positions at a fidelity level that support post-landing debriefing, while enabling and allowing automated and user defined corrections to data. This effort will result in implementation of data compensation algorithms, aircraft carrier specific configurations resulting in compensated data with increased fidelity necessary for post flight debrief of embarked operations.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant   Development of radiological nuclear medical countermeasures to treat Acute Radiation Syndrome  ARS  is a high priority research area for NIAID  Bone marrow is one of the most sensitive tissues to radiation damage and impaired hematopoiesis is one of the first clinical signs of excessive radiation exposure  often resulting i death  Granulocyte colony stimulating factor  G  CSF  is a    kDa protein that stimulates bone marrow cells to divide and differentiate into neutrophils  Recombinant human G CSF is widely used to treat chemotherapy related neutropenia in cancer patients  and recent studies indicate that it improves overall survival in animal models of ARS  although the drug requires daily administration  which may not be possible following a radiological nuclear disaster  G CSF has a short half life in humans  which necessitates daily dosing for two weeks or more  and may not optimize therapeutic benefits of the protein for patients  Long acting G CSF analogs that do not require frequent dosing could provide significant treatment advantages in a nuclear emergency setting  where healthcare provider time will be at a premium and daily dosing of patients may not be possible  We developed a rationally designed  long acting G CSF analog through site specific chemical modification of the protein with polyethylene glycol  PEG   Our long acting PEG G CSF analog has a    fold half life than unmodified G CSF and is significantly more effective than G CSF at accelerating neutrophil recovery in chemotherapy treated rats  Studies performed during the Phase I SBIR grant demonstrated the utility of this novel  long acting G CSF analog for improving survival in a well characterized mouse ARS model  In contrast to G CSF  our long acting G CSF analog required only a single administration to be effective  Notably              mice  of lethally irradiated mice treated   h post irradiation with a single administration of this long acting G CSF analog survived    days compared to a mortality rate of             mice  for vehicle treated mice  Our long acting G CSF analog also improved survival compared to placebo following multiple injections into irradiated mice  Irradiated mice treated with our long acting G CSF analog showed accelerated recovery of neutrophils  red blood cells and platelets compared to vehicle treated mice  indicating that the protein positively affected recovery of multiple blood cell types  The Phase II grant has three major goals  First  we will perform additional studies in irradiated mice to determine how long after irradiation the drug can be administered and still improve survival  Second  we will determine whether the protein improves survival of lethally irradiated non human primates  which is the gold standard ARS model adopted by the FDA  Third  we will measure the safety profile and pharmacokinetic properties of the protein in IND enabling  GLP animal pharmacology and toxicology studies in order to identify safe doses of the drug for testing in humans  Our novel G  CSF analog will provide physicians with an effective and convenient therapy for the treatment of all of the major hematopoietic complications of ARS  and improve survival of subjects exposed to high radiation doses as a result of a radiological nuclear disaster  The fact that the drug requires only a single\nadministration for effectiveness represents a significance advance in the treatment of ARS and will optimize healthcare provider time in a radiological nuclear emergency setting  where patient numbers are expected to overwhelm available healthcare resources  The drug should prove useful for treating other diseases for which G CSF is used as a therapy  such as neutropenia resulting from chemotherapy use in cancer patients PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Development of radiological nuclear medical countermeasures to treat Acute Radiation Syndrome  ARS  is a high priority research area for NIAID  The Phase I SBIR studies showed that our long  acting G CSF analog significantly improved survival of lethally irradiated mice compared to a placebo  Unlike G CSF  which is administered daily for       days following radiation exposure  our long acting G CSF analog was effective when administered only once  Improved survival of irradiated mice treated with our long acting G CSF analog correlated with accelerated recovery of multiple blood cell types  including neutrophils  red blood cells and platelets  which is a novel finding  The primary goals of this Phase II SBIR grant are     to demonstrate the feasibility of using this novel  long acting\nG CSF analog to improve survival in a non human primate ARS model      determine how long after radiation exposure the drug can be administered and still provide a survival benefit  and    \ncomplete IND enabling animal toxicology studies required by the FDA to begin testing the protein in human safety studies and pivotal animal ARS studies  Our long  acting G CSF analog will prove useful for improving survival of humans exposed to an otherwise lethal dose of radiation as a result of a radiological nuclear disaster  The long half life of the drug will allow\npatients to be treated only once with the drug  which will optimize healthcare provider time in a radiological nuclear emergency setting  The drug should prove useful for treating other diseases for which G CSF is used as a therapy  such as neutropenia resulting from chemotherapy use in cancer patients",

A purely semiconductor-based night vision device with higher performance, longer lifetime and lower cost is desirable.    Built upon proven semiconductor nano-technologies, the proposed Photon Counting Integrated Circuit (PCIC) provides photon detection, image enhancement and in-line visual display with zero offset. The PCIC in-line detection-enhancement-display sandwich can cover 350nm  1800nm wavelength, and has high pixel count and wide field of view to match those of the human eyes. The same PCIC delivers photon-counting night vision sensitivity and performs day-and-night imaging with glare control.    In Phase I, we have fabricated and characterized the PCIC detector, optimize detector pixel sensitivity for night vision, and demonstrated glare control for day and night all light level operation. In Phase II, we will develop and prototype a complete PCIC in-line night vision sandwich to full specifications. The PCIC will be delivered to DoD laboratories for evaluation and demonstration. During Phase III, we will manufacture and market the PCIC night vision device to major defense contractors for incorporation into military systems and for our commercial medical device products.    BENEFIT:  Besides night vision either under covert illumination or under the more abundant natural night glow for military surveillance and target recognition, the proposed PCIC technology also finds commercial applications in laser detection and warning, laser eye protection, security, scientific instruments, biomedical imaging, ecosystem monitoring and protection, and manufacturing quality control.",

The Raman device will be designed and produced by MKS Technology and will be cell-phone sized for portability.  The device will: operate from 2-AA batteries; have a touch screen user-interface; will have Bluetooth connectivity, and will be ruggedized to MIL-STD-810G.  The reader will have a raster scan system to permit high laser power excitation with the (NPMs) nanoplasmonic materials.  The NPMs will be produced by iFyber and will have oxime coatings to react with the CW agent and enhance the sensitivity through resonance enhancement in addition to the plasmonic enhancement.  The NPMs will be composed of a porous substrate with grafted nanoparticles that produce&gt;107 enhancements.  The porosity will permit forced air sampling to increase sensitivity.  We will also begin work with Kodak to scale up the NPM production.  The device and substrates will be evaluated and optimized at Northwestern University.  Northwestern will use its advanced LSPR (localized-surface-plasmon-resonance) spectrometer to measure the efficacy of the iFyber materials and they will use their Raman systems to measure accurate enhancement factors.  Northwestern will examine alternate materials as a risk reduction from the iFyber sole source.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  To meet the goals for future generation Air Force LOX/Hydrocarbon booster engines, improvements must be made in performance, operability, reusability, reliability, and cost. To date, operational LOX/hydrocarbon engines have used the fuel as the thrust chamber assembly (TCA) regenerative coolant, and have used fuel film cooling (FFC) as the TCA hot gas wall thermal barrier. The present hydrocarbon fuels show increasing coking behavior at high chamber pressures (Pc) and heat loads and have forced the development of highly refined propellants e.g. RP-2. An alternate path to the fuel cooling road-block is proposed by incorporating LOX regenerative cooling and oxidizer film cooling (OFC). This combination provides greater robustness and safety, and completely de-couples fuel characteristics from the thermally stresses components. Additionally, this cooling method enables the use of military/aviation grade kerosene.  BENEFIT:  The development of this technology will enable the full-scale development of a high Pc LOX/HC engine to meet the requirements of future military and commercial spacelift systems. The technology is applicable to Air Force Reusable Booster System program and can be adopted to commercial or government RLV and expendable launch vehicles.",

The Phase 2 program will make the first large scale hybrid gears that can be run in a rotating gear rig with imposed torque loading. Several full scale gears will be made as well as full scale test elements. Test results from full scale testing will be applied to computer simulation models. This effort will apply topology optimization techniques to predict the best design of the gear elements. This should enable significantly more efficient designs than those fabricated and tested in the Phase 1 program.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Liquid rocket engine (LRE) turbopumps operate in complex flow regimes that range from cavitating liquid flows in pumps to shock-containing compressible flows in turbine components. The unsteady flow phenomena seen by structural components establish design limitations associated with mean loadings and cyclic fatigue. The current LRE design process simplifies the modeling of these phenomena due to the lack of fully-coupled fluid/structural interaction (FSI) analysis tools, potentially leading to excessive conservatism in the design. The current analysis methods used in turbomachinery tend to oversimplify the complex interactions between fluids and structures in that they are mostly&quot;one-way&quot;couplings. The proposed innovation is to move the state-of-the-art analysis of liquid rocket engine turbomachinery past the current one-way coupling schemes towards a fully-coupled FSI simulation for the product design cycle. This goal will be achieved through the development of methods that allow the close coupling of commercially available nonlinear computational structural dynamics and computational fluid dynamics tools, with focus on LRE turbopump inducer flows. The specific technical objective of the two-year Phase II effort will be to perform a set of software development, engineering, and validation/verification tasks that answers key questions related to computational simulation of hydrodynamic damping in an LRE inducer.  BENEFIT:  Next-generation launch programs will require propulsion systems that deliver high thrust-to-weight ratios, increased trajectory-averages specific impulse, reliable overall vehicle systems performance, low recurring costs, and improved crew safety. The development of a comprehensive set of validated FSI methods and tools provides a unique opportunity to optimize design, realize additional system efficiencies, reduce weight and/or cost, and increase part life in future generations of liquid rocket engine (LRE) designs. The benefits of the technology and potential commercial applications are not limited solely to the LRE industry.  The methods developed in this SBIR can also be used to help optimize the design of military and commercial gas turbine engines and any rotating machinery that experiences significant fluid/structure interactions.",

        "abstract": "State-of-the-art oil pumps in aircraft engines deliver a volumetric flow rate proportional to the rotor speed of the high-pressure engine core, which drive the pump via the engine gearbox. In emerging aircraft platforms, the fuel and oil systems are used to cool a variety of engine and airframe systems. The undesirable oil heating accumulates and reduces the fuels heat-sink reserve at critical flight conditions. Maximum flow rates are set to meet requirements at maximum engine power settings. At power settings less than maximum, the oil flow exceeds system requirements and as a result, parasitic losses generate additional heat due to the fact that the system circulates more oil than necessary. As a result, weight is being added to the aircraft because the thermal management system is being sized at the low power flight conditions to handle the parasitic losses.   The purpose of this program is to demonstrate an engine gearbox driven, high horsepower main engine variable delivery oil system pump can be produced that will reduce system thermal output by an estimated 20% and be comparable in weight/size and reliability to current state-of-the-art pumps.   The new technology being introduced mounts between the engine gearbox and pump and varies the pump speed independent of gearbox speed so that Flow On Demand can be achieved. It does not increase the overall system weight and can be used in any fuel/oil fixed displacement pump application.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to commercialize a unique scanning probe capable of mapping thermal properties with nanoscale resolution. A large number of physical science, engineering, and biological materials and phenomena require thermal conductivity and temperature measurements with high spatial resolution and sensitivity. Yet such measurements are challenging, with conventional thermal probe technology limited to a lateral resolution of only about 100 nanometers. This phase II project will overcome the major challenges of scanning thermal microscopy. The intellectual merits of the proposed activity are related to new and innovative designs and processes to realize thermal sensing elements integrated into a scanning probe design. This design maximizes heat flow from a sample to the probe while minimizing background heat transfer to areas away from the sensor. These devices will be nanofabricated using both unique and scalable semiconductor processing techniques to minimize the cost of manufacturing and ensure repeatability and reproducibility. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the availability of a high resolution thermal measurement tool which will enable scientists and engineers to investigate new materials and develop next-generation products. In the semiconductor industry, the tool will aid in process monitoring, material characterization, and failure analysis. The data storage industry will find applications ranging from mapping thermal effects on recording head &quot;fly heights&quot; to the characterization of recording technologies incorporating integrated laser pulsing to the investigation of superparamagnetic effects which limit areal densities. These are both multi-billion dollar industries that have broad impacts on society. Moreover, applications of this new technology will be geared towards soft-structure thermal mapping, which is not possible with current technologies because of large probe size. These measurements will also be ideally suited for medical research. For example, thermal microscopy of heated gold nanospheres localized in tumors and magnetic nanoparticle tracking inside cellular structures under radio frequency magnetic fields are areas where the impact of this technology will be very high. Such research has the potential to improve therapeutic interventions targeting a number of diseases.",

        "abstract": "To enable detection, tracking, and temperature determination of both very faint, distant targets and very bright targets upon approach, Nu-Trek is proposing to develop a digital ROIC (DROIC) with a game changing Mixed Mode Counter architecture. This architecture offers very high resolution (18-20 bits) and dynamic range (124 dB). In comparison to analog unit cells, the DROIC integration capacitor is about1/10 the size, which scales well to small (8-15 &amp; #61549;m) unit cells. In comparison to digital unit cells, the noisy digital electronics are outside the unit, resulting in very low ROIC noise (148 electrons). This architecture is also compatible with an emerging class of 2-speed cameras which are effective in the detection of fast moving objects, such as missiles. During Phase II Nu-Trek will design, fabricate, and test the DROIC. In Phase III the DROIC will be demonstrated with HgCdTe and SLS LWIR/LWIR detectors. The development effort targets the SM-3 Block IIB. To facilitate insertion, the DROIC will be compatible with baseline SM-3 IIB detectors. The Nu-Trek team also includes IR camera suppliers, which upon a successful technology demonstration will implement DROICs offering the Mixed Mode Counter architecture in multiple product lines.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  With the growing demands for Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) operations, it becomes increasingly important to determine how to best train RPA crewmembers. However, little is known regarding the effectiveness tradeoffs of training environments. Current tools and processes for evaluating effectiveness lack the flexibility and automation required for providing quick, clear, and useful guidance to support evolving missions and training environments. Thus, Realistic Assessment of Performance in Devices (RAPID) is a data-driven, model-based decision support tool that comprehensively analyzes the effectiveness of existing and future training solutions and provides training stakeholders with clear and quick recommendations on how to effectively train RPA Pilots and Sensor Operators. More specifically, the tool provides guidance on the training environments and/or devices best suited to achieve specified training requirements and how current devices can be modified to better address training requirements. The core decision model underlying the RAPID Tool analyzes the effectiveness tradeoffs based on relationships between training requirements and devices/environments. Once integrated with a performance measurement system, the decision model can be automatically and continually refined with multimodal data to support current and future tradeoff analyses, provide blended learning solutions, and quickly assess how well training devices and environments will achieve desired learning outcomes.  BENEFIT:  The results of our Phase II activities will be the RAPID Tool, an automated and adaptable tool that facilitates rapid, data driven analyses of the effectiveness of training environments and devices in relation to RPA training requirements. Specifically, the RAPID Tool will facilitate and house the automatic processing of multimodal data to continually refine and validate its underlying model of the relationships of relevant training environment characteristics and devices to training requirements. In support of instructors and training developers, the RAPID Tool will provide recommended training strategies for achieving desired outcomes effectively and efficiently, leveraging a variety of training environments, tools, and devices as applicable. To acquisition professionals, the RAPID Tool will provide a data driven analysis of the training effectiveness tradeoffs of current and future devices, including consideration of non-traditional fidelity variables that are important in RPA training environments. While we continue to develop a tool customized to meet the needs and challenges of Air Force RPA operations, our approach is designed to be generalizable and applicable to other Department of Defense agencies and commercial organizations that share some common challenges with the Air Force: (1) high demand for achieving training objectives in environments besides live missions (e.g. high consequences for errors); (2) uncertainty regarding which training devices, environments, and methods effectively train which training objectives; and (3) limited resources to achieve operational training objectives.",

Phase II will focus on demonstrating the EBM process to produce and evaluate LRE components.  In addition to the work performed on titanium alloy components, effort to develop a nickel-base alloy for use in LRE will be performed.  The final Phase II activity will be focused on scaling up the process to produce larger LRE components.  BENEFIT:  The benefits of employing EBM fabrication for LRE components are (1) the parts can be made faster because the process is tool-less; (2) for quantities typically used in LRE manufacture, the parts are less expensive; (3) the mechanical behavior of EBM fabricated titanium meets or exceeds that fabricated by traditional manufacturing methods; (4) Since the process is tool-less, as design concepts are tested and performance validated, it is possible to immediately implement design changes. This flexibility allows for greatly reducing the development time. Development of EBM technology for DOD LRE is directly applicable to LRE used to launch commercial payloads.",

High CR enables successful execution of tasks and missions and supports good decision-making under the complex and dynamic conditions common to military operations. In these environments, where the consequences of poor performance can be catastrophic, CR assessment could enable leaders to ensure that individuals and teams are ready to maintain safety and attain mission success. CR assessment could also improve training effectiveness and performance in real-world tasks by focusing limited pre-deployment training time on critical knowledge and skills for tasks they are not cognitively ready to execute. In Phase I, Aptima worked with the US Marine Corps Training and Simulation Division to identify CR assessment as a potentially powerful method for improving Small Unit Decision Making training for dismounted soldiers, who are the most vulnerable warfighters. Aptima developed a proof-of-concept Tool for Rapid Assessment of CR in Teams (TRACR-T), which will provide timely assessments of CR using relevant measurement tools and measures. Scientific objectives of this work include: (1) identifying reliable and valid measures for CR assessment; (2) evaluating the effectiveness of TRACR-T in assessing CR; and (3) identifying CR assessment benefits within dynamic training environments.",

        "abstract": "Robots have the potential to be a potent force multiplier in both combat and non-combat situations. They can go into dangerous and hostile environments; perform searches in spaces that are inaccessible to humans; and exhibit strength exceeding the strongest human. This extreme potential has yet to be realized, however, because of the effort required for human operators to control robots. A large part of the difficulty lies in the human-robot interface. Most current robots are controlled via teleoperations. This not only ties up the operators&#039;attention, it also ties up their hands. What is needed is a natural, hands-free human-robot interface that allows the operator to focus on events in the environment rather than on the specifics of a robot control system. Our team proposes a Neurocognitive Patterns (NCP). NCP will provide an innovative brain-computer interface (BCI) for robot navigation that combines recent advances in identifying the neural signals of motor intent with technology that exploits environmental and contextual information to provide likely interpretations for those neural signals. This will result in a new generation of robot control systems that will require dramatically less attention from the operator, freeing the operator to attend to other mission-important tasks.",

        "abstract": "A miniature (5 pounds, 10 watts) LWIR multi-spectral/hyperspectral imaging system will be developed for applications in remote detection and identification of chemical and biological warfare agents, toxic industrial chemicals (TICs), homemade explosives (HMEs) and disturbed soil indicating a buried IED.  This small size and power will allow a handheld instrument that can be carried by a dismount or flown on small UAVs.  The uniqueness and innovation of this development effort is not only the small size and low power but the addition of simultaneously imaging in 16 different spectral bands each frame of the camera.  Simultaneous multi-spectral and rapid collection of hyperspectral image data can be achieved by taking advantage of the state-of-the-art in micro-optic electro machined systems (MOEMS) technology.  Utilizing MOEMS technology circular blazed grating lenslet placed inside the dewar and close to the focal plan array are now possible and give the simultaneous multispectral imaging. An additional advantage to this approach is the inherit cooling of the optics which will minimizes the self-radiation of the lenses and maximize sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "The use of stress physical scale models allows the Navy to design ship magnetic field signature reduction systems into Navy vessels. Current methods for fabricating the stress physical scale models (SPSM) are expensive and are not timely enough to allow introduction of the signature reduction system into the ship build early in the cycle. Texas Research Institute Austin (TRI/Austin) is investigating and developing a SPSM fabrication process that will allow rapid turnaround between ship drawings and completed SPSM. The method under development is less expensive than legacy SPSM fabrication processes and appears to have greater capability to more precisely model the ship physically. TRI/Austin will investigate the limitations of the proposed SPSM fabrication system and propose the methods to overcome these limitations. The limitations of the proposed method include lack of a full understanding of the effects of the operational parameters of the fabrication process on the resulting model mechanical and magnetic properties. Other non-material issues that pertain to SPSM fabrication when using the proposed process include scale and shape issues. The objective of the proposed effort is to move a new SPSM fabrication process from the development phase to the full implementation in producing high fidelity Navy SPSM.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Modern military space systems use high specific impulse (Isp) propulsion systems to provide efficient station keeping and large delta-V orbital maneuvers. A multi-mode propulsion system utilizes a single propellant such as AF-M315E to provide high thrust as well as a 1000-4000 s Isp. By utilizing the same propellant in multiple thrusters an entire new range of mission operations are possible. The same spacecraft design and propulsion subsystem can be used over a wide range of mission operations from orbital plane changes to station keeping. Perhaps most importantly is the ability to provide on command dynamic mission changes for avoidance, for rendezvous, or precision observation all without a preordained mission set. The proposed development program will demonstrate and characterize the EMPT-MM, a 1.6 - 5 kW FRC thruster capable of efficient operation of Hydrazine, Xenon, and AF-M315E. In Phase I a direct liquid injection and pre-ionization system was demonstrated. In Phase II, this injector will be combined with a 1 kW thruster that will be demonstrated at MSNW and AFRL facilities running in steady operation on full AF-M315E propellant. At the conclusion of Phase II, a high-efficiency, wide specific impulse range multi-mode thruster will be developed, demonstrated, and delivered to AFRL.  BENEFIT:  Modern lightweight solar panel technology, such as the DARPA FAST program, has created a unique need for lightweight, efficient, and highly variable power Electric Propulsion.T the ability to use complex propellants such as Air, AF-M315E, or Hydrazine would allow a dramatic shift in the capabilities of DOD spacecraft. An EP system operating at high specific impulse on monopropellants could be retasked indefinitely between station keeping and rapid orbital maneuvers using a single propellant. Additionally, the ability to use ambient atmospheric gases would enable highly-eccentric orbits that use ambient Air for orbit raising and drag reduction for very low orbits. The Multi-Mode FRC thruster has definite payoffs for long-term military missions. This technology has direct applicability to missions involving Space Situational Awareness, orbit raising tugs, Dynamic and operationally responsive space, as well as all high delta-V missions such as plane changes. A Multi-Mode electric propulsion system capable of operation with any complex, liquid propellant has applications for DOD high-power EP, DOD rapid response propulsion, and NASA science missions.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  To address the Air Force need for an advanced power skiver tool capable of reliably skiving gap-fill material to precise heights with repeatable accuracy, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to advance the development of the innovative Pneumatic Height-Adjustable Skiving Tool (PHAST). By integrating a unique blade system, innovative feed rate control, and a novel gear topology, the PHAST reliably trims loaded gap fill material to a user-defined height over varying surface contours, ensuring a smooth, consistent finish in a single pass. In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of the PHAST to manufacturing readiness level (MRL)-4 by building a completely functional prototype tool capable of skiving gap-fill materials to precise heights in a single pass on representative samples with complex contours. In Phase II, POC will continue development of the PHAST to improve skiving precision, durability, safety, and manufacturability, as well as begin tailoring the tool to immediate customer needs, culminating in an MRL-7 prototype, capable of reliably skiving in a production-representative environment, developed with specific application relevancy and a clear, detailed path toward transition to production.  BENEFIT:  Meeting the technical and operational requirements set forth by the U.S. Air Force for an advanced power skiving tool will allow POC to develop the PHAST for all types of assembly operations in both the military and commercial sides of the aerospace industry, where outer mold line control is critical, including assembly and rework of stealth aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In addition to gap-fill trimming, the PHAST may be utilized in fastener flushness applications in which fastener holes must be filled and consequently trimmed to meet low observability requirements. The PHAST can also be used to trim shim buttons and cured liquid shim down to the required heights in a single pass for proper skin alignment to reduce the cycle time and cost associated with meeting step and gap requirements. All of these capabilities apply not only to the military and defense side of manufacturing but to other commercial transportation areas as well, such as automotive and boating, where the use of composites and fill materials is increasing and trimming materials to exact specifications is necessary to meet aerodynamic and fluid dynamic requirements.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:   Busek has successfully demonstrated key technical features of an autonomous, long-term storable, radiation tolerant propulsion module with no moving parts that is suitable for deorbiting small spacecraft.  Critical properties of a new, high melting point, ionic liquid propellant were measured, confirming it as an excellent candidate for use in electrospray thrusters.  The electrospray propellant selected was then operated in a 100\u00b5N-class electrospray thruster developed by Busek.  Schematics were generated for an analog-based thruster fire control system and critical features, such as orbital and thruster fire timers, and pointing sensors, were validated.    As part of the Phase II effort, Busek shall continue development of the deorbit module advanced under the Phase I.  Additional thruster configurations will be tested for best performance, and a prototype thruster deliverable shall be fabricated, loaded, and delivered for additional testing.  Remaining electronics for initiating and executing the deorbit maneuver will be fabricated and tested.   The various subsystems shall be integrated to perform a single degree-of-freedom demonstration that includes: two 100\u00b5N-class electrospray thrusters, sun tracker, and breadboard control electronics.  After the single axis validation test, mechanical designs shall be produced for the final deorbit module concept.    BENEFIT:   International consensus is forming around the need for orbital debris management, which poses risks to functioning space assets.  It is likely that in the near future, international agreements will require provisions in spacecraft design to reposition satellites to disposal orbits, or to completely deorbit them.  In recognition of this, legal frameworks developed by the United Nations and DoD Instruction 3100.12 (Space Support) require satellites in low earth orbit to de-orbit in fewer than 25 years.  The propulsion system proposed here provides key features necessary to endure extended on-station storage and subsequent thruster firing for spacecraft deorbiting at the end of life.    In addition to use as a deorbiting propulsion system, the electrospray thruster advanced here is applicable to primary and ACS propulsion on small satellites, and CubeSats in particular.  The system has no moving parts, or pressurized propellant, and poses little risk to primary payloads when launched as a secondary payload.  The propellant is stored as a solid during launch and is not a leakage risk.  Furthermore, the lack of mechanisms enables significant miniaturization, enabling a high-deltaV propulsion system that resides within a fraction of a 1U CubeSat module.",

The use of precursor oxides instead of commercial spinel powder reduced the powder and processing costs by about 64% in comparison to using commercial spinel powder. The in-situ oxide conversion spinel technology was demonstrated by making spinel windows up to a size of 4&quot;x4&quot;x0.55&quot;. During Phase II, the size of the windows will be scaled up to 800 square inches.  MER will produce ready to install low cost transparent spinel solution for an array of military construction equipment and transport vehicles at a cost much less than 3x the equivalent cost of glass solution. To achieve the lower cost, special oxide powder precursors will be used. In addition, reduction in cost will be achieved by using a special refractive index matching coating which will eliminate the need for polishing of the final window components. The transparent solution will be fully characterized including ballistic performance, optical and mechanical properties.",

Also, since the satellite network system is distributed across ground-based and space-based entities, the management policy that the PBNM tool generates and uploads on the different components should not introduce any unintended behavior or faults into the satellite system. In this Phase 2 SBIR effort, the combined Scalable Network Technologies and Applied Communication Sciences team proposes to build a Simulation-Assisted Policy Based Network Management Tool for Satellite Networks termed as P-3. The P-3 tool will combine cutting-edge network management and performance optimization techniques for satellite networks with high fidelity&quot;faster than real-time&quot;satellite network models of interest to ensure that the satellite network will be managed by treating the system as a&quot;whole&quot;and network management policies be comprehensively validated using the high fidelity network simulation models before being applied to the live system.  BENEFIT:  The simulated assisted policy based network management concept that will be researched has direct application towards enhancing existing network management of complex satellite and ground based wireless networks for better accuracy and assurance and will thus make the network management process more fault tolerant, efficient and effective. In the military space, the P-3 PBNM solution being developed has direct application in the WIN-T and JTRS MUOS program, where it can be used  to automate the network planning, configuration and online re-configuration of the satellite networks.",

Improving individual aircraft loads/strain predictions is an important focus of this objective. TDA has developed the software tool rotorwiseTM, a method to combine analytical modeling and experimental data to improve the accuracy of predictions for individual blade loads and stresses in dynamic components.  Direct loads-based usage tracking for fatigue-critical rotorcraft dynamic components provides insight into the actual load history of the component in question, offers the potential to extend component service life, and allow for part remediation through the acceptance of greater repair limits. It can also prevent unnecessary maintenance actions, such as early component retirement, enhancing mission readiness and reducing maintenance costs. This presents the possibility for significant maintenance cost savings, as well as enhanced awareness of component structural health.  rotorwiseTM takes as input a combination of instrumentation, on-board data processing requirements, offline data collection, numerical rotor loads analysis, and fatigue life prediction algorithms. rotorwiseTM supports the USN&#039;s end goals for the CH-53K: tracking rotorcraft life in near real-time, gathering complete component loads/usage history, and thereby accurately predicting the life of each system. This eliminates penalties imposed due to unknown usage histories and/or inaccurate/overly-conservative loads prediction.",

The challenges of pumping in this regime are well known:  Two-phase, liquid-vapor refrigerant mixtures are a mixture of saturated liquid and saturated vapor, by definition meaning that there is zero net positive suction head. Many pump types are highly susceptible to cavitation under these conditions, leading to rough operation, poor performance, and erosion and ultimate destruction of pump elements, especially centrifugal pump impellers.  The common fluorocarbon refrigerants and heat transfer fluids are generally low in liquid viscosity and offer no boundary lubrication type lubricity, making mechanical design of a pump to handle these fluids challenging with respect to both mechanical friction losses and the wear life of rotating shafts, bearings, and pump elements.

The new anodes will allow batteries to reach capacities 30 to 40% higher than conventional lithium-ion batteries for more than 1000 cycles. The broader impacts/commercial potential of this project is that higher capacity lithium-ion batteries will be quickly realized in portable electronics and electric vehicles. Lithium-ion batteries have revolutionized portable communications and electric vehicle power sources, yet their materials of construction have remained essentially unchanged since the mid 1980?s. If successful, the commercialization of surface-engineered silicon nanoparticles in lithium-ion anodes would result in 30 to 40% capacity gains along with an approximately 20% drop in cost per watt. Cell phones, tablets, and laptop users could use portable devices for longer periods between charging intervals. Electric vehicles with lithium- ion batteries could increase driving ranges by 40% and improve their cost competitiveness with gasoline-powered vehicles. Electrochemical Materials has strong relationships with major specialty chemical manufacturers, battery materials providers and battery manufacturers and intends to use NSF research and development funds to commercialize their innovative capacity-enhancing anode material.",

        "abstract": "The innovation in this Phase II Project will develop tools for creating, displaying, and publishing interactive 3D content. The resulting technology will empower educators, students, publishers, and businesses to easily produce interactive 3D illustrations for digital books and online education materials. A unique approach to this long-standing content creation problem centers around the use of Image-Based Modeling and Rendering (IBMR), which enables the creation of highly realistic digital 3D models using commodity smartphones instead of the complex dedicated hardware systems traditionally required. Building on technology developed during the associated Phase I Project, this research aims to: develop new algorithms for creating interactive illustrations that place fewer assumptions on the hardware used to create them, develop algorithms for extracting 3D geometry from image sequences, and develop new methods for capturing unique panoramic image sets that can be used in an educational context. The resulting technology platform will make interactive 3D content widely-accessible by significantly reducing the expertise and cost currently required during its creation. The broader/commercial impact of this project is to make user-generated 3D content part of the revolution in digital and online education by simplify the creation process and making it widely accessible to a non-technical audience. The core technology developed in this proposal has application areas spanning from education and cultural heritage to consumer marketing and advertising. This project also includes specific outreach activities that will benefit the local community while bringing the resulting technology to the attention of the wide audience that can benefit from user-generated 3D content.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project investigates a new series of low-cost non- precious metal catalysts for selective catalytic reduction (SCO) of NH3 to N2. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO with urea is widely applied for abating NOx emissions in diesel engine vehicles. A common problem of using the SCR technology is ammonia slip. Under conditions of incomplete NO conversion or exhaust temperature upswings, NH3 will be released from the exhaust, resulting in a number of environmental problems. This SCO technology can convert the toxic ammonia to nitrogen and water on NexTech\u00a1\u00afs proposed catalysts at low temperatures. The proposed non-precious metal catalysts have proven to be highly active and tolerant to SO2 and H2O in Phase I. 100% NH3 conversion and above 90% N2 selectivity were achieved at \u00a1\u00dd 225 \u00a1\u00e3C. The catalysts exhibited comparable NH3 conversion but higher N2 selectivity (i.e., less NO and N2O formation) as compared to a conventional Pt-based catalyst. In Phase II, catalyst formulation will further be refined to improve SCO performance, and long term stability testing will be conducted. After that, the focus will be shifted to catalyst scale-up, washcoating on monoliths and evaluation under real diesel engine exhaust conditions. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to solve the NH3 slip problem existing in the SCR system, allowing its application in the diesel engine exhaust treatment. This SCO technology can also help reduce NOX emissions by greater than 90% when stoichiometric or excess amount of urea is used in the SCR process, providing an excellent approach for reaching aggressive NOX abatement goals. As compared to conventional Platinum containing catalysts, the substitution of the proposed non-precious metalcatalysts could drastically reduce the cost of diesel engine after-treatment system. The generated information can provide new insights in understanding activation process of small molecules, such as NH3, NO, NO2 and O2, on the oxide surface with acid and redox sites, enabling development of bettercatalysts for further emission reduction in the future.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the unmet needs for effective analysis of protein phosphorylation, a process where a phosphate group is added to a protein to change its function. Protein phosphorylation is a crucial modification of proteins; its abnormalities have been implicated in many diseases. Therefore, assessing the phosphorylation status of individual proteins or classes of proteins, qualitatively or quantitatively, has become a routine but extremely important step in the majority of life science research labs. Existing technologies have glaring deficiencies, including low reproducibility, poor recovery, high cost, reduced selectivity and prolonged experiment time. The platform technology to be developed during this Phase II project will greatly alleviate these shortcomings by providing lucrative, general approaches for phosphorylation analyses. The technologies will enable general phosphorylation detection, cost-effective cancer inhibitor screenings, and kinase/phosphatase activity quantitation for new drug discovery. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of platform technology to improve a set of biochemical assays, thus enabling the discovery of new therapeutic targets and drugs. Protein phosphorylation and kinase inhibitors as drug targets are currently at the peak of research and development (R &amp; D), responsible for over 30% of the total drug discovery expenses. These R &amp; D activities could greatly benefit from the proposed technologies due to their innovative design and versatile features for optimum efficiency, and the ability to reproducibly explore phosphorylation events in unprecedented depth. These should provide invaluable tools and address needs of many bioscience research labs/facilities in academic and industrial settings.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the analysis needs for monitoring perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) in water. PFOA and PFOS are ubiquitous environmental contaminants that have been found at low concentrations in waste water, drinking water, human blood, and in food. Because PFOA, PFOS and other perfluorochemicals are bio-accumulative, extremely persistent, and toxic, several states have established analytical methods and emission limits. Furthermore, there is a large effort surrounding remediation of PFOA and PFOS contaminated areas. Considering the impacts on both the environment and public health, there is a market need for rapid, selective, low cost, and field portable PFOA and PFOS sensing. This research aims at the development of a field deployable ion-selective electrode that permits selective and fast measurement of PFOA and PFOS with a low detection limit at low cost. The broader impact of this research is to improve public health by rapid identification and screening of polluted areas. Moreover, the research will enable an economical PFOS/PFOA detection method for environmental monitoring, continued research, compliance and remediation efforts. Currently, research efforts are hampered by costly and time consuming liquid extractions coupled with liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. This research aims to produce a device that will significantly lower the barriers to testing. Additional broader impacts include expanded application of the sensor to measure the contaminant in blood, soil and food. Most importantly, these efforts are important and instructive to direct and monitor remediation and enable in-field research. We view this effort as an integral part of a wider effort to understand and reduce sources and pathways by which the persistent substance has become widespread in the environment.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Among the technical challenges associated with current Air Force scramjet technology development is coupling between the combustor and isolator that leads to isolator unstart. Performance is currently restricted because the engine is not actively controlled. While simple passive techniques such as cavities for shock capture exist, they result in increased drag. We propose a closed-loop control scheme that seeks to actively isolate the inlet from the combustor to prevent unstart while monitoring and minimizing the drag in the inlet using flow control. The shock trapping scheme is based on a cavity in the isolator section and the flow control system consists of arc filament plasma actuators coupled with skin friction sensors. When there is potential for unstart, the actuators will make the cavity a high drag cavity, which would act as a shock trapping device. In normal operation, the actuators will be adjusted to minimize the drag of the cavity. The skin friction sensors that are based on an existing Surface Stress Sensitive Film sensor hardened to operate in high enthalpy flows. The flow control scheme is based on a class of high amplitude and high bandwidth plasma actuators called localized arc filament plasma actuators  BENEFIT:  Surface Stress Sensitive Films are being investigation for a variety of applications in aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, and biomedical research. Skin friction is a quantity of interest in many aerodynamics applications such as validation of CFD, and investigation of hypersonic inlets. A point version of this sensor could be used for both ground test and flight test measurements of skin friction. Other applications include a sensor for feedback in closed loop flow control. The S3F sensor has recently been used to detect shear forces on tires and a means of using the system for predictive maintenance of fleet vehicles is underway. The sensor also has use in biomedical applications include ongoing research for identification and correlation of shear on the foot of diabetics. The formation of bed sores is believed to be related to shear stress, and therefore this would be a similar application of the technology. Other biomedical applications include shear stress on surfaces of artificial implants such as stints, hearts, valves, and assist pumps",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In today&quot;s limited government budget environment, the push is towards smaller spacecraft with more rapid development times (&lt;24 months) than traditional systems, which are averaging 48-60 month development timelines.  Our team has been a proponent of small satellites and the&quot;faster, better, cheaper&quot;philosophy.  Customers can field systems with high utility, lower cost, more radiation tolerance, and high reliability in a very rapid timeframe to meet their mission needs.  This trend should be embraced for a generation as the fielding of smaller systems with high utility sustains our country&quot;s diminishing spacecraft workforce, fields a variety of key operational systems to meet a growing national defense threat, and lowers system cost through increased procurement of unique spacecraft components.   The scope of this Phase II SBIR is to develop a low-cost, size, weight, and power (SWAP) strategically radiation hardened (RH) miniature star tracker (MST) with autonomous lost-in-space recovery and high-angular-rate tracking capability.  The RH MST will be developed to survive and perform its mission in natural and man-made weapon environments encountered in low earth orbits (LEO), highly elliptical orbits (HEO), and geostationary orbits (GEO).  Man-made nuclear weapon environments should be assumed to be added to the environments associated with natural space.      BENEFIT:  The first anticipated benefit of the RH MST is to provide precise, stable, and reliable attitude control for space launch vehicles and satellite systems.  The benefit of the RH MST is for continued, high performance of the MST following accumulation of 300 krad (Si) of dose (proton and ionizing) and following a high dose rate from a man-made event.  Our primary emphasis for the first planned product will be to focus on and respond to this requirement.  As described above we will work in conjunction with established Air Force, other Government agency, and aerospace/prime system developer contacts to identify specific launch vehicles, payloads, missions, and programs where the RH MST can be applied at the system level.     The global space market is expected to reach $196B over the next ten (1) years.  Although access to certain elements of this market may be constrained due to ITAR, the remaining portion would still be substantial and affords significant opportunity for application of the RH MST, especially in the Government sector.  Further, while our first priority is the development of a product meeting AFRL&quot;s stated requirements for a strategically radiation hardened star tracker, we believe our design can be modified to pare costs.  This would serve to preserve MST&quot;s cost competitiveness in other markets (e.g., LEO, commercial satellite applications, etc.) where strategic hardness is not a requirement.    While the DoD/Government space market is attractive, we believe there are other Government and civil market opportunities for this MST technology.  For example, there is great interest within the Government and throughout the DoD (especially within the Air Force) for technologies which enhance the capability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).  Driven by the war on terrorism and ongoing combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, solutions are being sought that increase the endurance, range, and effectiveness of these and similar systems.  We believe it is possible that elements of the technology being developed for the RH MST may be applied in these arenas.  Additionally, applications abound in Homeland Security with the need for persistent surveillance at all critical infrastructure elements and in transportation security.  Further, the civil target market for this technology is broad and commercially lucrative as well.  For example, opportunities exist in border and maritime management and patrol, search and rescue, traffic monitoring, and commercial satellite augmentation.  Other potential applications include:   - Environmental science   - Border surveillance   - Wildland surveillance (fires, etc.)   - Coastal and maritime surveillance   - Monitoring severe weather systems   - Emergency services, search-and-rescue, and disaster relief   - Other domestic emergencies   We believe it is possible to extend the application space for the MST by adding enhanced pattern recognition capability and modifying its digital logic and optics to serve a broader range of both Government and commercial applications.",

The final solution will be a full end-to-end modeling tool that provides high-fidelity and optimal run times, with seamless interfaces between the physics techniques, controlled through an integrated, user-friendly graphical user interface.  BENEFIT:  The outcome of this SBIR will be a modeling suite that seamlessly integrates high-fidelity electromagnetic simulation in the near-field of antennas and in the vicinity of human anatomical models, with high-fidelity propagation calculations over rough terrain or within urban settings.  Antenna designers, engineers, and health physicists could use this tool to assess health and safety risks in a variety of environments by determining the potential for radiation exposure to personnel.  Its hybrid capabilities will allow it to be used to perform detailed assessments of fields or specific absorption rate (SAR) for near-field analysis or far-field analysis, well beyond the range where high-fidelity calculations would be feasible with current modeling solutions.   GPU and other acceleration techniques will ensure reasonably optimal run times for calculations that would otherwise take significant time to complete.  The combined set of capabilities also has potential for use in other fields, providing the capability to perform high fidelity electromagnetic analysis near any type of complex object.",

This SBIR Phase II proposal is focused on developing an innovative, compact and no maintenance Waste to Energy (WTE) system generating fuel cell electrical power from biogas. The most critical piece for fuel cell application is the purification of biogas. Biogas contains substantial amounts of impurities such as H2S, siloxanes and halogenated organics, which are harmful for fuel cell applications. The Phase I project demonstrated a novel, compact and low maintenance biogas purifier which removes these three impurities in a single step for downstream fuel cell application. The target of the Phase II program is to develop a compact, easily operable and no maintenance complete biogas to fuel cell electricity system. The specific goal of the Phase II project is to demonstrate a compact 2 kW fuel cell power system operating on biogas and demonstrate its stability of operation to potentially achieve 2000 hours of unattended operation.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Optical Physics Company (OPC) combined two pioneering sets of optical phased array technologies during the first phase of this project. These are OPC&quot;s Holographic Beam Control (HBC) and Nutronics&quot;Conformal Laser Weapon System (CLAWS). HBC addresses target illumination, aimpoint selection, aimpoint maintenance, stair-mode correction and kill assessment; whereas, CLAWS addresses local and target path phasing control.  Their synergistic use performs target path wavefront control and local phase control:  With CLAWS running a high bandwidth inner loop, HBC provides a mid-bandwidth outer loop to measure CLAWS biases, compensate stair mode errors and steer the beam to the desired aimpoint on the target.    During the second phase, the OPC-Nutronics team will demonstrate the closed loop real time execution of HBC+CLAWS control algorithms in the laboratory using a low power laser and a processor suitable for a real-time field test.  At the end of Phase II, with laboratory demonstration of real time operation, the technical maturity of HBC+CLAWS will advance to TRL 4 or better.    BENEFIT:  The HBC+CLAWS combination forms a viable path to practical HEL phased array systems in the air and on the ground. The target application is a conformal HEL system in a jet fighter.  Conformal HEL designs (enabled by the proposed beam control method) promise extremely lightweight, high performance and cost-effective options which can enhance utility and speed deployment.      The conformal design and advanced features of the proposed beam control system also make it suitable for imaging.  The HEL system can be a reconnaissance as well as a target engagement tool.  One can foresee deployment on remotely piloted armed unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) where the imaging function provides broad area surveillance, and the HEL function negates identified targets.  Another application is space-based HEL defense which becomes practical when large apertures can be deployed on panels providing both high resolution imaging, aimpoint selection and high quality hit spots to defend against space-borne threats.     The beam control methods developed during this project are also applicable to ground based space object imaging as well as commercial aircraft and ship defense.    OPC has already demonstrated success with transitioning technologies developed with SBIR funding to ongoing research and acquisition programs.  In particular, OPC is building deformable mirrors to meet the needs of several government and prime contractor customers.",

The benefit of developing such an uncertainty management tool is to make accurate remaining useful life forecasts of aircraft systems based on actual usage. It is anticipated that the demonstration will be performed on a legacy airframe component. The first year of the project will be focused on developing the necessary computational codes &amp; models to set up the demonstration problem and laying out the basic multi-disciplinary analysis framework to predict fatigue durability. The second year of the project will focus on developing Bayesian analysis techniques which will update usage and damage states (based on real and simulated inspection data) to provide revised estimates on durability.  BENEFIT:  In the current age of large multi-disciplinary virtual simulation, developing a multi-disciplinary, multi-fidelity uncertainty management tool is useful in determining how to minimize overall uncertainty in analytical predictions. In addition the methodology can be used to optimize for the best use of computational resources to arrive at most robust predictions. The benefit of this methodology lies in creating understanding of how parameter changes at each discipline level affects overall system reliability and uncertainty.",

Fast and reliable means to limit fault currents and isolate faulted sections are required to meet these emerging power needs.  We propose to develop an extremely fast, Silicon Carbide (SiC) based Solid State Circuit Breaker (SSCB) which is capable of high voltage, current, and power.  This will allow large loads to be isolated quickly, enabling the move to greater electrical power system capacity.  By also allowing greater operating temperature, our SSCB can be installed in harsh environments, such as the engine compartment, with minimal demand on vehicle thermal management systems.  During Phase I, we developed and demonstrated a 1.2 kV, 200 A SSCB, and testing was completed at voltages up to 120 V, currents up to 100 A, and junction temperatures up to 185 deg C.  We showed that the SSCB can isolate a fault within 2.5 microseconds, which is much faster than the 10 to 20 ms possible with electromechanical relays.  During Phase II, we will continue to mature this technology by scaling the design for 500 A continuous current rating, improving current density, and demonstrating field operation in prototypical ground vehicle power system equipment.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The technology developed under this SBIR program provides for accurate time synchronization across an entire network for purposes of processing data collected at multiple computers from multiple sensors in real-time.  A software solution (in Windows) is desired in order to produce a universal solution, independent from specific hardware components (e.g., NICs) in data capture computers.   The effort in this Phase II program will produce a technology that reduces the latency between the transmission of data from a  NIC at one location to the user application at another location to less than 0.5ms with a jitter of less than 0.2ms.  This will be accomplished by leveraging results from the Phase I work and developing new software approaches to reduce latency further than that achieved in Phase I.  Software will be developed and demonstrated via an intermediate demonstration as well as a larger full system demonstration.  BENEFIT:  The developed technology will provide an effective alternative to current systems that utilize costly, proprietary network components from a single vendor. In addition, external time synchronization approaches, which utilize GPS or IRIG, require additional hardware components that are costly and must be maintained over the life of the system, thereby leading to long term costs.  The proposed software-based solution provides the benefits of greatly reduced cost by allowing the use of COTS Ethernet hardware, rather than proprietary single-vendor solutions, as well as not requiring an external synchronization system.  Utilizing commodity Ethernet equipment helps to reduce cost and provide increased flexibility in hardware selection.  The overall benefit is the provision of the same level of system performance with greatly reduced costs.    Several commercial applications exist.  The first is for multi-sensor data acquisition systems, which are used in university and research labs as well as large scale commercial systems utilizing thousands of sensors such as large oil refineries and the U.S. smart power grid.  Another large potential application of the developed technology is for time-sensitive transactions across networks especially large networks such as the internet.  Examples include banking and online trading.  Furthermore, the software components could play a key role for online gaming. Finally, providing accurate clock synchronization across a network, or across networks, is critical in many popular online applications.  These include hi-frequency trading, online gambling, and online bidding (such as eBay).",

We will develop a resource manager which builds schedules for ground-based radars (e.g., TPY-2 and UEWR) and lower-altitude space-based infrared systems (e.g., PTSS). Mission performance will be quantified in terms of the expected damage caused by threats that could penetrate our defenses  with a good schedule and an effective missile defense system, this damage might be driven to zero. A schedule will define a series of sensor tasks for multiple sensors over a specified time horizon. Each sensor task will describe where the sensor is pointing, what modes are to be employed, and the dwell time. The resource manager, which we will call Sensor Management for Automated Resource Triage (SMART), will work with a fusion system housed in a Command and Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) system. The fusion system will provide track information to the SMART module and the SMART module will use this information to select future sensor tasks which minimize the expected damage caused by leaking threats. The SMART module will create the sensor schedule dynamically during an attack, based on the latest information supplied by the fusion system. We will develop and test the SMART module using a Toyon-developed testbed as well as testbeds specified by the government.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the development of Epoxidized Norbornylized Linseed Oil (ENLO) resin as a matrix for reinforced composites. This ENLO resin is a high bio-content, low hazard system with roughly three times the bio-content of any commercially proven resin. In Phase I feasibility was demonstrated and benefits of the system were explored. Phase II funding will be used to scale and refine the resin manufacture process and to develop and demonstrate performance of Bulk Molding Compound (BMC) and Sheet Molding Compound (SMC) utilizing the ENLO resin matrix. The research objectives are to scale the resin process to 1000-gallon reactor size, to identify a cost effective initiation system, to formulate compounds for improved fiber wetout, to characterize and benchmark performance relative to competitive molding compounds, to develop compounds and component prototypes for specific applications, and to explore enhancements to the technology that would provide a wider range of potential market segments. The anticipated technical results are the realization of cost competitive molding compounds based on the ENLO resin, the demonstration of performance in targeted initial application components, and the realization of an ENLO resin chemistry and process for the coatings market. The broader impact / commercial potential of this project will derive from the regulatory and green benefits that customers desire to meet strengthened Environment Health and Safety (EHS) demands. The ENLO resin is derived from rapidly renewable raw material streams that can be domestically controlled, liberating the U.S. from the dependence on depleting oil reserves from unstable regions of the world and providing U.S. jobs for our farmers, plant oil processors, and resin manufacturers. Commercial composites resins include unsaturated polyesters, which contain styrene, epoxies made from Bis-phenol A, and urethanes with isocyanate. The ENLO resin contains none of these chemicals of significant EHS concern resulting in safer processes, workplaces, and products. Another major benefit of the technology is that the molded end products will sequester carbon dioxide for the life of the composite, reducing the life cycle contribution to global warming. These benefits will be magnified well beyond the scope of the $18 billion composites market because the same matrix resin can be used in the much larger $99 billion coatings market.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Program Phase II project proposes to develop a simple, single-shot, inexpensive, and complete laser-pulse measurement device for ~100-picosecond to ~10-nanosecond pulses. Long (&gt;10 nanosecond) pulses are easily measured, and recently developed techniques completely measure ultrashort pulses (&lt;10 picosecond). But intermediate-length, ~1-nanosecond, pulses remain only partially, roughly, and expensively measurable, and so generally remain complex and unstable. This is unfortunate because most laser pulses are in this intermediate range. The proposed measurement device is based on frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG), a very successful technique for measuring the complete intensity and phase vs. time of femtosecond pulses. The main challenge in extending FROG to much longer pulses is the generation of a many-nanosecond delay range on a single pulse-currently an unsolved problem in general. The proposed innovation solves it by tilting the input pulse by a remarkable ~89.99\u00b0 without distorting it in time. As a result, one side of a ~1cm-wide beam precedes the other by over a meter. The proposed nanosecond FROG can completely measure even complex pulses and will cost less than one tenth as much as the high-bandwidth oscilloscopes currently used to only partially measure such pulses. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project follows from the fact that most pulsed lasers, from solid-state lasers to fiber lasers, emit pulses about a nanosecond long. They are the least stable lasers in the world, yet they have billions of dollars of applications, frommaterials processing to distance measurements to remote sensing to medical, military, and scientific uses. With the proposed device, nanosecond lasers will finally have a previously unavailable device to monitor their performance and to diagnose problems before expensive materials are ruined or patients are harmed. It will also be essential for combining pulses from multiple fiber lasers, generally regarded as the next important step in the development of compact and convenient high-power pulsed lasers. Finally, using this device, laser engineers in general will be better able to improve the quality of nanosecond laser pulses, thus greatly benefitting all pulsed-laser applications. If the spectacular progress in much-shorter-pulse lasers that occurred after analogous complete pulse-measurement technology was introduced there is any indication, such an inexpensive and simple device for measuring nanosecond pulses should make a huge difference in the generation of cleaner, more stable nanosecond pulses and consequently in the many fields that use such lasers.",

These furnaces are also used in many other industries, including cement, coke, iron &amp; steel, and pulp &amp; paper industries. This 3-D imaging sensor creates an interior image of the furnace wall so that maintenance personnel can identify wall erosion, and any molten material leaking through the wall joints. The objective in Phase II is to develop a prototype sensor system that can form 3-D images of the interface between the furnace wall and molten glass. To achieve this, a high performance sensor hardware and corresponding imaging software will be developed. The entire prototyped system will be tested on high temperature furnace walls using in-house kilns followed by tests at an operational glass furnace. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it will enable maintenance programs based upon real furnace conditions. This will allow longer life span of high temperature furnaces and the ability to make informed local maintenance without a major interruption in production. This translates to significant financial savings for the glass manufacturing industry and improved safety, as several catastrophic accidents have occurred due to molten glass leaking from the furnaces.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a sprayable foam hemostat for treatment of non-compressible hemorrhage, which is the leading cause of death (~90%) for bleeding-related trauma. The foam material is based on the biopolymer chitosan; a modification to this polymer with novel hydrophobic grafts allows the material to clot blood much more rapidly and adhere to tissue more strongly than the unmodified version. Also, a complementary cyclodextrin-based technology is able to reverse the hemostatic action of the modified chitosan on demand. The biopolymer is packaged into aluminum hand-held canisters with liquefied propellant and expelled via mechanical actuator creating a foam which is able to expand into irregularly shaped cavities. The desired outcome of the project is to develop a working prototype of the canister containing an optimized modified chitosan with respect to hydrophobic grafting density and hydrophobe length. Foam formulations will be tested for clotting and reversibility in vitro via dynamic and steady shear rheology studies in the presence of blood and in vivo using non-compressible bleeding models in pigs. Biocompatibility testing and tissue histology studies will be performed to determine the safety profile of the optimized formulations. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project falls in the arena of battlefield and trauma medicine. Foams are the future of acute wound treatment on the battlefield and in emergency medical services. Severe bleeding, especially internal bleeding, is not easily treated with a spatially contained product, such as a bandage. Furthermore, correct bandage placement on an acute wound requires a great deal of skill and experience. However, a sprayable foam is very user friendly and allows potential for adequate self-application or application by an unskilled &#039;buddy&#039; for a wide range of hemorrhage types. Thus, we envision our chitosan foam as a necessary supply in the soldier&#039;s backpack, the emergency room and the home first aid kit. This vision is a viable economic prospect because the material is low cost, lightweight and highly durable even in extreme ambient conditions. Additionally, the reversibility provided by the complementary cyclodextrin system provides a streamlining tool for the trauma surgeon. Removal of hemostatic material and precise indentification of the injury site are necessary tasks in the operating room which are made much easier by this unique technological feature.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will support the final development and commercialization of Symbios Technologies plasma treatment system to allow produced water in the oil and gas industry to be effectively treated, thereby allowing its safe discharge to surface waters or recycling to stimulate production in new wells, rather than being disposed of in injection wells. Produced water is the water brought to the surface, with or without hydraulic fracturing, along with the intended fuel products during extraction of oil, gas, and coal bed methane from formations underground. In general, produced water is contaminated with hydrocarbons, salts, and harmful microorganisms, meaning that it must be treated before it can be discharged or reused for agriculture and other purposes. This is an important environmental, public safety, and economic problem in the US. Research conducted during this project will be used to evaluate reactor improvements including process sensors and control systems, electrode geometries and surface coatings, degradation of contaminants in produced water, field testing, and techno-economic modeling. The anticipated technical results are that the Symbios plasma system will degrade hydrocarbon contaminants and kill microorganisms in frac flowback or produced water, leaving the waters suitable for safe reuse or discharge. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it will facilitate cleanup and reuse of a critical resource, water, in the oil and gas production industry, with crucial societal benefits for protecting the environment, guarding human safety, and keeping domestic energy costs down. The proposed technology is based on an innovative, low-voltage plasma discharge that creates powerful oxidizing species for destroying biological and chemical contaminants in produced water. Symbios Technologies has developed relationships and executed agreements with key companies in the produced water treatment field, which have identified numerous near-term business opportunities and provided crucial insights into preparing the technology for commercial success during Phase II. The customer-centered emphasis on solving water contamination problems in the oil and gas industry, which was estimated to have a global market size of $45 billion in 2010, will result in a high likelihood for commercial success. The Phase II R &amp; D plan will enhance scientific and technical understanding as well as commercial impact by addressing reactor improvements pertaining to corrosion resistance and automated operation for a market-ready system, treatment of microbial and organic contaminants in produced water, on- site testing, and demonstration of economic competitiveness of the developed system.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will use waste methane gas (biogas) as a feedstock to produce pellets of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), a valuable polymer that is converted into a variety of high margin or high volume, eco-friendly plastic products such as childrens toys, electronic casings, water bottles, and food packaging containers. The current plastics market is dominated by petroleum-derived, non-biodegradable, energy-intensive plastics, which often persist in the environment upon disposal. Alternative plastics are derived from rapidly renewable biological resources (biobased) and consumed by microbes when no longer needed (biodegradable). Unfortunately, these alternative plastics are often costly to produce and their manufacturing process requires significant amounts of energy. Mango Materials has a novel, patented, energy-efficient method to produce a biodegradable, biobased polymer at a price competitive with petrochemical-based polymers. Phase II involves scaling the Mango Materials process to produce samples for customers to test while addressing associated challenges. Key goals are to optimize the production process and to verify that customers can process the product on existing manufacturing equipment. Key results include a more optimized process, customer validation of samples, a thorough understanding of polymer characteristics, and an updated cost and yield comparison. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will ultimately be the widespread production of low-cost bioplastics from waste biogas and the eventual displacement of petroleum-based plastics. Bioplastics have the potential to capture an increasing fraction of the plastics market, thereby giving consumers the choice to purchase affordable, environmentally friendly, bioplastic-based products. When products made from Mango Materials bioplastic are disposed in modern wastewater treatment plants or landfills, they biodegrade anaerobically (without oxygen) to methane. This methane can be cycled back and re-enter the process as feedstock to produce more PHA. Thus, the life cycle may be closed, creating a cradle to cradle system. This use of biogas will provide a strong economic incentive for facilities to capture their methane, rather than releasing or flaring it, which will reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and reduce corresponding impacts on global warming. The innovation will enhance scientific understanding by studying the production of bioplastic from waste biogas and by characterizing the microbial species responsible for this conversion. This project represents one of the first times that waste biogas will be used commercially as a feedstock for bacteria to produce a valuable product.",

Unlike other through-single-wall imaging technologies, a device does not need to be held against a wall. This project will develop new technologies that make the system useful for police team end-users to quickly deploy and use without extensive training. Specifically, the produce should investigate methods to achieve robust connectivity across larger buildings; develop capabilities for 2.5-dimensional (x,y + floor) imaging and tracking; develop adaptive estimation algorithms that automatically adjust to the environment; develop devices suited for rapid deployment, and develop a real-time commercial prototype including user interface. At the end of the project, the combination of these developments should allow delivery of a prototype to a SWAT team for them to deploy and use on their own in a training exercise. The broader/commercial impact is the commercialization of a technology for police and SWAT (special weapons and tactics) teams to quickly obtain situational intelligence that will save lives. Lives are lost every year because law enforcement officers do not know what is happening inside a building prior to entering. In addition, other life-saving applications will benefit from technologies developed, for example: military urban operations; building security and homeland security systems; finding people alive in collapsed buildings or during fire rescue; and worker safety systems. The firms technology is also useful in systems that allow elderly to live longer in their own home by monitoring their activities to ensure their safety and health.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will result in the continuing development of novel ultrafast, highly selective, high permeability ion-exchange fiber composites (IXFCs) for removing perchlorate from drinking water. The proposed material removes perchlorate 10-100 times faster than the best available technology and employs a low-cost production method compatible with widely available manufacturing equipment. Rapid contaminant removal is made possible by the use of micron-scale mass transfer distances; whereas commonly used beads and granular media are limited to much larger sizes resulting in drawbacks such as difficult containment and enormous pressure drops. However, IXFCs display both high permeability and self-containment due to their permanently intertwined, self-supporting structure. Serionix demonstrated the feasibility of this technology in Phase I and will continue in the Phase II with the following key goals: 1) optimization of ultra-high capacity IXFCs for perchlorate removal; 2) design/build IXFC purification cartridges for evaluation by industrial partners; 3) identify and validate chemistries for complimentary IXFCs that are selective for heavy metals such as lead and mercury; and 4) produce IXFCs at a pilot scale and develop strategy for commercial production.

There is an ongoing need to substitute two separate visors that provide clear and dark transmission with a single lens capable of fast transition, wide light transmission contrast range, fail clear operation and other specific platform requirements.  Our team, which includes current contractors for visors and displays for the military, will fabricate prototype visor devices to demonstrate critical aspects of the fundamental performance capabilities that will eventually lead to use in specific aircraft pilot helmet systems.  BENEFIT:  The variable light transmission technology provides a pilot with the capability to make the visor opaqueable at will, thereby providing optimum contrast for maximum visual performance. This program will demonstrate the technical capability of the technology to meet specific requirements and demonstrate the manufacturability of our process that would lead to cost effective commercial products.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The purpose of this Phase II is to develop a working prototype of the  HADRian tool that can assist SOC (Sensing Operations Center)  Operators, the persons responsible for the display of information within an EOC (Emergency Operations Center) COP (Common Operational  Picture) during a Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/DR) operation in providing information for the COP to support the EOC commander and Incident commander.  The tool will allow the operator to make information accessible to the COP by leveraging metadata annotations describing the repository with respect to an ontology.  The ontology provides a formal representation (OWL) of the conceptual domain. Repositories of information are annotated with respect to this ontology in order to enable the system to (1) Infer which repositories are relevant to a high level query (statement of information need), based on the situation at hand; (2) Formulate queries for each relevant repository that (partially) satisfy the information need expressed in the high level query; (3) Reason about the results returned by the queried relevant repositories in order to filter out irrelevant items: (4) Transform the remaining results so they can be displayed within a common COP.    BENEFIT:  It is desirable (although very difficult) to have the ability to adapt a COP (Common Operational Picture) application to include new information sources and to display the information therein in an effective manner for HA/DR decision makers, including  Emergency Operations Center commanders  and field responders.  This kind of feature is not part of the currently available EOR systems.  Our proposed solution is to capture adequate metadata about available repositories in a format that supports automated reasoning in order to support identifying relevant repositories automatically, filtering and transforming their data, and display the results, thus mitigating the problem.  The necessary metadata annotation must be simpler and more efficient than developing custom software adapters for new metadata repositories.  We anticipate that this technology will be useful in integrating novel information into COPs of many kinds; particularly, those used in Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief or emergency management operations. The benefit of this technology is the improved responsiveness of emergency responders, better and more timely decisions, and in the end, even saving of lives.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The purpose of this proposal is to develop a new photosensitive optical material with working range from 3 to 5 um, which enables recording of high efficiency volume holograms with tolerance to high power laser radiation, and to demonstrate the use of those holograms for beam control of mid IR lasers. Three directions will be pursued in the material part of the project. The first one is to develop optical glass transparent up to 5 um that would possess ability for photo-thermo-induced crystallization and, therefore, for refractive index change in the exposed areas. The second approach is to find proper compositions and conditions of irradiation of chalcogenide glasses that would enable direct writing of holograms by laser radiation. Chalcogenide glasses are transparent up to 12 um. This technology is well known for chalcogenide films but it is a challenging approach for recording of bulk holograms. The third direction will be the study of iron doped lithium niobate which is transparent up to 5 um and shows refractive index change resulted from electro-optical phenomenon caused by spatial separation of charges. We will use revealed photoinduced phenomena tor record holographic gratings for spectral beam combining and spectral locking of MIR lasers.  BENEFIT:  One of the hot topics in military photonics development is a robust emitter in 3 to 5 um spectral region for countermeasures against IR self-guided missiles. The most portable and efficient light sources are semiconductor lasers. However, semiconductor lasers operating in mid IR spectral region have not enough power and brightness for efficient countermeasures. A possible solution of this problem is to develop a method for spectral or coherent combining of NIR semiconductor lasers. This combining is routinely produced for near IR region by volume Bragg gratings recorded in a photo-thermo-refractive glass. However, this glass is not transparent in mid IR. The proposed research is directed to development of a phase photosensitive material that would be transparent up to 5 um. This material would enable fabrication of volume Bragg gratings that will be used for spectral and coherent locking of mid IR lasers and for spectral combining of multiple laser sources. Such approach with robust passive elements will provide dramatic increase of brightness of mid IR laser sources and will be used in a great number of military laser systems. Additionally these gratings could be used for narrow band spectral filtering in multiple night vision systems.",

        "abstract": "Phase II.5 proposal, extension of Phase II contract N00014-09-C-0510.  Free-space Laser communications (Lasercomm)  or free-space optical (FSO) communications  is rapidly gaining traction as a next-generation line-of-sight (LOS) wireless technology for both commercial and military applications. Over short time scales (e.g., milliseconds), these high-bandwidth links are plagued by scintillation fading due to atmospheric turbulence and (possibly) boundary layer effects (e.g., at the surface of fast moving aircraft in ship-air links). Although somewhat analogous to the mutlipath-induced fading that is familiar in mobile RF communications, optical scintillation-induced fades typically span thousands to millions of symbols  rather than tens to hundreds  due to the higher symbol rates and longer fade durations. Consequently, solutions for combating fading in RF links do not readily extend to Lasercomm. During Phase I, TrellisWare showed that a modern coded-protocol can offer dramatic throughput improvements over existing state-of-the-art baseband approaches in scintillation-induced fading FSO links. In Phase II.5, TrellisWare proposes to design and implement a hardware prototype FSO modem, to include optics, to demonstrate that our approach can be effectively and efficiently implemented for use on real maritime and expeditionary links. TrellisWare has already received interest from its FSO industry partners in the proposed hardware thus demonstrating a clear path to commercialization during Phase III and beyond.",

        "abstract": "Marine biofouling is a significant problem on ship hulls, increasing fuel consumption and decreasing speed/efficiency. Traditional coatings prevent fouling through controlled release of biocidal compounds (e.g. metals, copper or zinc, or organics, tributyltin). The continuous leaching of these biocides has raised environmental impact concerns. A variety of non-biocidal technologies have been attempted, including foul-release coatings and microtextured coatings. However, these systems have proven unable to address the unique demands on US Navy Ships (i.e. long periods of time in dock and sustained periods of low/minimal speed). Luna Innovations and Zwitter Technology have developed two unique, complementary technologies to meet the Navy&#039;s needs: zwitterion resins and stabilized enzymatic antifoulers. Building on successful demonstration of bifouling resistance during the Phase I work, Luna will work with Zwitter Technology during the Phase II to optimize and integrate these technologies, resulting in a unique Zwitterion-Enzymatic Bioresistant Coating. This coating will retain the naturally bioresistant, non-fouling properties of the zwitterion resin while also deterring bio-organism proliferation using stabilized enzymatic antifoulers. A significant focus of the Phase II effort will be transitioning the coatings from small scale laboratory test samples to test samples suitable for long-term open ocean static immersion testing.",

        "abstract": "Small Navy UAS platforms require affordable GPS anti-jam technology that works with small antenna arrays to meet the operational availability and accuracy requirements in challenged GPS environments. Beam-forming/null steering algorithms have been developed for antenna installations on ships and fixed wing aircraft where navigational accuracy is achieved at the expense of greater complexity and cost in the antenna electronics. Most of the current anti-jam systems use nulling techniques that steer antenna nulls toward the interfering signals by adapting antenna weights. Studies suggest that these techniques introduce error into the GPS solution that may be unacceptable for precision approach and landing. The objective of this Phase II SBIR program is to develop advanced non beam-steering adaptive weighting algorithms that mitigate potential code and carrier phase bias errors introduced by Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (CRPA) nulling algorithms. In Phase I Mayflower modeled algorithms and performed simulations to mitigate code and carrier phase bias errors introduced in the nulling process. In Phase II, our plan is to further develop these algorithms and implement an enhanced AJ solution to demonstrate the ability to mitigate GPS carrier phase and pseudo-range biases. Under Phase III, Mayflower will develop form-fit AJ electronics for transitioning the technology to current and future naval platforms focused on small unmanned aerial systems (UAS).",

        "abstract": "Electrodynamics Associates, Inc. (EAI) has designed an AC+DC generator suitable for aircraft applications. The generator is a variable speed machine with a nominal speed of 8000 rpm. It provides a 28V DC output with a nominal rating of 400A, and a 115/ 200 V, three-phase output with a nominal rating of 5 kVA and a power factor of 0.7 to 1. This is a compact generator with the capability of eliminating the need for external inverters to provide AC power on helicopters. This helps improve the power density, efficiency, and reliability of the electric power system on helicopters. A controller to provide independent voltage regulation for the AC and DC power as well as protective functions is also designed. During Phase II it is planned that EAI will fabricate two sets of the AC +DC generator and controller. The generator geometric profile will be made to suit the existing mounting arrangements on the gearbox pads of specific helicopters. Tests will be performed to meet and demonstrate the electrical performance requirements per the relevant military standards: Mil-G-21480, Mil-PRF-21480, and Mil-G-6162. The performance tests will include load tests to full load and overload, tests to verify parallel operation and load sharing by the DC generators, voltage regulation under steady state and transient states, and fault protection. Two sets of hardware will be delivered to Navair. It is anticipated that follow up programs with Navair support will be requested to transition the generator technology for insertion in specific helicopter programs.",

The measurement-to-track fusion module incorporates a modified Multiple Hypothesis Tracker (MHT) in conjunction with nonlinear filters and association as well as a Bayesian network to model feature information and possible inferences in a way that promotes improved measurement-to-track fusion. Toyon&#039;s Fusion and Correlation for Tracked Object Retention (FACTOR) module handles track-to-track fusion.  The FACTOR system will incorporate advanced fusion algorithms and be adapted to an architecture that is aligned with that envisioned by the MDA. Toyon shall additionally design a scenario with multiple attacks from multiple launch sites in order to test these algorithms. The development shall be in a spiral process that uses testing and analysis to fuel future algorithm development. Furthermore, because of the modular form in which the measurement-to-track and track-to-track fusion algorithms are cast, it is easy to perform studies changing different parameters in the simulation or the algorithms. Toyon will also perform integration with a testbed determined by the MDA.",

        "abstract": "This effort addresses the need for a predictive model which characterizes the motor ejecta from thrust terminated and burn-to-depletion solid rocket motors.  Two models will be developed: an engineering model that provides near term predictive capability and a high fidelity model which will provide guidance to improve the engineering models.  The engineering model, developed under Phase I, will be extended, treating additional sources of debris and enfolding existing signature models for the validation phase of this effort.  Predictions of solid motor performance and radar scene will be made for up to six flight tests for comparison to test data.  Predictions will be made by coupling Sierra&quot;s engineering model with a debris propagation and radar scene generation tool.      Prior to the flight test predictions, Sierra will enhance its engineering model, including fragmentation predictions for charred internal insulation.  A commercial system optimization tool set will be used to automate the analysis tool interactions, reducing the time required to achieve an acceptable solution.    The detailed analysis tool effort will demonstrate a moving mesh capability applicable to the burning grain surface, demonstrate an improved rigid body (i.e. debris) model, and develop tools to import debris characteristics into the model.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In an attempt to address the data overload challenge significant work has been conducted studying the human factors and cognitive science issues related to exploitation of&quot;big data&quot;. Also, significant investment has been made in automated or autonomous processing/exploitation capability. It is clear that no matter how efficiently the human cognitive ability is applied to&quot;manually&quot;interpreting data that we cannot keep pace with the data explosion in this manner. In spite of the allure of automated or autonomous processing/exploitation the&quot;brittleness&quot;of current capabilities limits the benefit achieved because significant human oversight and correction is required    What is required to meet this throughput/brittleness challenge is focus on the human-machine system and, in particular, the development of adaptive human-machine systems that evolve, learning from each other to continually improve system performance and accurately adapting the roles (boundaries of competency) of each agent in order to optimize performance of the total human-computation-sensor system.    The results of our Phase I research highlighted opportunities for cognitive acceleration of knowledge gain across the various points of collection, processing, interpretation and transmission of both human and automated analysis activities.  This work points to potential order-of-magnitude improvements in throughput and quality. The proposed Phase II research will implement and assess these concepts by addressing data exploitation challenges associated with a major new hyperspectral program.    BENEFIT:  The proposed work has the potential to achieve order-of-magnitude increases in throughput and quality of integrated intelligence production systems. This will help the ISR community to deal with a rapidly growing deluge of data from an increasingly diverse and disparate set of sensors and sources, within increasingly stringent time requirements. This work will benefit NASIC, DoD, NGA and other intelligence production organizations and will ultimately address civilian&quot;big-data&quot;applications.",

The results from the Phase I effort demonstrated:  (1) the feasibility of our technical approach to meet all Air Force program objectives; (2) the ability of our approach to support a network-centric SOA for positive inventory control and assessment; (3) the value of our unique mixed-initiative environment for human-systems collaboration; and (4) the ability for our cognitive engineering and human factors skills to identify needs in the operational environment.  Phase II will build an operationally capable prototype of SAUNA based on the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) Mission System (JMS) UDOP and infrastructure.  SAUNA will facilitate data gathering, storage, and analysis in order to maximize the potential of positive inventory control (PIC) and increase the accuracy of daily nuclear weapon-related material tracking.  BENEFIT:  SAUNA will facilitate effective positive inventory control through system-induced reduction of manual comparison and data accessibility.  SAUNA will automate data gathering, storage, and management, including the ability to rapidly ingest and store data from the various current formats used, such as MS SharePoint and Excel.

        "abstract": "Human operators must closely monitor video for simultaneous situational awareness and threat assessment. For instance, urban environments in a state of constant activity generate numerous visual cues, each of which must be examined so that potential security breaches do not go unnoticed. The need for constant vigilance places a significant burden on the human operator, invariably leading to fatigue and lapses in attention span. Vecna proposes a video event detection software tool, known as AESOP, that automatically  detects time critical events in real-time. AESOP learns new events using a programming by example. With this technique, the analyst teaches the software tool new events by demonstrating actions on concrete examples. Once trained, AESOP processes incoming video and proactively identifies user-defined events in real-time while also indexing the video to simplify forensic analysis. Using state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms, the system identifies and tracks all targets in the scene. Characteristic features for each target are extracted over time yielding feature trajectories which are then efficiently matched to the trained event trajectories. An easy-to-use user interface allows the analyst to visualize and confirm detected events quickly. Furthermore, AESOP&#039;s accuracy can improve by incorporating the confirmed detected events into the training set.",

EdgeWare is an Edge Enabled System (EES) framework that will leverage and enhance the situation awareness (SA) of dismounted warfighters. Using EdgeWare, warfighters will develop, extend and combine ISR applications for their current mission. Situation understanding and response time will improve through sensing and reasoning applications that evolve out of the common needs of individual soldiers. In addition to improving access to information for the dismounted soldier, our approach to EES will increase the relevance of incoming information by allowing soldiers to customize how the information is acquired, processed, and interpreted. Finally, commanders will order customized information reports from dismounted warfighters as situations develop. In this way, warfighters will act as human sensors and interpreters of the environment in which they are deployed. A full-featured EdgeWare system will enable warfighters to create information harnessing and reasoning apps, called mission specific apps, during mission planning. These can then be configured for specific and novel situations by the dismounted warfighter using a mobile device while deployed. Phase II EdgeWare demonstrations will include applications for Force Protection and telemedicine.",

Anchoring a large structure such as a floating pier along a shoreline is a labor intensive procedure using traditional anchoring hardware. Training and experience is required for personnel to anticipate a dangerous anchoring situation. Failure of anchoring hardware or failure on the part of the crew to exercise the proper judgment to avoid such a situation usually results in a costly and life threatening incident. This is particularly true in shallow water conditions near shore. In this Phase II effort Triton Systems will prototype and test their design for an innovative anchoring system that significantly reduces scope of anchor line, requires less personnel and time, require less training, and reduces the likelihood of error.",

With a typical simple cycle gas turbine nearly 65% of the energy consumed is typically lost as waste heat. Safely and efficiently recovering electrical power from this source of energy equal to an amount of power to provide a 20% reduction in fuel consumption is the program goal. Also important is the avoidance of systems that are expensive, maintenance intensive or systems that employ working fluids that could be dangerous if they were to be released inside the closed confines of a ship. To meet these program requirements, Candent Technologies is developing a waste heat recovery system utilizing an air (Brayton) bottoming cycle with the requisite heat exchangers and turbomachinery.

        "abstract": "Advanced underwater vehicles (unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), torpedoes, etc.) are key to achieving long-term objectives for undersea force projection and surveillance. Existing battery-based power systems for these vehicles do not meet mission requirements due to low energy density, prohibitive cost, and/or time-consuming maintenance. Power systems based on liquid fuels and oxidizers (collectively reactants) can provide very high energy density for air-independent power systems. However, managing the liquid reactants presents significant challenges. Simple tanks are inadequate in many cases due to a wide variety of constraints and issues. Creare proposes a reactant delivery system (RDS) that utilizes a novel bladder system that can safely store a range of reactants for extended periods of time. The bladder system has a high fuel volume fraction; is safe, reusable, easy to fill and refill; and has very low residual fuel volume when emptied. Compatibility with a wide range of reactant and power conversion system topologies is also possible.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  AutoDrills at Lockheed Martin drill over 12,000 holes in the wing skins and understructure on each F-35 aircraft. To ensure these holes get the correct fasteners, a technician must measure the depth of each hole and mark the dimension on the skin adjacent to the hole. This procedure is known as&quot;gripping&quot;. According to Lockheed Martin Manufacturing Technology (ManTech), gripping takes an average of 70 seconds per hole. This amounts to over 230 hours per aircraft. Systems and Materials Research Corporation (SMRC) proposes GripChek, an automated, zero time added, hole depth measurement solution. Technicians tend to use fasteners that are known to be too long. This adds unnecessary weight, and the practice is fundamentally incompatible with the JSF program&#039;s ESH mission. Likewise, fasteners that are installed too short must be removed and replaced with the correct fastener. GripChek uses the drilling operation itself to determine and record the depth of the hole in real time - exactly the right length fastener every time. GripChek will benefit the aircraft industry by reducing weight, cost, and waste with zero time added.  BENEFIT:  SMRC&#039;s GripChek solution is simpler, faster, and easier to integrate to an automated drilling system in comparison to any other real-time hole-depth measurement system under development. The baseline technology has been proven by Sandia National Laboratory, and has been addressed as a preferred solution for both Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. SMRC&#039;s GripChek system does not rely on added components attached to the drill head, but instead relies on data generated by the AutoDrill controller and minimal sensor hardware attached to the drive harness. GripChek will be cost effective and provide high return on investment. It will eliminate manual hole-depth measurement process saving thousands of labor-hours per aircraft. The maintenance of GripChek will be less frequent and require minimum interruption to the drilling process. SMRC estimates savings of $305Million for the entire Aerospace industry over 27-year time period of GripChek operation.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  At the Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems (NGAS) El Segundo composites manufacturing facility, large pallets containing as many as a dozen skin tools with skin panels that need to be machined are loaded into a large enclosed environmentally controlled precision milling machine (PMM). Unfortunately, to maintain tight tolerances, the skin panels must remain in the PMM enclosure post-machining, locked down on the tools while a time-consuming touch probe process is used to meet F-35 tolerance requirements. Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to continue the development of the Rapid Advanced Non-contact Measurement System (RANMS), demonstrated in Phase I of this program, which consists of a new 3D profilometer mounted in the spindle of the PMM, two laser tracker and intelligent target pairs following the motion of the PMM head, and a pair of 3D accelerometers to capture the last axis of motion of the PMM. All of these devices will be controlled with a computer system installed in the PMM control room that will be connected to the PMM control system and will&quot;listen&quot;to the PMM tape and&quot;watch&quot;the motion of the PMM to provide a true second source inspection system.  BENEFIT:  The new RANMS 3D profilometer is a direct replacement for current touch probes and has the potential to revolutionize the industrial metrology market. Touch probe metrology is inherently slow because to capture the measurement of any machined feature, the probe needs to touch the part in several places in different areas on the feature. The RANMS 3D profilometer returns a measurement of the entire machined feature in less than a second, and, if laser trackers are used to track the motion of the precision milling or drilling machine, a true second source measurement system is created that is fully qualified and extremely fast. The RANMS metrology system can initially be used ubiquitously in the aerospace manufacturing industry, where tight tolerances on large parts need to be maintained. Further commercial development and implementation of RANMS is possible in the automotive manufacturing industry and in the infrastructure manufacturing industry (e.g., steam turbines, power generators, wind power machines, gas turbines, hydroelectric turbine generators).",

Enhanced pilot operational performance and health may be accomplished through improvements in crew station, seating, procedure enhancements, and training. In this effort CFDRC will develop and integrate scalable human body and spine biomechanics models with pain neurobiology and subjective response mathematical models to simulate the occupant response to the inertial and positional stressors.

These actuation devices can be integrated into the structure of munitions to further reduce the usable volume that they occupy. The design of these novel control surface actuation devices allows them to be readily protected against very high firing acceleration loads, vibration, impact loading, repeated loading and acceleration and deceleration cycles that can be experienced during transportation and munitions loading operations. In addition, their mode of generating actuation forces and torques allows them to achieve peak actuation forces and torques in less than 2-3 msec, thereby providing very high level of dynamic response. Projectiles equipped with the proposed control surface actuation devices should be capable of achieving significantly enhanced precision for both stationary and moving targets, thereby achieving significantly enhanced probability of hit.",

An automated system for GW and CG will improve aircraft structural life estimation and performance characteristics, will relieve pilots burden of logging data, and will also improve situational awareness.

        "abstract": "Modern turbine engines are making increasing use of the blisk or integrally bladed rotor (IBR). One benefit of using blisks is the reduced weight required to achieve the rotors function. Because a blisk is a single, continuous piece of material there is no decoupling of vibrational energy between the blades and the disk at the center of the rotor. As a result, vibrations can be transferred from one blade through the disk to other blades, setting up vibratory modes of the entire rotor.   During the course of operation the blades of a blisk are altered by erosion, fatigue, and FOD. In the case of more significant blade damage the blade may need to be blended to restore its strength. These changes can result in rotor mistuning, allowing for more damaging vibratory modes to be supported in the rotor, leading to high cycle fatigue and ultimately rotor failure.   Prime, along with our team partners, will continue to refine the FOCIS based technology to detect and characterize the vibrations of the rotor blades. This will be done by expanding the FOCIS probes native ability to perform time of arrival measurements. In the proposed configuration, a multi-beam variant of the FOCIS probe will be developed allowing for simultaneous monitoring of a blades motion at multiple locations.",

Current HUMS provide diagnostic and prognostic information to maintenance crews through Condition Based Maintenance (CBM), which allows parts to be replaced on an as-needed basis. This marks an improvement over legacy approaches, which relied on conservative life estimates that resulted in early component retirement due to a lack of accurate component usage data to determine actual component life. HUMS has shown its value over time, yet it is still a passive system that provides no active fatigue damage alleviation.  This SBIR effort is focused on the development of a HUMS interface which will automatically reduce the damage on aircraft components in real-time by modifying the control system output, allowing component life to be extended beyond that which has been realized with HUMS alone. In addition, through control system output modification, damage rates on specific components may be tailored to extend the life up to the next scheduled maintenance activity. The development of a system to track the amount of damage occurring on this component allows for optimization of the flight control system output to reduce structural component damage while maintaining the required maneuverability, flying quality, and handling qualities.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Stellar Science has developed innovative techniques for satellite conjunction processing using spatiotemporally indexed ephemeris data.  Our algorithms first insert each satellite into a spatially aware data structure, such as a K-D Tree or a Spatial Hash Table, and then it scans the data structure looking for satellite conjunctions.  While traditional approaches to satellite conjunction analysis have polynomial runtimes (O(n^2)), this spatial indexing approach are capable of achieving linearithmic (On*log(n)) or even linear (O(n)) runtimes, depending on which data structure is used and how efficiently it is tuned.  In phase I, Stellar Science has demonstrated the feasibility of these concepts and created prototype filtering plug-ins for the CAOS-D Conjunction Analysis architecture. In phase II, we will build upon and expand this initial proof of concept through several comprehensive test and refine algorithm development cycles.  The algorithms will be validated using current space object catalogs and also future proofed using catalogs containing up to 100,000 space objects.  We will also develop an analyst tool that will help characterize the performance characteristics of various filtering algorithms and chains of filtering algorithms.  BENEFIT:  Timely and accurate conjunction filtering is a critical need of the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC). The collision warnings produced by the JSpOC are of critical importance in protecting U.S. and allied spacecraft against destructive collisions, and in protecting the lives of astronauts during space flight. By reducing the number of objects requiring high-fidelity and computationally-intensive conjunction analysis, Stellar Science will enable the JSpOC to continue to perform its mission in the future as the number of tracked space objects and debris particles grows to exceed 100,000. In addition to benefitting JSpOC, this technology can be used to aid the Naval Space Command (NSC), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the European Space Agency (ESA), and commercial satellite owners and operators in protecting their valuable and irreplaceable space assets from space debris. Future commercialization applications also include air traffic control, a domain that also requires predicting and avoiding collisions among multiple fast-moving objects.",

Based on our expertise in high-temperature materials and packaging processes, we propose to develop a conformal packaging and&quot;stick on&quot;installation strategy for high temperature conformal sensors. The Phase I effort primarily included: working with turbine engine OEMS to define applications, the development of key fabrication processes, and proof of principle demonstrations. Simple proof of principle packaging prototypes, demonstrating all key process steps, were installed on non-planar surfaces and key aspects of the performance up to 600 &amp; #176;C were demonstrated. The ultimate goal of this proposed Phase II effort is to develop a genetic/standardized high-temperature conformal packaging and installation technology for use in extreme aerospace environments: including temperatures ranging from -60 &amp; #176;C up to 1000 &amp; #176;C, and high-g accelerations. Ultimately, such packaging should be easily installed with no permanent changes to the engine components or surfaces, and sufficiently small and conformal to avoid disrupting aerodynamic flows. The packaging should be widely adaptable for many conformal sensor technologies with future development effort.",

        "abstract": "Advanced space suits require lightweight, low-power, durable sensors for monitoring critical life support materials. No current compact sensors have the tolerance for liquid water that is specifically required for next-generation portable life support systems (PLSS). Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) is developing a luminescence-based optical sensor probe to monitor carbon dioxide, oxygen, and humidity. Our monitor will incorporate robust CO2, O2, and H2O partial pressure sensors interrogated by a compact, low-power optoelectronic unit. The sensors will not only tolerate liquid water but will actually operate while wet, and can be remotely connected to electronic circuitry by an optical fiber cable immune to electromagnetic interference. For space systems, using these miniature sensor elements with remote optoelectronics provides unmatched design flexibility for measurements in highly constrained volume systems such as PLSS. Our flow-through monitor design includes an optical sensor we have already developed for PLSS humidity monitoring, and an optical oxygen sensor with similar IOS technology. In Phase I of this project IOS demonstrated a CO2 sensor capable of operating while wet, and a miniature prototype PPCO2-H2O-O2 sensor probe was fabricated and tested under relevant environmental conditions. In Phase II, in collaboration with Hamilton Sundstrand (Hamilton), we will design and produce prototypes for space qualification, and will conduct extensive testing under simulated space conditions, culminating in validation in NASA systems, bringing the monitor to TRL 6-7. Engineers from IOS and Hamilton will design the new sensor system to be compatible with electronics developed and fabricated for space operation by Hamilton (in particular, the common modular data bus interface unit). This approach will minimize the power requirements and size of the monitoring device, and will tremendously facilitate the infusion of the technology into the PLSS.",

Up to 87% of cooling loads are generated by equipment that is currently cooled with 80\u00b0F air that is produced by a 40\u00b0F chilled water supply. Shipboard chiller efficiency can be increased by introducing an intermediate sink water system at 68\u00b0F to directly cool the equipment loads and adding active refrigeration to fan coil units that condition the air for non-equipment loads. This strategy will result in annual fuel savings of $937,000 per ship.  Mainstream is developing a family of AFCUs with high-efficiency integrated heat pumps to cool and heat with a 68\u00b0F water sink. During Phase I, Mainstream designed, built, and demonstrated an H3-sized AFCU which weighs 35% less than the legacy fan coil and has a cooling capacity over 15,280 Btu/hr.  Mainstream will advance the AFCU architecture by designing and building two production representative sample H3 units in Phase II. These AFCUs will be subject to qualification tests including shock, cooling and heating capacity tests, and EMI testing.

        "abstract": "High-power electric propulsion with Hall thrusters has been proposed as a strong candidate for Electric Path missions, but conventional power processing units (PPUs) are complicated and the mass of the discharge power converters needs to be reduced. Direct Discharge Power Processing Units (DDUs) have been proposed as an alternative due to their simplicity and low mass, but the achievable operating range of thrust and ISP is significantly limited because power regulation for DDUs is only achieved through gas flow control, array offpointing or shunting. This proposal presents a compromise between PPUs and DDUs called a Hybrid Direct Drive Power Processing Unit (HDDU) that provides a wider operating range than DDUs while reducing the mass and increasing the efficiency compared to conventional PPUs. An HDDU provides filtering like a DDU, but it can additionally raise or lower the discharge voltage over a limited range. An HDDU only processes the power necessary to raise or lower the discharge voltage. We propose using a soft switching non-inverting interleaved buck-boost circuit similar to what was built for Phase I, but with improved control circuitry and a modular chassis. Straight-through direct drive operation is possible by leaving the buck switches on continually while having the boost switches off.  The proposed HDDU would operate from an input voltage of 150 V to 300 V, and would provide 15 kW output power from approximately 200 V to 500 V. The HDDU approach is readily scalable to higher power levels by connecting modules in parallel because the proposed circuit naturally shares output currents. The HDDU will also include a digital control interface unit (DCIU), heater, keeper and magnet supply modules and driving circuits for a VACCO gas flow controller.  The DCIU will be controlled through a Windows GUI and a MIL-STD-1553 communication to USB adapter. The modular approach and enhanced operating range promote design re-use and reduce life-cycle costs.",

Project activities focused on achieving a magnetic field that shields the discharge channel from ion induced erosion.  The goal is to achieve a propellant throughput greater than 100 kg/kW.  Numerical modeling is playing a critical role in the thruster design.  In Phase I, we used a fluid based code developed by JPL to model the plasma in an existing thruster that is currently undergoing life testing.  The erosion predictions of the model were found to agree well with actual measurements.  The numerical model was then applied to the magnetically shielded 1-kW thruster and preliminary results were found to be reasonable.  The goal is to demonstrate a thruster design where channel erosion is entirely eliminated as a life limiting mechanism.\n\nIn Phase II, we will build and test the extended lifetime thruster.  The performance, lifetime, and plume properties of the thruster will then be evaluated, and the design will be optimized.  Numerical modeling will be used throughout the process to ensure that magnetic shielding is achieved.  Code predictions will be grounded in plasma measurements taken with a variety of diagnostics including channel wall probes, high speed intrusive channel probes, and plume probes.  The ability of the thruster to achieve its lifetime goals will be assessed through a 500 hour wear test.  When the design is finalized, an engineering development unit (EDU) thruster will be designed, built, validated, and delivered to NASA.  The EDU thruster design will be modeled thermally and structurally to facilitate the transition to Phase III.  At the end of the Phase II, the TRL will be 5/6.",

The baseline concept design will meet performance constraints and appropriate military specifications.

Therefore, there is a need to develop a method to characterize coke layer thickness so that engine lifetimes can be predicted.  In the Phase I project, Reaction Systems identified an approach than can rapidly and accurately map very thin layers of coke deposited in the cooling channels.  We detected coke thicknesses of less than a millionth of an inch in a multichannel plate test article and identified where the coke was located.     The overall objective for Phase II is to advance the technology and transition it to a full scale application.  In Phase II, we will construct a 1/2 scale cooling channel replica, deposit coke, and demonstrate that our method can detect coke deposits one millionth of an inch thick in these cooling channels.  We will also show that our method is effective on coke produced at the very high heat fluxes that occur in rocket engine cooling channels.     BENEFIT:  The technology will be useful for government and commercial applications.  The DoD and AFRL have recently been studying reusable launch vehicles for the eventual replacement of the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) system, currently scheduled to be phased-out in 2030.   Developing a reusable, fast turn-around launch capability vehicle would allow the DoD to amortize the cost of these launch vehicles over a large number of launches.  The ability to reuse a vehicle even ten times could reduce the on-going launch services costs of the government by 90% of current costs.  Since the engines are a major part of the cost of a rocket, increasing the reusability of these components by mapping coke deposition could substantially improve the number of missions each engine can provide.    There is also a great deal of commercial interest in reusable launch vehicles.  Current manufacturers and users of RP/LOx rocket engines would be the primary customers for our technology.  This list is fairly small but is increasing in size with the commercialization of space tourism and space launch services.  SpaceX, for example, currently has over a $2B order backlog for their Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy series of expendable launch vehicles and soon expect to break the mythical $1000 per pound of payload cost to LEO.  SpaceX is also actively looking at ways to return both their first and second stages back to the launch site for refurbishment and reuse.  SpaceX has experienced an approximately 100% growth in orders per year for the past few years, and expects this trend to continue or accelerate in the future as their launch costs decrease.",

We use a closed loop control system and a servo motor to smoothly and accurately simulate the gravitational and inertial loads of lifting a weight on earth. However, because the system uses a computer-controlled motor, the load can be varied independently during the concentric and eccentric phase of the exercise. Thus, the system can easily provide an eccentric overload during the return stroke, greatly increasing the physiological benefit of a workout. \n\nThe NGRED has a user-friendly interface where the exercise is selected from a drop-down menu, along with the desired weight and overload. The NGRED will automatically adjust to the user's stored range of motion (ROM) for the selected exercise and apply the set load only during the ROM. The NGRED automatically applies the eccentric overload at the top of the ROM and advances to the next rep at the bottom. The time required to change between users, exercises, and weights is less than 10 seconds. This makes much better use of the astronaut's time; with current mechanically adjustable exercise machines up to two thirds of the time is spent adjusting the machine. The software includes data logging and communication abilities to meet NASA requirements as well as redundant hardware and software fail-safe mechanisms.\n\nThe NGRED includes an efficient energy recovery system which stores the energy generated by the user during the concentric phase of the motion (pull stroke) and applies that energy to provide resistance during the eccentric phase (return stroke). The average power consumption of the NGRED will be less than 50 W during an exercise session. The expected weight of the NGRED at the end of Phase II will be 20 kg, and the total volume is expected to be 55 L, including all electronics and controls.

The impact of nonlinear effects in both path planning and estimation is often most noticeable when the spacecraft under consideration transitions through a region of space where multiple exogenous perturbations become significant.

To address these challenges, DECISIVE ANALYTICS Corporation seeks to advance the capabilities of NASA's open source General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT) by integrating the latest advances in trajectory path planning and estimation, including multi-sensor data fusion.

Each receiver is tuned to the 180GHz frequency, while the intermediate frequency (IF) reaches 500MHz. The IF signal is quantized at 1GHz with 2-bit accuracy. The resulting data rate is 700Gb/s. This data has to be pre-processed aboard the satellite before it can be transmitted to Earth for further processing. One of the steps of such data processing is cross-correlation. For a space borne instrument, power dissipation and radiation hardness are among the most important requirements. Pacific Microchip Corp. is designing an ASIC that includes a cross-correlation unit with interfaces for the GeoSTAR's receivers.

The deep submicron SOI CMOS technology selected for the ASIC's fabrication will increase its tolerance to the total ionizing dose (TID) and reduce the probability of radiation-induced latch-up.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) Phase II project advances a new electronic paper technology that offers paper-like viewability and high energy-efficiency at very low production costs. Central to the innovation is a reverse-emulsion electrophoretic display (REED) ink, combined with a paper-like nano-porous matrix that was developed in Phase I research. The research objectives for Phase II are: (1) to develop a controlled method for depositing the matrix layer, (2) to finalize critical product design parameters, (3) to develop scalable and high-yield fabrication methods, and (4) to conduct performance evaluation of advanced prototypes. Necessary tasks to achieve these objectives include developing matrix deposition hardware and characterizing layer quality, optimizing the combined formulation of porous matrix and ink, defining specific product geometry and functional specifications, performing process integration and assembly, interfacing with electronics and optimizing driving signals, conducting failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), and identifying robust operating conditions. The anticipated results of this work is an advanced prototype display that meets performance requirements for electronic shelf label (ESL) applications, as well as a commercially-viable sequence of manufacturing processes for scalable production. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project are to develop a core display technology that satisfies the readability, power, and cost requirements desired for electronic shelf labels (ESLs), opening new opportunities within the multi-billion dollar global electronic paper market. This project has important implications on society because it can mitigate some of the environmental impact associated with current thin-film display technologies, improve the energy efficiency of electronic displays, and can also lead to reduced paper consumption in a commercially viable way. Technology areas impacted by this innovation include electronic displays, printable electronics, and nanotechnology. Market sectors impacted include display manufacturing and retail. The innovation will further enhance scientific and technological understanding of the behavior of electrophoretic nano-droplets in thin nano-porous media. The enhanced scientific understanding that will be gained from the study of porous matrix and nano-droplet interactions has potential for synergies beyond the realm of electronic displays, with parallels encountered in other areas such as bioseparation and energy conversion processes.

These sensors provide real-time data corresponding to mechanical property degradation resulting from environmental aging of propellants.

They are accurate because the sensing element degrades in the same way under the same environment as the propellant in motor itself.     Applications include (1) mechanical property data for verifying existing strategic SRM propellant models and (2) stand-alone&quot;Smart Shelf-Life&quot;labels attached to tactical SRMs or packaging to monitor aging and provide remaining life of the propellant throughout life of the asset.  These smart labels provide immediate&quot;go, no-go&quot;indication to the user in the field without special training or equipment.      This Phase II project will fabricate and bench test PHM sensors and health monitoring hardware/software for a live propellant used in strategic and tactical SRMs. Polymer Aging Concept&quot;s experience in fabricating PHM sensors from propellant binders demonstrated feasibility of the approach. Participation by a SRM prime contractor in the propellant selection, health monitoring hardware/software design and bench top demonstrations optimizes probabilities of success and technology implementation.    BENEFIT:  This Phase II project will mature the Technical Readiness Level (TRL) of PHM sensors from TRL 3 (active R &amp; D is initiated) to TRL 5 (component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment). Commercialization of PHM sensors will greatly advance Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) of strategic Solid Rocket Motors (SRMs) by providing real time, non-destructive propellant properties for aging model verification. Internal Air Force studies have shown potential savings of up to 50% of the lifecycle costs of strategic assets by SRM heath monitoring improvements that reduce destructive testing and premature removal of assets from service.    PHM sensors, integrated into passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags attached to tactical SRMs will provide passive (no battery)&quot;Smart Shelf Life&quot;tags which allow instant reading in the field of SRM propellant status (&quot;go, no-go&quot;or percent remaining lifetime) without special training or specialized equipment.  These Smart Shelf Life tags will improve ordnance reliability by identifying assets which degrade prematurely from extreme environments, while reducing lifecycle costs by reducing destructive testing requirements and premature removal from service.    The unique&quot;self-integrating&quot;feature of AgeAlert PHM sensors means that hardware and software is greatly simplified compared to environmental sensors and modeling approaches.  Smart Shelf Life tags for tactical assets are estimated to cost approximately $50/tag in full production quantities.    Commercialization potential and market interest has been demonstrated by strong documented interest by Joint forces (US Army, ARDEC), and several SRM prime contractors.  Since AgeAlert technology is potentially applicable to any product comprising polymeric components, future health monitoring applications include sensors and Smart Shelf Life tags for gun propellants, advanced composite structural materials, seals, gaskets, tires, protective coatings and electronic packaging. Strong intellectual property and process&quot;know-how&quot;in fabricating AgeAlert sensors and demonstrated manufacturability provides significant opportunity for high technology domestic manufacturing jobs.",

In Phase II, we will build upon our Phase I success to develop a sensor to monitor specific gas species that are markers of the chemical and mechanical aging processes of polybutadiene composite propellants. We will demonstrate and validate the efficacy of our prototype sensors in an analog motor to ensure system reliability.  Several prototype sensors will be delivered to the Air Force for further evaluation at the system level.  Following its existing approach to this sensor type, PSI will manufacture these sensors in conjunction with Vtech Technologies.  The first transition path will be via Aerojet to the Minuteman III motor.  BENEFIT:  The proposed portable, non-invasive, real-time sensor will enable remote assessment of the propellant&quot;s structural integrity in fielded SRM systems. The ability to assess the current and future state of missiles will improve the system&quot;s performance and its reliability, while simultaneously reducing the life cycle cost.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Exquadrum proposes to continue development of its rocket nozzle thrust diverter, which was successfully demonstrated in Phase I.  The innovative thrust diverter operates separate from the engine and engine cycle, and therefore has no performance effect on the turbomachinery, thrust chamber, or nozzle.  It is stowed away from the engine exhaust stream for re-usability and long-life, and is deployed using a single actuator, synchronization ring, and linkages.  In Phase I, Exquadrum document the requirements, used modeling and simulation to conduct design trade studies, and performed a proof-of-concept hot-fire test demonstrating an additional 3.7:1 throttling capability.  Further, analysis quantified the impact this technology has to increase the engine performance by using the thrust diverter as an uncooled nozzle extension and for altitude compensation.  Phase II will continue the technology development by maturing the thermal and mechanical design of the thrust diverter, culminating in full life thermal-mechanical demonstration.  BENEFIT:  Anticipated benefits of this research includes the successful full-duration life demonstration of  full-scale rocket nozzle thrust diverter hot section parts.  This test will demonstrate the ability of the rocket nozzle thrust diverter to withstand the high heat flux environment of the rocket nozzle exhaust for long durations.  The mechanical testing will demonstrate the ability of a compact actuation system to withstand the deployment loads and operational forces associated with the thrust diversion.  Additional benefits of the rocket nozzle thrust diverter include using it as an uncooled nozzle extension for increased performance, as well as using its actuation capability to provide altitude compensation for improved off-design performance.  These performance improvements have the potential to offset the added weight of the thrust diverter system.  The rocket nozzle thrust diverter enables greater throttle range beyond the rocket engine throttle capability.  Moving the throttling capability from the engine to the diverter reduces the operating range of the engine, which improves its performance and reliability.  Having an overall increased throttle range enables significantly lower thrust during stage separation for a booster engine and provides deeper throttling capability for upper stage engines.  Additionally, the thrust reduction capability enables increased precision for DACS thrusters, and the thrust reduction and/or vectoring capability provides improved maneuverability for missiles.  The technology is applicable to booster and upper stage engines with either bell, conical, or aerospike nozzles for Air Force, NASA, and the growing commercial space launch industry, as well as DoD missile applications.",

This is important because precision clocks needed for electronic warfare applications are extremely vibration sensitive and are compromised by the vibration inherent in ground vehicles, helicopters, and jets. This technology is called the Integrated Vibration Isolator for Quartz (IVIQ). This system consists of a micromachined vibration isolator and an accelerometer based vibration compensation system which work together to compensate for vibrations in the environment. This system is dramatically smaller (200) and more cost effective than any approach currently used. Furthermore, this is the first vibration isolation system which can be assembled directly onto a circuit board. Long term, the IVIQ system will even be further reduced in size and applied for isolating various other sensors. In phase I, initial prototypes were fabricated and partially characterized. In phase II, fully functional IVIQ-Quartz Clocks will be developed and provided to the Navy for functional tests with a yet to be determined sensor system.",

        "abstract": "State-of-the-art electrical starter/generator (ES/G) systems have become increasingly complex in design and integration due to significant power-demand increase in more electric aircraft initiatives such as the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). They must provide high performance and high efficiency with limited active cooling availability. In order to satisfy the power demands and harsher environments anticipated in military and civilian aircraft platforms, new technologies must be investigated that allow significant platform-level performance improvements, including increased power density, increased efficiency, and utilization of cooling media with higher inlet temperatures. To address these challenges, PC Krause and Associates (PCKA) is developing a new generator technology that reduces temperature limitations associated with traditional synchronous generator designs. This new technology, called the ac-field electrical synchronous generator (ACESG), can operate at significantly elevated temperatures without sacrificing output power capability. Such a high operating temperature has several advantages: 1) temperature capabilities of cooling media, such as fuel and oil, can be better utilized, 2) heat can be radiated and convected into the environment, and 3) direct integration of the ACESG at the turbine engine becomes possible. All these advantages will result in significant reduction of active cooling, thus reducing size and increasing power density of the overall ES/G system. In the Phase I effort, PCKA has demonstrated the feasibility of the ACESG's electromagnetic and thermal concepts with modeling and simulation. It was shown that the elevated cooling media temperatures could yield a significant size and performance reduction in cooling loop components such as pumps and heat exchangers while improving overall aircraft performance. In the Phase II effort, PCKA will demonstrate the ACESG technology in a hardware prototype (TRL 4) and evaluate the technology impact on the JSF aircraft in a comprehensive cost / benefit study. If successful, PCKA will transition the ACESG technology to DoD programs under Phase III contracts and/or commercial applications.",

Further, the ES-MaTe non-myopic multi-sensor SRM employs approximate dynamic programming techniques to address the complexity arising from combinatorial explosion.

While manufacturing methods for balancing have improved significantly over the last ten years, measurement methods and procedures and fixturing have not advanced at the same pace.  Modern jet engines require multiple parts and subassemblies to be balanced to ensure proper engine operation.  To assure that these specifications are met, parts must be balanced separately and then integrated as assemblies during production and refurbishment.  The goal of this project is development of an optical measurement system and procedures that overcome the primary shortcomings of existing methods, such as: (1) the need for more accurate measurement of displacement than is currently state-of-the-art on commercial balancing systems, (2) use of fixtures that contribute significantly to the time it takes to perform precision balancing, and (3) inability to correct for inconsistencies in the balancing process.  During Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of an optical measurement system that improves displacement measurement accuracy by an order of magnitude over currently available sensors and developed methods and procedures to help mitigate the issues that extend the time and cost of balancing jet engine rotors and subassemblies.

This proposal seeks funding to develop an in-water &quot;Hybridspectral&quot; capability that combines two differing practices for data collection (multiwaveband and hyperspectral) to satisfy the diversity, accuracy, and precision requirements of future ocean color missions.  Called the Compact Hybridspectral Radiometer (C-HyR), C-HyR places special focus on two important priorities from the call: 1) Instruments making measurements of the apparent optical properties; and 2) Hyperspectral radiometers (340 - 900 nm) for use in near-surface profiling.  The C-HyR system leverages a 2004 NASA SBIR microradiometer development that lead to the Compact-Optical Profiling System (C-OPS), a commercially available multiwaveband radiometer system and adds a spectrograph-based upwelling Radiance Collector Assembly (RCA) for operations very near the surface of the water at the top of a vertical profile.  In Phase II, attention will be paid to spectrograph selection with the goal of making optically valid measurements out to 900 nm, as requested in the call.  For improved deployment security and shadow avoidance, the system uses an innovative buoyancy backplane with twin positioning thrusters to ensure ship avoidance and allow maneuvering the profiler to a desired sampling location.  The result is an innovative expansion of existing state-of-the-art commercial instruments to include a spectral sampling capability that exceeds current and planned satellite requirements, and that can operate in optically complex near-shore regions.  The benefits of this new sampling capability are an improved ability to separate the biotic and abiotic components of seawater, an improved ocean color mission calibration and validation capability into Case 2 waters, reduced deployment effort, and reduced deployment risks.",

NASA&#039;s Regolith &amp; Environmental Science and Oxygen &amp; Lunar Volatile Extraction (RESOLVE) mission&#039;s objectives are to analyze the distribution of volatile compounds in the lunar surface and to demonstrate ISRU operation on the moon.  To support ISRU activities, NASA requires the development of a compact, lightweight gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) instrument that can quantify volatile gases with masses below atomic number 70 released by sample heating.  The instrument must also be designed to withstand exposure to the release of HF, HCl, or Hg that may result from heating regolith samples to high temperatures.  Creare proposes to design, build, and test a compact, lightweight GC/MS system capable of detecting, identifying, and quantifying 100 ppm to 100%-level concentrations of relevant compounds having mass less than 70 amu.  Our GC/MS design is based on components that can be space qualified using techniques proven on numerous past space hardware development projects.  During the Phase I project, we proved our design with benchtop testing, and in Phase II, we plan to build a brassboard version of our GC/MS that will meet the important performance requirements for the intended application.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Spectral Energies, LLC in collaboration with the University of Notre Dame and Georgia Tech proposes to develop and deliver flow control approaches for mitigating adverse effects of shock formation, unsteadiness, and shock-induced separation on aero optical turrets. During Phase I, one passive and two active flow control approaches were identified for a favorable modification of the turret-surrogate flow environment over a range of transonic Mach numbers. The effect of these flow control approaches were characterized with the emphasis on global shock behavior and the ensuing flow separation. Aero-optical measurements were performed with various passive pin configurations which indicated to be promising candidates for mitigating shocks. The Phase II research work will comprise interactive investigations of the flow control mechanisms and their effects on mitigation of aero-optical distortions in canonical flow geometries that mimic major characteristics of the turret flows. The research team anticipates that the eventual outcome of the proposed effort will lead to a toolbox of flow-control devices/approaches/design strategies that would be applied to a wide variety of turret configurations. It is anticipated that the turret design tools, database developed and data analysis under the proposed program will be applied to a broad range of military and civilian aero-optical applications with and without adaptive-optics systems including warfighter missions, laser communications and power beaming.  BENEFIT:  The commercial products foreseen from the proposed work are turret design concepts, flow control devices, methods, and strategies, aero-optics instrumentation, CFD tools, and wind tunnel database. These products will have significant impact on military applications including the ELLA, Laser Strike Fighter, High Energy Liquid Laser Area Defense System (HELLADS), unmanned aerial vehicles, and aircraft surveillance systems. They also will have commercial applications such as in astronomy, laser communications, and power beaming.",

This sensor will provide rapid (10 Hz), real-time, accurate measurements of these important trace gases with minimal calibration.  The SBIR instrument will be capable of both terrestrial and airborne deployment to provide data in the troposphere, tropopause, and stratosphere.  The resulting system will allow NASA researchers to acquire data that complements satellite observations made from missions in the Earth Observing System.  The data will help elucidate stratospheric aerosol loading and terrestrial CO2 fluxes to improve climate models.\nPhase I, LGR demonstrated technical feasibility by fabricating an Off-Axis ICOS system for OCS, CO2, CO, and H2O quantification in ambient air.  The prototype was highly precise (OCS, CO2, CO, and H2O to better than \u00b14 ppt, \u00b10.2 ppm, \u00b10.31 ppb, and \u00b13.7 ppm respectively), linear (R2 > 0.9997) over a wide dynamic range, and fast (2-Hz response), with no appreciable cross-interference between the measured species.  Subsequently, LGR deployed the Phase I prototype locally and at a DOE Ameriflux site (Sherman Island, California).\nPhase II, LGR will develop and deliver two autonomous OCS, CO2, CO, and H2O analyzers for terrestrial flux and airborne monitoring respectively.  The first analyzer, which will measure these gases at up to 10 Hz in a variety of terrestrial ecosystems, will be tested with Professor Chris Still for long-term monitoring and Professor Dennis Baldocci for eddy-flux measurements.  The second instrument will be packaged for deployment aboard a select NASA aircraft, and include provisions for ambient temperature, humidity, and pressure fluctuatons.  The flight sensor will be tested using a modified Mooney TLS with Dr. Stephen Conley and then deployed aboard a NASA aircraft.",

The Light Microscopy Module (LMM), which was developed and is being managed by the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC), is one such facility currently operating and producing fascinating results on ISS. LMM will yield even more astonishing results with the addition of enhancing subsystems. Techshot is currently developing one such subsystem, the LMM-Dynamic Stage (LMM-DS), which will satisfy a host of new experiments proposed for LMM. However, GRC has many more researchers awaiting the ultimate enhancing subsystems for conducting colloid science experiments in the LMM that could lead to new advanced materials with significant commercial potential. Capitalizing on Techshot's rapid progress with the LMM-DS, the company's vast array of mixing and separations technologies, and its extensive experience with microfluidic systems, a series of Colloid SPEcialty Cell Systems (C-SPECS) will be developed by Techshot for use in the LMM-DS. These innovative low-volume mixing devices will enable uniform particle density and remotely controlled repetition of LMM colloids experiments. In addition C-SPECS will minimize crew time, as well as avert the need for multiple, costly colloid samples that are expended after only one examination. C-SPECS are vital analytical microgravity research technologies that will greatly enhance the capability of the LMM, thereby enabling ISS to become even more effective as a national laboratory.",

These figure errors, which occur at spatial frequencies outside the DM control band, are the most significant technological development hurdle preventing the use of MEMS DMs in proximity glare suppression for astronomical coronagraphy. Such wavefront control devices fill a critical technology gap in NASA's vision for high-contrast, high-resolution space based imaging and spectroscopy instruments. Space-based telescopes have become indispensible in advancing the frontiers of astrophysics. Over the past decade NASA has pioneered coronagraphic instrument concepts and test beds to provide a foundation for exploring feasibility of new approaches to high-contrast imaging. From this work, NASA has identified a current technology need for compact, ultra-precise, multi-thousand actuator DM devices. Boston Micromachines Corporation has developed MEMS DMs that represents the state-of-the-art for scalable, small-stroke high-precision wavefront control. The emerging class of high-resolution DMs pioneered by the project team has already been shown to be compact, low-power, precise, and repeatable. These DMs can be currently produced with uncorrectable shape errors as small as 10nm root mean square (rms). The residual shape errors on the DM are mostly periodic and act essentially as a grating, producing diffraction spikes in the image plane. In the Phase I effort, DM fabrication process modifications were developed which will enable the manufacture of these enabling components with an unprecedented surface figure of less than 2nm rms by eliminating surface features resulting from print-through , etch access holes, and mirror attachment posts, and compensating for residual stress induced scalloping.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous landing of a Vertical Takeoff and Landing Unmanned Air Vehicle (VTUAV), such as Fire Scout, on the deck of a moving ship requires a precise and accurate ship-relative navigation solution. The existing automated landing system, consisting of ship-based radar equipment and airborne transponder equipment that utilizes round-trip Radio Frequency (RF) characteristics to determine relative position, is prone to component failure as well as unavailability of the required RF spectrum  issues that may require abandoning an expensive asset at sea. Image-based Navigation for Shipboard Landing (ImageNav-SL) system can act as a backup or replacement for the existing radar -based solution and enables recovery in the aforementioned scenarios. ImageNav-SL system generates ship-relative navigation estimates for its onboard guidance and control system during the final approach and terminal landing phases. ImageNav-SL uses existing visual landing aids on the ship deck and does not require any ship-to-platform synchronous datalink or GPS. In Phase-I, ImageNav-SL was developed using advanced computer vision methods and its feasibility successfully demonstrated. Phase II will expand on the concept design to specify a detailed system HW/SW design and test a prototype implementation using data collects and real-time open-loop flight tests using Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) Fire Scout test assets.",

        "abstract": "Missile defense takes place in a dynamic, uncertain environment. Multi-raid attacks threaten to overload sensor capabilities, leaving fewer sensor resources free to observe each target. Moreover, the shift in emphasis toward early intercept, coupled with the growing importance of short- and medium-range threats, reduces the time available for detection, tracking, and discrimination, because engagement decisions must be made more quickly. These factors increase the need for effective sensor resource management to squeeze the maximum amount of useful information out of an overloaded sensor network. What is needed is a solution that can optimally assign a large number of heterogeneous sensors to a large number of incoming threats fast enough for early intercept, while meeting dynamic constraints on sensor availability and physical constraints. Here, we propose Resource Allocation using Market-Based Optimization (RAMBO), to provide dynamic planning and scheduling of sensors to maximize sensor quality of service while minimizing sensor uncertainty. This approach applies market-based optimization, using solutions from economic theory and game theory, to sensor resource management by creating an artificial market for sensor capabilities and information. With a properly designed market, we can engineer a system that ensures an optimal allocation of sensors and resources.",

The primary objectives are to: 1) Precisely point and hold a laser spot on a target; 2) Safely control the laser beam to prevent collateral damage by providing real-time feedback of the laser spot location; and 3) Package a gimbal payload in small Tube Launched (TL) and Hand-Launched (HL) UAV gimbal configuration. The size of the TLUAV gimbal will be sub 5 inch diameter, and the HLUAV gimbal will be less than 3.5 inches in diameter. The successful completion of the Phase II baseline and option program will result in a technology demonstration system in which the novel precision laser pointing technology has been demonstrated in a from-fit-function gimbal on a manned aircraft. The Phase II program provides a low risk transition to a production design for both TLUAV and HLUAV platforms.  BENEFIT:  The transition of this precision laser pointing technology to Tube Launched and Hand-Launched UAV gimbals provides them with the new ability to both identify and designate targets for laser-guided ordinance. This removes the need for any soldiers on the ground performing this function.

Advanced radar systems on large remotely piloted aircraft (RPAs) include Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Ground Moving Target Indicators (GMTI).  The ability to identify and track vehicles and dismounts has become a key focus.  Small (< 10 lb) radars with SAR imaging capabilities exist for RPAs, but GMTI capabilities are not yet available on Tier I/II programs of record.  Incorporating dismount detection and tracking capabilities into small RPAs will be a significant force multiplier and improve the tactical commanders Battlefield Awareness and is the focus of this Advanced Radar Concepts for Small RPAs program.    The Advanced Radar Concepts for Small RPAs Phase I program clearly demonstrates the feasibility of innovative approaches needed to bridge the gap between advanced weapon system radars and small Size Weight & Power (SWaP) radar systems that can operate on Tier I/II programs of record RPAs.  The objective of Phase II is to mature small SWaP GMTI technology and demonstrate real-time GMTI radar capabilities within the stringent SWaP constraints of these Teir I/II RPAs.    BENEFIT:  GMTI and dismount detection radar is a force multiplier that will help the tactical commander to dispel the fog of war and the uncertainty of ever changing battlefield conditions.  Pushing this important and proven technology down to the smallest RPAs will provide accurate and timely situational awareness information to commanders of forward operational bases and the small tactical units critical for the protection of personnel and concentration of force.    Moreover, agencies responsible for border patrol, law enforcement, and search and rescue operations will benefit from this technology.  GMTI will improve their ability to efficiently search and patrol large areas.  They will be able to concentrate their efforts where it is most needed while minimizing risk to personnel.",

(ACT) proposes an innovative heat exchanger integrated with thermoelectric devices to achieve 10-15 kW additional cooling capacity to the current Liquid Cooling System (LCS) aboard the E2-D Advanced Hawkeye. The proposed heat exchanger will reduce the cold side temperature of the LCS by 3-5\u00b0F and reject the waste heat to the hot side of the LCS using thermoelectric devices to pump heat against the thermal gradient. By raising the hot side temperature of the LCS, the ultimate heat sink (ram air heat exchanger) will be able to handle the additional heat load without size increase. The proposed heat exchanger will replace existing sections of LCS plumbing, providing a design that has minimal impact on size and pressure drop. Additional innovations in the heat exchanger design will improve efficiency and mechanical reliability by allowing direct convection heat transfer to remove heat from the hot side of the thermoelectric modules. ACT has secured the support for this project from Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems, the manufacturer of the E-2D Hawkeye. Northrop Grumman will provide design requirements and guide the development efforts in Phase II and eventually become an integrator of the technology in actual aircraft.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  M4 Engineering proposes to develop a method for accurately correcting dynamic wind tunnel force measurements by removing components due to inertia and aeroelasticity.  This effort will effectively utilize novel sensors to determine inertial loads due to excitation of multiple structural dynamic modes resulting from a broadband loading environment.  Methods for system identification and optimal estimation will be included within this development.  This work will include demonstration of the proposed technology on a hardware prototype CTS system.  The proposed development will create an excellent compliment to modern test and analysis methods.  BENEFIT:  The new technology developed in this Phase II SBIR will be hardware and software for correcting wind tunnel data for balance motion.  The hardware component of the product will be a balance assembly including additional sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes in addition to conventional strain gauges.  M4 Engineering has initiated discussion with Triumph Aerospace Systems regarding the fabrication of such unique balance hardware.  The software that will be developed consists of methods that will be used to accept the output from the hardware and compute the model motion and the associated inertial, aeroelastic, and rigid aerodynamic loads.  The first product that this new technology will go into will be wind tunnel instrumentation that measures forces and moments.  This type of instrumentation is usually defined as sting balance assemblies.    Initial customers will be the Defense Agencies and its contractors. Defense Agencies would include Air Force, NASA, and Navy; and contractors will include Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman.  These customers are those involved in developing, testing, and/or certifying aerospace vehicles.  There are numerous universities performing aerodynamic research and development which are also our potential customers.  Customer interaction will ensure development of capability which industry needs.  M4 Engineering has begun discussion of this technology with Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman.  Because this technology will be used in wind tunnel instrumentation, other customers will be those who develop and manufacture wind tunnel instrumentation.  While it is important to target customers who are interested in using this technology, it is also important to understand the number of facilities available to conduct wind tunnel testing.  While there are certainly wind tunnels worldwide, our initial market research focuses on the United States and Canada.  As our technology matures, there will be opportunities to market to the rest of the world.  There are 97 major wind tunnels in the United States and Canada.  Discriminators are size, accuracy, and other considerations such as whether the balance is a 3-component (normal force, axial force, and pitching moment) or a 6-component (normal force, axial force, pitching moment, side force, yawing moment, and rolling moment).      These market size numbers are conservative because there are many other facilities not accounted for since they are not considered major.  And there are many other universities conducting aeronautical research.  This technology is capable of being used in all wind tunnels not just those considered major.  Our technology enhances existing balance capability and the market size estimate is based on figures for existing balances.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Addressing the Air Force need for a reduced-path-length solar/lunar exclusion sensor test capability that quantitatively characterizes off-axis rejection of bright light sources for validation and calibration of sensors in a cryo-vacuum environment, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to advance the development of the new solar/lunar exclusion projection (SLEP) system proven feasible in Phase I. The SLEP system is based on a novel integration of athermalized compact projection and polarization control optics with spatial light modulation. SLEP provides collimated source irradiance with known polarization characteristics over broadband infrared (1 to 20 micrometers) with a uniform intensity profile in a compact form operable in a cryo-vacuum environment. SLEP will enable measuring sensor performance to nominally 10^-9/sr of ratio of sensor response at an off-axis angle to normal incidence per solid angle with a 14 orders of magnitude dynamic range from 0 to 12 degrees with 0.1 degree angular resolution. In Phase II, we will develop a full SLEP system based on the Phase I results and implement identified improvements to enhance system performance. We plan to design and fabricate a SLEP prototype satisfying the Air Force requirements and test its performance in a cryo-vacuum chamber.  BENEFIT:  The proposed SLEP system will provide the Air Force with the required reduced-path-length solar/lunar exclusion sensor test capability that quantitatively characterizes off-axis rejection (OAR) of bright light sources for validation and calibration of sensors in a cryo-vacuum environment. SLEP will find commercial applications such as delivery and testing of advanced space systems, on-board spacecraft systems and commercial space simulation test facilities. The innovative system design allows reduced size and weight and facilitates easy incorporation into an existing space simulation test facility. Specifically, the SLEP system can be used in test facilities that operate at cryogenic temperature and need ground testing capabilities to characterize OAR sensors, such as in satellite industries.",

        "abstract": "The Vadum electronically steered phased array system generates high RF (radio frequency) power at C-band without TWTAs (traveling wave tube amplifiers) and delivers that power to the target without requiring a lossy output combiner.  This approach addresses existing TWTA challenges while simultaneously delivering new capabilities and increased standoff.  Vadum focused attention on radial power combiners as the traditional low-loss approach to microwave power combining at higher frequencies.  Verification that the application supports combining at the target led Vadum to investigate an even lower-loss combining technique:  free space power combining via a phased array.  This approach to directed energy power delivery eliminates the output combiner entirely and allows combining to take place at the target area from an array of transmit modules feeding a corresponding array of antenna elements.  A phased array achieves modularity, flexibility, beamsteering, beamforming, size and weight reduction, graceful degradation, and enhanced reliability, in addition to substantial elimination of passive output combining loss.  The system contains radiating antenna elements, output amplifier stages, and driver and array control electronics.  The array is modular, consisting of sub-array&quot;tiles&quot;that will be dimensioned to create arrays appropriately sized for specific vehicles.   The Vadum phased array can also dynamically steer one or more simultaneous beams, sweeping through a space with variable dwell time.",

In Phase 1 of the program, we were able to successfully monitor cortical activity using multi-parameter sensor modules. In addition to electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals that provided the electrophysiological and cortical oxygenation information, we were able to obtain photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals to compute the heart rate and frequency of eye movement. In Phase 1 we also demonstrated the functionality of an algorithm that automatically classifies the varying degrees of cognitive loading based on the measured physiological parameters. In the proposed Phase 2 program, we will develop a flight-capable neurodiagnostic device that can be unobtrusively worn on the head. Based on the neuro and non-neurophysiological parameters obtained from the multi-modality sensors, we will detect and classify neurophysiological markers associated with decrements in behavioral state and cognition. We will develop an automated algorithm that can recognize and identify key decrements in behavioral state.",

During the Phase I program, a LADAR model, utilizing the output from a Laboratory prototype design of a 1064 nm laser source, indicated that the source is an ideal candidate for a 3D LADAR illuminator. During the Phase II program this laser design will be refined and a prototype laser illuminator system will be fabricated and tested. The laboratory design will be optimized to achieve key performance objectives developed with input by Air Force representatives. An Alpha prototype design of the laser transmitter will then be developed that is compatible with size weight and power (SWaP) requirements of airborne platforms of interest to the Air Force. The Alpha prototype will then be assembled and tested, first in the laboratory, and later, in optional efforts, in the field after integration with a Geiger Mode APD imager.       BENEFIT:  The proposed SBIR program will lead to the development of a compact, efficient 1064 nm laser illuminator which will support a number of important Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance missions that are facilitated by 3D imaging. The compact and efficient design of the illuminator&quot;s laser transmitter will enable integration onto a variety of platforms ranging from compact stabilized gimbals on small remotely piloted aircraft to pods on larger aircraft.

The proposed solution to this problem is to provide subsystem-level detection of the special environment and circumvention of potential damage to commercial integrated circuits by the integration of multiple nuclear event detector chips (NEDs) into the system. When a special environment is detected, the NED interrupts power to critical parts of the interceptor avionics system. After the nuclear event concludes, the system will have survived the event and the NED allows the power to be restored to the protected integrated circuits and the system can again function normally.  Present BMDS systems need new nuclear event detector circuits that have different characteristics from the current parts.  This program will develop new NEDs that will be fabricated with a modern small geometry process which is presently a trusted mainstream technology.  In addition to this, the new parts will have lower power and be capable of handling larger power supply currents at higher speeds.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Trust and reputation management system has been proven to be an effective method to solve many security issues in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). A typical reputation management system evaluates the trustworthy of a sensor node based on historical interactions. However, trust initialization remains to be a challenging issue, as there are no historical interactions in the initialization phase of the reputation management system. In this effort, we propose to develop an effective Trust Initialization Mechanism (T-INIT) based on Bayesian Fusion for evaluating the initial trustworthy of WSNs. The objective of this effort is to improve existing trust initialization strategy by taking a set of context parameters into consideration. Our final target is, based on our studies in Phase I, to build an advanced trust initialization strategy integrating with existing reputation/trust management system, so that we can successfully minimize the warm-up period and achieve the full advantages of the trust/reputation.  BENEFIT:  The proposed T-INIT system provides a solid solution for robust, efficient and accurate trust initialization for wireless sensor networks. We expect to produce a software prototype equipped with distributed reputation management system for military as well as researchers in the networking community to investigate reputation management in dynamic wireless networks. First, the proposed T-INIT solution has tremendous applications potential in dynamic military applications. Given the GIG vision, such heterogeneous and dynamic wireless sensor webs will be common and therefore secure, robust, efficient and timely routing solution is necessary. The proposed architecture, algorithms, and the developed software tool can be applied to various military networks for major programs like layered sensing program, surveillance network, JUMPS, DCGS, etc. Second, due to the increasing popularity of ubiquitous computing technologies, our proposed solution can be applied into a large number of commercial network applications, such as industrial control networks, disaster networks, and border monitoring networks. The size of the market is quite large and may grow rapidly with the commercial demand in network reliability and availability.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Air and space gimbaled Infrared, multi-spectral, and hyperspectral sensor systems require cryogenic cooling to operate. Current cryogenic systems are inefficient, costly, subject to vibrations, are typically the high-maintenance portion of a sensor system, and take up a considerable amount of size, weight and power (SWaP) onboard air and space platforms. Current Cryocooler technology used by the Department of Defense generally fall into one of two categories. The first category, space Cryocooler, includes multiple candidate technologies capable of reaching an objective ~30K temperature and below, but these systems typically cost >$1M because of the low build quantities and the extreme demands of the environment, and excessively high overhead costs of large contractors. The second category, airborne tactical Cryocooler, are affordable at a typical cost between $5,000 and $20,000, but they are generally designed for a high operating temperature range (>65K) for the objective mission.  The Cryocooler design resulting from the Phase I SBIR is a military-grade Cryocooler capable of reaching temperatures traditionally reserved for the space Cryocooler, but at a recurring price more typical of the tactical Cryocooler marketplace. The Phase II SBIR will move the system design developed in the Phase I SBIR to a flight configuration demonstration unit.  BENEFIT:  The Phase II effort will lead to a large number of applications.

By taking advantage of low light conditions encountered in nighttime urban environments Toyons solution can eliminate the need for cryogenically cooled thermal imagers and instead rely on the lightweight and low-er-cost solution offered by InGaAs FPAs. In Phase I, Toyon performed a series of trade studies and inves-tigations to determine the optimum camera architecture that balances performance with cost. In this Phase II effort, Toyon proposes to develop a prototype 5.24 Mega-pixel sub-camera based on Phase I findings. This sub-camera will utilize a sparse 2x2 array of 1 Mega-pixel InGaAs FPAs precision aligned on a mul-ti-layer, optically polished ceramic substrate. The Phase II prototype camera will ultimately be one of four sub-cameras used to deliver a fully contiguous 21 Mega-pixel image. The four sub-camera system could be developed in a follow-on effort. A final sub-camera prototype, performance results, and manufacturing readiness assessment will be delivered by contract end.

The design will be composed of three subsystems to include the lens assembly, the composite focal plane (CFPA) assembly, and the signal condition-ing/processing/data transport electronics.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In this Phase II proposal Silvus proposes to develop a prototype Airborne Network Orderwire system. The prototype called Silvus Communications Orderwire (SC-Orderwire) is based on the architecture that Silvus has developed in Phase I. Silvus proposes to demonstrate the SC-Orderwire prototype in Phase II in an airborne network with 1 ground and 3 airborne nodes. Each SC-Orderwire maintains a local database of node locations, radio parameters, application QoS requirements and network management information. SC-Orderwire architecture includes data replication and replicated computation features to maintain the consistency of distributed databases despite network partition and merges. SC-Orderwire requires no external coordination to setup and its MAC protocol seamlessly handles node join/leave and network partition/merges. To limit overhead and enhance LPD and scalability SC-Orderwire architecture includes airborne node location prediction. PHY layer of SC-Orderwire leverages Silvus&quot;unique expertise with multi-antenna technology to provide a large one-hop link range of 150-200 km for data rate sufficient for Orderwire application using small inexpensive aerodynamic omni-directional antennas and no external power ampliers. SC-Orderwire uses a MIMO-OFDM waveform in the L-band. Additional range is achieved by the use of optimized relay capability at the SC-Orderwire network layer. SC-Orderwire uses multi-antenna adaptive beamforming to protect against adversarial jamming.  BENEFIT:  The techniques being developed under this program could have wide applicability with many types of mobile networks.  The use of mobile networks is expected to explode both in military and civilian applications.  The military airspace directly addressed by this proposal will become increasingly crowded with manned and ever more unmanned systems, making the coordination function addressed in this proposal critical to network efficiency and reliability.  Even the civilian airspace might benefit from the techniques being developed.  New concepts in air traffic control envision data communication directly between planes.  Unmanned systems will almost certainly be introduced into the civilian airspace in coming years, putting additional coordination burdens on the system and likely requiring increased amounts of direct air to air data exchange.  Even on the nations highways, proposed networks such as WAVE for passing traffic and safety information from car to car might benefit from concepts developed under this program.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In Phase II of TIGRESS, we will continue development of a prototype event geolocating system, known as TIGRESS, which leverages an ensemble of open-domain text processing and sophisticated spatial reasoning capabilities in order to associate events with any and all spatial information that is extracted  or inferred  from disparate collections of unstructured text.  We plan to extend the state-of-the-art spatial event reasoning system developed in Phase I of this effort with a combination of novel techniques, including supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised algorithms, which will increase the amount of domain knowledge about events and event structures that informs the event geolocating system.  We expect that by integrating forms of spatial inference with robust statistical and symbolic models of the implicit structure of complex events, we can achieve a level of performance for event geolocating which goes beyond what is possible with the more&quot;shallow&quot;approaches which focus solely on the spatial properties of individual events and event structures. In addition to pursuing unsupervised approaches to knowledge acquisition from text, we also plan to explore a tighter integration between the TIGRESS prototype and LCC&quot;s family of fully-customizable information extraction systems (including CiceroCustom and CiceroEvent), as well as knowledge base tools (Lorify). This will incorporate the rich semantic models created by users of these interactive systems into an integrated spatial reasoning framework.  BENEFIT:  We believe there is a growing need for systems capable of providing a wide range of accurate spatial and temporal information about events from unstructured texts within multiple sectors of the U.S. government, including the Departments of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the national intelligence organizations overseen by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. We anticipate that the prototype location-tagging and spatial reasoning system being developed as part of TIGRESS will not only enhance the quality of Language Computer&quot;s CiceroCustom suite of open-domain customizable event extraction tools, but will also serve the location-tagging and spatial visualization needs of operational customers as well.   Transitioning our technology into these organizations will support intelligence analysts, incident managers, intelligence preparation for the battlefield, and event detection / response collaboration. To accomplish our objectives, we will solicit our current contacts within the Intelligence and Homeland Security communities to demonstrate and tailor this capability to their needs. For DoD customers, we will work through our strategic partners to demonstrate and integrate spatial visualization into their current and future systems.  As location-tagging and spatial reasoning capabilities become more robust, we expect the quality and coverage of our applications will drive demand for LCC&quot;s products in the civilian commercial sector as well.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Toyon Research Corporation proposes to develop a decentralized asset management framework which will provide near-optimal loose cooperative control of diverse assets within the Layered Sensing Architecture. We propose to develop an asset manager which will perform allocation, assignment, vehicle routing, target prediction, and sensor tasking for a heterogeneous collection of assets while taking into account other asset managers and assets.  The proposed design creates a&quot;team of teams&quot;behavior, which can accommodate large numbers of diverse assets with tolerant synchronization.  Interfaces will accept information needs from multiple sources and will be&quot;plug-n-play&quot;so that organic assets can come on-line at any time to help fulfill sensing objectives.  We will build upon Toyon&quot;s existing fingerprinting, fusion, prediction, tasking and routing algorithms and the Tracked Object Manager (TOM).  In Phase I, we developed the prototype asset manager, built a realistic contemporary operational scenario, and demonstrated real-time closed-loop plug-and-play operation of multiple asset managers controlling assets simulated using SLAMEM. In Phase II we will advance the prototype asset manager incorporating decentralized fusion and tasking.  We will perform live closed-loop testing of the new decentralized control framework using multiple asset managers and real unmanned aerial vehicles at Camp Roberts.  BENEFIT:  This project has three tremendous benefits.  First, is the fundamental advancement of decentralized control and fusion algorithms which will enable multiple groups of assets to perform concurrent missions as an efficient autonomous agile team.  Second is the development of the Decentralized Asset Manager application, a tool which greatly expands the usefulness of thousands of small UAVs from traditional&quot;look over the next hill&quot;to autonomous convoy over-watch and suspect tracking missions. Third is the creation of a simulation which can be used to test and evaluate this and other asset manger concepts.  In addition to military systems, the technology developed during this project will serve as a foundation for planning tools for manned and unmanned systems, providing, for example, hazardous material transport over-watch or emergency response plans for natural disasters or biological, chemical, or nuclear attacks.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Current military systems laser rangefinding and designation systems require multiple detectors, which make such systems large, heavy, and power hungry, which limits application to larger, high-value platforms. The proposed Phase II program addresses the need for a single, compact high-resolution SWIR imager with see-spot/time-spot capabilities. In the Phase II program, Voxtel will develop a dual-mode (active/passive) focal plane array (FPA) capable of simultaneous active tracking of laser spots and high resolution passive SWIR imaging during both daytime and nighttime operations. The proposed FPA has the ability to asynchronously time the arrival of laser pulses, enabling it to range targets and read pulse repetition frequency (PRF) codes, as well as centroid the laser spot for tracking or guidance applications while simultaneous performing low light level SWIR imaging of the target and scene.   In this 24-month program, a fully-functional dual-mode readout integrated circuit (ROIC) will be fabricated, tested, and hybridized to an InGaAs detector array. The prototype active/passive FPA will be characterized and each of its operating modes demonstrated. The ability to scale the innovation to high resolution formats will be shown.  BENEFIT:  No currently fielded single device that can see the laser spot from eye-safe laser range finders exists. A simultaneous active/passive imaging device will provide persistent surveillance, an unmanned aircraft system (UAS), airborne laser targeting pods, Forward Air Controller (FACs) and combat controller ground targeting systems, laser guided munitions, dismounted warfighters, and active/passive imaging that simultaneously shows the scene, the target area, and laser energy from pointers, designator/markers, or rangefinders.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Operating in a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) environment is risky because there is limited ability to gauge the quality of information, especially information that has been transformed multiple times as it flows within the SOA. To address this problem, CFDRC built METSI (Metadata Establishing Trust in SOA-based Information) to quantify the Quality of Information (QoI) using seven QoI Metrics that evaluate independent aspects of information quality. METSI also includes a QoI Rating that provides a numerical summary of the QoI for filtering and visualization. METSI is built upon CFDRC&quot;s existing DINES technology which provides data integrity protection to both information and metadata in SOA environments and protects against cyber attacks.  In Phase I, a prototype was developed that demonstrate the feasibility of the QoI Rating and QoI Metrics and conveying QoI in SOAs. During Phase II, these metrics will be enhanced and new metrics will be added to improve the accuracy of the system. A full prototype will be developed and integrated into AFRL&quot;s Phoenix architecture to demonstrate and fine-tune METSI. Additionally, METSI will be validated by evaluating it with real-world data. New capabilities will also be added to prevent insider threats and tested with several cyber attacks.    BENEFIT:  The SOA-based (Service Oriented Architecture) solution for quantifying the Quality of Information (QoI) developed under this project, called METSI (Metadata Establishing Trust in SOA-based Information), will be greatly beneficial to the Air Force and the rest of DoD in addressing the Global Information Grid (GIG) goal of a secure, collaborative environment. Additionally, METSI&quot;s capability of connecting to legacy systems and external SOAs to quantify the trust of information coming from these domains that don&quot;t provide rich metadata capabilities will address the short term goals of managing the Quality of Information (QoI) for current DoD systems.  CFDRC&quot;s commercialization strategy is focused in two areas. First, CFDRC will develop and market the METSI technology for the Air Force. During Phase II, CFDRC will integrate MESTI into AFRL&quot;s Phoenix architecture to demonstrate its capabilities and fine-tune its seven QoI Metrics that quantify information quality. Using this demonstration, CFDRC will market the METSI technology to potential military customers during Phase II. In Phase III, CFDRC will integrate METSI into other military systems and provide consulting on incorporating new quality metrics. ITT Exelis has already expressed interest in the METSI technology and has provided a strong support letter.  The second focus is to market the METSI technology to providers of Electronic Medical Record (EMR) solutions and demonstrate how METSI can evaluate and propagate the QoI in medical records as detailed medical tests are summarized. Additionally, EMR solution providers will be interested in METSI&quot;s ability to work efficiently in federated environments. CFDRC will use its existing relationship with Systems Made Simple, a provider of EMR technology, to market and commercialize the technology in the medical IT market.",

The Heatsink solution utilizes the embedment of high thermal conductivity Thermal Pyrolytic Graphite (TPG) within 6061T6 aluminum to create a high thermal conductivity path for waste heat to be driven to a heat rejection surface.  TPG has a very high thermal conductivity 10 times that of aluminum 6061T6.  However, TPG is not a structural material and cannot be machined into the necessary heatsink configuration for the SSADT program by itself.  By embedding the TPG within aluminum a structural component can be made so that the heatsinks can be mechanically integrated into the overall assembly.  Peregrine&quot;s innovative composite approach utilizes the high thermal conductance of TPG with the structural capabilities of 6061T6 aluminum to provide an enabling solution for SSADT&quot;s needs.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  As the USAF and other military services migrate to an IP-based tactical network, i.e., the&quot;IP to the edge&quot;paradigm, the use of end-to-end IPSEC-based encryption of network traffic using HAIPE devices presents a tremendous opportunity for cost savings compared to traditional link layer encryption for implementing needed COMSEC capabilities. Despite the attractive cost advantages offered by HAIPEs, their widespread use in tactical networks is currently not possible because the use of HAIPEs impairs, and sometime precludes, the operation of networking protocols and network optimization/acceleration techniques critical to the functioning of mission applications.  To overcome these problems, Architecture Technology Corporation designed an innovative software product called CAPTAIN (Crypto-Partitioning Aware PEP for Tactical Networks) and successfully established its implementation feasibility during the Phase I SBIR effort. Designed to be integrated within existing network hardware devices such as inline network encryptors (INEs) and routers, the CAPTAIN software product will enable the DoD as well as civilian agencies to reap the cost savings produced by employing HAIPEs to meet the COMSEC requirements for tactical networks.  The proposed Phase II effort will build a TRL 6 prototype of the CAPTAIN software product and demonstrate its effectiveness in a laboratory network.     BENEFIT:  The CAPTAIN software product developed by this effort will, in the near future, benefit USAF programs such as BACN (Battlefield Airborne Communications Node), TACP-M (Tactical Air Control Party  Modernization), and CMBDDS (Crypto-Modernization Black-Side Data Distribution System). Also, CAPTAIN will address the needs of the USAF&quot;s Joint Aerial Layer Network (JALN). Furthermore, the US Navy&quot;s ADNS program and the US Army&quot;s WIN-T program that currently rely on the use of HAIPEs for COMSEC would be direct beneficiaries CAPTAIN technology. In the civilian arena the CAPTAIN product will address the WAN performance acceleration needs of enterprises using IPSEC-based VPNs for interconnecting remote sites over the Internet.",

During Phase I of this SBIR, Architecture Technology Corporation (ATC) defined an innovative technology called Adaptive and Integrated Multicast for the Airborne Networks (AIM-AN) that will meet this need. The AIM-AN technology includes a hybrid multicast routing scheme that dynamically adapts to changes in the black MANET for optimized usage of the network resources, and an HAIPE-compliant multicast integration scheme that enables secure, efficient and seamless multicast across the red-black boundaries. A practical and easily deployable solution for supporting tactical multicast operations, the software-only technology will operate within the existing network infrastructure, including COTS routers and HAIPE devices. Based on the confirmed feasibility, ATC will implement a full prototype of AIM-AN during the proposed Phase II effort to transition the technology to the field to enable secure and efficient multicast in airborne networks.  BENEFIT:  This research will yield a software-based solution to secure and efficient multicast in crypto-partitioned heterogeneous wired and wireless networks. Potential customers of the commercial product from this research include the military, the homeland defense and the commercial enterprises. For the military, this technology will facilitate effective and timely dissemination of ISR and C2 video, voice, etc., among tactical edge users as well as implementation of other net-centric services. For the homeland defense, this technology will be very useful in emergency response communications, which tend to have the characteristics of mobile ad hoc networks and high security requirements.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The primary objective of this research effort is to develop a next-generation time-gated ballistic imaging (BI) system for three-dimensional characterization of liquid breakup within dense fuel sprays.  The temporal resolution will be varied using nonlinear time gating and pulse shaping techniques to optimize image contrast for a range of optical densities in sprays for propulsion applications, including augmentors, rockets, scramjets, and IC engines. The unique feature of BI is that it can circumvent the difficulties associated with propagating light through dense media by eliminating diffuse light that has undergone multiple scattering within the dense field of droplets.  In contrast with X-ray or conventional tomography, BI greatly reduces the number of elements that must be reconstructed to satisfy the Shannon/Nyquist criterion and allows 3D reconstruction using discrete tomography.  Borrowing largely from advancements in medical imaging and non-destructive testing, several inversion algorithms will be tested to solve the discrete tomography problem.  This approach can potentially allow measurements with very limited viewing angles for high-speed 3D imaging of liquid breakup in dense sprays.  BENEFIT:  We anticipate that three-dimensional ballistic imaging tomography will provide new measurement capabilities for studying liquid-breakup dynamics in a variety of propulsion systems, including augmentors, gas turbines, scramjets, and rockets.  This will enable improved fundamental understanding and modeling of dense sprays, which is of significant practical and scientific interest.  The understanding developed from the proposed tomography system is critical for improving the speed and efficiency of the design process, ultimately helping to avoid and or solve problems associated combustion dynamics brought on by transient, non-uniform fuel-air mixture preparation. This measurement capability is applicable for military and commercial propulsion systems, as well as industrial furnaces and internal combustion engines. The increasing availability of compact, ultrafast laser systems indicates that a ballistic imaging approach based on these advanced laser sources will be commercially feasible.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Advantages of health management algorithms to critical and complex systems are numerous.  For example, a health management system can improve system readiness by quantifying the health of the system and reduce maintenance costs.  By applying these methodologies to unmanned vehicle payloads, the same benefits can be obtained.  In this proposal, QorTek is teaming with KEYW to apply a health management methodology to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) payloads.  The health methodology is based on symbolic dynamics, a statistical pattern recognition tool.  This methodology enables health monitoring of the complex SAR payload and will also be able to predict remaining life.  A problem with these methodologies is to discriminate differences in the payload as a result of operational characteristics and internal degradation.  It is advantageous to determine if payload degradation is due to internal effects such as from wear-out or if degradation is due to outside effects such as those derived from Electronic Warfare (EW) events (jamming).  The methodology will be developed to handle both of these situations.  The algorithm will be further tested on a flight platform and verified.  Health monitoring capabilities will also be expanded through research and development in this proposal to both infrared (IR) and electro-optical (EO) payloads.  BENEFIT:  By implementing a health management methodology, maintenance costs for complex systems such as a SAR payload can be reduced.  Maintenance can be scheduled as necessitated by the payload versus by use as required in current systems.  In addition, the statistical algorithm lends itself well to expanding the methodology into additional payloads such as EO and IR.  This will enable a complete health management tool that can monitor the critical payloads on military ISR vehicles.  In addition, the maturation of the algorithm will enable future deployments in the commercial sector such as in airlines.  Additionally, another commercial application is within the traction community monitoring the health of the electronic equipment.  Industrial applications can also be targeted through monitoring numerous electronics and machines.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this project was to help reduce or eliminate the potentially catastrophic effects of a failed hose/drogue system during aerial refueling. Failures can arise in certain situations when the receiver aircraft engages the hose at too high of a speed cause a wave to be generated in the hose. This wave reflects off the reel and creates a whipping motion at the drogue with the potential to break the hose. The reel was designed to take up slack when the receiver aircraft engages, however it could be inoperative, or simply not capable of taking up the slack fast enough. Mid proposes to incorporate energy absorbing material directly into the hose to help mitigate these potentially catastrophic occurrences. The material will not interfere with the current operation of the hose and reel and provide the United States military with the benefit of a much safer and more reliable probe and drogue refueling system.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The DoD requires increased performance and increased density solid propellants for use on boost, strategic and tactical missile systems, however, simultaneously attaining higher energy and density while maintaining satisfactory physical properties is an extremely challenging goal. Current ingredients are incapable of imparting the desired performance and insensitivity. Because of sporadic, short-term funding in advanced energetic ingredient research over the past 20 years and the lack of a coordinated, sustained national effort; few new ingredients have surfaced. Concurrently, the level of research effort has declined steadily in the USA and research chemists in this critical defense area represent a declining workforce. Meanwhile, efforts in Russia and the People&quot;s Republic of China have remained high and have accelerated dramatically. In order to meet and compete in this technology challenge, and to avoid technological surprise, focused efforts are needed to identify, synthesize, and characterize new ingredient oxidizers to increase the energy and density of formulated solid propellant mixtures while meeting other required attributes defined by the DoD/NASA/US Industry&quot;s IHPRPT Program Phase III goals and beyond. Nalas is focused on the synthesis of an AP replacement based on the elaboration of the diaminofurazan motif.  BENEFIT:  Our objectives for Phase II are in continuation with our recent successes and aimed at addressing important technological gaps identified during Phase I. Specifically, we project to synthesize a novel oxidizer and deliver multi-gram quantities to the Air Force Research team. In parallel to these efforts, we will develop innovative methods to produce sustainable processes for the production of DAF and ANF. These deliveries will require the engineering of optimized chemical processes, and answer the problem associated with the supply of these important chemicals. All materials have excellent potential for commercialization to CONUS sources.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  When Air Force applications or data reside in a third-party&quot;gray&quot;cloud, trustworthiness can be compromised due to lack of control over the underlying infrastructure. The user must treat the cloud as a black box that cannot be instrumented or modified. To support verifiable access to applications and data residing in gray cloud infrastructures, we will develop a framework that treats the cloud as a black box and assesses trustworthiness at the cloud client to execute tests within a trusted environment. Our solution integrates diagnostic tests to assess application trustworthiness with the application client, so they are run within a single process. The integration process optimizes test coverage while accounting for properties of the diagnostic tests, parameters of the mission supported by the application, and properties of the cloud infrastructure. If a test fails, the framework attempts to redeploy the application on more trustworthy cloud resources. Diagnostic tests for data objects stored in the cloud are based on a separate cryptographic hash-based check that verifies their data integrity. As with the diagnostic tests for applications, the diagnostic tests for data objects are evaluated outside of the cloud.  BENEFIT:  We expect the full-scope framework to have immediate and tangible benefit to users requiring trustworthy execution of applications and storage of data in both blue and gray clouds. Companies that provide commercial cloud computing services are potential licensees of this technology, which will enhance their competitive advantage for security-conscious consumers.",

This program will apply channel equalization to the photonic link, leveraging techniques established for copper interconnect.  We optimize the fiber launch condition to maximize the effective modal bandwidth (EMB).  We will utilized built-in-test methods to measure the link bandwidth insitu and auto-negotiate to the maximum rate available.  Lastly, this program will incorporate a ruggedized vertical connector (RVCON) has extremely low-loss optical coupling, offering increased bandwidth through higher power entering the receiver.  This connector solves the cable problem in existing low-profile transceivers that have fixed fiber pigtails, prone to breakage during assembly and operation.      BENEFIT:  Higher data rate (&gt;10 Gbps per fiber) over the installed MMF, including 50/125, 62.5/125 and 100/140 variants.  Specific platforms/systems present transition opportunities.

Future aircraft are expected to have hotter exhaust that could threaten the integrity of these lighting fixtures. During Phase 1, two conceptual LED illumination designs were developed and virtually integrated into the existing Tramline housing. Thermal analysis, which included electrical thermal loads, showed that the LED's junction temperature was below the requirement defined by MIL-STD-16377 in ambient operations and below the LED's failure point when exposed to aircraft exhaust. The Phase 2 goal will be to complete system development and validate performance of an LED sourced Centerline/Tramline light system for both carriers and LHA/LHD type ships. Detailed design will be completed and a sufficient number of prototypes will be built to demonstrate functionality. Environmental and EMI test will be done to validate performance. During the development process, product improvements and cost reduction changes in the design will be made as improvements and cost reduction changes in the design will be made as necessary.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Current cyber threats analysis and detection techniques based on intrusion prevention/detection, anti-virus and spam filters often offer unsatisfactory security properties. They cannot detect new attacks, have high false negative rate and often identify attacks after they have happened. We propose a light-weight whitelist-based cyber threat detection and prevention framework for Weapon Systems, called SecureVisor. SecureVisor is composed of three major components: 1) a whitelisting tool to identify allowed safe programs; 2) a security enhanced hypervisor; and 3) Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to provide the root of trust. In all, the proposed SecureVisor is a combined hardware-software security solution to detect and prevent cyber threats to Weapon Systems. Our solution will not only provide high level of security, but also minimizes impacts on the platform in terms of power, processing cycles and operation performance.  BENEFIT:  We anticipate that by the end of our Phase II effort we will have matured the SecureVisor sufficiently and we will be able to demonstrate its functions to evaluate the near real-world use on multiple platforms. Our proposed techniques in threat detection and prevention can also be applied in a wide range of application scenarios. Essentially any kind of computer systems can potentially benefit from our technology.  As the world becomes more and more digitalized and connected and protecting cyber assets becomes more critical, the proposed solution has tremendous application potential for military systems as well as commercial sector.",

For visible applications, conductive coatings like indium tin oxide are available; however, these coatings become highly absorbing at longer wavelengths. For MWIR applications, conductivity is generally provided by metal grids. Unfortunately, the grids are not transparent and produce scattering/reflections, and thus a suitable transparent conductive coating is preferable for applications like the targeting system in the Joint Strike Fighter. During Phase I, Surmet and Teledyne successfully fabricated a durable IR transparent, conductive coating. Teledyne applied their TransCon coatings on Surmet provided spinel substrates and Surmet applied a durable top layer. Measurements indicate that Surmet&quot;s durable coating did not have a detrimental effect on the optics and conductivity of the TransCon-Spinel samples. The durable coatings were completely resistant to hot water and thermal cycle while maintaining some resistance to sand abrasion. This Phase II will further develop the coating technology to improve optical properties of the TransCon and make it valuable to a wider range of MWIR applications. Additionally, thicker durable layers will be evaluated to increase the abrasion resistance of the IR transparent conductive coating.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  To address the Air Force need for a system to monitor the state of wear of cutting tools in high performance fighter jet production, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) developed the Innovative Monitoring System for Performance Assessment of Cutting Tools (IMPACT) that has demonstrated the ability to detect the onset of cutting tool wear and the ensuing degradation of part quality. The performance of the system is made possible by two novel sensors that were developed and demonstrated by POC in the Phase I effort. Because tool life is known to vary from cutter to cutter, POC&quot;s IMPACT has been designed to detect the onset of tool wear of each unique cutting tool, allowing the machinist to continue drilling so long as the cutter continues to make parts of acceptable quality. The fully developed IMPACT system, which POC plans to integrate into facilities at Lockheed Martin and Boeing, will be a robust, affordable system that will dramatically reduce the cost associated with variations in cutting tool life.  BENEFIT:  The IMPACT system will reduce the cost associated with variations in cutting tool life by identifying maximum acceptable tool wear in real time. First, the IMPACT reduces cutting tool waste by allowing the manufacturer to use the full extent of the life of each unique tool. Second, the IMPACT reduces the cost of reworking parts whose quality is unacceptable due to early onset of tool wear. Finally, the IMPACT enables the manufacturer to further reduce costs because the system makes iterative process optimization possible. This system will find application in commercial and military aerospace manufacturing, as well as in automotive and industrial infrastructure manufacturing, thereby reducing the costs associated with manufacturing in the United States. This cost offsetting technology will aid in keeping the United States competitive in a global manufacturing economy.",

        "abstract": "The Phase II objective is to demonstrate the vision that the reuse of knowledge gained from known designs for Direct Digital Manufacturing (DDM) of building blocks in a laboratory can be leveraged in order to produce and rapidly qualify complex DDM parts whose geometry can be expressed as union of building block geometries. The DDM of such a part will be designed using a heuristic and adaptive analytical framework that seeks thermal and flow similitude between the building block deposit and the part deposit, instead of a rigorous computational simulation-based design. The various elements of this framework are designed to overcome the technical barriers in qualification that arise from the approval of deposition and geometry parameters, and the determination of probability of detection (POD) of defects. It allows for the evaluation of DDM equipment capability for the deposition of fine features, which is also beneficial for the comparative evaluation of two machines for the deposition of the same part. The framework has been designed to minimize the effort in the collection of knowledge based on the building block DDM, its reuse for part DDM, and nondestructive inspection. Dimensionless metric parameters will be designed in order to overcome the dependence of part quality on the size, sequence and orientation of the deposit build. The admissible window for the dimensionless metric parameters will be defined based on the in-process temperature data for the building block. The POD of defects will be calculated by performing building block deposits within the admissible window of processing parameters and its vicinity. The process parameters for the part deposition will be controlled using a feedback loop that will seek to maintain the process within a subset of the admissible window in order to provide a margin of safety. Excursion of the material thermo-mechanical path outside the admissible window will be mapped to the POD data and a part-specific inspection plan will be generated. The part will be subject to NDI, evaluation of microstructure heterogeneity on local mechanical properties, and limited mechanical tests for tension, fatigue and fracture toughness. The admissible window, POD, feedback control data, inspection plan, NDI and mechanical tests will comprise a data package that is deemed to reduce the qualification effort. This data package will be documented in the form of a part-specific process qualification record (PQR) and the DDM process will be documented as a draft DDM process specification (DPS). The technology will be demonstrated for powder spray and powder bed DDM.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) need regular and more flexible access to civil airspace to enhance existing training capabilities and to improve the logistics of transporting UAS. To qualify for unrestricted access to civil airspace, UAS need the capability to Sense and Avoid (SAA) both cooperative and non-cooperative intruder aircraft. Passive Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors are attractive for SAA on all classes of UAS because of their low Size, Weight, and Power as well as cost. Passive sensors traditionally have suffered from the drawbacks of high false alarm rates and unavailability of range to the target. UtopiaCompression Corporation has developed a novel approach to maneuverless monocular passive range estimation that can additionally be used to filter out false tracks due to objects such as clouds. The passive ranging and false track filtering technologies have been tested both using recorded flight test data in a non-real time desktop environment and real-time hardware-in-the-loop set-up.  The objective of this Phase II effort is to evaluate the passive ranging and false track filtering technologies in flight tests. At the desired end-state, the integrated system software, hosted on an embedded system, will have been flight tested and will be enhanced to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6.  BENEFIT:  Anticipated benefits. A successful Phase II effort will demonstrate that the innovative passive ranging technology offers UAS the capability to range non-cooperative air traffic, which can enable a passive only solution to SAA for UAS. These results will demonstrate improved capability as this is the first passive imaging sensor based SAA solution with the ability to provide intruder range and also filter out false tracks.   Potential commercial applications. There is a very significant commercial market for a successful SAA capability in commercial revenue traffic manned aircraft. DoD will be the early adopter of the technology. Within DoD, the immediate market for SAA alone is well over one thousand shipsets. As its effectiveness in avoiding collisions is demonstrated, UC anticipates a move in the commercial aviation industry to adopt the technology as a pilot advisory system, similar to the adoption of T-CAS (Traffic  Collision Avoidance System). The proposed passive ranging technology, which can range to non-cooperative traffic over a much larger volume of sky than a human and is never distracted, will improve pilot situation awareness and therefore flight safety.  As economies of scale bring the price down to the T-CAS range and test data begin to demonstrate flight safety improvements, it is reasonable to expect the FAA and commercial aviation entities will adopt technology.",

The SAVIEN system is based on the unique combination of a staring multiaperture superposition compound eye with a high-sensitivity integrated IR and visible photodetector array and a neural network processor. SAVIEN detects, locates, and declares mid-air collision threats with high angular resolution over a large field of view, using infrared signal detection and data processing supported by a simple neural network for long-range detection with low false alarm rate. The insect-inspired design matches the stringent cost, size, weight, and power requirements of small-scale RPA, and represents a paradigm shift from traditional camera-based approaches. In Phase II, we will develop a full SAVIEN prototype system based on the Phase I prototype and implement specific improvements to enhance system performance. We will optimize and fabricate a SAVIEN prototype that satisfies the requirements and interfaces to Air Force systems and collision-avoidance algorithms. We will test the performance of the Phase II prototype and prepare for ground and flight demonstrations.  BENEFIT:  Currently restricted to flight under 400 ft above ground and away from aircraft traffic, UAVs are no-longer limited to the support of intelligence and military operations. Unmanned aircraft are making their way into such commercial arenas as aerial photography, land surveying and crops monitoring. Once the regulations governing UAV flight in the National Airspace (NAS) are in place in 2015, the demand for reliable autonomous see-and-avoid systems will surge. Because of its compact size, lightweight, and low cost, the SAVIEN system can be installed in small remotely controlled aerial vehicles for applications such as police surveillance and traffic control. Its low cost will also make it suitable for collision avoidance in automobiles, boats, and aircraft.",

        "abstract": "This Through the Sensor Active Sonar Enhancement SBIR aims to develop algorithms for in-situ adaptive sonar performance prediction. These algorithms will provide spatially and temporally varying estimates for terms in the sonar performance prediction equation such as clutter, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), probability of detection (PD), and false alarm rate (FAR). The primary purpose of these estimates is to provide statistical distributions for the terms in the sonar equation. These distributions, referred to as sonar equation maps (SE-MAPs), characterize the expected value and its uncertainty over space and time and can be used for sonar performance prediction for system design and for real-time operation of warfare systems.  Operationally, the SE-MAPs will used as input to space-time adaptive processing (STAP) algorithms for data normalization (also referred to as whitening) and suppression of clutter and other unwanted noise sources. Data normalization is a critical processing component of Information Processing (IP) streams, providing the means for effective and robust target detection, tracking and classification. The SE-MAPs can combine historical data from disparate sensor surveillance platforms to produce fused geospatial-temporal distributions for use by operational sensor systems and for system development and design.",

This platform can measure multiple configurations of fiber links by utilizing pluggable modules. This platform is used for Navy aircraft and ship-board applications. The goal was to identify a feasible and low-cost approach to implementing high-resolution OTDR in a T-BERD module. The approach should work for wavelengths and fiber types of interest to Navy platforms. We identified a wavelength and fiber-type agnostic capability for measuring the quality of optical fibers, waveguides and devices with a resolution of 1 cm, which is a 30X improvement over current state-of-the-art. Fiber optic pathways today contain links at the board-level, backplane-level and box-to-box level. The box-to-box links traverse several bulk-head connectors. The improved resolution will allow aircraft and ship maintainers to isolate faults within the cable plant to a specific section of the pathway, reducing the time required for diagnostics.

Of particular interest to the Navy is the potential use of ultrafast lasers for aircraft self-defense applications. However, the propagation of an ultrafast signal through the atmosphere inevitably results in changes to the temporal and spatial characteristics of the pulsed beam, which diminishes the effectiveness of the signal. In this Phase II SBIR, Raydiance proposes to develop an autonomous pulse tuning system that will pre-compensate for atmospheric effects so that the desired pulse energy and quality can be delivered on target, regardless of field conditions. Key tasks in the program will include the development of integrated devices and methods for ultrafast laser pulse shaping and tuning, and control algorithms for autonomous programming the nature of the laser output. In addition, an architecture will be designed that enables a user to program the temporal and spatial characteristics of the output.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  As the size, cost, and power of digital signal processing platforms continue to drop and their performance improves, incorporating digital beamformer into future SATCOM satellite payloads has become an increasingly attractive option.  This is particularly true as the number of active SATCOM users and their required throughput has steadily grown.  Digital beamforming offers the ability to simultaneously synthesize multiple independent radiation patterns that can be used to improve capacity through frequency re-use while nulling interfering signals that can disrupt SATCOM communication.     MaXentric is developing a flexible X-band digital beamforming architecture codenamed X-BEAST.  The architecture leverages the capabilities of two types of processors: FPGAs and Manycore.  The FPGAs execute the relatively simple yet computationally intensive operations associated with wideband beamforming while the Manycore processor performs the more sophisticated higher level algorithms such as source localization and steering weight calculation.  During Phase I, MaXentric investigated the feasibility and attractiveness of the X-BEAST to SATCOM beamforming.  Under Phase II, MaXentric will construct, test, demonstrate, and deliver to the AFRL a highly flexible X-BEAST digital beamforming receiver prototype and supporting software along with a strategy for Phase III including a plan for scaling the system up to larger array sizes.  BENEFIT:  The X-BEAST architecture promises a flexible digital beamforming receiver architecture designed to support several high level functions that can be used to further improve link performance through interference detection and suppression.  The applications for such a digital beamforming system are far-reaching: a large potential commercial market is next generation base stations for broadband IP and mobile data services.  4G- and IEEE 802.11n-based technologies have the capacity to meet the growing demand for untethered high-throughput data, but current limitations imposed by frequency availability and user mobility may be overcome using our unique architecture.  In terms of government demand, next generation SATCOM payloads will require substantially more throughput capacity along with mechanisms for maintaining operation in jammer rich scenarios; all of these properties have been designed into X-BEAST.  X-BEAST is also applicable to next generation SIGINT, Software Defined Radio (SDR), and radar array platforms.  In the case of SIGINT, the digital beamformer can be used to synthesize several radiation patterns that independently scan the environment looking for signals of interest.  When signals of interest are detected, the on-board Manycore processor can be used for signal classification and demodulation; it is important to note that the Manycore is well suited for this application since it can quickly switch between various signal classification algorithms on the fly.  Similarly X-BEAST can be targeted towards SDR applications: the Manycore can switch between radio&quot;personalities&quot;on-the-fly providing a great deal of flexibility.  With regard to radar array applications, the X-BEAST architecture can be used to create several independent search beams that can be used for target detection, tracking, identification; each of these higher level radar functions can be supported by the Manycore processor.",

In the emerging NAVWAR scenarios, the GPS receiver should be capable of mitigating the jamming threats from the enemy forces (Red Force Electronic Attack) as well as from the friendly forces (Blue Force Electronic Attack or BFEA) and provide situation awareness of the RF environment.  The MGUE hence need to be capable of seamless integration with Electronic Protection (EP) and Electronic Support (ES) subsystems.  We define SGUE to be the MGUE optimized for integration with NAVWAR ES/EP in a small form factor.  In the Phase I of this SBIR program, Mayflower developed an integrated ES/EP/SGUE system architecture to meet the Air Force objective of providing robust PNT solution to the SWaP-C constrained platforms in NAVWAR environment.   Mayflower proposes to leverage its expertise in developing SWAP-C optimized GPS Receiver, Anti-Jam and Electronic Support subsystems to demonstrate the integrated ES/EP/SGUE system architecture in Phase II which will lead to developing ASICs to meet the final program objective. The ES/EP/SGUE system architecture will be  implemented and demonstrated on an FPGA/general-purpose microprocessor based prototype platform.      BENEFIT:  The proposed research and development will result in highly SWaP-C optimized integrated ES/EP/SGUE technology for use in Navigation Warfare environments, suitable for deployment in the handheld Soldier radios, munitions and small UAVs.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  A better understanding of the thermo-mechanical response, characteristics and properties of materials can lead to improved device performance as well as facilitate the design of new devices and materials for various applications. Although there has been significant progress in the development of micro/nanomechanical testing techniques and tools over the last decade, commercially available tools do not provide adequate capabilities for investigating thermo-mechanical behaviors of micro/nano scale samples at elevated temperatures over 600\u00b0C. In order to extend quantitative thermo-mechanical property measurements to higher temperature applications, we propose the development of a high-temperature microsample testing system capable of temperature control up to 1100\u00b0C. The proposed thermo-mechanical testing system can perform uniaxial compression and tensile tests inside a scanning electron microscope or under a high-resolution optical microscope and record real-time in-situ video images of the material deformation behavior. In this SBIR we will develop a heating stage capable of sample heating up to 1100\u00b0C, a transducer capable of applying a maximum force higher than 5 N and a maximum travel range of 0.5 mm, a sample holder capable of mounting a microsample for tensile test, and a piezo-motor stage for sample approach, alignment, and precise positioning. Successful completion of this SBIR development will provide a high-temperature microsample testing system offering unprecedented capabilities for exploring relationships between temperature, mechanical properties, and structural behavior of materials.  BENEFIT:  The proposed system is intended for pioneering studies of the thermo-mechanical characteristics of microscale samples at high temperatures up to 1100\u00b0C. The realization of the proposed high-temperature microsample testing system will provide an unprecedented thermo-mechanical testing tool to researchers interested in the quantitative exploration of the relationship between temperature, mechanical property, and structural behavior of materials. Many materials and devices are used and operated at high temperatures. The thermo-mechanical reliability and performance of these materials need to be fully understood through proper mechanical testing. Increasing the temperature control capability of the mechanical testing system to cover the sample material/device operating temperature range is critical. Material reliability data related to wear, fatigue, and material strength obtained from thermo-mechanical testing can be used to estimate the possible operational temperature range and life span in the high temperature environment. The proposed mechanical test system will introduce many new scientific findings especially to researchers interested in high temperature materials such as metal alloys, composites, and ceramics routinely used at temperatures from 600\u00b0C to 1100\u00b0C.  The proposed system is compatible with in-situ optical/electron microscopy which can be used to investigate structure-property correlations and the influence of pre-existing defects on the mechanical response of materials. In addition to optical and electron imaging, additional in-situ measurement techniques (e.g. electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD)) can also be employed during the high temperature mechanical test. Performing in-situ microscopy coupled with quantitative micro/nano-mechanical testing can provide a clear differentiation between the many possible causes of force or displacement transients which may include dislocation burst, phase transformation, shear banding or fracture onset. Understanding the fundamentals of micro/nano mechanics can facilitate the design of new devices for various applications and improve overall device performance.    The SBIR company&quot;s (our) product user groups have expressed considerable interest in in-situ microscopy micro/nano-mechanical testing capabilities at elevated temperatures. From our experience as a pioneer in the development and commercialization of in-situ electron microscopy micro/nano-mechanical testers, material research laboratories such as university labs, government research institutions, and industrial R &amp; D facilities are the potential customers of the proposed instrument. Based on the feedback from the users, we are confident that the proposed thermo-mechanical testing system can be marketed to many frontier researchers eager to perform unprecedented thermo-mechanical characterizations. Strong demand for the proposed instrument will be derived from researchers and industries whose applications are in advanced alloys, various composite materials, and ceramics. Defense, energy, aerospace, automobile, semiconductor, and composites related industries and research institutions have a high degree of interest in thermo-mechanical tests at elevated temperatures above 600\u00b0C. Measuring mechanical properties and investigating material behaviors at high temperatures can help to understand phase transformation behavior, failure mode, and reliability of the structures. This capability can have a tremendous economic impact as it provides a means for tailoring materials for an intended purpose based on their properties. Micro/nano scale material synthesis for enhanced mechanical properties at high temperature will result in more reliable high temperature materials for our country&quot;s benefit.",

        "abstract": "United States Navy (USN) program offices have struggled with rotorcraft component history tracking for years, and still spend millions in trying to obtain accurate component history and maintenance information. This is mainly due to records that are kept manually through paperwork systems such as Scheduled Removal Component and Assembly Service Record (SRC and ASR) cards, which are prone to human errors. Because of the lack of reliable component histories, penalties must be imposed when such data cannot be validated. By implementing an electronic record keeping system (eSRC and eASR), point-of-entry data validation will enable highly accurate transaction records to be interrogated instantaneously, world-wide by all stakeholders. The eSRC/eASR system will reduce Total Ownership Costs (TOC) through optimum asset life management and maintenance planning. This also satisfies the USN&quot;s end goal of real-time tracking, gathering complete component usage history to accurately predict the life of each component, and subsequently eliminating penalties imposed due to unknown usage histories. Preserving complete component installation and usage history, along with the implementation of advanced prognostics tools can enable Performance Based Logistics (PBL) as well as Condition Based Maintenance (CBM).

The primary challenges from a SAR-processing perspective are a) the estimation of position and velocity states directly from SAR phase history data and b) the development of  a realistic model to calculate uncertainty estimates associated with the SAR-based (position, velocity)-state estimates for use in an integrated navigation system.   From a more traditional navigation viewpoint, a significant challenge arises in the incorporation of the noisy SAR-based (position, velocity) estimates -- which are inherently associated with the approximate phase center of the SAR antenna -- within an overall navigation system.  This effort will focus on developing real-time implementations of the algorithms proved successful in the prior Phase I effort (the autofocus- and feature-based motion estimation algorithms, as well as the generic navigation filter).  The efficiency and efficacy of these algorithms will be demonstrated through real-time data collections measured on an Air Force platform.

The same mechanism can be used to produce a superluminal ring laser accelerometer (SRLA), with a similar improvement in accuracy.  Under Phase I, we have demonstrated the feasibility of the SRLA.  Under the Phase II work proposed here, we will develop a miniaturized version of the SRLA, with a sensitivity of 10 pico-g/Hz^(1/2),  a volume of 2cmX2cmX1cm, weighing about 15 grams, and using less than 2W of power.  It will have a high dynamic range, capable of sensing an acceleration of 100g, a bias stability less than 0.01micro-g, and a scale factor fluctuation of less than 0.001 PPM.  Under another Phase II proposal that have been selected for funding, we plan to develop an IMU, consisting of SRLGs and SRLAs, with an emphasis on performance optimization as well as electronic interfacing.  In contrast, the emphasis of the work proposed here will be on miniaturization, while maintaining high performance.  Since the SRLG makes use of the same core technology as the SRLA, the work carried out here will translate easily to the corresponding miniaturization of the overall 3-axis IMU, with a volume of 27 cm^3.  BENEFIT:  Three SRLAs, combined with three SRLGs, can be used to realize a high accuracy IMU that is very compact and light weight. Such an IMU could also be relatively inexpensive. An IMU of this type could have a significant impact on guidance, navigation and control systems for spacecraft, launch vehicles, missiles, kill vehicles, smart munitions and other applications requiring precision inertial knowledge.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have  been the most dynamic growth sector of the aerospace industry this decade and it is projected to double over  the next decade. The most significant catalyst has been the enormous growth of interest in UAVs by the US military, tied to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as the general trend towards information warfare and net-centric systems. UAVs are a key element in the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) portion of this revolution, and they are expanding into other missions as well with the advent of hunter-killer UAVs, like the Predator and Reaper, which are equipped with the latest targeting and laser guided missiles. Efforts to reduce the cost, operational footprint and platform vulnerability have led to the development and successful deployment of thousands of small UAV. There is a growing need to add targeting capabilities (acquisition and designation) to small UAS by integrating small laser designator systems into the payload. Advances in miniature laser technology will aid in improving the performance of legacy hunter-killer platforms, and will help enable targeting capabilities of small UAV. Scalable, ultra-low SWaP laser architectures that lead to increased operating ranges and endurance from small platforms are highly desired. Laser configurations must be inherently thermally and mechanically stable over extreme temperatures, shock, vibration, and must be capable of operating in high radiation environments. Arete Associates proposes to mature a disruptive new ultra-compact and efficient laser technology called AIRTRAC that promises to meet these stringent requirements. The AIRTRAC configuration combined with Arete&#039;s&quot;coffin&quot;athermal gain module dramatically reduce size, weight and power (SWaP) requirements on severely constrained platforms. AIRTRAC&#039;s self-aligning, dimensionally stable cavity configuration is extremely robust over harsh environmental conditions. In this Phase-II SBIR Arete will build two technology demonstrator versions of the AIRTRAC: One for the high-altitude hunter-killer platforms (Predator, Reaper,) and another for the small marker UAS platforms (Puma AE, TigerShark, Cutlass). These tech demonstrator units will be tested and qualified over the environment to achieve an exit maturity of TRL-5.  BENEFIT:  A host of other military and civilian applications benefit from the development of compact and rugged high power, brightness and efficiency solid-state lasers sources. Complimentary military applications include long-range air- and space-borne lidar and ladar systems, which are hosted on platforms with limited payload and power capacities. The development of a new ultra-compact AIRTRAC laser configuration will provide&gt;50 mJ of high beam quality output in a package that requiring less than 6 cu-in in volume and&lt;0.5 lbs, which is well below the current state-of-the-art in compact laser designators. Moreover, the integration of Arete&#039;s athermal gain module eliminates diode temperature control requirement, increasing the laser efficiency by a factor-of-two.  AIRTRAC promises to meet future demand for an ultra low SWAP laser designator for ground based warfighters and small UAVs.  The design is particularly novel because it enables full compliance with NATO PRF/PIM codes and pulsewidths in this very compact package.  AIRTRAC is a scalable architecture that can be applied to other more traditional laser designator markets where higher energies are required. A host of civilian applications benefit from the development of an ultra-compact, light-weight and efficient solid-state laser source including law enforcement, homeland security, surveillance, and search and rescue.",

In this way, all of the peripheral devices can be networked without being encumbered by the extra weight and physical restriction of the cables on the warfighter.  This will be a great technological asset for the Air Force special forces operators.  Phase I provided the complete technical specification design, down to the chipsets.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Alkali atoms are utilized in a wide range of applications including atomic clock references, cold-atom physics, quantum computing, low quantum-defect alkali vapor lasers, and next-generation precision navigation and timing (PNT) instruments.  The demand for navigation-grade and strategic-grade PNT capability in compact form factors has led to development of several atom-optics solutions using the energy level and spin properties of alkali atoms.  There is a pervasive need for high performance single-frequency diode lasers as key components to enable realization and field deployment of these atom optics technologies.  Progress on each of these next-generation PNT applications has been hindered by the lack of these precision laser sources.  Independent of the specific physics package, there exists a common need for increased laser power with narrow spectral linewidths tuned for cold atom trapping and resonant pumping of the alkali atom resonant transitions.    The proposed SBIR Phase II research program is to develop high performance LOC-DBR lasers to specifically address this need for increased laser performance and lifetime. The availability of these new LOC-DBR lasers enables a new class of SRLG gyro and SRLA accelerometer systems having performance comparable to units having two orders of magnitude larger volume and weight.    BENEFIT:  The proposed program has benefits to numerous DoD and commercial applications requiring precision inertial sensing, timing, and navigation.  Components developed in this work will benefit other researchers and systems integrators working in the fields of atom optics, cold atom physics, alkali atom-based timing, and inertial navigation systems",

Under Phase I, we have established the feasibility of realizing a superluminal ring laser gyroscope (SRLG) and a superluminal ring laser accelerometer (SRLA), based on diode-pumped alkali lasers (DPALs), augmented by a fast-light Raman cells.  The SRLG can improve the accuracy of rotation sensing by nearly five orders of magnitude.   Alternatively, for a given accuracy need, the SRLG can be very small.  The SRLA can be very compact, and achieve a sensitivity of 10 pico-g/ &amp; #61654;Hz.  The primary goal of the Phase II effort is to demonstrate a prototype IMU that would house three SRLGs and three SRLAs for 3-axis rotation and acceleration sensing, utilizing miniature vapor cells and frequency-stabilized lasers.  The prototype will be tested and analyzed in order to identify any possible technical hurdles in meeting the size, weight, power and performance goals stated in the solicitation, as well as to address applicability to weapon systems and aircraft/spacecraft environments.  Northwestern University will participate as a subcontractor.  Dr. Selim Shahriar, inventor of the SRLG and the SRLA and the chief scientific adviser at DOT, will coordinate the overall effort.  BENEFIT:  Three SRLAs, combined with three SRLGs, can be used to realize a high accuracy IMU that is very compact and  light weight.  Such an IMU could also be relatively inexpensive.  An IMU of this type could have a significant impact on guidance, navigation and control systems for spacecraft, launch vehicles, missiles, kill vehicles, smart munitions, and other applications requiring precision inertial knowledge.

The Spectral Imaging Laboratory (SPILAB) proposes the development of a 120\u00b0WFOV, forward looking artificial compound eye (ACE) sensor for missile seekers and smart munitions, and a 220\u00b0Ultra-WFOV ACE sensor for aircraft.  Both sensors will have simultaneous 3 - 5 um middle wavelength infrared (MWIR) and 8 - 10 um long wavelength infrared (LWIR) capabilities.  Both sensors will be equipped with hyperacuity apertures in the foveal region to improve the accuracy of locating long range targets and to enhance the resolution of images.  BENEFIT:  The Ultra-WFOV ACE can enhance the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability of the larger RPAs, and the forward looking, WFOV ACE can enhance the guidance, navigation and control of seekers and munitions. The wide angle capability eliminates the need for heavy gimbals and thereby reduces the overall size, weight, and power of seekers and munitions.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Due to their high strength to weight ratio, fiber reinforced composites (FRCs) are attractive structural materials for Air Force applications. Multi-functional self-healing FRCs will be beneficial in applications that either currently use FRCs, or will use them in the future. The introduction of high loading levels of dispersed and aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) will enable enhanced mechanical and electrical properties not otherwise achievable, and the self-healing property will enable a damaged FRC component to be healed to as-good-as-new condition. We call this the SAN-FRC approach (Self-healing Aligned carbon Nanotubes). Damage to an FRC structure most frequently occurs at the interface between the matrix and the fiber; the proposed technology addresses this by delivering a self-healing function, as well as CNT reinforcement, at this critical boundary. Building upon the proof of concept demonstrated during Phase I, we will implement this technology into FRCs within the context of a manufacturing process during the Phase II effort. To accomplish the goals of the Phase II program, we have put together a team that includes manufacturers and a DoD prime contractor, in addition to our university partner. This will allow us to further develop the technology with a focus on manufacturing and end-use applications, from both a DoD and a commercial perspective. Life-cycle costs to produce the composite material and prototype structures will be determined in collaboration with a commercial prepreg/FRC manufacturer. Prototype samples will be delivered to the Air Force for testing. We expect the TRL to be 5 at the end of the Phase II program. Future R &amp; D will include additional long term testing and validation, which will help commercialization and full implementation.  BENEFIT:  Currently, there is no commercialized technology for self-healing resins for composite materials. Additionally, the current use of CNTs in FRCs is challenging due to both the lack of alignment of the CNTs, as well as the difficulty in dispersing them in the polymer matrix, especially in high concentrations. The proposed technology solves these issues by delivering a commercial-ready means of incorporating both the aligned/dispersed CNTs and the self-healing agent to the matrix and fiber interface, where they are needed the most. This allows self-healing of microcrack damage, as well as enhancement in mechanical, electrical and thermal properties. The developed technology can be implemented in carbon tow, carbon weave, towpreg and prepreg. Commercial end-use markets that would benefit from the technology include commercial aircraft, aerospace, automotive, composite overwrapped pressure vessels as used for storage of liquids and fuels, and sporting goods.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  As Small Air Vehicles (SUAVs) transition into theater with ever-increasing capabilities, the necessity for tailored avionics becomes acute.  The Air Force and OSD emphasize an increasing role for SUAVs and providing squad-level units with ever-more capable, man-packable air assets.  These smarter and smaller UAVs will perform complex including below roofline urban ISR and precision strike.  Conventional fixed-wing vehicles with IMU-based control laws do not meet the performance required to operate in these environments; bio-inspired approaches to sensing, control, and actuation will need to be incorporated.  Proprioception, a technique to react to environmental disturbances reflexively using torque feedback, is under investigation by Aurora and AFRL through the use of torque error to control actuator position and the use of body force sensing to compensate for high optical/outer-loop sensor feedback latency.  Extending the approach to all three rotational axes and by applying the concept in a more distributed fashion, along the wing for example, provides even more improvement.  Coupling this with bio-inspired vehicle concepts such as distributed actuation yields an exceptionally capable vehicle.  Aurora will work with the University of Maryland to analyze available COTS and other cutting edge sensors to extend the concept of proprioceptive sensing to its performance ceiling.  BENEFIT:  The PWings system provides three potential productization paths (1) as a self-contained package, installed as an after-market modification, (2) as a system to be included in the build-up/development of new systems, and (3) as a fully functional, high performing aircraft produced and sold by Aurora.  PWings is attractive to any customer seeking controllable flight in gustier conditions, greater maneuverability, and lifetime wing load monitoring and gust-load alleviation.    The PWings system will be developed initially for micro- and small- UAV military applications but the benefits and applications are relevant for all classes of UAVs.  As developed in Phase II, the base system will provide enhanced stability, a larger flight envelope, and greater maneuverability to the SUAVs conducting SUAV-related missions, viz. urban ISR and lethal engagement.  Ideal platforms would be smaller UAVs with severe weight and volumetric limitations, those not capable of carrying gimbaled payloads for example.  SUAVs tend to be more affected by turbulence and wind speeds rendering onboard video above 20 knots useless and flight infeasible in wind speeds over 25 knots.  Mechanically stabilized video or even on-board digitally stabilized video greatly improves the military utility of ISR missions but as UAVs continue to decrease in size to support the squad and single soldier CONOPs, integrating these payloads will be infeasible.  PWings will provide platforms such as the Aerovironment Raven and Wasp with an alternative stabilization method with a much smaller weight footprint.  In addition, PWings would increase the wind ceiling for SUAVs over the typical limit of 20 knots allowing these assets to be used much more often.    With over 13,000 Aerovironment Raven SUAVs built to-date , a per system cost of $250k,  and a projected UAV sales of $1.8 billion over the next 10 years for&quot;mini&quot;and small tactical UAVs , SUAV enhancements is a lucrative market.  During fiscal 2011, the U.S. Army, the largest Raven user, increased its projected total demand for our Raven small UAS by 8%, from 2,182 to 2,358 new systems.  One can look to the Raven DDL block upgrades as a model for the market potential of Program of Record system upgrades like PWings.  The Raven DDL retrofit kit was completed in fiscal year (fy) 2010 contributing to a UAS service revenue of $20.9 million in fy 2011, and increase in total UAS revenue of $13 million for a total of $224 million of fy 2011.",

RBS Technologies, LLC has pursued two high performance architectures for a High Resolution Wideband Direct Conversion Receiver (DCR) as potential candidates for prototype implementation. One of the architectures is based on an array of Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters to process the received spectrum to produce channelized time domain data for signal detection and parameter estimation.  A second architecture exploits the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert the received spectrum into channelized data in the frequency domain for signal detection and analysis.   Both architectures are very amendable to implementation in state of the art Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. The phase I effort included formulation and design of a sub-sampling technique to facilitate implementation of a DCR with an signal detection bandwidth up to 18 GHz while maintaining a lower ADC sampling frequency consistant with state of the art hardware.  The Filter Array architecture has some advantages in signal arbitration and parameter estimation compared to the FFT based architecture.  BENEFIT:  There is a broad range of applications in all branches of the military for a very wide band, high dynamic range direct conversion receiver for detection and analysis of RF signals.

This effort will combine our unique expertise in instrumented-Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) with new approaches in reactive materials design to develop a new generation of highly reactive materials.  The proposed material system will use a blend of elemental or compound powders capable of an energetic (exothermic) chemical reaction.  The existence of different powders allows for tailoring of the mechanical and reactive properties of the material through engineered variations of the volume fraction of each powder to control the type of reaction and the form of energy release as well as the mechanical properties.  During the Phase I project, we demonstrated the feasibility of our concept and designed new and highly reactive powder blends that showed a 10-times increase in blast performance over inert material (steel) and 75% improvement in blast performance over existing reactive materials.  In Phase II, we plan to optimize these formulations and their processing, and develop net-shape forming technology for munitions applications of interest to the Air Force.  Upon successful demonstration, this powder-based process can be easily scaled for cost-effective, high-volume production of structural reactive composites.  BENEFIT:  The proposed program will have dual use commercialization with military as well as commercial applications.

The proposed solution is a small ruggedized electrolysis unit based on proton exchange membrane (PEM) technology.  Key components of the effort include verification of the cell stack at desired operating conditions such as production pressure and output capacity, packaging of the electrolyzer system for military field use, and design features to meet weight, operational, transportation, and storage requirements.   The technical effort for the Phase II project includes identification of the optimal system operating pressure based on examining the trade between the cost and weight of the subcomponents vs. the fill capacity of the metal hydride.  Other key parameters include 1) refinement of the hydrogen production rate to increase the number of hydride cylinders that can be filled per day, 2) selection of the final water purification scheme, 3) validation of the safety, mechanical, electrical, and control subsystems, and 4) build and delivery of functional prototypes in a relevant form factor for Air Force field testing.  BENEFIT:  Anticipated benefits include enabling the Air Force portable power solution based upon fuel cell and metal hydride hydrogen storage in order to provide continuous, long-duration, lightweight power from field to hospital locations.  Specifically, support of critical-care patients, during an entire airlift operation which might last 12 hours or more, requires continuous power to maintain the patient monitoring and life-support systems.  The metal hydride canisters can provide enough storage for the advanced fuel cells being utilized in this application, but need to be refilled between missions at a variety of sites, rather than having to return to a central base. The project will also continue to build valuable experience and understating of military field requirements for hydrogen generation in conjunction with other DoD fuel cell applications, to assist in evolution of hydrogen-based solutions for other off grid solutions.      The proposed solution has significant commercial application in conjunction with Proton&#039;s existing laboratory onsite gas generation business.  The Air Force needs are synergistic with the market drivers for the laboratory line and will be supported by Proton&#039;s concurrent re-design effort on the laboratory line for expansion and cost reductions.  The majority of the subsystems being developed for the Air Force program can be directly incorporated into Proton&#039;s commercial products, such as the expanded output cell stack and integrated water purification.  Similarly, Proton&#039;s lightweight, low cost phase separator developed for the commercial line can be adapted for the AFRL unit.  This project thus provides the Air Force with a highly robust solution with significant dual use application and commercial potential.",

As important, the sensor hardware should include signal conditioning and communications electronics such as to be able to communicate over a data bus to the full authority digital engine control. Sporian Microsystems, Inc. has established a solid track record of successful research and development of high temperature (up to 1350oC) sensors and packaging architectures for high temperature turbine engines.  The proposed approach is to leverage previously developed and demonstrated high-temperature pressure sensor technology and advance the sensor electronics into a&quot;smart&quot;form suitable for engine control applications/use.

Commercial applications abound for the successful results of this proposal in commercial and military jet and helicopter aircraft engine industries, which are made up of companies such as Pratt &amp; Whitney, GE, Honeywell and Rolls-Royce.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This program will develop salient feature analysis and saliency cueing capabilities for SAR-based exploitation and demonstrate this technology with operationally relevant data and classifiers.  This saliency technology will immediately enable the development of exploitable, robust, compact feature databases for sustainable radar CID.  This new SAR-based saliency capability will complement existing HRR-based saliency technology by providing either independent or joint discovery of sparse sets of robust, exploitable features across these two common radar sensing modalities, in support of air-to-air or air-to-ground moving and stationary CID missions.  This framework provides a balance between a compact target representation and target generalization across in-class variations.  The underlying probabilistic model captures the uncertainty inherent to the training process due to limited or noisy data, and propagates these probabilities in a mathematically rigorous manner to downstream processes.  The proposed work for this program will focus on near-term capabilities of sustainable radar CID database development and will lay the fundamental groundwork for potential fusion of radar and EO features based upon saliency and target geometry.  BENEFIT:  Phase II will result in a combined salient feature analysis, saliency cueing, and classification performance analysis capability for both HRR and SAR radar modalities integrated into POSSIBLE.  This capability will enable the automatic identification of compact exploitable radar signature features over fewer target aspect states for more efficient and sustainable CID databases.      While the salient feature analysis framework will be leveraged on the proposed program for classification with radar sensor modalities, the framework easily generalizes to other data modalities and exploitation applications, such as detection, recognition, identification, and general data categorization.  Medical device manufacturers are developing cutting-edge sensors and equipment that is leading to revolutionary advances in non-invasive diagnosis of a variety of diseases, especially cancer.  These devices have the ability to gather a significant amount of data, much more than a physician or technician can handle alone.  Additionally, commercial satellite imagery providers are developing sensors that collect extremely high-resolution imagery.  While more pixels generally provide more information, large amounts of data also lead to increased burden on image analysis, storage, and query.  Therefore, automated processing, including rigorous understanding of salient features, is necessary for realizing the full potential of these new medical devices and satellite imagery.  SIG is actively engaged with sensor and data providers in each of these industries and will leverage these relationships to commercialize the products of this Phase II SBIR.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  To achieve the objectives of condition-based maintenance plus prognosis (CBM+), and realize its potential, the location and size of damage at any length scale, e.g., either a crack or a microstructural perturbation, needs to be determined with statistical metrics to feed prognostic reasoners and risk assessments.  Previous work by Victor Technologies has focused on developing estimation-theoretic metrics for model-based inversion algorithms in eddy-current NDE.  During Phase II, we will build on the Phase I feasibility study to demonstrate and validate a general statistical theory of uncertainty propagation with appropriate metrics, and apply the results to more challenging three-dimensional problems, including those in which sizing and location of flaws are required, as well as materials characterization.  Further, we will continue the development of high-dimensional model representation (HDMR) algorithms for application to statistical problems in NDE, which we first studied during Phase I.  BENEFIT:  The technology that we develop in this proposal will be applicable to the aerospace, nuclear power, materials characterization, civil infrastructure, and many other industries, so our research will have commercial benefits that extend far beyond military applications.",

It is the foundation upon which leaders build situational awareness to support timely decision making, and the mechanism through which leaders train and assess their teams. Team communication training is particularly important as the Marine Corps transitions from a culture in which small unit leaders are focused on stimulus-based decisions to one where leaders are encouraged to employ judgment-based decisions. However, communication training is a gap in the Marine Corps. Aptima has consulted with TECOM, NAWC-TSD, and ONR to define this training gap, and to define a solution strategy that can be integrated with specific Marine Corps courses: IULC and IOC. We call the proposed effort CONTACT: COordiNated TActical Communication in Teams. CONTACT training will facilitate the development of team situation awareness and formulation of effective decisions. This training will provide small unit leaders with the catalyst  communication skills  to take the individual skills learned during squad leader training and apply them at the platoon level. CONTACT will be designed to help small unit leaders 1) assess team communications, 2) diagnose communications failures, and 3) select effective actions to improve communications.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Air Force has need of a Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) Hyperspectral imager with simultaneously high spectral and spatial resolution.  Most hyperspectral imaging systems sacrifice spatial resolution for spectral resolution.  As a result, the imagery that contains spectral information which may be important in target selection will not have the spatial resolution to allow simultaneous detection of objects by shape-based algorithms or human-in the-loop exploitation.    This project is directed towards the development of a multiplexed hyperspectral imager suitable for deployment on a Tier 2 UAV.  In Phase I, we were able to develop hardware and software for the creation of high-resolution hyperspectral images by using a scanning fore-optic, an array of apertures and a dispersive optical processor.  The prototype system demonstrated in Phase produces composite LWIR hyperspectral images at the resolution of the focal plane array by combining images from varying scan positions, processed with custom software.    The great promise demonstrated in Phase 1 will be scaled up in Phase 2 with a much faster focal plane array, integrated cooling system, and a dedicated computer with integrated data acquisition and processing software with a user-friendly GUI, allowing the production of high resolution LWIR hyperspectral images at 5 Hz.      BENEFIT:  The multiplexed scanning hyperspectral imager allows the production of LWIR hyperspectral images with simultaneously high spatial and spectral resolution.  This will allow the integration of spectral and shape-based detection algorithms in a single system for greatly enhanced target identification and discrimination.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Under this effort, we will develop a system for precise cross-cueing of target locations between different EO sensors flying on different platforms.  The primary emphasis is on target handoff between wide area motion imagery (WAMI) sensors and narrow field-of-view full motion video (FMV) sensors.  We address the challenges imposed by metadata inaccuracies, different resolutions, different frame rates and different viewpoints by the two sensors as well as dense target environments where the targets of interest may be moving or stationary as well as partially occluded or shadowed.  The Phase II project will build upon the Phase I effort which demonstrated that arget handoff is feasible between a wide area EO sensor and a narrow field-of-view EO sensor.  In Phase II we will (1) improve the cross sensor registration algorithms to simultaneously take into account multiple frames of data, (2) improve target handoff in dense target environments by incorporating multi-target association using kinematic as well as appearance matching, and (3) expand the feature set used in associating target appearance from one sensor to another to include image correlation, color and feature histograms.  In addition, we will integrate the target handoff functions into a reliable and efficient system and comprehensively test system performance and improve robustness and accuracy across a wide range of operating conditions.  The system will be tested on measured data from multi-sensor collections as well as simulated data where a broad range of operating conditions may be assessed.  The Phase II effort will deliver a target cross-cueing software system and a test report detailing the benefits and limitations of the cross-cueing capabilities relevant to practical applications.  BENEFIT:  The ability to reliably and accurately cross-cue target information between different sensors operating on different platforms will enable coordination and cooperation between multiple sensor assets to best leverage availability, capability, and coverage of diverse ISR sensors and platforms.  Target handoff from one wide area motion imagery (WAMI) sensor to another WAMI sensor or gimbaled full motion video (FMV) sensor enables continuous target tracking beyond the field-of-view of any one single sensor.  Future benefits, enabled by this Phase II project, include  leveraging of high resolution target features from a narrow field-of-view sensor in the data exploitation processing by a wide area, but lower resolution, sensor to achieve improved situational awareness.  Target cross-cueing may also enable the simultaneous exploitation of imagery of the same target from multiple points of view, thus mitigating against illumination artifacts or occlusion effects observed from a particular sensor viewpoint.  Furthermore, target cross-cueing may support the integration of information from different sensor modalities in the exploitation process -- e.g., enabling visualization of a target detected by a non-literal sensor.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  There has been a strong desire in the turbine engine and thermal protection systems communities to measure surface parameters (such as temperature/pressure) in tight spaces within the engine system using conformal sensors.  This type of sensor, prescribed in areas such as turbine and compressor blades would provide unprecedented information to the engine community. New sensor and high-temperature electronics technologies are being developed to address these deficiencies, but many of these technologies are based on discrete elements and semiconductor fabrication processes not inherently compatible with conformal application to aerospace components. Thus an adaptable conformal high-temperature packaging and installation methodology is needed.  The ultimate goal of this proposed effort is to develop a high-temperature conformal packaging and installation technology to realize a conformal capacitive pressure sensor/sensor interface module for in-situ turbine engine monitoring applications. Further, the resultant conformal sensor interface module could be ultimately used with a range of commercial sensors with minimal additional development. Phase I included initial proof of principle demonstrations of all key process steps, and Phase II will encompass working with OEM partners to: complete process/design development, prototyping, and culminating in the demonstration of a prototype device in OEM/relevant environment test systems.  BENEFIT:  Aero propulsion turbine engines, commonly used in commercial and military jets and rotorcraft, would benefit significantly by having non-invasive, small mass, conformal, on-engine component sensors, allowing for visibility of the conditions of the turbine engine.  To enable such sensors, novel packaging technologies must be developed to interface the sensor with the sensed environment and with engine control and health monitoring systems.  The conditions in this application are harsh, and packaging must be able to withstand high temperatures, high pressures, fuel and exhaust.  The packaging technologies described in this proposal would allow exactly that, allowing sensing directly from the point of interest within the engine.   Commercial applications abound for the successful results of this proposal in commercial and military jet and helicopter aircraft engine industries, which are made up of companies such as Pratt &amp; Whitney, GE, Honeywell and Rolls-Royce.  Additional potential market areas include: marine propulsion, rail transport, rocketry, land based power generation turbines, downstream crude oil refining, oil shale conversion, and government and academic laboratories.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In this AF Phase II SBIR program, MATECH proposes to further demonstrate the ability to perform&quot;on wing&quot;repair of ceramic matrix composite (CMC) components. On wing repairs cannot exceed 300F cure temperatures. MATECH proposes to demonstrate its high ceramic yield, fully domestic, solvent less preceramic polymer resins, as the preferred resin system for field repair. These resins can be fully cured at below 300F, thereby meeting the on wing temperature requirement. This resin also emits limited gaseous by-products during curing. Higher temperature&quot;pyrolysis&quot;can be performed either by utilizing engine heat (for engine and exhaust components) or in flight (for leading edge components). In the Phase I, MATECH demonstrated this approach by measuring CMC strength before and after the simulated repair of&quot;near catastrophic&quot;matrix damage in a large scale CMC system. The damaged CMC flexural strength and modulus properties were fully restored to equal (and above) those of the&#039;as received&#039;CMCs. The technique used for the simulated repair will be amenable to an operational field application environment (flight line or hanger). This Phase II program benefits from the active support and participation of Lockheed Martin(Fort Worth, TX), GE Aviation (Cincinnati, OH), and General Atomics (San Diego, CA).  BENEFIT:  Ceramic and ceramic matrix composite will be increasingly utilized in both military and commercial aircraft engines and turbine generators, along with other applications requiring high service temperature components, due to their light weight and higher service temperature capabilities. A facile, user friendly ceramic repair capability would greatly encourage the use of ceramics and CMCs in commercial applications by reducing maintenance costs.",

        "abstract": "Future high-speed missiles require aerodynamic dome shapes that reduce drag and have greater ability to withstand aerothermal heating. Several Navy SBIR topics have addressed fundamental issues of producing an ogive-shaped dome of MWIR transparent ceramic material, but an aerodynamic dome meeting the optical tolerances required by the Navy has not been produced. CeraNova&quot;s transparent, fine-grained, polycrystalline alumina (CeraLumina) has excellent MWIR transmission and mechanical properties comparable to, and in some cases better than, sapphire. CeraNova has the unique capability to fully process transparent alumina ogive domes, including the manufacture of dense dome blanks and their fabrication (grinding and polishing) to the required geometry and surface finish.  The goal of the proposed program is to produce a polished, optically figured, low drag-shaped dome of CeraLumina. The latest technology that has demonstrated the best finishing and metrology methods will be used to produce a precisely figured dome. Measurement and metrology will be performed at each stage of fabrication. CeraNova will demonstrate the capability of applying the measured data to correct surface and optical error.  The objective is to demonstrate CeraNova&quot;s capability for precise fabrication of low drag domes in a manner that will serve as a basis for dome production.",

Anyone outside that group without the group key(s) will be unable to decrypt the data. LEG will provide an automated approach to ensure confidentiality and tracking of data files early in their creation, throughout processing and during transmission. It is intended that LEG will transparently exist within current information systems by coexisting and occasionally relying upon cryptographic and information sharing infrastructure. A design goal of LEG will be to be entirely implemented as software that is installed on host systems. LEG will function low in the operating system architecture to provide transparent functionality to high level applications.  BENEFIT:  Host or network based detection of data exfiltration is generally an ineffective, reactive approach and as such the LEG effort is built around a new and promising approach to proactively prevent data exfiltration. A design goal of LEG is to be entirely implemented as software installed on a host system. LEG will function low in the operating system architecture to provide transparent functionality to user space applications. The LEG effort will ensure the successful coexistence within the current and future enterprise information security infrastructure while maximally protecting data from unauthorized access.",

        "abstract": "The proposed work further develops and supports transition of a long integration mode for radar detection and tracking of small maritime targets at high grazing angles in the presence of highly variable Doppler spectra characteristics that occur in the littoral sea clutter environment. Radar detection of small maritime targets can be very challenging at high grazing angles because the radar reflectivity is masked by the much stronger reflectivity of the surrounding sea especially. Maritime wide area surface search radars have traditionally operated at low altitudes (=1000 ft ) and short coherent integration times (some non-coherently) which provide for low grazing angles where the mean clutter levels are low but where sea spikes returns may be larger than target returns. Short integration times with Scan-to-Scan integration were a necessity to maintain fast search revisit rates to provide detection of limited exposure targets. For persistently exposed targets like small boats and semi-submersibles, an alternative approach is to use longer coherent processing. Coherent processing adds the dimension of the Doppler spectrum as a radar observable. If the Doppler spectra of the small boat&#039;s return can be adequately separated from that of the sea then improved detection performance is possible. The Doppler spectra of the littoral seas varies from being rather homogeneous to being highly inhomogeneous with large discrete Doppler packets associated with free and trapped capillaries riding on surface gravity waves and swell. Likewise the target Doppler spectra of the small boat target set of interest can be highly variable containing relatively narrow Doppler spectra from the vessel itself and a much wider response from the speed dependent boat wake and spray.",

This is partially due to limited research in this area, but a large part is also due to material and processing issues unique to deep UV lasers. New approaches to achieving 340 nm III-Nitride lasers are needed to meet the Navy&#039;s ambitious goals; traditional approaches to III-Nitrides are unlikely to be able to achieve the desired laser performance. Instead it is necessary to develop revolutionarily novel approaches to the growth and fabrication of AlInGaN based UV lasers. Phase I of this effort involved studying the growth, processing, testing, and demonstration of high power UV LEDs, and the initial demonstration of laser fabrication. This work has laid the ground work for a Phase II effort in which we will pursue novel approached to realizing UV lasers. One of the cornerstones of our novel approach is to use lateral epitaxial overgrowth (LEO) to reduce dislocation density and cracking formation, so as to improve the quality of the active layers.

They present significant environmental hazards over their entire life cycle  from production, to use, to disposal  because of their use of hazardous and toxic chemicals, which also is a significant contributing factor to their high cost.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The main objective of this task is to demonstrate that multiple systems with assorted architectures within the DoD can share data to better enable Warfighter Tasking.  As opposed to manually transferring data products through high latency means like Microsoft PowerPoint or Word documents through email or file transfer protocol (FTP), which may require phone calls to operators and preparation time and then manual data entry into the application requiring the new information, data should be made available instantly 100% of the time when the proper security credentials are supplied.  A Warfighter will make better informed decisions when more data is available to them in a timelier manner, which can significantly impact outcomes and the safety of our soldiers.  The key technology that will enable enhanced Warfighter Tasking is a data format and protocol bridge service to connect the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) Mission System (JMS) with the Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Mission Services Interface (MSI), and potentially other platforms in the future.  JMS employs a service-oriented architecture (SOA) that leverages web services and ORS employs the NASA GMSEC messaging architecture.  BENEFIT:  There are several benefits to be gained by developing a GMSEC-JMS bridge, which include:  1. Improved Warfighter tasking due to the availability of additional information (i.e. cloud cover, satellite positions, Intel, etc.)  2. Enabler for real-time flow of satellite information from the 50SW to JSpOC, as the 50SW is also looking at adopting GMSEC  3. Real-time awareness of ORS and JSpOC assets between both organizations  4. Ability to more rapidly interface with other DoD organizations  5. Enhanced readiness to adopt future technologies  At the completion of Phase III, Emergent will be able to provide a fully operational software product that could be deployed to multiple DoD government organizations, such as the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).  The initial customers for the MBS will be the JMS and ORS so data can be shared among the two different architectures.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Modern military and commercial aircraft utilize empty areas within the aircraft structure to store fuel. As such, fasteners and joints within these&quot;wet areas&quot;must be sealed with fuel-resistant sealant to prevent leak paths. Systems and Materials Research Corporation (SMRC) proposes their Intelligent Sealant Application System (ISAS) to assist technicians with inverted sealing, dome sealing, and fillet sealing over exposed fasteners, nutplates, and fay surfaces, respectively. Currently, fuel resistant sealant is hand applied to wet areas within the F-35 using manual sealant dispensers and spatulas to shape the sealant over the application areas, a time-consuming, operator-dependent process that frequently results in over-application of sealant. This adds unnecessary weight to the aircraft, and its over-use is fundamentally incompatible with the JSF program&#039;s ESH mission. Likewise, under-application of sealant can produce detrimental fuel leak paths. ISAS uses custom SealKap pre-formed molds and Joint Sealing nozzles to apply sealant to these areas - exactly the right amount and placement every time. ISAS will benefit the aircraft industry by saving time, weight, and cost all while delivering a higher quality seal.  BENEFIT:  SMRC&#039;s ISAS solution is simple, faster, and more accurate. It requires minimal user expertise and training to correctly install sealant on fillet, domed, and inverted sealing areas throughout the F-35, even in tight, difficult-to-access areas. ISAS can save significant amounts of touch labor time as compared to other sealant dispensing solutions such as the PSDS or Semco gun. It can increase manufacturing consistency and reduce aircraft weight by eliminating excess sealant usage. The ISAS solution covers both fillet sealing with Joint Sealing nozzles and domed/inverted sealing with SealKap pre-formed molds. The monetary benefit of a successful ISAS implementation is approximated at $2.7Billion over 27-year with a positive return on investment. SMRC&#039;s preliminary analysis shows ISAS as a high value investment for the Aerospace and Defense industry.",

The ROIC features row-programmable integration time, row-programmable gain, and row-wise windowed readout. The designs low noise pixel amplifiers combined with the row-programmable integration time and gain features, and a novel in-pixel bit serial digitizer allows the ROIC over 28-bits of intra-scene dynamic range, enabling it to be used, with high linearity, for both VIS-SWIR and LWIR applications.   The multi-tap design accommodates variable timing of frame rates, with snapshot integration, up to 450 frames per second (fps). The design includes features for bad pixel and blinker pixel disable, and power down of all non-used portions of the array.  The ROIC will be designed, fabricated, hybridized to a SWIR detector array, and its performance demonstrated with laboratory electronics.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The IED is a difficult and effective threat due to its evolving nature and loosely defined composition.  Due to the variations in design and configuration, no single sensor, or single sensor platform, can reliably detect IED devices with practical false alarm performance in tactical environments.  However, many existing sensors, including some operational in Iraq and Afghanistan, have demonstrated capabilities to address various pieces of the IED puzzle.  These sensors generally detect a subset of the IED anatomy and have marginal false alarm rates in operational environments.  By fusing the data from current sensor technologies, a multi-source fusion system will improve efficacy rates by detecting more IEDs at a safe stand-off distance prior to detonation.    In Phase II, TSC will develop an end-to-end prototype COMIDT system to enhance situational awareness and countermeasures against IEDs.  The prototype system will be developed from TSC&#039;s Phase I design and demonstrate the following capabilities:    1. Combine real and simulated sensor reports from three or more heterogeneous sources reporting on critical components of the IED anatomy.    2. Transfer the sensor reports over a distributed network to a centralized fusion server.    3. Receive sensor reports through a common data fusion interface.    4. Apply data fusion algorithms to the sensor reports and display the fused system result to an operator interface.    BENEFIT:  The TSC proposed Cognitive Multi-sensor IED Detection Technology (COMIDT) and its critical components have benefits and commercial applications on multiple levels to the DoD, FAA, domestic law enforcement, and other US Government agencies.  DoD applications are readily apparent for supporting military operations and saving lives in current tactical environments, by diminishing the threat of IEDs to civilians and the warfighter. FAA and domestic law enforcement applications would provide safety and reliability in the inspection and evaluation of people, luggage, homes, and suspicious containers for evidence of HME fabrication.    A successful, efficient, and reliable sensor fusion system providing an integrated situational awareness display would support systems across all branches of the DoD.  Systems such as Guardian Angel (BAE), Cooperative Engagement Capability (Raytheon/US Navy), Distributed Common Ground System, Sand Dragon (Aero Mech/AFRL), Blue Devil (SAIC/AFRL), Radiant Falcon (SAIC/AFRL), JLENS (Army), NC3S Vigilare (Boeing), Husky Mounted Detection System (Niitek), Vehicle Optics Sensor System (US Army), and Healy Beacon (JIEDDO) could benefit from this technology.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In this Phase II SBIR, a Voxtel Inc. led team will develop a lightweight small unmanned aircraft system (SUAS) delivered payload, including targeting and fire-control sub-system, taggant dissemination hardware, and taggant reservoir, that is capable of covertly delivering optical taggants. Because the performance of auto-pilots and video trackers is limited by SRPA system constraints, the vehicle state errors, will likely lead to low target estimation precision. As the taggant delivery efficiency falls off with distance and operational viability of optical taggants depends upon depositing nanoparticles in specific spectral mixtures and at precise target locations, increased precision is required for this application, especially at the long standoff ranges required for covert delivery. Toward this end, fixed- and gimbal-mounted day/night sensor systems will be characterized, augmented with auxillary sensors and off-board data, and integrated with the SUAS&#039;navigation system. After determining the target estimation accuracy, taggant dissemination systems will be developed, and an integrated delivery payload will be first tested on zip lines and then in flight field tests. The information gained from these tests will be used to develop an optimized small sized, light weight SRPA-based taggant delivery payload, which will be validated in military sponsored flight tests.  BENEFIT:  The military interests discussed in the Defense Science Board&#039;s 2004 study entitled Transition to and from Hostilities recommends a&quot;Manhattan Project-like&quot;focus to develop extensive, covert tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL) technology. Using optically encoded taggants, a powerful, new tool, addresses the challenges resulting from unconventional war targets and technical advances in military weaponry, and applies the Defense Science Board&#039;s recommendations. Optical taggants also satisfy the military&#039;s need for combat identification (CI), and identification of friend or foe (IFF).

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The performance of supersonic inlets, actuators, and scramjet isolators is limited by shock wave/boundary layer interactions (SBLIs).  These interactions lead to flow separation, increased total pressure loss, and fluctuations that can cause excessive thermal or structural loading.  Current control strategies to mitigate SBLI effects rely on bleeding the boundary layer upstream of the shock or enhancing the momentum transfer between the freestream and boundary layer.  An ideal SBLI actuator will have low induced drag, high control authority, high frequency response, and low power requirements.  Current actuators fall short in one or more of these areas.  In this research program, Creare and our collaborators are developing pulsed plasma jet actuators for active SBLI flow control.  This type of actuator has demonstrated the potential for all the ideal actuator traits listed above.  In Phase I, we experimentally demonstrated the ability of our actuators to reduce the size of a separation bubble caused by a compression ramp SBLI.  We identified the effects of actuator geometry, location, and forcing conditions.  In Phase II, we will refine the design of our actuators and test them over a range of SBLI geometries and flow conditions.  BENEFIT:  Technology derived from this program will be in the form of new SBLI flow control actuators and actuator implementation schemes.  These actuators will be beneficial on supersonic inlets, control surfaces, and scramjet isolators.  They may be used to reduce flow pressure loss, separation size, and potentially damaging oscillations caused by SBLIs.  They will enable optimal engine performance over a wide range of flight conditions for both supersonic and hypersonic vehicles.  The high frequency response of the actuators will allow them to be used in concert with new high-bandwidth control strategies for arresting scramjet unstart.  When not needed, these non-intrusive actuators may be turned off, leading to minimal induced drag.",

Design work will continue, as refinements are driven by incremental flight demonstrations, until the software supports fully autonomous operation in demanding environments, and the hardware delivers aerodynamic and propulsive capability that enables VTOL and the payload, speed and endurance required for Tier II missions.    VTOL and endurance capability will be demonstrated both with a small electric V-Bat vehicle and a heavy-fuel powered vehicle suitable for the Tier 2 mission.

Aluminum has an energy density (-31.05 kJ/g) nearly three times higher than most molecular high explosives and its combustion yields a highly exothermic release of energy (?&#039;Hf (Al2O3) = -1676.8 kJ/mol).Unpassivated nano-Al powders are highly pyrophoric and require stabilization through formation of a nascent oxide layer (2-6 nm), however, this process accounts for significant losses in the amount of reactive Al. To optimize the reactive Al content in nano-Al powders, UES has investigated the use of silicon, deposited through a modified chemical vapor deposition process, as an innovative passivation strategy for stabilizing nano-Al. Silicon has an energy density (-32.42 kJ/g) essentially equivalent to Al and also expresses high reactivity on the nano-scale. Passivation of silicon is achieved through a 34% less dense, 1-2 nm nascent oxide, additionally silicon passivation does not consume any Al, therefore, passivation of nano-Al through deposition of silicon has the potential to eliminate undesirable Sdead weight and replace it with additional reactive fuel.",

ES3&quot;s RODS Phase I testing results were very positive and indicated that 6061 aluminum alloy MSS coatings have a great potential for repairing the IDs of aluminum outer cylinders. The results for the 7075 aluminum MSS coatings were: 1) Similar hardness properties as the substrate alloy material. 2) Withstood high bending loads without spalling off.  3) Wear characteristics increased by almost 200% on the sputtered surface vs. the bare surface of the 7075 coupons.    Phase II testing will demonstrate the feasibility of the sputtering method on both test cylinders and actual landing gear outer cylinders.  Phase II feasibility testing shall be conducted on coupons consisting of 7000 series aluminum alloy to provide acceptable model of actual landing gear components in operations. Also, Field Service Evaluation of several landing gear outer cylinders will be conducted to certify the MSS process.  After MSS process passes the testing and    FSE a process specification will be developed for MSS.

By improving the inherent strength of spinel new, lighter weight armor solutions can be developed for ground vehicles and aircraft.

Harmonia proposes to develop a system that implements a&quot;Bank ATM/POS-like&quot;system onboard the ship which works in conjunction with standard bank issued debit cards, biometric authentication devices and a Navy-specific PIN set up by the sailor at the time of registration to create a secure and simple environment for cashless purchases. The system also fully automates the bank-end processes for reconciliation of transactions and settlement of accounts with vendors. It also provides a facility for disbursing cash while onboard without unduly taxing the disbursement officer&#039;s time. The result is a system that can be implemented systematically and cost-effectively, provides significant savings in terms of management and long-term maintenance and is scalable and upgradeable to newer authentication processes as they mature.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to demonstrate that the evolution of plant biosynthetic pathways can be accelerated and driven to favor the synthesis of ligands which interact with a specific human target protein. This is achieved bysubjecting mutant plant cells to selection pressures favoring the survival of mutants with the phenotype of interest. As an example, this approach will be used to optimize pharmacological activity in Lobelia cardinalis, which inhibits the human dopamine transporter (hDAT), putatively by its ability to synthesize the complex alkaloid, lobinaline. A stable transgenic line of L. cardinalis plant cells expressing the hDAT has been established. These cells show increased sensitivity to toxins transported into the cell by the hDAT, including the neurotoxin MPP+. A large, genetically diverse, population of gain-of-function mutants expressing the hDAT has now been generated, and selected on medium containing 100uM MPP+, which kills the vast majority of the transgenic mutants. However, individual mutants that are over-producing inhibitors of the hDAT have a survival advantage, so that the MPP+-resistant population is greatly  enriched  in clones with this bioactivity. Preliminary GC/MS analysis of individual MPP+-resistant mutants with increased hDAT inhibitory activity indicates that many of these are overproducing lobinaline, but the rest are generating other metabolites, some of which are not detectable in the wild-type plant. Phase II is designed to demonstrate that this biotechnology can be used to (a) generate novel natural products with a specific valuable pharmacology (b) provide a biosynthetic production system for these compounds in mutant plants. The process should be of particular value when a plant-derivedlead compound, such as lobinaline, is too complex for chemical synthesis. The first specific aim is to analyze the remaining MPP+-resistant population to determine those individuals in which lobinaline content cannot explain increased hDAT inhibitory activity. Separation (assay-guided preparative HPLC) and tentative identification (GC/MS) of active compounds will be followed by pharmacological evaluation in vitro, in comparison with lobinaline and a synthetic inhibitor of the hDAT. The most active compounds will then be tested for functional effects on the DAT in rat brain in vivo using electrochemistry. In parallel studies, the  mutant clonal cultures which are overproducing active metabolites to the greatest extent will be regenerated to intact mutant plants, and extracts analyzed to establish whether the pharmacological /chemical phenotype is retained. The ultimate aim is to commercialize the technology as a platform for discovering and producing novel plant-derived natural products targeted on specific human CNS proteins.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Plants are a major source of existing medicines, but the pharmaceutical industry has now almost abandoned this source in favor of synthetic chemicals. One reason is that plant metabolites are often too complex for synthetic methods to be used for their modification or production. The technology being developed by Naprogenix uses the plants own biosynthetic capacity to modify the active chemicals contained in the plant. It is alsocapable of increasing the amounts of the active chemicals that are present. The  directed evolution  of a plant species using this technology is capable of generating novel compounds that may be of value in many CNS diseases, for example the targets in this project are important in drug dependence and neurodegenerative disease.",

Workshop training is an essential first step in providing therapists with initial exposure to basic skills and strategies, ut to assure that clinicians implement CBT and other evidence based therapies consistently, effectively, and with adequate fidelity, ongoing supervision and feedback via monitoring of clinicians&#039; implementation of CBTare essential. However, there are no existing tools available for use by clinical supervisors to guide performance monitoring and feedback in clinicians&#039; implementation of CBT. The aim of this Phase II SBIR is to develop a supervision toolkit for CBT andto conduct a randomized training trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the CBT Supervisor&#039;s Toolkit on the ability of clinical supervisors in community-based settings to accurately evaluate clinicians&#039; fidelity (e.g., adherence and competence) in delivering CBT. We have successfully completed Phase I and have demonstrated the feasibility and promise of a prototype version of the CBT Toolkit in training clinical supervisors to accurately monitor and provide effective feedback on clinicians&#039; fidelity and skill in CBT. Specific aims for Phase II include the following 1. Complete a full web-based multimedia training program for the CBT Supervisors Toolkit. The program would be modeled on the highly successful supervisor&#039;s toolkit for Motivational Interviewing developed by Dr. Carroll and colleagues for Motivational Interviewing Assessment: Supervisory Tools for Enhancing Proficiency (MIA: STEP, ://www.nida.nih.gov/blending). Accuracy in using the supervisor rating form and independent ratings of skill in providing CBT supervision, and submission of a taped example of a supervisory session that demonstrates adequate skill (clarity, completeness, support) would serve as basic criteria for certifying qualified individuals as CBT supervisors. 2. Conduct a randomizedtrial in which 105 clinical supervisors would be randomized to (1) the CBT Supervisor&#039;s Toolkit website, (2) a two day didactic training or (3) reading the CBT manual alone. Outcomes will include independent ratings of the supervisors&#039; ability to conduct an effective feedback/ supervision session, the ability of the supervisors to accurately assess clinicians&#039; adherence and competence in delivering CBT, satisfaction with training, and relative costs of the three approaches. The development and systematic evaluation of the Toolkit represents the next major step broadening the availability of high quality training and supervision in CBT and thus addresses a major gap in the ability of clinical programs to implement this and other evidence based practices (EBP)effectively.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Driving while intoxicated (DWI) is a major public health hazard. In the U.S. there were 13,846 deaths in 2008 caused by alcohol-impaired drivers (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 2009a). The New Mexico Dept. of Transportation (DoT) reported the total DWI cost to New Mexico in 2007 alone was over one billion dollars (NM DoT, 2008). In New Mexico, 43% of DWI offenders are repeat offenders. This is unacceptable. Specifically, more needs to be done toprevent first-time offenders from becoming recidivists. This proposal is to develop a new web application that could consistently deliver an effective intervention that has the potential to reduce heavy drinking in these offenders. Currently, however, there are significant challenges to delivering empirically supported interventions to offenders. First, only a small proportion of DWI offenders are referred for treatment, despite evidence that brief motivational interventions reduce heavy drinking in offenders. Second, for those referred to treatment, providing such interventions through substance abuse counselors faces significant challenges: 1) Many substance abuse counselors are not trained in empirically supported protocols; 2) clinicians who are trainedin empirically supported interventions tend to  drift  from protocols over time; and 3) there is an average annual turn-over rate of 50% in counselors in substance abuse programs (McLellan et al., 2003). This turnover means that programs that provide training for staff in empirically supported protocols often need to train new counselors, and programs are rarely compensated for the cost. Training then becomes an occasional event. As a result, counselors may not have the opportunity to be trained, and if trained, tend to  drift  from empirically supported protocols ove time. This proposal provides an alternative. We propose to develop a web application that could consistently deliver an intervention that has the potential to reduce heavy drinking in these offenders. This reduction in drinking would reduce their risk for future DWIs, alcohol-related crashes, injuries, and death. Taking advantage of a  teachable moment,  the program will incorporate two empirically supported brief motivational interventions (onefor younger and one for older adults) and an abstinence-oriented, cognitive behavioral intervention into a single, new program called Right Turns. There are two innovations in this proposal: 1) A web-based and age-appropriate BMI that is tailored to offenders and that takes their readiness to change at the end of it into account when segueing to; 2) a cognitive behavioral, abstinence-oriented web application to help them achieve and maintain sobriety. The RandD proposed in Phase II is to complete the development of the program, adding a follow-up component to the BMIs and a  back office  module for program administrators that include extensive outcome report functions. The program&#039;s effectiveness will then be evaluated in a randomized clinical trial with a3 month follow-up.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drunk driving is a major public health hazard that caused 13,846 deaths in the U.S. in 2008. If this program proves to be effective, it could become a reliably delivered, empirically supported intervention to reduce recidivism in first-time DWI offenders. Reducing the drinking, alcohol- related problems and drunk driving in this population would benefit the individuals, their families, and their communities.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Project Summary Accurate quantification of alcohol and drugs of abuse intoxication in emergency rooms (ERs) is an important screening step for a precise diagnosis and hence for prompt treatment. Some severe emergenciessuch as traumatic head injury, diabetes, and stroke can be misdiagnosed in the absence of screening for alcohol and drug intoxication; reliable measurement of alcohol and drug intake levels would improve diagnosis and subsequent treatment in these cases.Most methods now used in emergency rooms either require patient cooperation and interaction, such as a Breathalyzer, or are invasive and have prolonged processing times, such as blood and urine sample analysis, making them inappropriate for ER applications. In particular, patients suffering from drug and alcohol intoxication are often not able, or are unwilling, to interact with medical personnel, hence the need for easier sampling and reliable measurement. To address this need, Intelligent Optical Systemsis collaborating with Dr. Robert Woolard of Texas Tech University Health Science Center (TTUHSC) Emergency Medicine Department, a recognized expert in alcohol and drugs of abuse in ER-related studies, in our development for a non-invasive saliva-based analyzer for ER applications. The analyzer measures emissions of fluorescent-labeled selective reagents to detect alcohol and drugs of abuse in saliva samples. Although saliva monitoring is an established area for alcohol and drugs of abuse, accurate quantitative measurements are still needed to quantify the intoxication levels in admitted ER patients without relying on visual judgments. In Phase I we demonstrated the feasibility of achieving reproducible, highly sensitive measurements of alcohol levels in buffer and modeled saliva, as well as in 30 human saliva samples obtained by Dr. Woolard and TTUHSC that were tested and compared to blood levels. In Phase II we will test an additional 100 human samples to expand the statistical data and determine sensor accuracy and precision levels, introduce a method for quantitative (high/mid/low) measurement of six drugs of abuse (opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, THC, benzodiazepines, barbiturates), and develop the portable readout system. The objective is a simple yet highly accurate optical detection platform suitable for bedside ER applications, with further potential for widespread clinical monitoring applications in many healthcare settings.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a very large and rapidly growing unmet need for disease-modifying drugs for Alzheimer&#039;s disease (AD) as its prevalence is increasing worldwide due to demographic shifts in the aging population. AD is the thirdmost costly disease in the US with direct costs over  200 billion annually. The proposed phase IIB program is for the continued development of small molecule drugs specifically inhibiting tau aggregation at the earliest steps of tau monomer self-association into oligomers that were discovered during the phase II program. A decrease in tau oligomer accumulation in neurons should also inhibit the formation of higher order aggregates. These drugs may also be effective in reducing extracellular tau oligomers that are not irreversibly linked. A decrease of tau oligomers in the extracellular compartment holds promise to eliminate the associative impairment of memory formation and the propagation of pathology to healthy neighboring neurons. Therefore, it is anticipated that therapeutic intervention that diminishes extracellular tau oligomers should lead to both an improvement in memory and a slowing or arresting of disease progression in AD patients. Symptomatic improvement in memory may be used as an early indication of drug efficacy in preclinical and clinical studies. In Phase II of the project, the assay was converted t a high throughput compound-screening platform, validated, and used to screen a diverse compound library. Antibody fragments for tau oligomers were selected and cloned (Tian et al. 2012). The proposed phase IIB program Specific Aims are:   Perform secondary screen in cell assays for inhibition of tau oligomer accumulation   Improve the potency of selected compounds in the primary and secondary assays   Validate the tau oligomer target in an acute mouse model of memory formation   Select compounds in the acute mouse model for testing in a chronic tauopathy model   Develop regulatory strategy The anticipated outcome of the proposed Phase IIB program isthe selection of at least three or more lead candidate compounds targeting tau oligomers for evaluation in animal models of AD and tauopathies. To attain this result, secondary screening in cell models of tau oligomer formation and medicinal chemistry will be used to optimize and select compounds for testing in the acute mouse model of tau-induced memory dysfunction. Following validation of the model for the tau oligomer target, selected active compounds will be screened and candidates chosen for further development. At the conclusion of the proposed program, a detailed regulatory strategy will be written to guide preclinical up to the IND submission and Ph 1 clinical trials. Key Words: Alzheimer&#039;s disease, tauopathy, neurodegenerative disease, drug discovery, tau, oligomer, cell model, mouse model, memory           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed phase IIB program is for the continued development of small molecule drugs specifically inhibiting an important protein that plays arole in Alzheimer&#039;s disease (AD) that forms protein aggregates known as tangles. A high throughput screening assay was implemented to discover compounds that could inhibit tau self-association and aggregation as starting structures for drug development for AD. These drugs may be effective in both improving cognitive function and in preventing the spread of pathology within the brain thereby arresting the disease. Standard lead optimization work will be carried out in the program to identify compounds for in vivo mouse studies. The mouse model that will be used to test compounds was developed by the team and it will test the ability of lead compounds to restore memory formation in this model. The Company is engaged in active discussions with potential pharmaceutical companies as commercialization partners for the purposes of accelerating this exciting program into clinical studies. The SBIR program has been essential for these studies and in transitioning the company from an early stage, high risk venture toan established successful; commercial entity.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR research effort is to develop a handheld fall risk assessment instrument for use by health and elder care providers. Falls occur in up to 30% of those over the age of 65 and upto 40% for people over the age of 80. Falls place each individual at risk for dangerous closed head injury and long bone fractures. The mortality rate at one year following a hip fracture has been reported to be as high as 27%, with another 22% losing theability to ambulate. Fall-related injuries are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among elderly adults. Falls are estimated to incur costs of over  28 billion annually in the U.S.  The proposed instrument will ensure that individuals at increased risk for falling are identified and provided with appropriate interventions to reduce fal occurrences. Avoidance of injurious falls will result in reduced pain and suffering and will lower the costs of patient care. Bayesian belief networks are the key technology that will enable faster and more accurate fall assessments; the Bayesian methodology allows the merging of disparate information into a unified and objective stochastic assessment of fall risk. The fall risk assessment tool will furnish a universalalgorithm for initializing, adapting, and optimizing fall isk assessments based on the patient risk factor data that are available in a given setting. The proposed approach leverages two important and extant assets: (1) an extensive literature on fall riskfactors and fall prevalence statistics; and (2) institution-specific patient fall risk factor nd fall outcomes data (these data can be used to train and adapt the new assessment tool, allowing accurate, clinically relevant estimates to be obtained for particular settings). These two data assets will be used effectively to close the loop between evidence and practice. The successful Phase I work demonstrated both the feasibility and the efficacy of the BENEFIT instrument. The BENEFIT instrument&#039;s accuracy surpassed that of current assessment tools by a wide margin. A retrospective analysis of a 900 patient sample in Phase I estimated that use of the proposed instrument would have realized a cost savings of nearly  2 million.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCEPUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed tool will provide superior identification of patients at risk for falling than presently-available screening instruments and will lead to changes in clinical practice that aect patient care through more accurate targeting of fall risk prevention interventions. The new tool will nd a ready market as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) began requiring (eective 2005) health care organizations seeking accreditation to routinely assessand periodically reassess each patient&#039;s risk for falling and to take action to reduce the risk of falling. Furthermore, recent changes to Medicare policy limit and, in some cases, prohibit reimbursement to institutions for the treatment of avoidable hospital-acquired conditions, including falls and fall-related trauma. These policy changes represent significant market pull and will stimulate and accelerate the adoption of the BENEFIT instrument.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer&#039;s disease (AD) is characterized by brain amyloid plaques consisting of insoluble beta-amyloid protein (A?), and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) containing aggregated tau protein. AD drug discovery efforts havebeen largely focused on reducing brain A? levels, with much less emphasis on tau-directed strategies. ProteoTech Inc. has developed a number of different in vitro screening technologies and cellular models that identified new potent inhibitors of amyloidoses. We have designed, synthesized and tested a class of new chemical entities (NCE) consisting of small molecules (200-400 MW) containing polyhydroxylated aromatic rings spaced by a linker region. Results from our Phase I SBIR studies have identified ten (10) lead small molecule compounds that possess strong potency to inhibit/disrupt tau protein fibril formation in vitro. This discovery has been confirmed by several  independent methodologies, including Thioflavin S fluorometry, CD spectroscopy, electron microscopy and cell-based assays. We hypothesize that specific lead polyhydroxylated aromatic compounds can also serve as direct inhibitors of tau aggregation/fibrillogenesis in mouse models of tauopathies. These compounds are believed to possess great potential as new therapeutic agents for AD and related tauopathies. The major objective of our Phase II SBIR project is to identify lead polyhydroxylated aromatic compounds in a relevant mouse model of tauopathy that have the ability to reduce tau-related pathology and to improve tau-induced behavioral deficits. In Specific Aim 1, we will assess the 10 lead small molecule compounds for their drugability, blood-brain-barrier penetration, pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles, and acute toxicity in mice. Three lead smallmolecule compounds that possess the best brain penetration, peripheral PK, drugability and tolerance in mice will be selected for animal studies in Aim 2. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the three best lead compounds (selected from Aim 1) for their in vivo efficacy in a transgenic mouse model expressing the human P301S mutant tau protein. We will treat mice with three compounds with one of two administration routes (orally or s.c. to be determined from Aim 1 studies) at 3 doses for each compound for 6 months (starting at 3 months of age). The effectiveness of these compounds in reducing tau aggregation/NFT formation, improving tau-related memory deficits, and improving CSF tau biomarker profiles will be determined using staining and quantitative immunohistochemistry, western blotting, ELISAs and behavioral testing including the Morris water maze test. This Phase II SBIR project will lead to a pre-clinical candidate (and back-up) for the treatment of tau aggregation in AD and other tauopathies.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This Phase II SBIR project will lead to the development of novel small molecule drugs for the treatment of tau protein aggregation found in the neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer disease and other related tauopathies. Neurofibrillary tangle formation is one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer&#039;s disease, the leading cause of dementia in the elderly.",

The TrueContour(R) therapeutic insole system was originally conceived for prevention of forefoot injury in diabetes mellitus. We propose to further develop and extend the applicability of the core elements of the TrueContour(R) system to provide advanced foot orthotics for two other clinically important areas: rheumatoid arthritis/forefoot pain and plantar fasciitis/heel pain. The application of the TrueContour(R) technology to address other common foot complaints will complement the existing diabetic product and offer foot professionals a comprehensive solution for the design and fabrication of custom foot orthotics. This extension will not only address a broader range of clinically important foot problems for which current solutions are often inadequate, but will also provide the opportunity for successful commercialization of a system that is poised to fill a significant unmet medical need. Furthermore, this will be the only system in the marketplace for which an evidence base exists in the refereed literature. Our work plan will employ a proven scientific approach for orthotic design and validation to achieve the following: Phase II Objectives: A) Complete the development of the TrueContour(R)RA foot orthotics for relief of forefoot pain caused by RA. B) Complete the development of the TrueContour(R)PF foot orthotics for relief of heel pain caused by PF. C) Validate the efficacy of the TrueContour(R)RA foot orthotics through clinical testing.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every 69 seconds someone in US develops Alzheimer&#039;s Disease (AD) and related dementia, affecting not only patients, but family caregivers (~15 million), largely untrained and neglected by the healthcare system, with high incidence of stress (60 percent) and depression (33 percent) due to difficulties of caregiving. A large underserved group is Hispanic, the largest minority (16 percent of US population) and the fastest growing ethnic group, facing several health disparities and barriers to care: higher incidence of Alzheimer&#039;s (e.g. 63 percent versus 30 percent for Caucasians age 85 years and over); greater depression in Hispanics (45 percent) than in other groups; limited medical insurance; language proficiency issues; lack of knowledge about dementia; greater need for help to deal with difficulties related to dementia, fewer culturally appropriate interventions, etc Besides materials in Spanish language, culturally appropriate interventions are also needed, because theyare more effective, as racial/ethnic identity influences beliefs about dementia and family care giving role, affecting how families cope with dementia care giving and respond to interventions. Another major challenge for effective Hispanic interventions isthe retention of participants and adherence to healthcare programs. We propose a new intervention called Webnovela (WN), a short online Telenovela in Spanish, specifically designed for Hispanic caregivers on how to cope with dementia care giving, reduce burden of care, decrease stress, and alleviate depression. A DVD with our Telenovela will also be created for non-Internet users. As Telenovela, a limited-run  television novel  drama, is one of the most popular television genres for Hispanics, a  Telenovela  intervention is likely to increase the subject retention and intervention adherence. A Webnovela also has a high potential, since Internet is very appealing to Hispanics, with a high number of online Hispanics (30 million in 2010), and growing two timesfaster than overall US online population. Research on Telenovela-based behavioral interventions is an unexplored field. WN is one of the first (if not the first one for dementia caregivers). The novel WN incorporates: (a) psychoeducation and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which are very effective behavioral interventions to reduce stress/depression; (b) translation and adaptation of evidence-based curriculums into a culturally sensitive short Telenovela for Hispanics; and (c) creative use of Telenovela medium to engage and motivate users to follow the intervention. Related clinical advantages are: encourage caregiver participation, enhance intervention adherence, and enable better assimilation of skills; which should enhance caregivers&#039; skills to dealwith demanding tasks of care giving, reduce burden of care, improve quality of life, decrease stress, and help to alleviate depression. In partnership with the Alzheimer&#039;s Association, expert Advisory Board and caregivers, we will develop and evaluate a prototype in Phase I. We will assess the effectiveness of the complete WN (with all modules) in improving well-being, decreasing stress, and alleviating depression with a randomized clinical trial in Phase II.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   Besides affecting 15 million dementia family caregivers in US, who provide 17 billion hours of unpaid care and are at high risk for stress/depression related to the difficulties of dementia care giving (depression rate of 33 percent), Alzheimer&#039;s has also a growing impact on Hispanics, the largest minority (16 percent of US population) and the fastest growing ethnic group in US, which is of increasing importance, because the number of Hispanic AD patients is likely to grow at an alarming rate, as the elderly Hispanic population (age 65+) is projected to grow the fastest of all racial/ethnic groups, from about 3 million (2008) to 17 millio (2050). Hispanics also face several health disparities and barriers to care, such as higher incidence of Alzheimer&#039;s (e.g. 63 percent for Hispanics vs. 30 percent for Caucasians age 85+), greater depression (45 percent incidence rate among Hispanic caregivers), limited medical insurance, lower educational level, lower household income, higher poverty rate, language proficiency issues, lack of knowledge about dementia, higher need for help to deal with difficulties related to dementia, and lack of specific tools and culturally appropriate interventios to cope with care giving. After Phase II is completed, the expected outcomes of our project are the following: reduce Hispanic dementia caregiver stress/depression, enhance quality of life, decrease burden of care, and increase coping skills; in addition, we expect the following potential indirect outcomes (not measured by this study): delay institutionalization of dementia patients, reduce caregiver medication, and thereby decrease economic costs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Complement system play a role in preventing inflammation and joint immobility. Osteoarthritis (OA), an inflammatory disease of the joints, is quite prevalent among the elderly and causes disability in nearly 10% of thepopulation over 55 years. Current medications only manage the disease and do not cure or halt the disease. The prevalence of OA coupled with the absence of Disease Modifying Osteoarthritis Drugs (DMOADs) heightens the negative impact of this disease on humanity.  Recent studies have shown that cytokines are important in the development and progression of OA. It has been hypothesized that neutralizing IL-12 or TNF-1 may provide benefit to OA patients, hence, biologics or drugs that neutralize these cytokines are being investigated. Clinical trials with an anti-TNF-1 antibody are currently ongoing. The alternative pathway (AP) of complement has recently been implicated in the etiology of OA. We have developed a proprietary group of antibodies that selectivelytarget the AP without affecting the host defense mediated via the classical pathway (CP). Our preliminary results suggest that the AP plays an important role in the development and progression of OA and that our target antibody is highly effective in resolving OA as indicated by rabbit models of OA.  The current application proposes development of a humanized IgG1 as a potent treatment for halting and arresting the progression of OA in humans. In the Phase I segment, we further test a specific neutralizinganti-complement monoclonal antibody in the young rabbit OA model. In the Phase II segment, we will study the efficacy of the targeted humanized antibody to aged rabbits, evaluate the efficacy of the biologic in multiple modes of administration, and establish protocol for scaled up preparation of the humanized antibody. Our studies will provide new insight into the development of novel therapies for the treatment of OA. Overall, the proposed work is a critical step in the direction of developing a cost-effective, efficacious and safe therapeutic agent for preventing joint damage caused by OA.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease which targets the elderly population, and affects a large number of people worldwide. Despite tremendous efforts, no effective and safe treatment is currently available. The treatment of OA is focused on managing pain and swelling, improving quality of life, and minimizing disability. There are no disease-modifying drugs (DMOADs) available at this time, sothe disease management is primarily with acetaminophen, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, naproxen, indomethacin, etc), cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors (celecoxib, etoricoxib, etc), and other non-opiate and opiate analgesics. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections provide benefit in some patients.  NovelMed intends to develop a Disease Modifying Treatment for Osteoarthritis. We have developed a humanized monoclonal antibody that displays exciting results in resolving OA in the rabbitmodel. This application proposes to further evaluate the use of this antibody in juvenile and aged rabbits.",

The biologic TNF inhibitors (TNFI), such as the TNF decoyreceptor, cannot be developed for brain diseases, because the TNFIs are large molecules that do not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The present work continues the drug development of a BBB-penetrating biologic TNFI, which is a re-engineered form of the human type II TNF receptor (TNFR), wherein the TNFR is produced as an IgG fusion protein. The IgG part is a genetically engineered monoclonal antibody (MAb) against the human insulin receptor (HIR). The HIRMAb-TNFR fusion protein is named AGT-110. The HIRMAb part of the HIRMAb-TNFR fusion protein acts as a molecular Trojan horse to ferry the fused decoy receptor across the BBB via receptor-mediated transport on the endogenous BBB insulin receptor. In this phase II SBIR project, the methodology for manufacturing of the HIRMAb-TNFR fusion protein at a large scale suitable for production of clinical trial lots of study drug will be developed. The stably transfected host cell will be cultured in a 50L bioreactor, and the fusion protein will be purified with 1liter columns or protein A affinity chromatography, cation exchange chromatography, and anion exchange chromatography. The identity, purity, potency, safety, and impurities of the drug product will be evaluated by gt15 test methods. The pharmacokinetics,immune response, safety pharmacology, and toxicology will be tested for the first time in adult Rhesus monkeys in an initial dose-ranging study.

Identifying at risk individuals and maintaining adequate fluid balance is  an essential component of health care in aging population. Currently,there is no effective tool available to measure hydration status and distinguish those at risk. The reliability and validity o current hydration assessment methods and criteria such as thirst, skin turgor, blood pressure, pulse, urine output and specificgravity, MRI, dilution methods and bioimpedance, are limited; the methods are inaccurate or expensive. Given that dehydration is both preventable and reversible, the need for an easy-to-perform method for the detection of water imbalance is of the utmost clinical importance. The goal of this project is to develop and commercialize an inexpensive and easy-to-use device that monitors changes in hydration status and predicts at risk in home-bound and institutionalized elderly. The Hydration Monitor (HM) whichis being developed under this grant can objectively quantify changes in the body water content and hydration status. The proprietary patented method implemented in the device is based on the experimental fact that ultrasound velocity through soft tissue isa linear function of the tissue water content. Because muscle provides the largest body reservoir for water, the assessment of water imbalance is conducted by measuring speed of ultrasound in muscle. In the course of Phase I studies we designed and assembled HM  -prototype, extensively tested it on tissue phantoms and excised animal tissues. Based on the results of these tests we designed the HM  -prototype for Phase II clinical studies. The aims of this Phase II SBIR project include building and bench-testing eight HM  -prototypes and providing the prototypes to three sites for clinical validation. The objectives of human studies include: to determine normal daily variation of the individual hydration level in longitudinal study on elderly in assisted living facility; to assess  range between individual hydration baselines for elderly in a normal physiologically hydrated state; to establish the ability of the HM to assess initial and corrected hydration status in a population of elderly patients admitted tothe hospital for hypernatremic dehydration; to determine euhydration and dehydration thresholds when employing ultrasound velocity measures in parallel with conventional tests and to detect changes in the hydration status of young healthy adults before and after undergoing 3% acute dehydration; and to test the hypothesis that body dehydration is a generalized physiological process equally affected all body muscles by comparing the data obtained on calf and biceps muscles. The Phase II activities will culminate with developing a pre-production HM prototype and preparing comprehensive engineering documentation.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This grant application is by Ion Channel Innovations, LLC, (ICI) a company dedicated to the development of naked DNA transfer to treat the unmet needs of people with common smooth muscle diseases that negatively impactthe quality of life of millions. Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB), characterized by symptoms of urinary urgency, frequency, and incontinence, is one of such diseases. OAB affects 17% of the adult US population and there are no satisfactory medical therapies available. ICI&#039;s therapy uses the increased expression of the hSlo gene splice variant, called hMaxiK, which codes for the pore forming subunit of the large conductance potassium channel. Prior studies by ICI have shown that hMaxiK improves urogenital pathophysiology in rodent and nonhuman primate models of aging, diabetes and atherosclerosis. ICI views its method of targeted, localized administration, safety, and 6-month duration of action as strengths of hMaxiK therapy contributing to its potential asa major advance in medicine. The current proposal will test the hypothesis that localized bladder wall injection of hMaxiK is a safe and efficacious treatment of OAB. Urodynamic studies in previous clinical trials using bladder lumen instillation of hMaxiKshowed no transfer-related serious adverse events and yielded evidence that the mean number of detrusor overactivity contractions (a presumptive clinical correlate of urinary urgency and incontinence) was diminished up to 24 weeks after transfer (Plt0.0508). Indeed the 5000 mcg treated group showed a 70% reduction of contractions from baseline compared to placebo (Plt0.0217); although this did not result in improved continence. However, direct bladder wall injection of hMaxiK may be more efficacious with asimilar safety profile. The current grant proposal will test this hypothesis in two phases. In Phase I, in collaboration with the Consortium PI Dr. Kelvin Davies, ICI will conduct studies in an animal model to optimize the method of direct injection of the plasmid to ensure the safe and efficient expression of hMaxiK by a sufficient number of bladder smooth muscle cells to result in significant physiological effects on bladder function. In Phase II, in collaboration with the consortium CE3, Inc. ICI will conduct a sequential double blind placebo controlled clinical trial in women with moderate to severe OAB to evaluate the safety and efficacy of direct injection of hMaxiK into the bladder wall. ICI has already identified potential investors from both industry and the private equity community. However, they require further efficacy data before additional investments are made. Upon completion of the proposed Phase II safety and efficacy trial, ICI will be positioned to partner with investors to bring its innovative technology to market.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   This proposal is designed to demonstrate that naked DNA-based gene transfer with the direct bladder wall injection of the gene encoding the calcium sensitive potassium channel known as hMaxiK can correct in humans, as has been shown to do in animal models, the syndrome of urinary urgency, frequency and incontinence known as overactive bladder or OAB. The study, with a placebo control, in a small number of participants is designed to show both safety and efficacy.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The SHARE Program: Supporting Health, Activities, Resources, and Education is a seven-session early stage intervention for care dyads (the IWD and a family CG) that takes advantage of a time when the IWD can still discuss the diagnosis and plan for the future. Communication and planning offers preventive short- and long-term benefits:1 1) IWDs feel reassured that the CG will look after their best interests later in the disease; 2) CGs feel empowered to obtain resources that prevent the accumulation of stress; and 3) The erosion of health and well-being over both the short- and long-term is prevented.1,2,4 The SHARE Program is one of few evidence-based interventions that takes a dyadic approach to responding to the needs of early-stage families.  Product. The proposed Fast Track project involves the development of a training curriculum package and iPad app to train care professionals to implement the SHARE Program. The package will consist of an innovative multi-module web-based learning platform to learn skills and iPad technology to be used with SHARE participants. SHARE provides education, teaches communication, and helps care dyads create a future care plan that includes the points of view of both the IWD and CG. It assists dyads in the early stages, before stressors leave CGs exhausted and IWDs become unable to express their own preferences. Our prior work found: 1) early-stage IWDs often welcome and have the intellectual competence and willingness to participate actively in discussions about their disease and plan for the future, and 2) CGs have a better understanding of care preferences and appropriate services and strategies for long term care.1-3  Phase I Objectives are to take knowledge gained from our previous controlled experimental settings and apply it to development of the technologies. Specific Aims are to: 1) Develop content to be included in the technologies ;2) Produce 2-3 prototype training modules and a prototype app, and 3) Determine the feasibility and acceptability of the training package based on evaluations from: 18 care dyads who have already gone through SHARE, 6 current SHARE counselors, and 36 dementia care professionals representing a broad range of existing community-based and health care organizations who are new to SHARE (total n=60).  Phase II Objectives are to complete the development of the SHARE training package and conduct a fidelity trial to test its effectiveness on new SHARE counselors. Specific Aims are to: 1) Produce a complete 10-module SHARE web course and develop a website that provides support and supervision materials; 2) Complete development of the app that will contain key session tools for counselors to use during sessions, and 3) Conduct a full scale fidelity trial with 20 new SHARE counselors and 60 early-stage dyads (total n=80).  Commercialization Potential: There is a market need for programs that train care professionals to serve a fast growing number of early-stage IWDs and their family. The SHARE Program can be implementedwithin existing community-based programs that increase the capability of these programs to serve this population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   Individuals who are in the early stages of dementia (IWD) and their family caregivers (CG) benefit from being active participants in the planning of the IWD&#039;s future care. An IWD&#039;s en- gagement allows them to maintain strong bonds to the family and enables CGs to understand the IWD&#039;s values, preferences, and wishes when the IWD is still able to communicate these wishes. The SHARE Program is an evidence-based multi-session program for care dyads (the IWD and CG) who are dealing with early-stage dementia. In research trials, the program has been shown to improve short term knowledge and communication and long termmood and well-being.1,2,4 The current application is to develop a SHARE Training Package consisting of a training manual, a web-based course, and apps to train care professionals who serve early- stage dyads. The value of the training package is in increasing the capability of community- based aging services organizations to provide a high level of service to families who are just entering the market for current and long term care.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective is to develop and clinically assess Kinesia-D , a wireless, ergonomic, and portable movement disorder technology designed for continuous monitoring of levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) and medication statein Parkinson&#039;s disease (PD). Motor symptoms can be ameliorated pharmacologically with the dopamine precursor, levodopa. While significant strides have been made in the management of PD, balancing motor improvement with treatment dyskinesia side effects (brief, rapid, irregular movements) associated with chronic use poses a key therapeutic challenge. Approximately 30 percent of patients exhibit LID within 5 years of treatment and 59-100 percent by 10 years. LID significantly impact quality of life through exhaustion and fatigue, social isolation, and depression. Healthcare costs are substantially greater with increased LID severity. Yearly costs increase over  16,000 when comparing a PD patient with severe LID to one with no side effects. The value of this application is tremendous in that existing clinical tools for capturing he levodopa dose response are completely reliant on in-clinic testing and/or the patient&#039;s subjective assessment of and ability to distinguish between PD tremor, dyskinesias, and voluntary movements throughout the day. Kinesia-D will not only objectively and accurately rate dyskinesia and tremor severity on a continuous scale independent of each other and activities of daily living, but also generate reports on levodopa response medication states: OFF (no PD symptomatic improvement), ON (PD symptomatic improvement), and ON with dyskinesia. This Phase II application will develop a system which can continuously rate dyskinesia severity throughout the day independent of activities of daily living while also allowing comfortable wear with minimal burden. This will be seamlessly integrated with existing tremor scoring algorithms for simultaneous assessment of PD symptom improvement and LID occurrence. These scores will be used to determine dyskinesia severity and medication state. Reports will automatically be generated and transmitted to the clinician via a broadband-enabled tablet computer residing in the patient&#039;s home to guide titration of levodopa treatment. A reliable method for detectingand monitoring the severity of dyskinesia in an ambulatory setting would be highly valuable both for aiding clinicians in optimizing patient medication regimens and the massive pharmaceutical industry for developing new PD drugs and for post market surveillance. Kinesia-D will first be validated in a home study by showing high correlations to the patient dyskinesia diary and then be used to compare therapy titration patient outcome using the Kinesia-D system versus traditional methods. Clinical outcome measures will be based on improved quality of life and motor scores and increased hours in the ON medication state without dyskinesia. We hypothesize that the commercial Kinesia-D system will continuously quantify dyskinesia severity during activities of dailyliving, improve patient outcomes by balancing PD motor symptom and dyskinesia side effect response to levodopa, and reduce healthcare and clinical drug trial costs.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Levodopa is the most widely used medication to treat Parkinson&#039;s disease; however, levodopa-induced dyskinesia (brief, rapid, irregular movements) is the primary adverse effect associated with chronic use, occurs in approximately 30 percent of patients within 5 years of treatment and59-100 percent by 10 years, significantly impacts quality of life, and can increase healthcare costs by over  16,000 per year for patients that exhibit levodopa- induced dyskinesia. Existing tools available to clinicians for assessing dyskinesia severity in response to adjustments in PD medication are significantly limited in that 1) the pattern and severity of dyskinesia vary substantially over time and during different activities, 2)  home dyskinesia diaries rely entirely on the patient&#039;s subjective perception of their medication state and their level of compliance, and 3) patients may underestimate the severity of the dyskinesia and have difficulty distinguishing between dyskinesia, tremor, and normal voluntary movements. Kinesia-D  will address these limitations through the development of a wireless, ergonomic, and portable movement disorder technology designed for continuous monitoring of levodopa induced dyskinesia and medication state in Parkinson&#039;s disease independent of voluntary movement associatedwith activities of daily living as well as a cloud-based telemedicine interface for remote therapy titration for the geographically disparate PD population.",

We will conduct all tasks required to generate the Pharmacology/Toxicology and Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) information required for IND submission, and outline the early clinical study designs with FDA. Development will be Go/No Go Decision and milestone driven to efficiently (resource, cost and time) evaluate the drug product in biologically relevant models for activity and safety, meet FDA and ICH requirements and manufacture drug and product suitable for early clinical trial material. We will address compliance issues experienced in recent HIV microbicidetrials by developing three prototypes and evaluating their consumer acceptability, safety and efficacy; then selecting the superior product form for final preclinical studies. Within ten months of grant approval, prototype formulations of three different vaginal formulations (aqueous gel, ovule and thin film) will be quickly prepared using modified recipes from industry, analytically tested and evaluated in four non GLP models: 10-day Rabbit Vaginal Irritation (RVI), cutting edge in vitro models for safety,HSV-prevention in the mouse model and contraception in the rabbit (funded by NICHD) providing us with data to select one product form for further development. Utilizing the 1kg of PPCM manufactured by Regis Chemical in the Phase I SBIR, one dosage form will be selected, incorporating consumer feedback using vehicle control products, to be taken forward by a commercial contract manufacturer through thorough development of the product formula, process and package. The CMO will produce product for use in INDenabling GLP toxicology and product stability studies. Reasonably priced quotes were obtained from the most reputable CMOs in the field. From the initiation of Phase II SBIR grant approval, a pre-IND meeting briefing document will be compiled and issued. The document will be accompanied with IND development questions addressed to FDA for response. These will include questions to finalize the Pharmacology/Toxicology study protocols and Phase I-II clinical study designs. In parallel to that, preparations willbe made for manufacturing and quality control testing of a 1kg GMP batch of drug substance (PPCM) for clinical use. The first item will be to implement the Quality Agreement (commitments by both parties to satisfy quality and regulatory requirements); manufacturing controls; and qualified/validated analytical test methods required to release and monitor the stability of the GMP lot of drug substance suitable for early clinical trials.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal ofthis Phase II SBIR is to further develop Polyphenylenecarboxymethylene (PPCM) as a dual indication vaginal contraceptive microbicide. PPCM, a novel drug polymer, has received extensive preclinical evaluation by several major laboratories and is considereda very promising candidate for both contraception and sexually transmitted infections (STI) protection. Statistics from CDC inform us that there are 19 million new STI in the USA each year and 16.2% of adults have genital herpes (HSV). Moreover, 49% of all pregnancies are unplanned. As a microbicide, PPCM has significant advantages in safety and effectiveness compared to polyanion microbicides and in combination with a reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI) promises to offer significant STI protection. As acontraceptive, PPCM has a dual mechanism for sperm inactivation. During this grant we will also address the problem of consumer acceptance of vaginal products by seeking early consumer input on product aesthetics. This grant will provide funding necessaryto select an aesthetically acceptable, safe and effective product form and complete all preclinical studies required by the FDA for submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application subsequent to human clinical testing.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of radiological/nuclear medical countermeasures to treat Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) is a high priority research area for NIAID. Bone marrow is one of the most sensitive tissues to radiation damage and impaired hematopoiesis is one of the first clinical signs of excessive radiation exposure, often resulting i death. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G- CSF) is a 19 kDa protein that stimulates bone marrow cells to divide and differentiate into neutrophils. Recombinant human G-CSF is widely used to treat chemotherapy-related neutropenia in cancer patients, and recent studies indicate that it improves overall survival in animal models of ARS, although the drug requires daily administration, which may notbe possible following a radiological/nuclear disaster. G-CSF has a short half-life in humans, which necessitates daily dosing for two weeks or more, and may not optimize therapeutic benefits of the protein for patients. Long-acting G-CSF analogs that do not require frequent dosing could provide significant treatment advantages in a nuclear emergency setting, where healthcare provider time will be at a premium and daily dosing of patients may not be possible. We developed a rationally designed, long-acting G-CSF analog through site-specific chemical modification of the protein with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Our long-acting PEG-G-CSF analog has a 10-fold half-life than unmodified G-CSF and is significantly more effective than G-CSF at accelerating neutrophilrecovery in chemotherapy-treated rats. Studies performed during the Phase I SBIR grant demonstrated the utility of this novel, long-acting G-CSF analog for improving survival in a well characterized mouse ARS model. In contrast to G-CSF, our long-acting G-CSF analog required only a single administration to be effective. Notably, 100% (20/20 mice) of lethally irradiated mice treated 24h post-irradiation with a single administration of this long-acting G-CSF analog survived 30 days compared to a mortality rate of 50 % (10/20 mice) for vehicle-treated mice. Our long-acting G-CSF analog also improved survival compared to placebo following multiple injections into irradiated mice. Irradiated mice treated with our long-acting G-CSF analog showed accelerated recovery of neutrophils, red blood cells and platelets compared to vehicle-treated mice, indicating that the protein positively affected recovery of multiple blood cell types. The Phase II grant has three major goals. First, we will perform additional studies inirradiated mice to determine how long after irradiation the drug can be administered and still improve survival. Second, we will determine whether the protein improves survival of lethally-irradiated non-human primates, which is the gold standard ARS model adopted by the FDA. Third, we will measure the safety profile and pharmacokinetic properties of the protein in IND-enabling, GLP animal pharmacology and toxicology studies in order to identify safe doses of the drug for testing in humans. Our novel G- CSF analog will provide physicians with an effective and convenient therapy for the treatment of all of the major hematopoietic complications of ARS, and improve survival of subjects exposed to high radiation doses as a result of a radiological/nuclear disaster. The fact that the drug requires only a single  administration for effectiveness represents a significance advance in the treatment of ARS and will optimize healthcare provider time in a radiological/nuclear emergency setting, where patient numbers areexpected to overwhelm available healthcare resources. The drug should prove useful for treating other diseases for which G-CSF is used as a therapy, such as neutropenia resulting from chemotherapy use in cancer patients.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCEPUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of radiological/nuclear medical countermeasures to treat Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) is a high priority research area for NIAID. The Phase I SBIR studies showed that our long- acting G-CSF analog significantly improved survival of lethally irradiated mice compared to a placebo. Unlike G-CSF, which is administered daily for 10-20 days following radiation exposure, our long-acting G-CSF analog was effective when administered only once. Improved survival of irradiated mice treated with our long-acting G-CSF analog correlated with accelerated recovery of multiple blood cell types, including neutrophils, red blood cells and platelets, which is a novel finding. The primary goals of this Phase II SBIR grant are (1) to demonstrate the feasibility of using this novel, long-acting  G-CSF analog to improve survival in a non-human primate ARS model; (2) determine how long after radiation exposure the drug can be administered and still provide a survival benefit; and (3)  completeIND-enabling animal toxicology studies required by the FDA to begin testing the protein in human safety studies and pivotal animal ARS studies. Our long- acting G-CSF analog will prove useful for improving survival of humans exposed to an otherwise lethaldose of radiation as a result of a radiological/nuclear disaster. Th",

Develop a prototype of a rapid portable instrument for detecting and measuring the amount of Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIV&#039;s) in samples of patient blood, particularly in low resource settings. 2. Carry out a pilot study to establish the effectiveness and comparative performance of the instrument against an established reference system. The aim is to provide clinicians tools to diagnose and monitor HIV that exist in resource abundant settings but are not readily available in low resource settings. In  particular, the instrument system will provide clinicians with detection methods that could be helpful in identifyingacute HIV-1, early diagnosis of infection in pregnant women and infants, monitoring viral load following treatment and monitoring for the emergence of antiretroviral resistance. Viral load monitoring of patients on antiretrovirals is a good example of thedifference in treatment between resource abundant and low resource settings. Routinely done in the former because of the threat to patients and community should they develop a drug resistant strain of HIV, millions of recipients of antiretroviral therapycurrently are not being monitored de to its cost and complexity. These aims are congruent with those parts of the mission of DAIDS  to bring an end to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by ... supporting the advancement of therapies for HIV infection and its complications....  This project will achieve its stated goals by completing the design of a compact, portable system based on the ultra-fast Thermal Gradient real-time PCR and nucleic acid sample preparation technologies developed in the original R44 089389 grant. They will be combined in an integrated test cartridge capable of carrying out a viral load test in 33 minutes and a multi-color fluorescent imaging system will be developed to measure the real time PCR output simultaneously. Finally, the performance of thesystem (instrument, cartridge and assay) will be validated, first in internal tests using prepared blood samples and then a significant pilot study.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pneumonia can be caused by a variety of pathogenic organisms including bacteria, fungi and viruses and is the leading cause of death worldwide. Even in developed countries, pneumonia continues to be the leading cause of death from infection and a serious complication for patients being treated for other diseases. The threat of lung infections is elevated when there is a decreased level of host resistance (e.g. immunocompromised cancer patients) and when there is an increased level of pathogen exposure (e.g. pandemics, bioterror, and biowarfare). Acute leukemia patients are currently some of the most at-risk patients, as they are faced with significant immunocompromise resulting from their cancer treatments. Many times infectious complications prevent the full cancer treatment plan from being completed. As a result, each year an estimated 44,700 leukemia patients spend more than one-half billion dollars on a range of treatments in an effort to prevent pneumonia. Despite this expenditure, pneumonia continues to occur in 15-20% of acute leukemia patients. Pulmotect&#039;s Solution: Pulmotect has identified and is developing a novel, proprietary technology to address the risks of inhaled microbes. Our therapeutic (PUL-042) is a combination of two Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist ligands that stimulate the lung&#039;s own innate defense mechanisms to create a broad protection against invading pathogens thereby reducing and preventing infection. Supported in part by a successful Phase I SBIR, both in vitro and in vivo preclinical proof-of-concept experiments have been completed to validate this technology and further advance it to the clinic. It is in the most at-risk cancer patients where clinical proof-of- concept can be captured and support development for additional patient populations (transplant, ICU, bioterror, pandemic). The focus of this proposal is to accomplish key milestones that will advance this technology further towards commercialization and bridge to funding already securedfor Phase I and Phase II clinical trials. The project is organized into four Specific Aims that address the needed data, drug manufacturing, and approvals to bridge this technology to the clinic.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:Pulmotect, Inc is developing novel therapeutics that stimulate the innate immune system to protect against infectious diseases, even in cases of severely compromised immunity.

The goal is for the Ag/Ab combo system to deliver the performance of laboratory based,4th generation antigen/antibody clinical analyzers, in a POC platform with cost and workflow of the widely used HIV rapid tests. Phase I research and development met or exceeded stated technical milestones. In particular, the MBio HIV antigen and antibodyassays provided a combined performance that significantly exceeds performance FDA approved rapid tests, and provides near equivalence to much more complicated laboratory based tests. HIV infection remains a major public health crisis both in the United States and worldwide. There is increasing awareness that acutely infected individuals disproportionately contribute to disease spread. Yet these individuals remain the most difficult to identify, as infectivity is highest prior to the appearance of the HIV antibodies that serve as the basis for serological diagnostics. There are currently no FDA-approved point-of-care (POC) tests that directly target HIV viral antigens. An HIV-1 antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) combination assay - the so-called  4th generation  immunoassay - in an inexpensive, simple to use, POC format would fundamentally improve HIV-1 screening efforts in the United States and worldwide. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) Combine the Phase I p24 antigen detection assay with the MBio multiplexed serology assay cartridge, addressing issues of final monoclonal antibody (mAb) pair selection, HIV-1 Ag and HIV-2 Ag selection, reagent conjugations, cross-reactivity, and minimization of assay steps and complexity. (2) Modify the MBio Cartridge, Rack, Reader, and Software to deliver an automated HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab combo result, and incorporate heat stable assay reagents into the MQ cartridge. The Aim 2 milestone is a portable, integrated system delivered to clinical collaborators that meets FDA CLIA waiver guidance requirements. (3) Validate system using well characterized early HIV infection specimens including a panel of 200 HIV positive specimens comprised of 20 acute infection samples, early seroconversion, and seropositive samples. 200 HIV-negative samples will be used for specificity testing. (4) Place systems in an intended use setting and capture operational and usability feedback in advance of design lock, and to use this site to generate a preliminary dataset on capillary whole blood samples.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad long-term goal of this research is to reduce morbidity due to arthritis by developing long-lasting injectable intra-articular drug delivery systems. Intra-articular steroids have been a mainstay of treatment for arthritis for more than 50 years. However, for many patients, multiple steroid injections are necessary. We have developed a series of steroid delivery systems that deliver steroid at therapeutic levels in the eye for as long as 3 years from a single implantation. We believe that the development of an injectable intra-articular sustained release steroid delivery formulation that releases drug over a  prolonged period is readily achievable, and that this formulation will become a useful tool in the treatment of arthritis. We achieved the specific aims of Phase I of this proposal which were to formulate sustained- release suspensions for an intra-articular steroid, to test the in vitro releae characteristics of these formulations, and to test the in vivo pharmacokinetics and safety of the formulations in sheep. The specific aims of this Phase II proposal are to confirm efficacy in an animal model of synovial inflammatory disease; to determine the minimum dose required using a dose ranging efficacy study; tomanufacture a lead formulation under sufficient Good Manufacturing Procedures (GMP) to permit Phase 1 clinical studies under an Investigational New Drug (IND) Exemption; and to contract pre-clinical GLP animal studies in sheep to support the IND. The milestone for the successful completion of Phase II work is the demonstration of efficacy in the rat model and safety of our target dose in sheep. In Phase IIb of this grant we wil complete necessary pre- clinical studies and submit an IND to the FDA. We have experience in all aspects of the drug development process from laboratory expertise, to regulatory experience, to a history of partnerships with two corporate partners leading to two NDAs. Because the technology is sound, the preliminary data are supportive, the development strategy is straightforward, and because we have done this before, we are confident that the probability of success is high. We believe that the resulting product can compete effectively in the niche market currently occupied by the viscosupplements.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: For more than 50 years intra-articular injection of steroids has been a mainstay of the treatment of arthritis. We propose to develop a formulation of a steroid that will be more effective, and require fewer injections at less frequent intervals. We&#039;ve demonstrated in Phase 1 of this project that sustained levels are maintained in animal models compared to existing formulations. Successful completion of this work will lead to the development of new treatments for large numbers of patients.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The distal radius is one of the most common sites of bone fracture and is the most common fracture site in the upper extremity, accounting for approximately 10% of all fractures in adults. Approximately 25% of patients(~80,000/year) require surgery to correctly repair this bone, and current practice requires the surgeon to disrupt  the soft tissues surrounding the joint to expose the bone for placement of hardware to stabilize the fracture. Thus, improved joint stability is achieved by sacrificing the integrity of an extensie tendon, ligament and neuromuscular network that is needed for proper wrist function. EndoOrthopaedic&#039;s core technology is a universal system of trans-cortical, micro-adjustable bone implants (TABI)for intramedullary fixation that can be assembled by the surgeon entirely within a fracture to restore the shape of the articulating surfaces. Adaptation of our TABI device for intramedullary fracture fixation of the distal radius would provide orthopaedicsurgeons with a  valuable option in the treatment of distal radial fractures. The device is designed to be deployed during a minimally invasive surgery, thereby reducing the cost of each surgery and minimizing the risk associated with soft tissue damage during the procedure. Also, since the device is completely intramedullary, it will not interfere with the soft tissues after the fracture has heale, which will substantially reduce the need for revision surgeries. For these reasons, the TABI device will lead to an overall reduction in the costs associated with treatment of distal radial fractures. In Phase I of this project, we demonstrated that our device was sufficient to resist interfragmentary strains in distal radial fractures during habitual loading and could prevent re-fracture during periodic overloading. During Phase II, our overall objective is to evaluate the mechanical performance of specific TABI device features that are designed to enable an efficient implantation procedure. We will thus validate the number of surgical steps required to implant the TABI device with the following specific aims: (1) to measure the implantation force of the intramedullary pins to verify sufficient haptic feedback for intuitive deployment by the surgeon; (2) to validate the strength of intramedullary pin attachment to a central hub, and (3) to  demonstrate the surgical efficiency and mechanical performance of the TABI device. At the conclusion of our Phase II study, we will have validated the mechanical properties andsurgical implantation procedure for the EndoOrthopaedics TABI device. As we conclude this project, we will translate our study results into regulatory documents that we will use when seeking FDA approval to market our TABI fixation technology.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low back and neck pain are two of the most common medical problems. In a recent study, 26.4% of individuals had an episode of severe low back pain and 13.8% severe neck pain in the preceding 3 months. Moreover, low backor neck pain is the major complaint in 3% of all office visits to primary care physicians (PCPS), and 5% of all healthcare visits overall. Although many patients suffer from musculoskeletal complaints due to deconditioning, a large fraction has nerve rootcompression (radiculopathy) requiring different treatment paradigms. Discriminating between these two on history and examination alone is challenging. Many of these patients undergo imaging of the spine with MRI and subspecialist referral, incurring additional costs. Thus, a diagnostic tool for PCPs could improve care and reduce costs. One technology that may help physicians correctly diagnose the cause of back or neck pain is electrical impedance myography (EIM). Like needle electromyography (EMG), EIM can give assessment of muscle health in both limbs and paraspinal musculature. Unlike EMG, however, EIM is very fast to perform, requires limited training, and is non-invasive, painless, and  quantitative. Moreover, unlike EMG, it can also provide data on the degree of deconditioning affecting a given muscle. For these reasons, and previously published data, we hypothesize that EIM will aid physicians in the initial classification of low back or neck pain as radiculopathic or  musculoskeletal in nature. We believe this will result in reduced overall costs and improved outcomes since patients will receive the right therapy sooner. Convergence Medical Devices, Inc. (CMD) has as its primary focus development of EIM technology. Using Phase 1 SBIR and additional funds we have developed an advanced EIM prototype and shown its ability to distinguish between healthy and diseased muscle. In this Phase 2 application, we propose to refine EIM for office-based assessment of back and neck pain, with the goal of improving patient outcomes and reducing costs. We will achieve this through the following aims: (1) We will collect EIM data from multiple muscles on 120 healthy subjects (including 50 completed prior to grant initiation), 60 with expert-defined radiculopathy and 60 with musculoskeletal back pain in order to develop algorithms to aid physicians in diagnosing neck/back pain; (2) We will refine our EIM software to facilitate interpretation by primary care physicians and their staff; and (3) we will tst ease-of-use, comfort, and preliminarily assess EIM&#039;s ability to improve a physician&#039;s ability to diagnose back and neck pain in a clinical setting. With the completion of these aims, CMD, will be well-poised submit a 510k application to FDA and pursue Phase 3 funding for commercialization.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Low-back and neck pain are two of the most common medical problems. Despite high prevalence, evaluation of these two conditions remains slow and expensive.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II SBIR builds upon the activities of R43-AT006634,  VerOFy: A New Tool to Improve Productivity and Reduce Costs for Stress Research . Technology for an integrated sample collection system was developed whichnon-invasively measures salivary cortisol levels within minutes of sample collection; this is a substantial improvement over traditional immunoassays in which cortisol concentrations are not returned for days to months. This innovation is expected to havea large impact on stress research as cortisol changes frequently and critical information about stress is lost during this measurement specific time-delay. VerOFy(R) is also innovative as it decreases costs compared to traditional protocols which requiresamples to be assayed regardless of their utility. Thus, real-time point-of-care cortisol measurement using the VerOFy(R) technology represents a substantial productivity improvement and major cost reduction for stress research. Phase I activities were accomplished well within the allotted Project timeframe. Furthermore, the technology was advanced substantially beyond initial goals by testing the system with pilot samples from human participants and developing the technology into a fully quantitative format capable of measuring salivary cortisol in real-time in conjunction with a complementary innovation for signal line analysis, known as the Lightbox Image Analysis Module (LIAMTM) portable reader. These added activities were pursued in order to comprehensively respond to Phase I critiques. Proposed Phase II activities extend these activities substantially further by (1 finalizing quality control of the VerOFy(R) device (e.g., determining recovery, sensitivity, precision, etc); (2) validating the LIAMTM reader for real-time quantitative cortisol results by streamlining the reader process and exploring user-friendly technological advances with a smartphone application; and (3) validating both the VerOFy(R) and LIAMTM with human participants in an established setting as well as six beta-sites strategically selected to represen each region of the US and cover a range of expertise for product evaluation. In parallel to these research activities, a detailed commercialization plan is described in which this technology can be feasibly marketed, building from the prior experience of the investigative team and advisory board of researchers and relevant experts. By the end of phase II, the goal is to have a fully operational VerOFy(R) device to allow stress researchers to individualize protocols for each individual and rapidly determine stress responsively via salivary cortisol. Future directions illustrate plans to move the technology forward beyond the Research Use Only application, as the team has accomplished with prior technology. VerOFy(R) opens up new, unexplored possibilities within the stress field. The impact of this technology can be tremendous as the annual economic toll of stress-related illnesses and health problems exceed  200 billion in the US and the NIH funded  83 million of stress-related research which utilizes salivary cortisol already in 2012 alone.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  NIH funds millions of stress-related research which relies on the biomarker cortisol as an indicator of stress responsivity and health risk. Current cortisol detection methods makes it impossible to individualize experimental protocols or provide feedback to the participant or researcher as cortisol assay results are not obtained for days to months. The present proposal uses an innovative salivary diagnostic device and reader to quantitatively measure salivary cortisol in real-time and lower stress-related research costs.",

During pre-clinical studies DM-CHOC-PEN produced complete remissions with long term survival vs. intracranially (IC) implanted human gliomas and breast cancer xenograft and melanoma murine models in mice. In the recentlycompleted Phase I clinical trial (that included patients with CNS involvement), the drug proved to be non-neurotoxic. Several patients - sarcoma, GBM, breast cancer (CNS lesions) have demonstrated PFS gt 6-18 mos. and one (sarcoma spread to the sine) has NED x 12+ mos. Renal, pulmonary and hematological side effects were not observed; dose limiting effect was hepatic - elevated bilirubin. Complete pharmacokinetic studies/parameters are reviewed. The clinical product is an emulsion with stability under refrigeration - 1.5 yrs. The package has been reviewed by IRBs and FDA - IND 68,876. The aims will include: 1) Initiate a Phase II trial with DM-CHOC-PEN administered IV to patients with advanced or recurrent cancer (+/- CNS involvement acceptable) and verify that the proposed dose is acceptable, monitor pharmacodynamics and toxicities. 2) Monitor tumor responses to DM-CHOC-PEN per imaging/examinations using RECIST guidelines. 3) Electronically store/analyze clinical data for toxicity, responses and tumor-organrelationships. 4) Continue to bank tumor tissue from pre- and post-treated patients when possible and assay tumor - drug/metabolite content and bio-markers; store blood samples for future studies, i.e. Caris Target Now, etc. 5) Prepare a FDA presentation for subsequent Phase II (binary drug) or III (single drug) trials with DM-CHOC-PEN in patients with specific tumor types.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to develop a new molecular entity with a novel mechanism of action for targeting and eliminating glioblastoma multiforme (GBM, high grade glioma), a deadly and invasive brain tumor with no effective treatment. Of the 12,000 patients expected to be diagnosed with GBM this year, most will succumb within a year. There is an urgent demand for an efficacious anti-glioma drug. We are developing a new class of therapeutic proteolipid nanovesicle that can target anddestroy glioma tumors. Composed of the small lysosomal sphingolipid activator protein saposin C (SapC, 80 aa) and the phospholipid dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS); the stable 200 nm SapC-DOPS nanovesicles (clinical formulation is called BXQ-350) have unusually high affinity for phosphatidylserine-enriched membrane surfaces that occur widely in many types of tumor cells and tumor neovasculature. Consistent with sphingolipid activator function, BXQ-350 appear to selectively induce tumor cells to undergo ceramide-mediated cell death, apparently sparing non-tumor cells. In Phase I of this proposal, we demonstrated the feasibility of using SapC-DOPS to target and kill intracranial gliomas. Intravenous administration of SapC-DOPS in mice with orthotopically implanted gliomas resulted in dose-dependent improvement in survival. In Phase II, a GMP compliant formulation of SapC-DOPS (i.e., BXQ-350) was developed, and potency was confirmed in additional orthotopic preclinical GBM models. IND-enabling studies are in progress. Pharmacokinetics and toxicity studies thus far indicate favorable distribution and safety profiles in rodent and non-rodent studies. In this three-year Phase IIB proposal, the key objectives are to file the IND for BXQ-350, complete a Phase 1 clinical trial, and prepare for Phase 2. Recognizing that gliomas are highly heterogeneous, another objective is to identify and link biochemical factors (e.g., cell surface PS levels; genetic markers) to the degree of BXQ-350 tumoricidal activity. Understanding of these factors will improve dosing strategies and reduce the risk of variable therapeutic response. Specific Aims are: (1) Scale- up GMP production of BXQ-350; (2) File the IND and complete the Phase 1 clinical trial; and (3) Correlate susceptibility to killing by BXQ-350 with molecular and cellular characteristics of glioma cell lins (from a tumor bank). BXQ-350 offers an innovative and potentially powerful approach for slowing tumor growth and eliminating deep-seated brain tumors. Ultimately, we willprogress this technology for treating other tumors and for developing tumor-targeted imaging diagnostics.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are developing a new treatment for glioblastoma multiforme, a deadly form of brain tumor that kills over 90% of afflicted patients. Current treatment methods, consisting of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, have not been effective in significantly reducing morbidity. Our strategy involves using new proteolipid nanovesicles that can penetrate the tumors and selectively destroy malignant cells without harming normal cells. Success in clinical trials will enable us to offer an effective new strategy to treat patients with  aggressive brain tumors.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Rogers Sciences&#039; mission is to provide effective, low morbidity and cost-effective cancer care through the development and commercialization of therapeutic systems based on Continuous Low Irradiance Photodynamic Therapy (CLIPT). The initial application and proof-of-principle of our technology is the treatment of chest wall progression of breast cancer.  While conventional photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been in development and clinical use for over 30 years, it has not gained widespread adoption for a number of reasons including morbidities associated with the therapy, the complexity of administering the required photoactivation energy and the lack of tumor-specificity of the therapy. Our research has addressed these limitations with a new, low irradiance dosimetry approach and novel therapy delivery devices. Low irradiance therapy in human subjects has demonstrated highly specific tumor kill with minimal morbidity and few of the side effects associated with conventional PDT. These promising clinical results are changing thought-leader opinion regarding PDT and have spurred interest from the radiation oncology, medical and surgical oncology communities.  Rogers Sciences has developed a 2nd generation prototype CLIPT Systemthat has successfully been used in human clinical trial with highly promising results. In the original CLIPT studies patients were given a 24 hour treatment of CLIPT at the maximum tolerated dose (J/cm2). With additional human and animal CLIPT studies it has been seen that patient outcomes have been improved by either lowering the dose (J/cm2) or reducing the therapy time while maintaining the dose rate (J/hr).  Building on the preliminary human trials,  the goals of this SBIR Phase II proposal are to refine the CLIPT System and to find the optimal CLIPT treatment dose, dose rate, and dose period. Phase II of the proposed SBIR has two specific aims. The firs aim is to develop a portable CLIPT System for future clinical studies and for commercialization as ahome based device capable of allowing patients to receive CLIPT while performing Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). The second aim is to refine the CLIPT treatment protocol using fractionated treatments commonly used in other modalities of cancer therapy thus allowing RSI to move CLIPT from an in-patient setting to an outpatient or home-based setting.  Successful completion of each specific aims will establish the technical and clinical feasibility of the Rogers Sciences CLIPT System for use in the treatment of chest wall progression of breast cancer. Phase III will involve commercial partners to move CLIPT into pivotal trials and to explore the use of CLIPT in treating additional cancer and proliferative diseases.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Post-mastectomy recurrence of breast cancer in the chest wall occurs in 5%-8% of cases, but it occurs more frequently in underserved populations and is highly stage-dependent, with incidence as high as 60% in some patient groups. Many patients have extensive disease that cannot be adequately controlled with conventional treatment and for patients that fail traditional radiation, surgery and chemotherapy, there are few therapeutic options available.

This treatment paradigm is intended to provide a meaningful treatment alternative for aggressive NHL Phase I/II clinical trials with 90Y-epratuzumab (humanized anti-CD22 IgG) and veltuzumab (humanized anti-CD20 IgG) have established the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a fractionated injection of 90Y-epratuzumab, and the optimal biological dose of veltuzumab, with both agents showing encouraging anti-tumor responses in follicular and aggressive NHL. This study first will re-evaluate the MTD for the fractionated weekly injection of 90Y-epratuzumab (previously found to be 2 x 20 mCi/m2) in a standard Phase I setting, and then proceed immediately into a Phase II trial to evaluate response and safety. The treatment regimen consists of 2 courses of veltuzumab spaced 4 weeks apart, with each course consisting of 4 weekly 120 mg/m2 of veltuzumab). 90Y-epratuzumab will be co-injected with the 3rd and 4th veltuzumab injection during the first veltuzumab course. This treatment regimen is based on preclinical data showing how a consolidation treatment with veltuzumab amplifies the treatment response of a radioconjugate treatment, but also how current anti-CD20-based radioimmunotherapy regimens may be reducing the impact of the therapeutic response by co-administered large amounts of competing anti-CD20 IgG. By substituting a 90Y-anti-CD22 radioconjugate, we can gain greater benefit from the radioconjugate and still provide the immunotherapeutic boost in response. Thus, this treatment scheme optimizes the use of both the radio- and immuno-conjugate for treating NHL. Standard pharmacokinetics and imaging studies will be performed in addition to safety and efficacy monitoring. 111In-epratuzumab imaging studies will be performed before the first veltuzumab treatment and with the first 90Y-epratuzumab injectionto determine if there are any changes in biodistribution as a result of the prior veltuzumab injections. With encouraging results from this study, the company expects to initiate a registration trial.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this Phase II SBIR, Actuated Medical, Inc. will complete the development of the  Actuated Low-Force Biopsy Tool for Versatile Bone Lesion Access with Less Trauma.  Public Health Problem: Percutaneous bone biopsy is performed to obtain tissue for specific diagnosis of bone lesions identified through imaging or clinical evaluation. A major disadvantage of the biopsy process is the force required to penetrate the cortical bone. Penetrating dense, thick cortical bone to interrogate sclerotic lesions or sample lesions contained within the intramedullary canal of long bones is particularly difficult. Another major limitation of current biopsy devices is the challenge of penetrating through cortical bone using low inclinationangles (lt 30 degrees) relative to the cortical surface, limiting the path choices available to reach the lesion. Re-seeding of tumor cells along the biopsy needle track leading to cancer recurrence is a recognized risk with primary sarcomas. In order toensure the best prognosis and preserve the option of limb-sparing resection, the clinical team must carefully plan out the approach to the lesion to ensure the needle track avoids vital structures and tissue compartments. A device is needed that allows greater flexibility in planning the path to the lesion by enabling oblique angle penetration and easier purchase onto bone surfaces with high curvature, while simultaneously allowing greater control by reducing penetration force. Phase I successfully met theSpecific Aims. Phase I demonstrated that a vibrated sharp can reduce insertion force by 60% and substantially improve bone biopsy procedures in animal and human tissue models. Reviews by practicing clinicians were extremely positive and have guided the Phase II Beta prototype design requirements. Phase II Hypothesis: The BIFOR system will enable core needle bone lesion biopsy using low inclination angles (lt30 degrees) relative to the cortical surface with 60% reduced insertion force. In addition, core needle bone biopsy performed with the BIFOR system will reduce lesion biopsy procedure time by 50% while increasing diagnostic sample yield over the standard commercial needle system. Phase II Specific Aims: 1. Final Optimization and Verification - Finalize handset, electronics, and user interface. 2. Design Validation through Cadaver Testing - Evaluate rib and femur sampling. 3. Safety and Efficacy in Animal Model - Performance data with assessment of biopsy sites for healing, and safety. 4. Pilot Human Clinical Evaluation - Clinical evaluation in image-guided lesion biopsy.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bone biopsies are used to analyze suspected tumors in bones throughout the body. A major disadvantage is the force required to insert the needle through the cortical bone to reach the target tissue, which often results in poor, crushed, or otherwise inadequate samples, clinician fatigue, and increased patient discomfort, anxiety, and healing time. Penetrating dense, thick cortical bone to interrogate sclerotic lesions in long or thn bones is particularly difficult. Sampling bone in locations with delicate tissue nearby, such as th spine or ribs, is risky. A device that reduces insertion force would lower risk for sampling near delicate tissue structures, allow more flexibility in sampling approach for the clinician, and provide the ability to sample in some locations without having to resort to an open surgery.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The most common malignancy in American women is breast cancer. Breast reconstruction for mastectomy currently involves two choices, implant or autologous tissue flap. Implant reconstruction is relatively simpler but istemporary, whereas flap  reconstruction is permanent but much more complex. We propose here a novel method for breast reconstruction by implanting a novel three dimensional biodegradable scaffold. This scaffold is designed to accommodate the patient&#039;s ownomentum and fat tissues. Over time, the scaffold would be completely resorbed, leaving the patient&#039;s autologous tissue in the form of a new breast. This new method would offer a third choice for breast reconstruction that may potentially be superior to thecurrent options. The goals of this proposal are to perform necessary pre-clinical tests on the Biobreast scaffold device to enable a pre-IDE application to the FDA for approval of initiation of a future Phase 1 human clinical trial. Our specific aims areas follows: Aim #1: To carry out bench performance tests of the scaffold. Aim #2: To complete animal and toxicity studies of the scaffold. Aim #3: To submit a pre-IDE application to the FDA.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast reconstruction for mastectomy currently involves two choices, implant or autologous tissue flap. Implant/expander reconstruction is relatively simpler but is temporary, with operative time about 1-3 hours and 1-2 day hospital stays. Complications in implant breast reconstruction are 2-3 fold higher than in breast augmentation, and the typical implant only lasts a few years. Flap reconstruction is permanent but much more complex, requiring lengthy (6-12 hours), more costly operations, 4-6 day inpatient care, and 6-8 weeks of outpatient rehabilitation. The patient then has one or more permanent large scar(s) at the donor site(s). We propose here a novel method for breast reconstruction by implanting a novel three dimensional biodegradable scaffold. This Biobreast scaffold is designed to accommodate the patient&#039;s own omentum and fat tissues. Over time, the scaffold would be completely resorbed, leaving the patient&#039;s autologous tissue in the form of a new breast. Our proposal represents a novel solution by constructing a bioabsorbable scaffold to: 1) provide a breast shape to the omental tissue, and 2) to increase volume for reconstruction by providing a vascular supply to added autologous fat derived from liposuction.  Our Biobreast scaffold offers potentiallymajor advantages to the current methods of breast reconstruction as follows: 1) Scaffold reconstruction is tissue-based without a permanent foreign body like an implant with its associated high complication and re-operation rate. 2) Operative time is several hours shorter than traditional flap reconstruction, and blood loss is significantly less, thus minimizing stress o the patient&#039;s body. 3) Postoperative monitor requirement is much less intensive than that for free flaps. 4) Hospital stay length is shorter, 1-2 days, and potentially not needed if the healthy patient goes home the same day. 5) Rehabilitation is anticipated to be many weeks less than traditional flap reconstruction. There is no permanent muscle loss, no large scars and potential defects atthe flap donor site(s).",

The American Cancer Society recommends that high-risk women with lifetime risk greater than 20% should receive annual breast MRI screening. Depending on the practitioner and study characteristics, MRI may have a high false positive rate (with specificity reported as low as 81%), which can lead to many unnecessary procedures or even over-treatment. Positron emission mammography ( PEM ), the breast-specific high-resolution molecular imaging system originally invented by the PI of the submitted proposal, has been demonstrated to have a high negativepredictive value. Integrating a PEM system into MRI for combined imaging is therefore likely to increase diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, the recent commercialization of PET/CT and PET/MR clinical systems has led to wide acceptance in the oncology community for combined anatomic and molecular imaging. The goal of this application is therefore to design and construct a PEM system that could be used in conjunction with an MRI scanner.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are roughly 250,000 new cases of metastatic cancer to the skeleton in the U.S. each year.  Bone-seeking  radiopharmaceuticals are used for bone pain palliation and have shown promise for treating bone metastases.They typically combine a radioactive metal such as samarium-153 with a chelant. The chelant part of the molecule is taken up by growing bone and carries the radioactive  payload  along with it. Approximately 50% of the radioactivity in the radiopharmaceutical concentrates in bone and irradiates the adjacent tumor. This radiation absorbed dose produces the therapeutic effect.  Two rare earth metal-based bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals (Sm-153-EDTMP and Ho-166- DOTMP) have been investigated for treating bone tumors and have shown promising clinical results. However, one has an inefficient chelant that limits how much radioactivity can be delivered to the bone. The other has a radionuclide that is too strong and causes intolerable side effects.  We are developing the bone-seeking radiopharmaceutical CycloSam(R) (Sm-153-DOTMP) for the treatment of bone metastases. Compared to the two compounds that have already been tried, CycloSam combines the better radionuclide, samarium-153, with the better phosphonic acidchelant, DOTMP. We anticipate that CycloSam will be able to deliver the prescribed radiation absorbed dose to bone tumors while avoiding intolerable radiation damage to normal, non-target tissues. Phase II of this project will: 1. manufacture clinical grade CycloSam; 2. verify that the clinical grade CycloSam has the same biodistribution and dose delivery properties that we measured in Phase I; and 3. treat bone tumors using increasing quantities of clinical grade CycloSam to determine the maximum amounts that may be safely given with no clinically significant suppression of the bone marrow and with marrow suppression that is mild enough for spontaneous recovery.  Phase II will make clinical grade material under good laboratory practices (GLP) and current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) conditions. The pharmacological toxicity of the clinical grade material will be tested in rats and dogs. The biodistribution of the clinical grade material will be tested in rats. The dose escalation study wil be performedin dogs that present to a veterinary clinic with osteosarcomas in order to estimate the maximum dosage at which concurrent chemotherapy might be given and the maximum dosage at which the expected myelosuppression would not require a bone marrow transplant. These dosage thresholds, combined with the dosimetry data, will be used in the design of the protocols to be presented along with the manufacturing and toxicology data in an IND application to the FDA for the first human trials.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Bone metastases have been treated by radioactive drugs, or radiopharmaceuticals. Thus far, their effects have been primarily palliative.

Approximately one-quarter of BCR-ABL(+) leukemia patients demonstrate evidence of resistance to imatinib mesylate either at initial diagnosis or at some point after treatment has begun. In our Phase I investigation, we demonstrated that monitoring the cellular stress developed by BCR-ABL(+) leukemia cells in response to tyrosine kinase inhibiting (TKI) drugs can used as an early marker for determining the effect of the therapeutic agents on the cancer cells. The approach is optimally implemented by measuring the dielectric permittivity of drug-treated cell suspensions using differential impedance sensing. Corresponding measurements of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant BCR-ABL(+) cell lines were obtained and confirmed by MTT assay. The response of non-leukemic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to TKIs measured at clinically relevantdrug concentrations showed no significant background level. Finally, the responses of BCR-ABL(+) patient blood to different TKIs were consistent with our initial cell line measurements laying the foundation for a practical clinical assay. In this Phase Ieffort we propose to quantify the cellular stress related drug responses enabling ease in interpretation of results, develop prototype instrumentation, verify the technical approach through animal model measurements and demonstrate feasibility with patientsamples.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of a rapid diagnostic tool for determining the sensitivity/resistance profiles of leukemia cells to therapeutic agents is a significant step towards the administration ofpersonalized medicine and optimal patient outcomes. By addressing and overcoming a significant technical barrier (the ability to determine the effects of a therapeutic agent on difficult to culture cancer cells), the proposed project enables drug-resistant cancer cells to be distinguished from drug-sensitive cells easily and rapidly. The availability of this diagnostic tool will arm oncologists with knowledge of the most effective drug for eliminating the cancer cells and the ability to monitor the onset of drug resistance during the  administration of treatment. These new capabilities will avoid the empirical prescription of cancer therapy and enable the start or modification of existing treatment choices as needed. While this project focuses on the chemosensitivity testing of leukemia cells to tyrosine kinase inhibiting agents and the identification of drug resistance as an initial demonstration of its feasibility, the technical approach is applicable to a spectrum of different cancer types and therapeuticagents.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION:  Drug candidates that disrupt the NEMO/IKK signaling complex for the treatment of cancer Project Summary/Abstract Protein-protein interactions represent the largest untapped opportunity for therapeutic development, but the field has languisheddue to lack of efficient lead finding technologies. To address these shortcomings, Carmot is developing an innovative drug discovery technology called Chemotype Evolution.  Chemotype Evolution provides access to novel and target-relevant chemical diversity with an efficiency that is unprecedented with other technologies. Importantly, through iterative applications of Chemotype Evolution, a starting peptide can be evolved into smaller and more drug-like molecules. Carmot has successfully applied this approach to target the NEMO/IKK protein-protein interaction, a key mediator of NF-kB activation. This Phase II proposal will advance the promising hits identified during Phase I to support Carmot&#039;s long-term objective to develop drugs that inhibit cancer cell survival and inflammatory signaling in the tumor environment by inhibiting NF-kB activation.  The NF-kB pathway is critical for the progression of leukemia and lymphoma and is directly activated by several cancer-associated mutations. NF-kB is also a key signaling node in the communication between tumors and the inflammatory microenvironment by promoting inflammation, cell survival, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling. However, despite intensive efforts, viable drug-leads that specificallytarget NF-kB activation have not been identified. The protein-protein interaction between NF-kB Essential Modulator (NEMO) and IkB Kinase (IKK), referred to as NEMO/IKK, has emerged as a promising target for inhibiting NF-kB activation. The technical objective of this Phase II proposal is to advance NEMO/IKK inhibitors identified in Phase I toward proof-of-concept in animal models. Specifically, Carmot will use Chemotype Evolution and medicinal chemistry to improve potency, cell activity, and pharmaceutical properties (aim 1). Next, Carmot will test compounds as single agents and in combination with approved chemotherapeutics in cell-based models of lymphoma and evaluate markers of drug response (aim 2). Finally, select compounds will be tested in animal models of lymphoma with the goal of identifying drug candidates for further pre-clinical development (aim 3).  Two products will emerge from the Phase II research. First, this proposal will validate an innovative technology for targeting protein-protein interactions by progressively converting a peptide ligand into a smaller more drug-like molecule, thus addressing a major technological gap in pharmaceutical discovery. Second, the identified molecules will serve as new drug candidates for treatment of leukemias, lymphomas, and solid tumors.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Standard Imaging, Inc. is developing a new generation of radiation dosimeters for small field dosimetry. These small detectors are needed in clinical applications such as stereotactic radiosurgery/stereotactic radiotherapy (SRS/SRT), intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), dynamic arc therapy, and tomotherapy treatments. The enabling technology is the point scintillation detector that employs a miniature plastic scintillator coupled to a color PIN diode detector via an optical fiber. Small field radiotherapy techniques such as stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) enable delivery of high radiation doses to tumors while sparing healthy tissue and organs at risk. These special and complex treatment modalities significantly benefit patients and offer substantial advantages over traditional radiotherapy techniques. Because SRS and SBRT treatments often deliver the entire therapeutic dose in a single or hypofractionated treatment regimen, the treatments must be delivered accurately. Phase I generated a robust, single-point water-equivalent scintillation dosimeter to accurately characterize and measure the dosimetry of small fields and to verify these special treatments before delivery. The compact, fully operational Plastic Scintillation Detector (PSD) is further enhanced when paired with Standard Imaging&#039;s dual-channel SuperMAX electrometer. However, the PSD/SuperMAX electrometer system cannot yet be used with water scanning systemsbecause it lacks a compatible analog signal output. Coordinated use of a water scanning system with SRS-appropriate detectors is crucial to characterize these precise radiation fields accurately and efficiently before patient treatment. The overall goal ofthis Phase II project is to transition th Phase I small-field detector from a bench-top system requiring a specialized 2-channel electrometer to a versatile fully commercialized medical radiation detector. Achieving this goal will advance the successful Phase I project by (1) greatly expanding the effectiveness and market potential of PSD devices by developing a universally compatible detector system that could be fully used in place of an ionization chamber or diode with existing medical radiation measurement equipment, especially water scanning systems, (2) thoroughly optimizing the detector, and (3) fully characterizing the detector for easy application in typical clinical settins. At the successful completion of this Phase II study, Standard Imaging will be poised to deliver to the market a well-characterized PSD suitable for precise dosimetry and QA of small fields used in SRS and SBRT, and that is fully compatible with existing measurement systems. Further development of this single-point system subsequently could include generating multi-point systems such as 2D arrays for patient dosimetry or fixed linear arrays for water scanning.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Patients undergoing very delicate radiation treatment, suchas stereotactic radiosurgery/ stereotactic radiotherapy (SRS/SRT), intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), dynamic arc therapy, or tomotherapy treatments, need extremely precise and accurate doses.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have identified a novel Type IIb prodrug of riluzole, FC-311, which has the potential to revolutionize therapy for the treatment of the devastating condition of metastatic melanoma acting via a novel glutamatergic mechanism of action, and also be useful to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the many other conditions for which riluzole itself is under clinical evaluation. FC-311 is not subject to the limiting Cyp1A2 metabolism and large patient-to-patient variability of exposure that riluzole is, and has a ~3X longer high-life, higher bioavailability upon oral administration, and shows dramatic efficacy in a xenograft model of melanoma, in a dose dependent manner. We identified FC-311 as the optimal prodrug from among ~30 designed candidates using a systematic in vitro and in vivo screening strategy. We have demonstrated conclusively that FC-311 is not metabolized by Cyp1A2, while confirming that riluzole itself is metabolized nearly exclusively by this enzyme, which has variable levels of expression in the general population. We have achieved all of the aims of our Phase I program of study as well as conducted many additional studies that were not originally described or anticipated. We now seek Phase II support to advance FC-311 through various IND-enabling pre-clinical development activities. Our goal is to develop FC-311 as an oral anticancer agent in order to provide uniform, patient to patient delivery of riluzole active substance. In Aim 1, we will conduct drug substance and chemistry related activities normally considered as part of any drug discovery and development program. These include preparing 300 g of non-GMP active pharmaceutical agent, selection of suitable salt form, vehicle and formulation, analytical methods development, drug substance stability testing, evaluation of additional riluzole prodrugs for added patent protection, as back-ups, and for possible consideration for additional indications, continued patent prosecution of the important intellectual property involved, and preparation of 5 kg of cGMP of FCC-311. In Aim 2, we will continue the required IND-enabling development activities which include completion of metabolite ID studies (human, rat and dog), determination of full PK parametersin two additional species, correlated to pharmacodynamics, investigation of Cyp450 inhibition effect in addition to the demonstrated lack of Cyp1A2, completion of in vitro, non-GLP toxicology studies (hERG, Ames, genotoxicity), 28 day safety pharmacologytesting in rats and dogs, and further ancillary pharmacology testing on FC-311. We wish to file an IND with the FDA as soon as possible, and then transition into clinical evaluation in melanoma patients. We have established a Riluzole Prodrug Project Leadership Team consisting of eight clinicians, pharmacologists and experienced pharmaceutical experts to provide real time guidance and support to ensure the success of this program. We will file for orphan drug designation for FC-311 for melanoma, and seek toobtain further funding from venture capital and other sources, or partner with a major pharmaceutical company, to advance FC-311 through the various phases of clinical development.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Metastatic melanoma is a cancer with extremely low survival rates and very limited treatment options based on highly toxic agents. Riluzole is a non-toxic drug approved for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We have recently shown exciting preliminary results for riluzole treatment of metastatic melanoma in mice and human subjects. We have now discovered a promising Type II prodrug of riluzole, FC-311, that is expected to treat melanoma in more patients (less patient to patient variability of exposure), has ~3X longerhalf life, greater bioavailability, and equivalent or better dose dependent activity in a mouse xenograft model of melanoma, when compared with riluzole. We seek to continue the development of FC-311 prior to filing an IND and eventual clinical use in melanoma patients.",

Monoclonal antibodies,  mAbs  have emerged as a rapidly growing class of oncology therapeutics. Despite their success in certain clinical applications, the therapeutic efficacy of mAbs is limited, with only a minority of patients responding to these agents as therapies on their own. It is becoming clear that many tumors evade successful elimination by co-opting the body&#039;s own immune regulatory systems. These same mechanisms also reduce the anti-cancer effects of mAbs. We are developing a molecule that addresses one of these key mechanisms that improves the therapeutic effects of mAbs by: 1) increasing sensitivity of cancers to treatment; 2) unmasking resistant cancers so they again become sensitized; and 3) possibly allowing treatment of cancers that have become refractory to therapy. This could make mAb therapy more effective, and potentially reduce the amounts of mAbs required for treatment, thus reducing costs and potential side effects. The public health implications of improving rituximab treatment are significant. There are over 300,000 patients with non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL), and the majority receives treatment with rituximab either alone or combined with chemotherapy. Many patients develop recurrent diseases, and 5-year survival rates for NHL is 63%. In most cases of tumor recurrence, patients develop resistance to rituximab therapy.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): According to the American Cancer Societylts 2009 report, one in eight women will develop breast cancer in her lifetime. Early detection of breast cancer through periodic screening using x-ray mammography has been highlyeffective in lowering mortality-rates. However, some breast lesions are not visible on mammography and the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly recommended, especially for younger women with high inherited risk of breast cancer. To improve the clinical utility of MRI in breast cancer diagnosis, it is critically important to increase its specificity and to therefore reduce the emotional burden, time, and costs associated with the clinical follow-up required by these false positive diagnoses. The proposed research and collaboration between Diagnosoft, Inc. and Johns Hopkins University will develop a commercial system for improving the specificity of MRI in the detection of malignant breast tumors by imaging and quantifying their mechanicalstiffness. About 90% of breast lesions are found by palpation, either through self- inspection or by a primary physician or gynecologist. Thus, the mechanical stiffness of lesions is already important property distinguishing lesions from normal tissues. Recent evidence also suggests that mechanical stiffness may play a further role in distinguishing benign from malignant masses, and new technology has recently emerged to image stiffness using MRI and mild compression. The proposed research and development will exploit the combined imaging of conventional MRI with MRI-based stiffness imaging to increase the specificity of breast cancer diagnoses. This fast-track SBIR will be carried out in the following two phases. Phase I includes the redesign and construction of the compression device and developing a pneumatic system to use lower air pressure for operating the device; perform ergonomics and safety analysis of the device operation; and acquiring pilot data on volunteers. Phase II includes the modifying the prototype of the compression device to meet the ergonomics and safety recommendations of Phase I, developing the integrated system including the imaging sequences on the MRI scanner, image reconstruction, and image processing; and testing the system in a pilot study of healthy volunteers and patients to demonstrate feasibility and the ability to detect stiff masses that corresponds to lesions in the breast of patients. This collaboration between Johns Hopkins University for innovative research and Diagnosoftfor development will realize a new market in womenlts health care and continue thriving as a small US owned business.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   Early detection of breast cancer is highly effective in lowering mortality-rates.

P-Chips have been shown to be viable and easy to read under conditions, such as the presence of frost, where traditional bar code labels fail due to problems related to interference or adhesive failure. Determining the serial ID numbers of p-Chips imbedded in the walls of vials is done with a dedicated reader that can be configured in several ways. The software associatesa particular vial ID with a database to determine the provenance of the sample. Reading is extremely rapid giving the opportunity to maintain (or be close to) the storage temperature during polling. The main goals of this project are to: (1) design and optimize the process for embedding p-Chips in one or more types of sample vials for use at varying storage temperatures; (2) modify the existing p-Chip/reader system for use with vials, including designing and implementing bench-top readers that can either poll single vials or entire racks of vials; (3) improve key features of the p-Chips themselves for very low temperature conditions; (4) provide software routines that are compatible with existing enterprise systems for biorepositories; and (5) to validate the system with several collaborators. Successful completion of this work will result in a method and standard operating procedures that will improve sample storage techniques and provide more reliable samples to the biomedical research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Biorepositories play an important role in basic and applied biological and medical research. A key issue for many researchers is the availability of high quality tissue, cell, and other types of samples whose identify is well characterized,and not compromised. The new electronic identification system has the potential to greatly increase the use of RFID technology in sample storage and to help to maintain sample identity and integrity.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our objective is to develop a Protease Chain Reaction technology (ProCR) that will enable ultra- sensitive and highly-quantitative detection of cancer markers. The basic element of a protease chain reaction is a protease-inhibitor complex. The protease is inactive when bound to the inhibitor but, once freed, is capable of cleaving the inhibitor and releasing additional free protease. A trace of free protease initiates the chain reaction and eventually causes the releaseof all protease from the inhibitory complex. The lag time preceding the full release of protease is determined by the initial concentration of free protease. The Phase I project developed a first-generation of self-amplifying complexes that form the core of the ProCR detection technology. All Phase I milestones were significantly exceeded. In Phase II we will develop powerful molecular sensors based on self- amplifying complexes. A sensor consists of three elements: 1) a sensing element that responds to thepresence of an analyte; 2) the processing/computational element that amplifies and quantifies the signal from the detection element; and 3) the transducer element that produces an optical signal. Through this combination, extremely sophisticated enzymaticsensors will be built to detect cancer markers. Accordingly the three experimental Aims are to: 1) Engineer sensing elements; 2) Engineer enhanced processing/computational elements; and 3) Engineer signaling components. Fundamentally, a protein chain reaction is a powerful analogue computer with two key characteristics that greatly facilitate the detection of target molecules. 1) It can convert th concentration of a specific target molecule into a time signature. 2) It can create enormous signal amplification, analogous to the amplification of DNA by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Thus detection is enabled because the final observable signal produced by a target molecule can be very large and the time lag until onset of the signal is precisely correlated with the concentration of target molecule. The long term goal is to develop protease-inhibitor complexes as enzymatic nano-processors which can be combined to detect multiple signals and to control output with multiple logic gates.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology demonstrated the extraordinary power of harnessing an enzyme to perform novel, programmable reactions. Our objective is here to develop an analogous protease chain reaction technology (ProCR) which will enable ultra-sensitive molecular detection. The long term goal is to improve cancer detection and prevention by enabling accurate quantitation of multiple, low abundance molecular markers.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project seeks to optimize a promising magneto-nanosensor technology for use in cancer diagnosis. By adapting a common technology from the computer disk drive industry, this simple device enables researchers to simultaneously detect multiple proteins, or biomarkers, at ultra low concentrations in biological fluids. The abundance and change over time of several of these biomarkers, when taken together, can be a powerful diagnostic tool.  At this time, the tools required to measure these biomarkers, such as mass spectrometry or ELISA immunoassays, are slow, expensive, difficult to use, and often not very reproducible. In addition, many interesting biomarkers are present at such low concentrations that they simply cannotbe detected with any but the most sophisticated and involved methods.  The technology under development combines the advantages of high sensitivity, ease of use, rapid quantification, and low cost. These drastic improvements are possible in part due to the use of extremely sensitive giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensors, and also because there are no natural magnetic signal sources in a blood sample, which results in a very low background signal.  Additionally, these sensors have been modified to detect only those magnetic nanoparticle labels which are actually bound to the sensors - unbound labels floating nearby are almost completely ignored. That means that, unlike most other assay technologies, it is not necessary to remove the excess labels to determinethe result. This allows the assay to be partially or completely wash-free, which again greatly increases the sensitivity and ease of use. Furthermore, no laser or complex optics are required because the signal is a simple change in electrical resistance of the sensor. This means that the ancillary instrumentation can be very simple and cost-efficient.  With an initial focus on lung cancer, where there are no effective methods for early detection of the disease, researchers are attempting to validate a panel of six biomarkers that have been associated with asymptomatic lung cancer. The long term goal is to have a diagnostic test that allows doctors to diagnose patients when they are still in Stage I and face survival rates of 70-80%, as opposed today&#039;s situation where most patients don&#039;t get diagnosed until they reach Stage IIIB or IV and face less than a 10% chance of survival.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PROJECT NARRATIVE Researchers are using a promising magneto-nanosensor technology to develop a novel diagnostic test for early detection of lung cancer. This simple blood test would greatly improve patient survival by making it possible to diagnose lung cancer in its early stages when it has a much better chance of being successfully treated.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mammography is the current cost-effective gold standard for breast cancer screening. However, its usefulness has recently become a subject of considerable debate. The limitations of mammography are most evident in the population of women who have dense breast tissue where up to half the cancers can be missed. Furthermore, mammography generates radiation and can be quite uncomfortable. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be more accurate than mammography, it is notpractical because it is too expensive for routine use. Currently, there is a trade-off between the cost effectiveness of mammography on the one hand and the imaging accuracy of MRI on the other. This trade-off represents a barrier to increasing survival rates for women who develop breast cancer. Our long-term goal is to eliminate this trade-off and thereby improve breast cancer survival rates through the introduction of safe, cost-effective, operator-independent sonography based on the principles of ultrasound tomography (UST). The objective of this study, and the next step in pursuit of that goal, is to demonstrate that our new UST scanner is ready to become a clinical and commercial product. The study is justified by the fact that our prior work has already demonstrated the feasibility of breast imaging with UST while the new design promises to greatly increase the performance of the scatter. By demonstrating the improved performance we will be able to introduce a practical, low-cost product for breast cancer screening and diagnosis with potential for significant societal impact. We propose to test the SoftVue system in the lab (Phase I) and then in the clinic (Phase II) to determine its performance and readiness for the marketplace. This study is expectedto generate supportive evidence for regulatory clearance and important input for planning large scale screening trials so that the company can undertake its Phase III activities of (i) selling SoftVue scanners for the diagnostic marketplace and (ii) undertaking screening trials to support future regulatory approval for screening.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The lack of an alternative breast imaging method that obviates the constraints of current standard imaging modalities is a barrier to dramatically impacting mortality (about 45,000 women in the US per year) and morbidity from breast cancer. Currently, there is a trade-off between the cost effectiveness of mammography and sonography on the one hand and the imaging accuracy of dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance (DCE-MR) on the other. The work described in this proposal will potentially eliminate this trade-off by combining the low- cost advantage of mammography with the superior imaging performance of DCE-MR through the development of an ultrasound tomography scanner (UST). Furthermore, UST offers comfort, operator independence and low-installation and maintenance costs. These advantages will be very beneficial to the society as they will support early breast cancer detection, decrease in thenumber of unnecessary biopsies, improved participation in breast cancer screening programs, and ultimately improved breast cancer survival rates.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diagnostic Photonics, Inc. (DxP) is a medical device company developing an intraoperative imaging system for surgical guidance and real-time assessment of cancer tumor margins based on interferometric synthetic aperturemicroscopy (ISAM), a novel modality that uses light defraction to assess tissue. Because of the fatty nature of the breast, current intraoperative histopathologic assessments are time consuming and unreliable. This project tests ISAM while the long term goal is to reduce the number of re-excisions for the management of breast cancer by providing rapid, reliable intraoperative margin assessment without tissue destruction. This will result in significant cost savings by reducing repeat operations. It may eventually result in a reduced volume of resection due to the ability to more accurately identify the extent of resection needed. In Phase I, three specific aims will be accomplished. Phase I aims include the development of a handheld probe and instrumentation support, user interface, and sterile disposable needed for execution of in vivo clinical studies as  well as a clinical evaluation of ISAM margin detection versus pathology. The clinical goal in Phase I will be an initial evaluation of ISAM by comparingISAM images against corresponding histology slides. This trial is necessary before proceeding to larger trials and will also serve asa control group for Phase II. The ex vivo assessment of tumor margins using the ISAM device will provide sensitivity and specificity data for the device vs. the gold standard of post-operative histology. The trial results and other data collected such as patient or pathology factors that increase or decrease the rate of margins will allow us to more accurately determine samplesize requirements for Phase II. In Phase II, the ISAM technology will be applied in vivo. Correct labeling and assessment of tumor margins has long been considered a weakness of the current margin assessment methods and has been well documented to be unreliable. It is crucial to develop a technique that can assess margins both ex vivo and in vivo in the specimen cavity. Successfully identifying positive margins at the time of the operation allows the surgeon to act on those positive margins immediately, reducing the number of re-excisions. Aims of Phase II include assessment of in vivo margin analysis, evaluation of the utility of the ISAM system and time required during surgery, and the ultimate reduction in repeat surgeries from positive margins. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death among women of all races in the United States. Over 182,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually An estimated 128,000 of these patients with early stage breast cancer undergo breast conservation surgery ( BCS ), i.e., lumpectomy/partial mastectomy. The literature reports post-surgical positive margins in 20-70% of these patients which then requires a repeat surgery. New methods of reliable cost-effective intra-operative margin assessment are needed to move diagnostic capabilities to the operating room for point-of-care decision-making, and thus reducing the number of repeat surgeries that add cost and risk to the patient. DxP aims to fulfill this unmet need starting with thegoals set for this grant application.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During embryonic development, EphB4 and EphrinB2 are both critically required for maturation of newly forming blood vessels. EphrinB2 and is critically required for activation of VEGFR2/3. EphrinB2 is up-regulated in tumor vasculature and loss of EphrinB2 led to arrested tumor angiogenesis and inhibited tumor growth. On the other hand, EphB4 is highly induced in many epithelial cancers and serves as a tumor survival factor. EphB4 expressed on tumor cells also interacts with EphrinB2 on tumor vessels and promotes both the tumor cell survival and the tumor angiogenesis. We have developed an EphB4-EphrinB2 inhibitor - the extracellular fragment of EphB4 fused with human serum albumin (sEphB4-HSA). In SBIR phase I project, wehave shown that sEphB4-HSA inhibits tumor growth and causes tumor regression in many xenograft and spontaneous tumor models, and combination with chemotherapy agents has additive/synergistic effect. Particularly sEphB4-HSA is highly effective in regressing Kras mutant driven tumors in xenograft and genetic tumor models. We have produced GMP quality sEphB4-HSA and performed GLP pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicology studies in mice and monkeys. The IND application has been approved and sEphB4-HSA now is in human phase I clinical trial. First three dose levels have been accrued and no dose limiting toxicity has been observed. None of the patients have experienced grade three or grade four toxicity. There are also signs of clinical benefit. One patient at the lowest dose (2.5mg/kg) has had stable disease at 4 months since the initiation of the treatment. Three patients including a kras lung adenocarcinoma at the second dose level (5mg/kg) have stayed on therapy for 3-4 months and all have had stable diseases andtwo have shown signs of tumor regression. Therefore, we will manufacture large quantity (1.7 kg) of sEphB4-HSA for the coming human Phase II clinical trials in Kras mutant lung and pancreatic cancers. To determine the treatment regimens, we will conduct efficacy studies in genetic Kras mutant mouse models (with or without concurrent p53 mutation). We will test sEphB4-HSA as a single agent and also combined with chemotherapy agents. Finally we will collect blood from patients at various time points and applynovel technology to isolate circulating tumor cells and analyze the expression of sEphB4-HSA targets. We will also analyze the circulating levels of VEGF and soluble VEGFR2, two known biomarkers of anti-angiogenesis therapies. These results will guide usto identify the pharmacodynamic biomarker of sEphB4-HSA, which will be very useful in the evaluation of patient responses in the clinic.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are developing a novel anti-cancer therapeutic sEphB4-HSA. sEphB4-HSA targets EphB4-EphrinB2 and has both anti-angiogenesis and anti-tumor cell activity. Pre-clinical studies show that sEphB4-HSA inhibits tumor growth and causes tumor regression in many xenograft and spontaneous tumor models. When combined withchemotherapy agents sEphB4-HSA has additive/synergistic effect. Particularly sEphB4-HSA is highly effective in regressing Kras mutant driven tumors in xenograft and genetic tumor models. sEphB4- HSA is currently in human Phase I clinical trial and no doselimiting toxicity has been observed for the first three dose levels. In addition, there are also signs of clinical benefit: thee patients (including a Kras lung adenocarcinoma) at the second dose level (5mg/kg) have stayed on therapy for 3-4+ months and all of them have had stable diseases and two have tumor regression. Based on preclinical data and up-to-date Phase I clinical trial results, we plan to perform Phase II clinical trials in Kras mutant lung and pancreatic cancers. In this project we propose to manufacture additional sEphB4-HSA for human Phase II clinical trials. We will also select treatment regimens for Phase II clinical trials by performing pre-clinical efficacy studies using spontaneous Kras mutant lung and pancreas tumor models. Finally wewill identify the pharmacodynamic biomarker(s) of sEphB4-HSA treatment by analyzing human blood/plasma samples collected in clinical trials. This is a highly innovative project with the following novel findings and therapeutic potentials: 1. EphB4-EphrinB2 are a pair of transmembrane proteins expressed in the vein and artery respectively and necessary for newly forming arterial-venous capillaries to fuse and mature. Their expression is low in adult vessels and normal tissues but induced in tumor vessels, as well as tumor cells. 2. sEphB4-HSA targets EphrinB2, blocks its binding to EphB4 and blocks new vessel formation and maturation and as such has broad anti-angiogenesis function: it can block angiogenesis induced by many growth factors. 3. sEphB4-HSA inhibits tumor growth and induces regression of many cancer types, and also complete tumor regression in combination therapy. 4. EphB4 is required for Kras mutant driven tumor development and sEphB4-HSA is effective in prevention and regression of Kras mutantdriven tumor in genetic model. Thus sEphB4-HSA is expected to be eff",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this small business innovation research grant is to develop and commercialize a highly accurate, minimally invasive risk stratification technique for colorectal cancer (CRC) that is simple enough to be performed by the primary care provider during an annual physical exam. Although existing guidelines recommend CRC screening for all patients over age 50 (gt100 million Americans), CRC remains the second leading cause of cancer death. This is in part due to thelimitations in the existing CRC screening techniques including colonoscopy which is considered a &#039;gold standard&#039; for CRC screening. This is because only a small fraction of eligible population undergoes colonoscopy due to variety of reasons including expense, patient reluctance, complications, and insufficient number of endoscopists. Furthermore, the current practice of colonoscopy on the  average risk  population is remarkably inefficient as only ~6% of the screening population have significant neoplasia (advanced adenomas). Hence developing a minimally invasive test to identify patients who do and do not harbor colonic adenomas is of crucial importance to better target patients for colonoscopy. This would enable, for the first time, a population wide screening for CRC. An interdisciplinary team of engineers, biologists and clinicians at Northwestern University and Northshore University HealthSystem has developed Partial Wave Spectroscopic (PWS) Microscopy, a novel biophotonic technique that enables sensingthe nanoscale intracellular architectural correlates of the genetic/epigenetic changes in otherwise cytopathologically normal mucosa cells. Preliminary animal and human studies demonstrated the potential of PWS microscopy to detect subtle alterations in cytologically normal-appearing cells that are due to the  presence of cancerous/precancerous lesions present in a different part of an organ, a consequence of the well-established concept of field carcinogenesis. This opens a possibility to detect the presence of colonic neoplasia by means of PWS analysis of cells from rectal mucosa, which is readily accessible by a simple brushing of the cells without the need for colonoscopy or bowel preparation. Indeed, in pilot studies on 146 patients it was noted that the PWS marker from endoscopically-normal rectal mucosal brushings mirrored the significance of neoplastic lesions elsewhere in the colon (advanced adenomas gt adenomas gt no neoplasia). There are several steps that are required prior to the future definitive clinical validation of rectal PWS analysis. In phase I of this SBIR, an automated PWS microscopy with high throughput capability will be developed and tested for its nanoscale sensitivity and diagnostic potential. In phase II, a  standard operating procedure will be developed that will optimize the sample collection, sample processing and PWS analysis algorithms. The automated PWS system and the SOP will be tested on 300 patients (training set, n = 200 and validation set, n = 100). The successful SBIR research would enable NanoCytomics to create a commercially viable diagnostic system that would be critical for future multi-center clinical trials and FDA approval. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Existing colorectal cancer screening techniques do not allow accurate and cost-effective screening of the entire at-risk population - all patients over 50 years  age (gt 100 million Americans). This SBIR project will lead towards the development of a highly sensitive, minimally invasive and commercially viable optical technology that would enable screening general population by a simple brushing of rectum that can be performed by the primary care physician at an annual physical exam.",

Feasibility of such HMD has been demonstrated in Phase I of the project.  2. Develop a hybrid image-based and gradient-tracking based head positioning system for the augmented reality system to provide head position in the MRI coordinate system at the edge area of the scanner.  3. Develop the augmented reality mode of the HMD that presents 3D anatomic data from previously acquired MRI onto neurosurgical operation field at the edge of the scanner.  4. Develop application specific MRI protocols that provide non-distorted high-resolution 3D rendered images with multiple contrast characteristics (e.g. T1, T2, FLAIR, MP-RAGE, etc.); and the planning and visualization software interface to incorporate these images to procedure planning and guidance using augmented reality.  5. Conduct phantom tests to demonstrate adequate operation of the HMD in its two modes of operation.  6. Conduct animal tests to evaluate the HMD in conducting percutaneous interventions and open neurosurgical procedures. The proposed project complies with two of the four specific goals of PA-10-079, namely: - The development and optimization of fully integrated cancer imaging,monitoring, and therapy systems. - Partnerships among small business and academic clinical centers in order to reach the research goals. The development of the technology and the eventual product for clinical use will be done jointly by Robin Medical, Inc., a small business specializes in the development of navigation systems for MRI; and the Magnetic Resonance Research Center (MRRC) at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, having extensive experience in human and large animal research in MRI and development of customized scan sequences. Robin Medical will develop a head mounted display (HMD) and head mounted augmented reality system (HMARS), based on feasibility demonstration in Phase I. The HMD will provide a 3D display of realtime or previously acquiredMR images along with realtime tracking annotation. The HMARS will provide an augmented reality display composed of view of the surgical field obtained by head mounted cameras, MR images, and tracking annotation. The MRRC group will develop customized MRIsequences for real-time guidance and display of 3D rendered structures and will conduct the technical and animal experimentation with the system.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cigarette smoking causes the vast majority of lung cancers and over 400,000 deaths annually with a total monetary cost exceeding  190 billion. While the majority of the 45+ million US smokers want to quit, a small fraction of this number actually succeeds. The most popular smoking cessation products utilize the nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) paradigm, but deliver cessation rates of less than 10%. Therefore,there is an urgent need for smoking cessation products that deliver higher efficacy than those currently marketed. With 7 million NRT users and over  800 million in annual US sales, the NRT market is well-established. Even though smokers experience peak cravings and smoke at predictable times throughout the day, existing NRT regimens are not tailored to systematically preempt these episodes. Therefore, there is a commercial opportunity for a programmable NRT (PNRT) product that leverages this important feature of smoking behavior to increase efficacy, with potential to save or prolong millions of lives and dramatically cut US healthcare costs.  Chrono Therapeutics, Inc. (CTI) plans to produce a programmable wristwatch-like device, SmartStopTM, that deliversnicotine transdermally through a patch medium in pulses throughout the day. By tailoring the pulses to preempt the regular craving and peak smoking episodes that smokers experience,SmartStopTM is likely to significantly increase the efficacy of NRT. The end goal of this Fast-Track SBIR project is to produce a set of six prototypes of this device and to demonstrate their functionality in human pharmacokinetic (PK) trials. CTI will implement this project as follows: (i) Prototype the nicotine formulation dispensing unit by miniaturizing a pump and testing its performance. (ii) Demonstrate the ability of the dispensing unit to deliver nicotine through a skin sample. (iii) Produce six SmartStopTM prototypes for a clinical PK study that employs the pumping technology developed in (i) above. (iv) Demonstrate the capability of the prototypes to regulate plasma nicotine in human subjects using programmed pulses of nicotine formulation.  SmartStopTM will be the only product that combines the time-tested principles ofNRT with the latest science on the predictable nature of smoking. Therapeutic innovations include the ability to (i) automatically ensure compliance with a multi-dose regimen, (ii) customize for patient-specific levels of dependence and smoking patterns,(iii) administer nicotine automatically prior to waking to relieve peak morning craving without the side effects of night-long dosing, and (iv) decrease tolerance to nicotine by gradually  tailoring-down  the dose to wean the smoker off cigarettes. Technical innovations include (i) automated  on-off  for nicotine administration, (ii) miniaturization combined with full functionality and visual appeal, and (iii) key safety features including insulation of the nicotine reservoir from the skin and delivery anduptake mechanisms that limit risk of excessive dosage, which are absent from existing transdermal NRT products.

Both conventional examination and endoscopy  lack the ability to visualize the depth of penetration of disease into the deeper layers  of the tissue, and  provide information on vocal fold epithelial structure. Therefore, laryngeal cancer diagnosis has to rely  on biopsies, which requires general anesthesia and surgical endoscopy. Multiple and repeated biopsies  are common in order to increase diagnostic yield, and with this increasing morbidity form surgery.   Regardless of the toll exacted on patients and their families, there are major costs associated with  surgery, and significant patient time away from work. Hence, there is a huge need to develop a fast,  mobile and noninvasive technology to aid in the early detection and monitoring of laryngeal malignant  lesions,assist in selecting patients to undergo surgical biopsy.  The use of OCT in managing early  laryngeal epithelial cancer will be analogous to the use of macroscopic imaging modalities (i.e., MR, CT)  in managing large solid tumors in the body.  Using several licensed patents, OCT Medical Imaging Inc.  (OCTMI) proposes to address the treatment and diagnosis of early laryngeal cancer using light based  fiber optic imaging technology known as optical Coherence tomography (OCT), which produces a cross- sectional images at near histopathological resolution(Fujimoto et.al 2000). The first in vivo endoscopic  OCT images in animals and humans were reported in 1997 (Tearney et.al., 1997)).  Many clinical  applications require a large area or 3-D imaging, which is  difficult to achieve with the Time Domain (TD)  OCT. Hence, OCTMI proposes to use advanced Fourier domain (FD) OCT technology which provides 3D  imaging at high speed and sensitivity ( Leitgeb et.al., 2003). Second, the paradigm shift from OR based to  office-based imaging is necessary to make OCT a useful technology for head and neck cancer screening,  early detection, and monitoring of disease progression. Incorporating this technology, OCTMI proposes  to develop an advanced compact, cost-effective office based real-time 3D-functional Fourier domain  functional OCT system that will not only acquire images at near histopathological resolution, but also  will provide clinically important structural information on  suspect lesions, potential biopsy sites, andcancer margins of larynx in the office without the need for general anesthesia or sedation. OCTMI is well  positioned to develop this technology since its founders and collaborators have developed several  office-based real-time 3D-OCT systems and were first to conduct large scale clinical trials on laryngeal  cancer to the best of our knowledge            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: OCTMI is seeking funds that will directly contribute to the easy advanced detection and diagnosis of laryngeal cancer. We are seeking funds from NCI to develop an advanced functional OCT system that will help reduce mortality, minimize number of invasive biopsies and dramatically improve the clinical outcome, while reducing cost and time required for diagnosis. Proposed office based system is not only similar to the system already tested ex-vivo, but also tested in human clinical trials at the UCI labs. OCTMI has licensed OCT technology from University of California, Irvine. Researchers and clinician who participated in system development and clinical trials are either co-founders of OCTMI or collaborating in this project. Out technology which was developed in the laboratory is now being transferred to market place through OCTMI. Hence this proposal in idealfor PA-08-114 program.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Commercialization of the OncoE6TM Cervical Test for detection of HPV induced malignancy Cervical cancer is a major cause of the cancer-related mortality of women and causes over 250,000 deaths per year worldwide, with about 80% of total mortality occurring in developing and emerging countries. The implementation of appropriate screening technology for the detection of cervical pre-cancer and cancer is one key element towards reduction of this high death toll. Cervical cancer screening has become most visible in developed countries; where cervical cancer prevalence has diminished by implementation of Pap testing (Cytology), followed by colposcopy and histology examination if the Pap test is positive. The lack of screeningmethods in emerging countries is a major culprit for high cervical cancer mortality worldwide. In developing and emerging countries, Pap testing has not been implemented, mostly due to the high degree of medical infrastructure needed. In many rural low-resource settings, it proves difficult to relocate women with a positive cytology result and bring them back for follow-up treatment to the clinic. Pap testing has suboptimal clinical sensitivity an specificity (both 50-70%), and interpretation is highly subjective. Molecular tests ( HPV testing )  have been developed during the past decade as a solution for primary cervical cancer screening in the developed world, and in emerging countries who wish to implement cervical cancer screening programs. Under the preceding SBIR phase I and phase II grants, Arbor Vita Corporation (in collaboration with PATH) has developed the reagents and associated technology for a simple and robust test for direct detection of E6 HPV oncoprotein from cervical specimens. The OncoE6TMCervical Test was developed to commercialization readiness in emerging countries; it (Fig. 1) consists of a lateral-flow-based test for the detection of elevated  E6 oncoprotein of the most prevalent HPV types found in cervical cancer (HPV types 16 and 18). The OncoE6TM Cervical Test does not need complex equipment, advanced operator training, and is stable at room temperature. The OncoE6TM Cervical Test delivers the clinical specificity and positive predictive value required for a triage screening test for cervical malignancy in emerging countries. We plan to further develop the OncoE6TM Cervical Test towards commercialization. The approach will consist of implementing information gained from clinical field studies into continued product development to adapt the test to standard of care. We plan analytical performance studies, guard band studies, and extended stability studies. We plan to scale up manufacturing from the existing 6,000 unit batches to gt100,000 unit batches with verification and validation.An endpoint will provide validation in numerous geographic settings with different sample collection methods. A final product based on customer feedback, with larger scale manufacturing in compliance with GMP.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The OncoE6TM Cervical Test prototype has been developed for detection of cervical malignancy in emerging countries, with limited medical and technical infrastructure, and the need for a simple and specific test for detection of cervical malignancy or  the risk thereof is high. The OncoE6TM Cervical Test has been developed under previous SBIR phase I and II grants, and has undergone initial clinical validation in a large study in China. We now propose further product development and manufacturing scale-up towards commercialization in countries of urgent medical need.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The addiction treatment field continues to lag in implementing treatments based on scientific evidence. Treatment systems are now being held accountable for providing evidence-based treatments (EBTs). As a result, thereis increasing pressure on counselors to adopt and implement empirically-supported treatments such as motivational enhancement, cognitive behavioral treatment, and twelve-step facilitation. Current efforts rely primarily on downloads, online courses, and training announcements - all of which are static methods. These methods are not tailored to counselors&#039; educational needs or client caseloads. We are therefore proposing the development of Behavioral Health Solutions, which will provide tailored, real-time,evidence- based treatment recommendations to substance abuse counselors. These recommendations will be based on core elements of EBTs and provide step-by-step EBT delivery directions, instructional videos, and handouts for clients. The goal of this product is to increase the understanding and effective use of evidence-based practices so that counselors can more flexibly use these practices with their substance-abusing clients. Behavioral Health Solutions will be available on mobile devices, allowing counselors to easily access important interventions that are relevant to current client needs. This innovative product represents a major advancement over current training methods, which are asynchronous with treatment delivery, cumbersome, and often too costlyto use in day-to-day clinical work. Other advantages of this product include: (1) training that occurs in proximity to treatment, thereby increasing the potential for implementation; (2) content that is linked to pertinent client resources; (3) standard content review and updates (via Hazelden&#039;s large editorial operation); (4) content that is easily tagged and pushed, and (5) the ability to track counselor implementation of EBTs. This Phase II embodies a collaboration between two organizations with extensive experience in the addictions and behavioral health fields. Hazelden Publishing (Center City, MN) is a leader in providing evidence-based programs for the full continuum of care, ranging from prevention and intervention to treatment and recovery management. Inflexxion (Newton, MA) has conducted interactive health research in the addictions for the past 17 years. The goal of Phase II is to demonstrate that Behavioral Health Solutions will significantly improve counselor EBT implementation. The field test will examine the primary hypotheses that, relative to a control condition (treatment as usual with access to online EBT materials), counselors assigned to the Experimental group will evidence significantly greater: (1) EBT self-efficacy, (2) positive attitudes about the use of EBTs, and (3) self- reported use of EBTs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The addiction treatment field continues to lag in implementing treatments based on scientific evidence, but treatment systems are nowbeing held accountable for providing evidence-based treatments (EBTs). We propose to develop Behavioral Health Solutions, a mobile technology platform that will provide recommendations based on core EBT elements to substance abuse counselors. By enabling evidence-based treatment on a more consistent basis, this program can have significant public health impact through improved treatment of substance abusers.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): LightSpin Technologies, Inc., proposes a Phase II SBIR to develop a new photodetector component (the GaAs Photomultiplier Chip ) for ultrafast TOF-PET applications. The goal is to build a solid-state photodetector witha single photon timing resolution of 50 ps rms in Phase II and 25 ps rms in a follow-on effort. A single photon timing jitter of 25 ps rms would be about 4 better than the current state-of-the-art (photomultiplier tubes and silicon photomultiplier devicesfor TOF-PET). Furthermore, the GaAs Photomultiplier Chip  will achieve 25% quantum efficiency in Phase II and 50% in a follow-on effort, further improving the timing resolution in TOF-PET (compared to the 10 - 20% quantum efficiency of today&#039;s solutions).In Phase I, we demonstrated the ability to achieve single-photon rise times as fast as 100 picoseconds. In Phase II, these results will be extended to improved timing jitter, higher single photon detection efficiencies, and larger active areas. The breakthrough stems from LightSpin&#039;s innovation enabling compound semiconductors to be used for single photon detectors, combined with optimization of the monolithically integrated passive quench circuitry. GaAs is inherently faster than silicon due to its 5 higher mobility (reducing transit time spread) and it sharp avalanche breakdown characteristics (reducing jitter in the avalanche gain process). The end result of the Phase II effort will be an 8 8 array of 16 mm2 Photomultiplier Chips , coupled to a matching array of scintillators provided by Saint-Gobain Crystals and including high performance electrical readout circuitry and digitization electronics. The performance for ultrafast TOF-PET applications will be evaluated by Prof. Joel Karp at the University of Pennsylvania, and benchmarked against state-of-the-art alternatives. The Phase II goal is to demonstrate a TOF-PET coincidence timing resolution of 200 psec, which is sufficiently fast to enable a substantial improvement in PET performance in brain and breast imaging applications. Additionally, the Phase II project is expected to pave the way for a follow-on effort to reduce the coincidence timing resolution to below 50 psec, providing an order of magnitude improvement compared to currently available commercial TOF-PET systems.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed ultra-fast Photomultiplier Chip  will enable new generations of ultra-fast TOF-PET machines capable of providing a coincidence timing resolution of 200 picoseconds (3 cm) at the end of Phase II and eventually 50 picoseconds (0.75 cm). This timing resolution is sufficient to provide a substantial improvement in signal-to-noise for whole body, brain, and eventually breast and small animal imaging applications. The improved signal-to-noise can be used to reduce the radiation dose, improve the imaging speed, improve the spatial resolution, or some combination of the above.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Substance abuse treatment is often complicated by a client&#039;s family, employment, psychiatric, or legal problems. When these co-existing issues are addressed with evidence-based practices (EBPs), outcomes improve. The expansion of EBPs is especially important regarding Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT), which is the subject of a number of federal and state treatment initiatives. However, despite extensive efforts to educate clinicians through training, the integration of EBPs into clinical settings continues to lag. EBPs are most likely to be implemented if information is available at the point of service. These challenges strongly suggest the need for a technical solution. This proposal seeks to develop a clinical decision support (CDS) system within electronic health records (EHRs) through a collaboration of two companies that have developed a national standing in substance abuse treatment - Inflexxion (Newton, MA) and FEi (Columbia, MD). Inflexxion and FEi are seekingto develop the Behavioral Health Advisory Module (BHAM). This CDS will  plug into  Web Infrastructure for Treatment Services (WITS), a web-based EHR supported by FEi. By applying advanced statistical techniques (latent class analysis) and data mining to the extensive WITS dataset, we can assess the relationships between client profiles, delivered services, and outcomes. BHAM can identify which profile best fits a client and provide: (1) tailored, evidence-based practice recommendations, and (2) client engagement strategies (which have been shown to improve outcomes). In Phase I, we: completed a model comprised of three profiles of opiate/opioid users; developed an interactive prototype of BHAM; and demonstrated acceptance of the CDS concept by substance abuse experts and clinicians. The concept was also reviewed and supported by CDS and substance abuse expert consultants. The goal of Phase II is to fully develop and test BHAM in substance abuse treatment centers. The field test will examine the primary hypotheses that, relative to the Control condition, counselors in treatment facilities assigned to the BHAM program will provide or offer their clients significantly greater matched evidence-based and wraparound services. We will also examine the extent to whichclients being treated by counselors in the Experimental condition, relative to the Control Condition, demonstrate significantly: (1) greater engagement in treatment, (2) fewer alcohol/drug relapses, and (3) greater psychosocial functioning. And finally, we will examine the cost effectiveness of BHAM.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health potential of this project is very significant, and will shift the paradigm away from an asynchronous, training-based, evidence-based practice (EBP) implementation model, to a data-driven, continuing care model. The Behavioral Health Advisory Module (BHAM) can help serve the critical public health goal of overcoming barriers to the implementation of EBPs. It can also assist substanceabusers in maintaining their engagement with treatment and achieving better overall outcomes.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I proposal focuses on the development of a small-sized, portable, point-of-contact analytical instrument; a screening tool for the simultaneous detection of alcohol and narcotics. The core technology is a miniature gas chromatograph (Mini-GC) that uses a multi-detector system to analyze the drug traces.  Persons adversely affected by drugs of abuse comprise a substantial proportion of the patients that seek care in emergencydepartments. Seacoast&#039;s envisioned low-cost drug screener will provide physicians with an initial assessment of patients to facilitate the  treatment decision making and enhance patient throughput. Most importantly, the screening test is non-invasive, does not require a blood or urine sample, but instead collects traces of narcotics and transdermal alcohol from a patient&#039;s skin. The sample swabs will be an enhanced version of what is currently used at airports to look for explosives traces.  Seacoast&#039;s novel Mini  GC is independent of bulky carrier gas tanks but has the needed sensitivity through a combination of a synergistic sensor set. Specifically, a polymer coated quartz crystal microbalance, a metal oxide semiconductor, and an electrochemical ethanolsensor from the gas chromatograph&#039;s detector module.  The idea of monitoring transdermal alcohol by means of an ankle bracelet and the trace detection of narcotics by ion mobility spectroscopy have both been applied separately for years; however, the two concepts have never before been combined in one instrument and made available at low cost. Seacoast&#039;s next generation Mini-GC with the multi-detector system will close this gap.  This Phase II program is supported by UCSD&#039;s Medical Center ER team, which will organize an emergency department field trial where Seacoast&#039;s diagnostic Mini-GC will be compared to state-of- the-art urine or blood based toxicological laboratory tests.

We have developed an alveolar region-targeted aerosol/inhalation method for nicotine delivery to rodents and developed devices with specialized software that enable this new method to be used effectively. In both the nose-only device and free-moving exposure chambers, the aerosol droplet size distribution is within the respirable diameter range. By physically imitating the properties of cigarette smoke, aerosol inhalation produces nicotine PK in both the arterial and venous blood resembling the PK profile of humans smoking cigarettes. This noninvasive method overcomes the limitations of current nicotine delivery methods. We have demonstrated that this novel method and device enable rapid delivery of a controllable amount of nicotine into systemic circulation and induces dose-dependent behavioral responses. The goal of this Phase II project is to translate the prototypes into commercialized products- AeroDeliver(R) . Three Specific Aims are as follows: Aim 1. Develop and scale up a commercial product series of integrated aerosol inhalation systems including nose-only exposure devices and free-moving exposure chambers. We will create the integrated hardware and software, and scale up to simultaneously operate 16 AeroDeliver(R) systems. Aim 2. Further develop the novel alveolar region-targeted aerosol inhalation method for chronic intermittent nicotine exposure and validate it with animal testing. The device and protocol will be evaluated and validated using animal testing and by measuringplasma nicotine concentrations that simulate the PK profile in moderate to heavy human smokers. We will verify nicotine aerosol deposition in the lungs in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET) with radioactive labeled nicotine aerosol. Aim 3. Establish nicotine aerosol self-administration paradigms in drug dependence and reinforcement studies. The system will have positive and negative levers (for rats) or nosepoke sensors (for mice) for performance choice. The system will also perform fixed ratio (FR)and progressive ratio (PR) reinforcement schedules. We will evaluate the system in rodent experiments and compare the operation and results with conventional i.v. nicotine self-administration methods that use currently available commercial devices. In thecourse of animal testing, we will also develop an experimental  cookbook  with standardized protocols to facilitate comparison of results generated by different laboratories. Our products -AeroDeliver(R) system will be a powerful toolkit for studies of nicotine addiction, toxicology, teratogenicity and tobacco-related diseases, and ultimately, for facilitation of new therapeutic discovery. Furthermore, the significant potential for these toolkits to be used for other drugs of abuse such as marijuana, cocaine, and heroin will expand the market size for our products.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Tobacco-related deaths cost the United States approximately  200 billion each year. Nicotine is singularly responsible for the dependence-forming properties of tobacco smoking and, once introduced to the body, affects the brain within 15 seconds.Breaking nicotine addiction is challenging and relapse rates remain high. The extremely rapid timescale of nicotine action renders existing techniques for studying nicotine accumulation in the brain (e.g., microdialysis, PET, radioimmunoassay) ill-suited for addiction studies in freely moving animals. Biosensors are a proven technology for monitoring real-time changes in CNS neurochemical concentrations on a second-by-second basis. The overall goal of this proposal is the delivery of a biosensor that can detect nicotine in a freely moving animal at relevant in vivo concentrations and that is compatible with Pinnacle&#039;s existing turn-key systems. The most critical component of a biosensor is the enzyme used as the biorecognition element, and no aspect of a biosensor&#039;s final design is as vital as a properly folded enzyme with sufficient activity and stability profiles. In Phase I, we were highly successful in providing proof-of-concept for two critical components of the nicotine biosensor: (1) conversion of 6-hydroxynicotine oxidase into an oxidase with an enhanced kcat for nicotine (~0.2 sec-1) while maintaining a Km that is 1000-fold above expected in vivo concentrations, and (2) development of new, thinner membranes to support nicotine monitoring. We also successfully implemented a random selection and screening strategy that gave rise to new mutations that enhanced the performance characteristics of the engineered nicotine oxidase enzyme. Phase II will complete the nicotine enzyme optimization through ongoingdirected evolution of the nicotine oxidase enzyme. We will also continue the ongoing optimization of new films to improve biosensor sensitivity. The completion of this proposal will provide two important innovations to the scientific community: 1) A nicotine biosensor suitable for addiction studies that provides second-by-second changes of nicotine concentration in the CNS. 2) A refined approach for the development of new biosensors that target analytes important for addiction and for which no oxidase enzyme currently exists (i.e., cocaine and caffeine). Pinnacle will work in conjunction with an interdisciplinary consortium of leading scientists at the University of Kansas. When completed, this will be the first commercial biosensor specifically designed torecord nicotine in rodents and will represent the first commercialized biosensor for in vivo use that is based on an engineered oxidase enzyme for an analyte for which no enzyme previously existed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 50% of regular smokers die due to smoking-related complications. In addition, nicotine addiction associated with cigarette smoking takes a tremendous economic toll, costing the United States nearly  200 billion annually, including  97 billionin lost productivity and  96 billion in health care expenditures. This projec allows for a better understanding of nicotine addiction, which could advance smoking cessation research and potentially reduce 450,000 smoking-related deaths per year in the United States.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The evaluation and selection of safe and effective pharmacotherapies for drug abuse and addiction, as well as many other diseases and disorders, is performed through clinical trials that rely on patients taking the studied medication  at the specified time and frequency. To ensure accurate efficacy measures, adherence to the prescribed regimen must be known. Creare proposes to develop a mobile adherence monitoring system to record timing and dosage information in near-real time during these clinical trials. The Creare system includes confirmatory biomarkers to ensure accuracy of the adherence measures. The system allows for ecological momentary assessments linked to dosing time that provide additional measures of efficacyand drug safety of the test medication over time. During Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of our monitoring system by implementing an initial prototype and performing a pilot human subject test to demonstrate feasibility. During Phase II, we willfurther develop and integrate the hardware and software components of our system, and test the system in the laboratory and in a cohort of subjects on opiate substitution therapy. The Creare team is extremely well qualified to successfully develop and commercialize this system thanks to algorithms, software, and hardware Creare has previously developed for image processing, neuropsychological testing, data sharing, and mobile hearing assessment. Our Clinical Collaborator, Dr. John Mendelson, head of the Addiction and Pharmacology Research Laboratory at the California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute (APRL-CPMCRI), has extensive experience in clinical trials with illicit drug users, and pioneered the methods used in our proposed system.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In 2011, 22.5 million Americans 12 years or older used illicit drugs on a regular basis; the economics of such widespread illicit drug use impose a huge cost on our society. One of the National Institute on Drug Abuse&#039;s primary objectives is to develop successful treatments for drug abuse and addiction and improve treatment accessibility and implementation. The proposed real-time, cell phone-based mobile adherence monitoring system will greatly increase the accuracy and efficiency of clinical trials for substance abuse pharmacotherapies, thereby increasing the likelihood that effective treatment options for substance abusers will be developed and reduce the burden of substance abuse disorders on our society.",

As noted by a recent NIDCD Working Group,  In the US there are no readily accessible low-cost hearing screening programs.  The authors of this proposal, in collaboration with scientists from Indiana University and VU University Medical Center of Amsterdam, have developed and validated a low-cost screening test for hearing disability, for administration by telephone. This test is based on one that has been available for the past seven years in the Netherlands, versions of which are now in use in the UK, Australia, France, and Germany, and are being developed in several other countries. Validity of the US test has been demonstrated in studies conducted at the Indiana University Hearing Clinic and in cooperation with the Veterans Administration. This project will determine the kind and extent of marketing needed to insure substantial usage of the test and the kind and extent of follow-up needed to insure that those who fail it seek professional hearing services. In Year 1 the test will be launched in two metropolitan areas. In one it will be mainly publicized through mass media; in the other through presentations to local organizations. Interested persons will be directed to a website, where the test will be explained, and they will be invited t take the test for a fee of  4.00. The fee will support the cost of administering the test to right nd left ears, the collection andanalysis of demographic information from each person tested, the cost of follow-up, and the cost of publicizing the test either through mass media, such as the AARP Magazine and local newspapers, radio and television; or through presentations to service organizations such as the Lions, Kiwanis, Rotary, retirement homes, labor unions, and religious organizations. Net program income during this project will be devoted to the expansion of the areas in which the test is available and the refinement of methods of publicizing the test. Based on Year 1 results, marketing plans will be implemented in additional metropolitan areas in Year 2. If the US response rates are similar to those reported in the Netherlands and the UK, between 1.5 and 2.0 million persons couldeventually be tested annually in the US. The two differences between this test and the large number of  free  tests advertised by hearing aid dealers and manufacturers are that (1) it has been proven to be a valid screening test in extensive clinical testing and (2) it is made available by a consortium of two universities and a test- development company, none of which have any financial connections to the hearing aid industry and thus have no conflict of interest in the test outcomes.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: About 80% of the hearing impaired persons in the US and in European countries have never had a hearing test. Since 2003 telephone-administered screening tests have been developed and successfully implemented in the Netherlands, the UK, Australia, Germany and France and soon will be introduced in several other countries. A US version of the telephone test will be deployed, first in two metropolitan areas totaling approximately 3,000,000 residents and then, if justifiedby the volume of calls, throughout the US. This research-validated, inexpensive ( 4.00) and convenient screening test will provide an attractive alternative to  free  hearing tests offered by commercial sources with significant conflicts of interest in theoutcome of the tests, and may lead to improved productivity and quality of life for large numbers of hearing-impaired men and women.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Roughly 30 million Americans suffer from hearing loss and would benefit from some form of hearing augmentation. However, the hearing aid (HA) adoption rate is low, less than 25% [Kochkin, (2009)] and those who do adoptwait more than 10 years before doing so [Donahue, (2010)]. There are a variety of reasons for the low utilization rate and long delay in adopting HAs including effectiveness, price, comfort, size, and cosmetic issues. Clearly there is a need to improve HAsso that those who suffer from hearing impairment can be more effectively helped to improve their quality of life and productivity through better treatment. In this proposal, the development of a new microphone for HA applications is sought as one avenue to improve HA effectiveness and increase utilization. In particular, development of the first piezoelectric, micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) microphones that satisfy the stringent acoustical specifications of the hearing aid industry will be undertaken. The three specific aims of the grant are to (1) design and fabricate the MEMS piezoelectric transducer element, (2) design and fabricate the amplifying electronics for readout of the transducer&#039;s electrical signal, and (3) design an appropriate housingfor the mechanical and electrical elements that meets the requirements for HA applications. Compared to the existing electret condenser microphone (ECM) based technology that has dominated the field for many years, the new microphone will: be more robust to the external environment, stable over time, ease hearing aid assembly, and deliver superior acoustic performance at a smaller size. Because the MEMS fabrication applied to create this device is based on the same processes used in the semiconductor industry, once the design of these devices is perfected they can be made at low cost and easily integrated with processing electronics. Our ultimate goal is to develop a microphone that provides better acoustic performance than present HAs at a cost comparable to microphones used for cell phones. The availability of robust, stable, and miniature microphones will improve existing and facilitate the development of new HA systems that utilize multiple microphones for directional sensing and noise cancellation. The goal of this NIH SBIR is to build these microphone prototypes, which will serve as the basis for improved microphones for the hearing aid industry.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Even though roughly 30 million Americans suffer from hearing loss and would benefit from some form of hearing augmentation the hearing aid (HA) adoption rate is less than 25% [Kochkin, (2009)]. In this proposal, a new class of HA microphones is to be developed that will reduce their cost and enable new types of HAs to be developed. Increased utilization of more effective HAs would help those who suffer from hearing impairment by improving their quality of life and productivity through better treatment.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Universal newborn hearing screening is mandated in the US and is performed in the postpartum hospital setting. Current physiology-based hearing screening tests are unable to detect late-onset hearing loss caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Therefore, a complementary screening approach has been suggested to prevent disabilities associated with CMV-related hearing loss by early detection and intervention. A nucleic acid test has been described to screen newborns for congenital CMV infection using saliva specimens where it is more sensitive than the dried blood spots traditionally used by the newborn screening laboratories. Newborn screening programs do not have the infrastructure necessary to use newborn saliva samples and molecular assays. Advanced Liquid Logic&#039;s digital microfluidic technology is a recognized innovative, low-cost, and automated liquid handling system that can address this challenge. The objective of this Fast-Track application is to develop an integrated lab-on-a-chip to perform screening of congenital CMV infection in newborns using saliva samples. Specific aims in Phase I are to develop protocols for CMV purification from saliva samples and for viral DNA amplification on-cartridge, and to integrate a  sample-to-answer  CMV screening assay on the digital microfluidic platform. Success in Phase I will result in a Phase II continuation where the specific aims will be (i) to develop a point-of-care newborn screening platform, (ii) to optimize the  sample-to-answer  CMV protocol in this platform and assess its analytical performance, and (iii) to perform a method comparison with the  gold standard  rapid saliva culture using neonatal saliva samples in collaboration with the University of Alabama at Birmingham.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   Newborn hearing screening is performed on almost every baby born in the US but some infants develop hearing loss caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection after the baby passes the current hearing screening test. Therefore, a complementary screening approach has been suggested to prevent CMV-related hearing loss by early detection and intervention. In this project, a digital microfluidic platform will be developed to perform CMV screening at the point-of-care using asaliva sample. Such technology can significantly impact the health outcomes for infants with increased risk of hearing loss caused by congenital CMV infection.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evaluation of dental tobacco cessation tool in practice-based research network This Phase II project will finish development and evaluate QuitAdvisorDDS as a tool for dental providers to advise patients on tobacco cessation. The University of Kentucky will evaluate the effectiveness of QuitAdvisorDDS in increasing quit attempts in tobacco using patients. The evaluation will be conducted within the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research&#039;s (NIDCR) NationalDental Practice- based Research Network (NDPBRN). Tobacco use severely affects dental health, and 80% of dentists consider tobacco cessation counseling and advice as one of their medical responsibilities. However, the majority of dental health care workersdo not do this. Reasons for this inaction are multifaceted, including lack of training, confidence, time, and funding. Health Decision Technologies (HDT) is developing QuitAdvisorDDS as a tool for dental providers to advise patients on tobacco cessation.This interactive, web-distributable tool assists dentists and dental hygienists in providing patient-tailored tobacco cessation counseling using proven patient-centered counseling techniques. QuitAdvisorDDS also enables dental providers to rapidly determine the patient&#039;s stage of readiness for change through four simple prompted questions. Once the dental provider has determined the patient&#039;s acceptance level, QuitAdvisorDDS will automatically proceed to a scripted motivational interview tailored to the patient&#039;s stage of change, while providing relevant health behavior information dentists can use to intervene with during the appointment. Finally, in addition to gathering information prior to the clinical encounter, QuitAdvisorDDS is also be able to track dental provider behavior -identifying the clinician using the application, recording a time and date stamp each time the application is opened, recording which sections of the application are accessed and how much time is spent in each - thereby making it possible to evaluate healthcare delivery services, ensure quality treatment, and aid in the conduct of research.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project has the potential to impact public health by improving dentists&#039; knowledge and skills for tobacco and smoking cessation counseling. This will encourage patients to quit smoking/using tobacco, thus increasing overall public health, and reducing mortality and morbidity related to these habits.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to further develop an immunotherapeutic strategy for HIV-associated malignancy based on the role of HPV in the pathogenesis and perform the pre-clinical experiments with a new drug whichallow us to enter clinical trials to test its safety and effectiveness. HPV related cancers express the E6/E7 oncoproteins of HPV that are ideal targets for immune inducing vaccines. We developed a vaccine based upon a novel adenovirus serotype-5 vector (Ad5) platform with unique and additional deletions of the viral DNA polymerase and the pre-terminal protein in the early gene 2b (E2b) region (Ad5 [E1-, E2b-]). In studies employing infectious disease and cancer antigens, we reported that new Ad5 [E1-, E2b-] vector vaccines are superior to current Ad5 [E1-] vector vaccines (containing deletion in the early gene 1 (E1) region) when used to induce CMI responses in a multiple homologous immunization regimen. We have demonstrated that significant antigen specific CMI responses are induced in mice and monkeys despite the presence of pre- existing Ad5 immunity. Our data indicates that the new Ad5 [E1-, E2b-] vectors induces robust CMI responses against tumor associated antigens (TAA) resulting in anti-tumor activity, even in the presence of pre-existing Ad5 immunity. We have constructed and produced a modified HPV-E6/E7 gene that expresses non-oncogenic early gene 6 (E6) and early gene 7 (E7) HPV proteins. We have incorporated this modified HPV-E6/E7 gene into thenew recombinant Ad5 [E1-, E2b-] vector platform (Ad5 [E1-, E2b-]-HPV-E6/E7) to be used as an immunotherapeutic for the treatment of patients with HPV-E6/E7 expressing cancers. This recombinant platform induces immune responses by expressing the modified HPV-E6/E7 antigens after direct transfection of antigen presenting cells via injection. We evaluated this dru combination with a toll-like receptor agonist (TLRa) platform designed to enhance immune responses induced by the vector. In an Ad5 immune murine cancer model employing the modified HPV-E6/E7 gene insert, the immunogenicity and in vivo anti-tumor effects of repeated immunizations with the Ad5 [E1-, E2b-]-HPV-E6/E7 with or without the addition of Ad5 [E1-, E2b-]-TLRa were compared. Significantly higherlevels of HPV-E6/E7 directed CMI activity was induced in mice immunized with Ad5 [E1-, E2b-]-HPV-E6/E7 plus Ad5 [E1-, E2b-]-TLRa as compared with mice immunized with Ad5 [E1-, E2b-]-HPV-E6/E7 alone. Importantly, mice treated by immunotherapy with Ad5 [E1-, E2b-]-HPV-E6/E7 with or without the addition of Ad5 [E1-, E2b-]-TLRa experienced large reductions in tumor growth as compared with control mice injected with Ad5 [E1-, E2b-]-null (empty vector). These results indicate that immunotherapy of HPV-E6/E7 expressing tumors using the new Ad5 [E1-, E2b-]-HPV-E6/E7 induces potent anti-tumor activity. Our previous research data also indicates that this new immunotherapeutic drug may be used in conjunction with chemotherapy/irradiation treatment to induce effectiveanti-tumor activity. The studies in the present pre-clinical program will allow us to advance manufacturing approaches and acquire data that will allow us to advance to FDA approved clinical trials           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this study, we will develop a new immunotherapy to treat HPV induced cancers such as oropharyngeal and tonsillar cancers as well as certain cervical cancers. The new approach is to use an adenoviral based drug (Ad5 [E1-, E2b-]-HPV-E6/7) to treat HIV+patients with HPV-associated Head and Neck cancers. Our published research data indicates that this novel immunotherapeutic drug induces anti-tumor activity and may be used in conjunction with chemotherapy/irradiation treatment for patients. These studiesset the stage for a first in man clinical trial to test this approach in HIV+ Head and Neck cancer.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Chronic gingival inflammation of the soft tissue surrounding the tooth afflicts over half of all American adults. In the most severely affected, progression of this inflammatory process to the deeper periodontal ligaments and alveolar bone results in tooth loss from loss of mandibular anchorage. Gingivitis and periodontitis are initiated  by chronic infection of the gingival crevice with bacteria such as Porphryomonas gingivalis. Risk for gingivitis is universal, but subjects with haplotypes of IL-1B producing higher IL-1  levels in  crevicular fluid, diabetics and smokers all have a more exuberant response to bacterial biofilm leading to serious periodontal disease. Regular brushing and flossing, and semi-annual scalingand root planing to remove plaque and biofilm are effective preventative strategies in normal individuals, but are inadequate to stop progression of serious periodontal disease in high-risk subjects such as diabetics, in whom interaction of diabetes-related advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) with the receptor for advanced glycation end- products (RAGE) promotes accelerated periodontal inflammation.  In Phase I, GlycoMira Therapeutics described a proprietary family of 5 kDa semi-synthetic glycosaminoglycan ethers (SAGEs), derived from sulfation and alkylation of hyaluronic acid (HA), that are intrinsically non-anticoagulant. SAGEs are systemically and topically safe anti-inflammatory agents that block P- and L-selectin, inhibit human neutrophil elastase(HLE), block complement receptor-3 (CR3, also known as Mac-1), and block interaction of RAGE with its known important ligands, including AGEs, high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB-1) and S100 calgranulins. In Phase I, the GlycoMira team demonstrated that the lead SAGE, GM-0111, has at least five salutary effects for treating periodontitis. First, it decreases IL-1 - and P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated IL-1 , prostaglandin E2, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 1, 2, 3, and 9 release from macrophages and human gingival fibroblasts. Second, it blocks CR3-mediated internalization of P. gingivalis by macrophages. Third, it inhibits P. gingivalis LPS-induced formation of multinucleated osteoclasts from blood monocytes. Fourth, it reduces TNF- , IL-1 , IL-6, and MMP-2 and -9 levels in gingival extracts from diabetic P. gingivalis-infected rats. Finally, and most importantly, it inhibits alveolar bone loss when administered parenterally in a diabetic P. gingivalis-infected rat model of accelerated periodontal disease.  In Phase II, GlycoMira will test  the hypothesis that GM-0111, can be an effective local therapy for periodontal disease. We propose to (i) use the diabetic rat model to show efficacy of local administration, (ii) explore th ability of GM-0111 to alter or block osteoclast activation and reduce bone resorption, (iii) test tolerability of topical formulations for delivery of GM-0111 into the sulcus in dose-ranging studie in beagle dogs, and (iv) conduct a pivotal study in beagle dogsto test the efficacy of the selected formulation.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Chronic gingival inflammation afflicts over half of all American adults, evolves into frank periodontal disease, and results in tooth loss. Periodontitis is caused by infection of the gingival crevice and production of subgingival microbial plaque, which results in leukocyte-mediated inflammation and alveolar bone resorption. Importantly, periodontal disease is exacerbated by diabetes and smoking,and periodontitis substantially increases the risk of systemic illness such as cardiovascular and renal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, preeclampsia and pre-term delivery. We propose to develop anionic, partially lipophilic hyaluronic acid derivatives as asimple mechanistically-based treatment for this chronic and extraordinarily common dental disorder.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Small Business Innovation Research project aims to develop hard ceramic coatings that will reduce the sliding resistance of archwires in their brackets during orthodontic treatment procedures. Excessive sliding resistance, which is a combination of friction and notching/binding behavior, works against tooth motion as the bracket slides along the wire into a new position, resulting in less predictable outcomes, and requiring increased force, treatment time,  chair time,  and patient costs. If successful, the hard coatings will decouple sliding resistance from other properties of the arch-wire material, such as stiffness and provide the practitioner with new material systems for solving specific patient problems. PhaseII will continue and expand highly promising Phase I results, in which thin coatings of alumina, zirconia, and titania were applied by ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD). The coatings decisively reduced sliding resistance of archwires in tests conductedby a major manufacturer of orthodontic appliances. The testing showed major reductions of both sliding friction and notching/binding behavior; and two of the coating materials demonstrated high resistance to scratching and delamination. The Phase II program will improve on coating properties through optimization of IBAD parameters, evaluate the coated archwires by in vitro testing in a more realistic configuration, and make a final selection of coating material and deposition parameters for a clinical study. Coated archwires will be evaluated in a limited clinica study at a major research university to test their efficacy in early and intermediate stages of tooth straightening in children. The commercialization potential of ceramic-coated orthodontic archwires is very high, as already demonstrated by the Phase I involvement by our industrial collaborators in laboratory testing. Phase III commercialization would be a straightforward expansion of Spire Biomedical&#039;s coating and surface- modification business, which specializes in surface treatments for orthopedic prostheses, catheters, and other medical devices.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this program, nano-crystalline ceramics will be applied to the surface of orthodontic archwires using ion beam assisted deposition to reduce sliding resistance. Excessive sliding resistance works against tooth motion as the bracket slides along the wire into a new position. These ceramic coatings will produce more predictable outcomes, requiring less force, shorter treatment time, and decreased patient costs. A limited clinical trial  will be conducted to demonstrate these effects.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Techshot, Inc. has successfully completed SBIR Phase I and Phase II research demonstrating that magnetically labeled porcine islets of Langerhans can be isolated from contaminating exocrine tissue by flow sorting usinga quadrupole magnetic separator ( Quadrasep ) designed for that purpose. Magnetically sorted islets are superior in morphology and physiology to those isolated by the presently used centrifugation method. A Phase IIB Competing Renewal project is proposed in which Techshot will collaborate with scientists at the University of Arizona, University of Louisville, IKOTECH LLC and Vitacyte LLC to prepare this technology for regulatory approval and commercialization. A business plan is presented in which the target market is initially human isologous islet transplantation, a clinically approved and proven procedure. Subsequently allogeneic and xenogeneic transplantation are expected to follow as these markets mature along with increased use of magnetic flow separation. Objective: Techshot proposes translational research leading to the submission of a Device Master File (DMF) to the FDA supporting use of Quadrasep as a manufacturing tool for effecting the improved isolation of human pancreatic islets of Langerhans for therapeutic transplantation for the prevention of diabetes in pancreatectomy patients. Description: The project plan includes (1) Improving the existing successful quadrupole sorter technology to meet required commercial and regulatory standards including cGMP fabrication, (2) Proving the technology through a series of human islet purifications in direct comparison with current methods using widely accepted criteria for islet evaluation, and (3) Approving the technology through application for a Device Master File with the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. The outcome of the project is expected to include the development of an instrument and consumables kit that improves the quality of islet transplants for which there is increasing demand. These outcomes, in turn, represent improved opportunities to eventually cure type-1 diabetes, which is currently only managed.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are more than 3 million Type 1 diabetes patients in the United States and anadditional 30,000 new patients per year. A permanent cure (insulin independence) for Type 1 diabetes has been tested on a few hundred patients in Phase 3 clinical trials. It consists of producing healthy islets of Langerhans, small bits of tissue in thepancreas that produce insulin in response to high blood sugar, from organ-donor pancreases. These islets are transplanted to the liver of the patient, who sometimes returns to normal blood sugar levels. Due to islet loss and damage during the isolation process only 26% of the transplant recipients received enough islets from one organ, and 74% of the recipients required islets from two to four donors. Separating islets by a new method, magnetic flow sorting has been shown to produce superior samples of islets. The proposed project will further demonstrate this fact and prepare the method of magnetic flow sorting for the improved manufacture of purified islets for use in cell therapies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New therapies are desperately needed to relieve patients with Type 1 diabetes from the neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy associated with the current standard of treatment, injected insulin. Transplantation of pancreatic islet  -cells, in combination with immunosuppressant to avoid immune rejection, is restricted to a subgroup of diabetics and is limited by the shortage in availability of donor islets. Combination treatment using Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Agonist (EGFRA) and Gastrin (G17) results in an increase in  -cell mass and reverses hyperglycemia in diabetic mice and rats. Because of short half-life (minutes) of both G17 and EGFRA, these were administered by infusion (rats) or frequent daily injection (mice) and a clinical trial of this treatment combination suffered from limited efficacy. Results from Phase 1 SBIR demonstrated the proof of concept that the experimental diabetes treatment using a combination of EGFRA and G17 can be improved significantlyby the use of EGFRA with Protected-graft-copolymer (PGC) excipient (PGC-EGFRA). The PGC protects and stabilizes EGFRA in the blood (10- fold stabilization) in combination with Omeprazole (OPZ), an over the counter proton pump inhibitor for the treatment ofstomach hyperacidity. The OPZ in this combination provides sustained elevation (up to 1000 fold over the baseline) of blood G17 level (over 24hr versus few minutes from G17 injection) without the associated hyperacidity of the stomach. The aims of the Phase 2 SBIR are to 1) produce well characterized PGC formulations, 2) find the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of the formulations and the most effective dosing regimen for the treatment of STZ-diabetic mice, and 3) find the most effective dosing regimen for each formulation with or without Anti-CD3 for the treatment of NOD mice to achieve a cure rate of higher than 60%, and 4) to evaluate stability and safety of each formulation. At the end of Phase 2, we will have a single treatment regimen which we will use to collect data for an IND filing.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This Phase 2 application will be a full pre-clinical development and optimization of the treatment regimen effective in preserving and enhancing islet  -cell function in diabetic mice. This treatment will alleviate suffering of people with diabetes and will  be a cost saving treatment that will reduce the economic burden to society. The eventual goal is the filing of an IND application with the FDA.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II SBIR application proposes the development and testing of a theory-based health promotion mobile phone application, BodiMojo, for adolescents (ages 13-18). The product is designed to: (1) promote wellness,healthy eating and physical activity in adolescents through a mobile program that can be accessed via any cell phone or wireless device; and (2) develop a service administrator tool for health clinics and youth organizations to monitor and reward progressamong their youth. Efforts to prevent obesity and improve nutrition intake and physical activity are very challenging to implement with this age group. This is in large part due to difficulties in program uptake and adherence, as well as social stigmatization and a lack of a sense of urgency about potential long-term adverse outcomes in adulthood. Phase I results clearly identified the need to engage teenagers with personal relevancy and to promote positive actions and reward small successes that may lead to behavior change. Attention to psychosocial issues such as mood and body image is clearly key to success in obesity prevention efforts. This project is designed to improve psychosocial factors, including body esteem, mood, and goal adherence, as they mediate the adoption of healthy eating and physical activity behaviors. Based on the proof-of-concept in Phase I, this application intends to fully develop the mobile program using gamification and social networks by capitalizing on the unique and broad-basedcapability of mobile phones. The second aim will be to develop a web-based tool and manual for health centers and school health staff to engage and track youth members in their efforts toward improving health behaviors. The final aim is to test the efficacy of and adherence to the mobile program in a randomized controlled field study among overweight and obese adolescents who are members of a large HMO.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of the proposed research is based on the growing demand for healthcare resources to treat and manage prostatic disease, particularly benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and cancer. Both the incidence andcost of treatment for BPH, and its complications, are growing rapidly with the aging U.S. population; prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer deaths among men in the U.S. There is a clear need for minimally invasive, cost-effective therapiesto match the outcomes of surgical treatment options, which are associated with significant morbidity and complications. Prostate injections have not become standard of care due to inadequate drug distribution with needles. The Applicants have developed amicroporous hollow fiber catheter (MiHFC) for improved injection distribution in the prostate. Phase II innovations focus on further developing MiHFC and combining existing treatment planning methods for drug delivery injections into human prostates with the objective to develop a system that is ready for human clinical use. The same MiHFC device with small changes would be adaptable for use in many other human clinical applications needing improved injection systems, such as liver, kidney and other solid organs. This would allow researchers to use MiHFC devices for other research projects involving human drug injections, either with or without treatment planning. Hypothesis: The MiHFC injection system being developed in Phase II will give urologists and researchers a more reliable tool to plan and deliver injection therapies into the human prostate. Preliminary Data: In Phase I research, the innovative use of applicant&#039;s MiHFC to improve injection drug delivery into the prostate was successful with MiHFC significantly improving ethanol distribution in canine prostates as compared to needle injections. Specific Aims: The objective of this Phase II proposal is to further develop the applicant&#039;s innovative drug delivery system for improved prostate disease therapies and to provide the bench and animal study data to accelerate its clinical use. Aim 1: Finalize human use MiHFC design. The Phase I MiHFC design will be optimized to meet human use specifications established from user requirements. Aim 2: Infusion studies and analysis. Human ex vivo and baboon in vivo studies will be conducted to assess MiHFC safety and agent distribution and to develop of a prostate specific treatment planning system. Aim 3: Design verification and 510(k) submission. Design verification test data and FDA 510(k) clearance will facilitate clinical adoption and commercialization.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuropeptide somatostatin analogs are important therapeutics for the treatment of hormone secreting tumors with annual sales of ~ 1.7B. However, the currently available peptide depots are effective in only half the patients with growth hormone secreting tumors, and patients with carcinoids can rapidly become resistant to these drugs. Somatostatin analogs act by stimulating sst2A, a G protein coupled receptor, but the currently available agents cause desensitization via internalization of the receptor, resulting  in reduced or complete loss of efficacy. We hypothesized that biased agonists of the somatostatin receptor that maintain strong Gi activation, but do not cause desensitization, would normalize hormone levels in agreater percentage of patients and improve efficacy in patients not adequately controlled by currently available agents. In Phase I, we proposed to validate this hypothesis, using assays for both receptor activation and internalization to identify new nonpeptide, orally-active somatostatin biased agonists that do not cause desensitization, with the goal of providing improved therapeutic options for patients with these tumors. In Phase I, we identified several small molecule agonists that are indeed potent activators of Gi, but with far less propensity for, or no evidence of inducing receptor internalization and desensitization. These proof of concept studies showed that we can identify compounds with the desired profile using our assay cascade, and can support the medicinal chemistry lead optimization efforts required to identify a candidate suitable for clinical development. In Phase II, we will optimize our leads identified in Phase I to deliver a novel orally available drug candidate, which meets our defined criteria, to undergo the non-clinical toxicology studies necessary to support clinical development. In addition to improved clinical efficacy, orally delivered agents would also reduce the need for physician office visits, eliminate the pain and discomfort of depot injections, and lower the manufacturing costs compared to expensive peptide depot formulations. This project promises to deliver a new cost effective therapeutic agent with a novel pharmacological profile that leads to improved efficacy. Our approach towards the identification of such an agent is innovative in that we are incorporating receptor regulatory assays (to detect receptor desensitization), in addition to affinity (or activity-based) assays. This combination of assays wil be used to guide lead optimization efforts. Importantly, the G protein coupled receptor family is the largest gene family in the human genome and a rich source of proven targets for drug discovery, which share common regulatory and signaling mechanisms. Therefore, if successful, this work will not only provide improved agents for patients with hormone secreting tumors, but will also support a general novel strategy for optimizing agonist drugs that can be exploited to target many other GPCRs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop orally bioavailable, biased agonists of the somatostatin receptor sst2A, with improved and prolonged efficacy, for the treatment of hormone secreting tumors.

In addition, this work will provide the foundation for a general strategy for thedevelopment of optimized agonists for many additional GPCR drug targets.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In Phase 1, measuring and characterizing glucose oscillations in yeast cells immobilized on the surface of a glucose sensor was completed. Using this as a model, it was postulated that within the subcutaneous environment, cells (e.g., fibroblasts, adipocytes) would be in close proximity to the surface of the glucose sensor thereby mimicking the in vitro environment of the yeast cells on the surface of the glucose sensor. A 12- hour clinical study was completed wherein glucose measurements within interstitial fluid were highly correlated with reference glucose measurements. Moreover, measurements of glucose oscillations within subcutaneous tissue showed clear differences between normal subjects and those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Further studies in Phase 2 are aimed at building a data base of measurements, over longer time periods, to provide the means for characterizing different states of glycemia along the continuum from normal to impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes. Information gained from human studies in Phase 2, could provide the means of controlling an insulin pump based on periodic changes in cellular glucose metabolism, rather than relying solely on peripheral fingerstick blood glucose measurementsfor calibration purposes. Continuous glucose monitoring is an evolving, revolutionary technology that promises to improve the quality of life for millions of people with diabetes. In order to realize its full potential, more accurate devices that can be used for diagnosis and control, by providing physiological feedback to an insulin pump, are required. Measuring subcutaneous metabolic oscillations of glucose could provide a missing link for insulin pump feedback control, more accurate glucose measurementsand novel methods for diagnosing stages of impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. Measuring and characterizing aberrations in glucose metabolism within interstitial fluid and correlating them to known defects in glucose metabolism could be a major leap forward in diabetes management and provide an inexpensive tool for discovering new insights into the genetic and molecular origins of insulin resistance. The proposed Phase 2 research may result in a CGM system that reduces the need for frequentfingerstick blood glucose re-calibration eventually leading to a user calibration-free CGM that can be interfaced with an insulin pump to form an artificial pancreas.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The potential for continuousglucose monitoring systems (CGMs) to detect cellular glycemic oscillations in interstitial fluid will advance the use of CGM technology into the realm of preventative medicine by providing an inexpensive screening tool, capable of identifying people with abnormal glucose metabolism long before overt clinical symptoms are apparent. In addition, our proposed research seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in continuous glucose monitoring by developing a convenient and useful method for evaluating glycemic control over shorter periods of time (days or weeks) that could potentially supplement quarterly assessments of glycemic control using hemoglobin A1C measurements. The measurement of subcutaneous glucose oscillations could lead to better control of an insulinpump based on cellular feedback as opposed to current CGM technologies that require frequent re-calibration using fingerstick glucose monitoring.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An estimated 11.5 percent of adults (approx 23 million people) suffer from chronic kidney disease. Among people suffering from ESRD, the mortality is approximately 163.8 deaths per 1,000 patient years. Hemodialysis is the leading treatment for more than 341,000 patients in the United States with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or kidney failure, which can be caused by common chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. The market for AV grafts is increasing since not all patients can wait the length of time for the fistula to mature or it cannot be used for people with fragile veins. Thus, s the number of Americans with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) continues to rise, the use of grafts will continue to be employed as a means of vascular access. As the number of diabetics within the hemodialysis patient population grows, it is also likely that graft demand will remain strong. The problem with the current grafts is their high potential for clotting and restenosis,an high potential for causing an infection. They frequently develop stenoses at the venous anastomosis and have a high rate of failure. Despite enthusiasm for PTFE and other biological grafts, there is no ideal solution to treating ESRD, as they have not been proven to be efficacious as a vascular access. Additionally, native arterial venous fistulas also a high failure rate PeriTec Biosciences has developed a novel peritoneum lined stent (PLS). The PLS has shown excellent performance in animal and international human clinical studies for both dialysis access failure and femoral artery occlusive disease. Peritec now aims to develop the stent graft to use as a treatment method to improve dialysis access stenosis. These unique tissue lined stents require special handling in a novel delivery system developed by the company to maintain their physical and biological integrity. Peritec has developed a more efficient and safe stent scaffold specifically designed to accommodate the tissue; the desired characteristicsinclude different radial forces and flared ends. This development will take place over the next 3 years. Phase I is underway and we seek funding to accelerate development. Computer aided design (CAD) models will be tested for various non-clinical factorssuch as fluid flow analysis, risk analysis, and material characterization of stents. All tests will be performed under ASTM standards and appropriate FDA requirements will be met. Phase II, includes mechanical tests of the tissue stents to a higher degreeof function. Accelerated fatigue tests will be done with the objective of determining the relationship between the stress range and number of times it can be applied before failure. These specific tests are Pulsatile and Axial/Torsion Testing. Finally, i vivo animal testing will be performed to validate our stent designs. This will allow the use of the unique tissue lined Peritec stents to meet a serious and growing unmet need in the treatment of End Stage Renal Disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   With the rapid increase in the people suffering from End Stage Renal Disease associated with aging, hypertension, and diabetes, there is a serious unmet need for creating a suitable vascular access to perform hemodialysis. Unfortunately, while the existing initial procedures are effective in the acute stage, recurrent failure is the nom. The cost of failure is very high. One highly touted minimally invasive procedure designed to improve on these failures is using the combination of a stent and prosthetic (called a stent graft) The mechanical stent props open the blockage, and the prosthetic provides a new surface for the blood to flow through. However, after just a short period of time the prosthetic causes an inflammatory response, which leads to yet anotherrecurrent failure. Additionally, native arterial venous fistulas also have high failure rates, albeit they do perform better than AV grafts. The vein may not mature properly to a size where blood flow is sufficient and the fistula requires months to heal and the vein may become more difficult to cannulate compared to a graft. Our goal is to improve the patency in the patients intervened on with failing arteriovenous grafts and fistulas. We believe that intervening with a stent graft with a biological material attached to it an improve patency. Peritec has developed a biologically tissue lined stent which will improve on current results.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Organ transplantation is a lifesaving option for those with end stage renal disease. In spite of many improvements in organ procurement, transplant procedures and immune suppression, the damage done by ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) remains problematic, leading to primary graft nonfunctional, delayed graft function and graft failure. The critical shortage of donor kidneys has increased the use of expanded criteria organs (ECD) and donation after cardiac death (DCD) organs that are even more susceptible to IRI damage. Thus reducing IRI will not only improve the success rate of standard criteria (SCD) organs, but may also allow greater use of ECD and DCD organs, thus increasing the number of transplants that can be performed and lives that can be saved. Enhanced nitric oxide (NO) signaling can benefit preservation of kidneys during transport and alleviate IRI upon transplantation. However, the founders of Vasculox discovered that thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) binding to its receptor, CD47, limits NO signaling throughout the vascular system thereby worsening IRI. Blocking the TSP1-CD47 system with anti-CD47 monoclonal antibodies (CD47mAbs) dramatically improves outcomes in models of kidney, liver, brain, hindlimb and soft tissueIRI. In our Phase I grant period, we have shown that treatment of harvested rat kidneys with CD47mAbs prior to 6 hr. of cold ischemia provides substantial protection against histological damage and improves markers of both kidney damage and function. Mostsignificantly, treatment of donor kidneys with a CD47mAb also enhances survival of the recipient. Vasculox has successfully humanized a CD47mAb (CD47humAb) for use in transplantation that has the unique property of binding to many species including rodent,pig and human. Here we will to test the CD47humAb in both small (rat) and large (pig) animal models of kidney transplantation. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Rat kidney SCD and DCD transplants. 1A. Determine in a syngeneic transplant model if kidneys subjected to warm ischemic times to mimic DCD kidneys can be rescued by treating the donor kidney and/or recipient with CD47humAb. 1B. Test the efficacy of the CD47humAb in an allogeneic (Brown Norway to Lewis) rat kidney transplant model with the use of an immunosuppressive drug (tacrolimus) under SCD and DCD conditions to mimic the mismatch that occurs with human donors/recipients. Aim 2. Porcine kidney DCD transplants. Determine if CD47humAb therapy can improve the performance of kidneys subjected to a periodof warm ischemia to mimic the transplantation of marginal DCD kidneys. Dr. Douglass Hanto, who developed this model in pigs, is our consultant for this study. Following his protocol, we will introduce a 60 minute warm ischemic time prior to harvest and cold storage to mimic human DCD kidney transplantation. This will establish proof of concept for CD47humAb treatment in a large animal model for the use of marginal organs that are more susceptible to IRI and therefore worse transplant outcomes.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The founders of Vasculox, Inc. have discovered a regulatory receptor, CD47 that inhibits nitric oxide signaling in all vascular tissues. Nitric oxide provides many beneficial effects in the vascular system, including limiting ischemia-reperfusion injury that  occurs during organ transplantation. Therefore, blocking CD47 and preventing nitric oxide inhibition improves ischemia-reperfusion injury and holds promise as a means to improve the condition of organs destined for transplant and to control the damage to the recipient caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury. Vasculox has developed a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets CD47 and in this project aims to test the efficacy of such an antibody in animal models of kidney transplantation that reflect the situation of the human transplant patient. This will advance our humanized CD47mAb toward our goal of FDA approval for kidney transplantation thereby improving outcomes for all transplant recipients and allowing the use of  marginal  kidneys thereby expanding the number of organs available for transplantation and the number of lives that can be saved.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The high prevalence of obesity in the US is a major public health concern, as overweight and obese individuals are at increased risk for many chronic diseases. Obesity stems from an imbalance between total caloric consumption and total energy expenditure (TEE), therefore accurate measurements of TEE play a pivotal role in understanding and ultimately reversing this epidemic. The gold standard for measuring TEE in free-living individuals is the doubly labeled water (DLW)method; major limitations of the method include high cost and precision of only   7% for individual measurements. In this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) project, Los Gatos Research (LGR) will develop, fabricate, and test a novel, laser-based analyzer based on LGR&#039;s patented, laser-based Off-Axis Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy technology to dramatically improve DLW measurements of TEE by measuring 17O/16O to correct for natural isotopic fluctuations in 18O and 2H. The Triple Isotope Water Analyzer (TIWA) will be capable of real-time, simultaneous, high-throughput (45 samples/day) monitoring of 2H/1H, 18O/16O, and 17O/16O in H2O from human bodily fluids, with a target accuracy and precision of better than  0.6% for 2H/1H,  0.15% for 18O/16O,and  0.2% for 17O/16O at natural isotopic abundances. For enriched body waters that have been labeled with 2H and 18O, the accuracy and precision will be comparable to IRMS and better than  1.0% for 2H/1H and  0.2% for 18O/16O. By measuring 17O/16O, the TIWA will allow quantification of isotopic background fluctuation in 18O/16O and 2H/1H during DLW measurements of TEE, thus eliminating the significant  constant background  assumption made during DLW experiments, and thereby improving measurement precisionand significantly reducing the cost of TEE experiments. Based on the excellent correlation measured during Phase I, we estimate that measurement of the isotopic background fluctuation will result in a 40% increase in the precision of DLW tests of TEE, allowing for smaller study sizes while maintaining the statistical power of the measurements and reducing study costs by an estimated 72%  Additionally, the improved precision introduces the possibility of extending this technique from population studies to the accurate assessment of the TEE of a single subject. During Phase II, LGR will continue to work with Prof. Edward Melanson and Prof. John Speakman to demonstrate and apply an improved instrument for simultaneous isotope measurements using minimally prepared, human urine samples. TEE will be measured using the improved, triple isotope method and the results compared with simultaneous, gold-standard measurement of TEE in a metabolic chamber, standard DLW as measured by IRMS, and standard DLW as measured using laser-based isotope analysis. At the conclusion of this research project, LGR will have demonstrated the use of the TIWA for triple-isotope DLW measurements and empirically determined the improvement in TEE accuracy and reduction in the DLW method cost due to the measurement of background fluctuation using 17O/16O.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dramatic increases in the incidence of obesity, diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome are increasing the prevalence of chronic liver diseases. Liver fibrosis arising from an excessive deposition of type I collagen in theparenchyma, occurs in advanced stages of most types of liver injury such as hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Prognosis, surveillance, and treatment decisions in patients with chronic liver disease rely on a precise estimation of the degree of fibrosis. There remains a large unmet medical need for a noninvasive method to stage and monitor disease, as the gold standard liver biopsy is invasive, subject to sampling error and not suitable for disease monitoring. We aim toadvance a non-invasive method to image liver fibrosis into the clinic by further optimizing and developing our advanced prototype probe, CM-65, a gadolinium (Gd)-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent that binds specifically to type I collagen to image fibrosis. This novel agent provides a conspicuous and persistent increase in signal intensity when bound to fibrotic tissue, and we present preclinical animal data demonstrating the feasibility of MRI to identify and stage fibrosis with a collagen specific Gd-based agent. The goal of this Phase I/II application is identification and preclinical development of a new collagen-targeted fibrosis imaging probe that is optimized for in vivo binding to fibrotic tissue and that has a safety and pharmacokinetic profile suitable for ultimate translation to human clinical trials. In Phase I (Aim 1) we will identify new probes, analogs of our lead compound CM-65, with higher collagen affinity and improved Gd elimination. After this gating event of improved in vitro potency, we will evaluate these probes for safety and efficacy in rodent models of liver fibrosis (Aim 2). Primary in vivo screens of safety and efficacy will be used to identify a clinical development candidate and the safety of this compound willbe further evaluated. The ability of this development candidate to noninvasively stage fibrosis by MRI will be fully evaluated in two orthogonal animal models of disease.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI), in collaboration with the University of Connecticut (UConn), proposes to develop the 2nd generation of an advanced 3D freeze-drying microscopy (FDM) system to advance the understanding of freeze-drying and to enable the development of efficient commercial freeze drying processes.  During the Phase I program PSI demonstrated the application of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) for imaging the 3D structure of product formulations during freeze drying in commercially relevant pharmaceutical packaging systems, vials. The OCT-FDM system enabled product structure imaging and collapse temperature Tc) determination in a vial, overcoming the limitation of current light transmission (LT) FDM systems which interrogate thin film product samples. The OCT-FDM system eliminates errors in Tc determinations which will lead to shorter processing times and reduced production and drug costs.  Biological drugs often require lyophilization to produce stable products that are stored in vials and reconstituted for patient use. The most critical process design parameter is the temperature at which the product undergoes primary drying. Drying above the product Tc results in viscous flow, loss of product structure and elegance, increased residual moisture content, poor storage stability, and long and/or poor reconstitution. LT- FDM, one method currently applied to estimate Tc, uses 1 - 2  L liquid product samples frozen between microscope slides, resulting in a frozen product thickness of 50 - 100  m. These samples are not representative of samples dried in vials which may have thicknesses of 5 - 50 mm. Thin films have different ice nucleation rates, crystallization tendencies for solutes, frozen product structures and drying rates as compared to vial freeze drying. Thus, LT-FDM does not accurately estimate Tc for freeze drying in a container of practical significance. [Our innovative OCT-FDM technique overcomes all of these shortcomings. The Phase I program demonstrated significantly more accurate determination of Tc using OCT-FDM, especially for a protein formulation. This is an important result as protein drug therapies are the fastest growing segment of the pharmaceutical industry.  Laboratory freeze drying of the protein formulation based on the OCT-FDM determination of Tc resulted in an 80% reduction in primary drying time compared to an LT-FDM based process.]  During the Phase II program PSI will develop a 2nd generation OCT-FDM system with improved imaging performance, instrument control, data acquisition and image processing software. The OCT-FDM will be used to: investigate ice formation during freezing, monitor 3D structural changes during primary drying, measure Tc in multi-component formulations of varying solidcontent, and monitor the advancement of the sublimation front. The goal of this RandD is the development and application of a laboratory tool which  enables accurate determination of product thermal properties and development of optimal commercial freeze drying processes [for economical drug production].           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this research is to develop the 2nd generation of an innovative 3D freeze-drying microscopy system to advance the understanding ofthe freeze-drying process in a product/container format that is the same as typically used during laboratory and manufacturing scale freeze drying and to enable the development of more efficient, economical commercial freeze drying processes.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology Initiative PAR-09-220. Healthcare is moving towards fully digitized patient records. Surgical pathology represents a challenge inthat high resolution imaging of tissue sections on glass slides produces datasets that are large compared to those of clinical pathology (e.g., blood tests) and radiology. Moreover the FDA recently announced its intention to regulate whole slide scannersas Class III medical devices, delaying implementation of digital pathology for primary diagnosis. Nevertheless digital pathology has enormous potential in other applications including education (teaching and training of physician residents and medical students), secondary consultation diagnosis and research. What is more there is a growing sense that application of digital methods can revolutionize diagnostics in anatomic pathology just as genomics technologies are predicted to revolutionize diagnostics inclinical pathology. Although the medical profession in general and anatomic pathologists in particular are currently seen to be slow in adapting the new technology, in the very near future pathology likely will take the lead in improving diagnosis throughprecision medicine (i.e., analytics of the  large multi-part health datasets).  Our Phase I efforts were focused on developing a high performance, open-source, client-server system for remote viewing of whole slide images. Our successful prototype system has been used weekly for teaching of Dermatopathology to residents in pathology and dermatology at Harvard University, and will be used at Washington University in St. Louis and at the University of New Mexico. For Phase II we are proposing to extend the client-server system to support peer-to-peer data sharing across a distributed database, and remote collaborative viewing and interaction. We will provide an open data repository for users to upload and share their images, and develop additional content on the 6,000 plus images already gathered in Phase I. Further we will promote innovation and extend our open, agile architecture to support plug-in support for analysis modules (e.g., to support CAD) and demonstrate this capability by using the open-source, medical image analysis toolkit ITK. Finally, through the use of a pilot Challenge Study we will begin to quantify early anecdotal evidence that the digital pathology system is faster and provides better results in certain applications than conventional approaches using physical slides.  Our goal is to establish widespread use of the system (server software) and/or service (web portal for uploading and viewing images) to create a large pathology network. During the proposed two-year Phase II we will deploy thesoftware and support the services to partnering institutions (there are six currently). In addition, the co-PI Dr. Faulkner-Jones will develop a curated slide image collection  that will build on the current collection of trusted, high-demand content.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The work described here will create and deploy modern digital pathology systems which reduce costs by reducing slide handling. Further, the project will provide new capabilities including data archival, sharing, retrieval and audit; telepathology (remote viewing); annotation and mark-up; 3D visualization and informatics; use of automated data processing algorithms; and education (curated and annotated image sets).",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the increased use of x-ray CT, the development of a market for CT screening exams, and the imaging of younger patients, there is a growing concern about the public health risk caused by the radiation dose deliveredby x-ray CT. The reduction of this dose has therefore taken on increased importance, as evidenced by the recent NIH Summit on Managing Dose in CT with the mandate of achieving the routine sub-millisievert CT exam. Iterative reconstruction algorithms are akey part in accomplishing this goal, producing high-quality images from low-dose data by incorporating detailed models of the physics and statistics of the data acquisition process. Iterative algorithms based on these system models are beginning to enterthe marketplace, but currently these algorithms suffer from three main limitations: (i) they are a very expensive add-on; (ii) they leave out detailed modeling of the physics, thus limiting the available dose reduction; and (iii) they are 10 - 100 times slower than standard reconstruction, preventing their use as a default for routine scans. The key to fully enabling iterative algorithms is acceleration of the backprojection and reprojection computational bottleneck, which is accomplished through the use ofInstaRecon&#039;s fast hierarchical backprojection/reprojection operators. Accelerating the iterative algorithm enables it to run on a less expensive platform, delivering fast reconstruction rates, and opens the door to incorporation of other system modeling,allowing for further image quality improvement and dose reduction. Thus, low-dose imaging and iterative reconstruction can move from a high-end option to the default scanning mode for a wide range of CT scanner hardware. The overall goal of this SBIR project is to accelerate iterative reconstruction rates even further and incorporate additional system models to improve dose and artifact reduction capabilities. The system acceleration will be achieved through algorithmic modifications to the hierarchical operators and the iterative reconstruction loop itself. Additional system modeling wil be introduced at a reduced computational cost through incorporation into the hierarchical operators themselves, providing advanced, accelerated system models. The resultingsystem will be faster than existing iterative reconstruction platforms, run on less expensive hardware, with additional reduction in dose and artifact levels. Benefits of the new technology will include superior low-dose performance in dose-critical applications such as pediatric, screening for lung cancer or heart disease, and interventional imaging, and significant improvement in diagnostic quality of CT scans of large patients, or of patients with prosthetic implants or cardiac pacemakers. Moreover, this project will help make iterative algorithm-based low-dose imaging a common scanning modality, reducing the burden of CT x-ray exposure for the patient population at large.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project promises dramatic acceleration ofadvanced image formation algorithms in CT, with improved dose reducing capabilities. The increased reconstruction rates make it possible for low-dose imaging to be brought into routine clinical use. The resulting product will improve the detection of lungcancer and heart disease, enable 3D CT image-guided surgery and accurate radiotherapy for cancer, improve the imaging of large patients and patients with prosthetic implants and cardiac pacemakers, and reduce healthcare costs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure in interventional radiology and other medical imaging modalities has become a serious concern, driven by the growing number of efficacious diagnostic and image-guided minimally invasive procedures andappropriately increasing utilization. This concern has been underlined by a recent FDA initiative to reduce dose in medical imaging. Alleviating this problem is complex because of the many contributing factors, but we believe that one part of the solutionis to build X-ray imaging equipment that acquires images at significantly lower dose. In this spirit, we propose in this SBIR Fast-Track application to build a low-dose fluoroscopic system with a large field of view as required for interventional radiology. We expect that the system will reduce entrance X- ray exposure and radiation dose to the patient by a factor of 4 and the occupational dose by at least a factor of 2 at equal image quality as compared to a conventional system. We, Triple Ring Technologies, have developed a scanning-beam digital X-ray (SBDX) system with a small field of view for cardiac interventions, scheduled for release in fall 2010. The system employs a novel imaging geometry with an extended, scanning-beam X-ray source with 9,000 focal spot positions, and a pixelated photon-counting detector. From each focal-spot position, an X-ray beam is cast through an X-ray collimator onto the detector. The final image, composed of up to 9,000 detector images, is reconstructed in real time. The SBDX system has shown a 4-fold dose reduction in adult patients. To achieve the extended FOV, we will use the existing SBDX system and replace the single detector with two laterally spaced detectors. Importantly, this will require a new X-ray collimator andwe determined that construction of the new collimator is the highest development risk. We propose to retire this risk in Phase 1 of the SBIR Fast-Track grant. In Phase 2 of the grant, we will build the large FOV system and perform a comparative phantom study of our system against a conventional system to measure entrance exposure, patient and occupational dose savings. Finally, we will perform an observer study in porcine models to validate image quality in comparison to a conventional system. In conclusion, this grant application proposes to reduce the radiation risk in interventional radiology by building and testing a low-dose fluoroscopy system.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   Interventional radiology is an expanding field with over 4 million minimally invasive procedures performed every year in the US alone. Despite its success, IR has recently come under scrutiny because many of the procedures are performed under X-ray image guidance. There is strong evidence that the elevated dose exposures as found inIR are leading to a significantly increased risk of cancer, especially in young patients. In this grant application we propose to address this concern by building a low-dose fluoroscopic system with a large field-of-view as required for interventional radiology. Importantly, our system will use inverse geometry architecture with an extended X-ray source and two small detectors. We hypothesize that our system will offer a 4-fold reduction in patient dose and 2-fold reduction in occupational dose with equivalent image quality as compared to a conventional system.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II SBIR proposal aims at the continued development and commercialization of a new class of high-performance X-ray imaging screens based on the recently developed core/shell nanorod (NR) and nano-tetrapods (NTs) structures. These multi-dimensional nanocrystalline (NC) structures can be easily embedded with high densities in transparent polymer matrices. They will have wide ranging applications in digital radiography, mammography, tomography, protein crystallography, as well as a various large-area radiation imaging and detection applications, never before possible using conventional scintillators. The goals of Phase I were successfully achieved and we have demonstrated the potential for high spatial resolution,very fast time response, no afterglow, no self-absorption, and good X-ray conversion efficiency. The nano- composite scintillators were prepared and tested independently by both PhosphorTech and Radiation Monitoring Devices (RMD) and have outperformed conventional organic and inorganic bulk scintillators on several fronts.  During Phase II, our plan is to continue refining these NC structures and related screening/growth techniques and demonstrate their ability to outperform even single crystal X-ray scintillators in terms of resolution, detection area, gain, and production cost. This will be achieved by creating NCs with optimal lengths and narrow size distribution and then incorporating them into polymer composites containing orderly arrangement of such structures at high packing densities. The orderly NC arrangement, which will be achieved by well-established low-cost solution-based self-assembly techniques, will dramatically enhance X-ray absorption and facilitate light channeling through the polymer matrix to the electronic sensors. Using such methods, it is possible to attain very long (tens of microns) vertically aligned NCs in a polymer matrix with inter- NC spacings (that can act as light channels) of only few nanometers, as opposed to the micron spacing limitations provided by conventional CsI and other single crystal (or bulk powder) scintillating structures. The low-cost solution processing methods employed in these systems will also enable both large-area and high resolution scintillators with significant cost reduction compared to conventional bulk and single crystal materials. In summary, these novel NC-based films will have significant applications in various types of radiation detection devices, and other biomedical imaging applications, enhancing their value to the NIH and to the molecular biology and medical communities as a whole.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed nanomaterials will significantly improve the resolution and brightness of Xray- produced images compared to current state-of-the art. They will have applications in digital radiography, crystallography, and various medical imaging applications, enhancing their value to the NIH and to the molecular biology and medical communities as a whole.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many peer-reviewed publications show that Bisphenol A (BPA)-based polycarbonate (PC) and all other commonly used hard and clear (HC) plastics (e.g., polyethylene terephthalate (PET), glycol-modified polyethylene terephthalate (PETG), and polystyrene (PS)) leach endocrine disrupting chemicals that most commonly exhibit estrogenic activity (EA). BPA is only one of many hundreds of chemicals having EA or anti- EA used to manufacture HC plastic products. Chemicals having EAor anti-EA have been reported to have significant adverse effects on many behavioral and physiological processes such as sperm counts, uterine and ovarian functions, aggressive behaviors, and some types of cancers. These adverse effects sometimes occur atvery low (picomolar to nanomolar) concentrations, especially on fetal or developing mammals (including humans). PlastiPure&#039;s (PPi&#039;s) data show that no consumer products or packaging made from EA-free** HC plastic are currently commercially available, including those made from PC substitutes currently advertised as BPA-free or phthalate-free. In fact, BPA-free plastics often release chemicals having more EA than do plastics made using BPA (e.g., PC plastics), especially when exposed to sunlight or other UV wavelengths.  In order to meet a commercial and health-related need for plastics free of EA and anti-EA (EA-free** plastics), PPi is submitting a Phase II SBIR grant to confirm that it has developed a set of EA-free** resins that directly substitute for PC,PET, PETG, and PS resins that have many advantageous characteristics in different combinations, e.g., HC, microwavable, resistant to UV light and moisture, acid resistant, cold-tolerant (including freezing), and suitable for making thick- or thin-layeredplastics, some of which have an oxygen barrier. PPi proposes to confirm that plastic products manufactured from these EA-free** resins remain EA- free** before and after common-use stresses of heat, moisture, UV and microwave radiation. PPi will use two very sensitive, reproducible and accurate in vitro assays and an in vivo assay to confirm that no chemicals having detectable EA are released from these resins or plastic products before or after stressing.  Collectively, the novel EA-free**, BPA-free, HC plastics to be developed on this Phase II grant would replace PET, PETG, and other HC beverage and food-contacting plastics in highest-volume current use that all release chemicals having EA**. Products produced from these resins represent the best commercial opportunity, and the greatest potential reduction in chemicals having EA** that are currently released from plastics and ingested by consumers world-wide.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many peer-reviewed papers report that commonly used hard and clear (HC) plastics leach chemicals having estrogenic activity (EA) regardless of whether they have bisphenol A (BPA), such as polycarbonate (PC), or are  BPA-free  such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), glycol-modified polyethylene terephthalate (PETG), and polystyrene (PS). Ingestion of chemicals having EA by mammals (including humans) have been associated with causing various disorders including uterine dysfunction, higher rates of some cancers, reduced sperm count, and abnormalbrain maturation leading to pathologies such as learning disabilities, disorders of attention, motivation, emotion, cognitive development, and changes in aggressive behavior and sexual orientation. Given such potential adverse effects of chemicals having EA, there is high scientific, societal, and commercial merit for PlastiPure to develop novel EA-Free resins and single- and multi-layer plastics to replace EA-containing PC, PET, PETG, and PS plastic packaging used currently to contain most foodstuffs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human death investigations must by law be properly implemented even when the decedent is involved in or near to the scene of a hazardous materials emergency. This project intends to develop worker health and safety training for those staff of coroners and medical examiners who investigate deaths in hazardous materials environments. This innovative training will be implemented by e-learning applications and by hands-on practice that is specific to the job tasks of death investigators. Federal law, implemented by the OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) rule at 29 CFR 1910.120, places certain requirements and restrictions on workers at hazardous materials response and waste sites. Unlike other more general HAZWOPER training, this particular effort will focus on the relevant job tasks of death investigators, provide practical training, and be economical to administer for coroners and medical examiners. During Phase I of this project a hazard assessment was conducted with respect to the job tasks of death investigators at hazardous materials emergencies and other situations involving potential exposure of these workers to chemical, radiological and etiological agents. This has led to a list of competencies that death investigators should possess to safely operate during a hazardous materials response or in a contaminated environment. A training syllabus was developed, in detail, to address the learning of these competencies. Typically, HAZWOPER training is more effective when verbal presentations are combined with hands on practice to refine and reinforce the presented skills. Phase I of this project included researching developing and evaluating the effectiveness of various combinations of ways of conducting the verbal (lecture) portion of the proposed course using e-teaching means. The web-based portion of the training includes a mix of written material, still photographs, sketches, quizzes, and automated feedback, scenario-based simulations, and tests. An on-line resource library provides continued e-learning access to the students for later reference. Phase II of the project is combining the e-learning effort for cognitive skills developed in Phase I with hands-on psychomotor training using trainingmanikins, personal protective equipment, hazardous materials monitoring devices and decontamination equipment typical of a hazardous materials response. The combined course leads to a certification of proficiency for trained individuals in compliance with29 CFR 1910.120 criteria. Phase II will also include the development of &#039;train-the-trainer&#039; curricula for the hands-on portion of the course, in order to facilitate expansion of he geographic reach of the hands-on training in a cost effective manner. Thiswould assist in the recruitment and preparation of local trainers to provide the hands-on experience.

Unlike other, more general, HAZWOPER training this effort will focus on the relevant job tasks, be practical, and be economical to implement. It will be a self-sufficient and legally compliant HAZWOPER training program for coroners, medical examiners and their staffs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION:  Biomarkers currently employed for the detection of organ toxicity are often not sensitive enough to detect the early stages of acute organ damage, i.e. at a stage when reducing or eliminating exposure to a toxin could prevent progression of organ damage or a disease process, nor do they adequately discriminate damage to one organ system vs. another. For example, the level of aminotransferases (ALT and AST) in blood is a widely accepted practice for detecting liver damage. However, these enzymes are typically not detectable in blood at low levels of liver damage and require a relatively long exposure to a toxin before they are detected. The cytosolic glutathione transferase (GST) family of enzymes offer a more reliable alternative as a biomarkerfor organ damage as they exhibit many of the required characteristics for that use, i.e. tissue specific localization, release into the blood at low leves of toxicity (high sensitivity), and a high intracellular concentration. The GST protein family is comprised of several classes (e.g. A, M, P) with some classes containing multiple isoforms. The GST classes and their isoforms exhibit marked differences in tissue distribution. For example, GSTA1-1 and A2-2 are the predominant GST enzymes found in the liver, whereas GSTA3-3 is mainly expressed in steroidogenic tissues and GSTA4-4 is expressed in all tissues that have been examined. Additionally, GSTP1-1 is the GST predominantly found in platelets. Therefore, measuring the level of specific GST classes and isoforms in blood would be a valuable indicator of damage to a particular organ or tissue. However, currently available antibodies for GSTs are often not capable of distinguishing among the different isoforms of a GST class and, in some cases, are insufficiently specific to distinguish among GST classes. The availability of assays for  specific GST classes and their isoforms, and multiplex panels for many GST isoforms, would enable a much greater degree of resolution and sensitivity to organ damage due to xenobiotic exposure. Recent identification of several additional cytosolic GST classes (S, O and Z) provides the opportunity to further expand the applications of GST assays for toxicology testing with the development of immunoassays that are specific for given classes and isoforms associated with specific tissues. In Phase 1 we succeeded in developing antibodies and immunoassays specific for human GST A subforms, and demonstrated their utility for rodent toxicity testing and for non-invasive monitoring of GSTisoforms in human urine. Phase 2 plans include (a) the development of highly specific antibodies for additional human GST Classes and their isoforms (b) development of ultrasensitive immunoassays for these biomarkers, (c) development of a sophisticated, rapid, easy to use multiplex platform for a panel of GST immunoassays, (d) determination of the utility of this GST proteomics panel for pre-clinical organ-specific toxicity testing in animal models, and (e) determination of the utility of a GST proteomicspanel for human clinical toxicity studies, including comparison to traditional toxicity biomarkers in patients undergoing chemotherapy.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a great need for more sensitive, minimally-invasive methods to detect the early stages of toxicity to specific organs from exposure to pharmaceuticals or to environmental or occupational toxins. This proposal expands on a successful Phase 1 feasibility study with the ongoing aim of developing a panel of highly specific and ultrasensitive tests to measure the levels of a family of proteins (the glutathione transferases) in blood and urine. Incorporating these tests into a comprehensive multiplexed panel will allow for high sensitivity organ-specific toxicology testing, for which there are many significant preclinical and clinical commercial applications.",

The mTraining technology is an objective and checklist-based method for delivering just-in-time training and reference materials, making it an effective Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS)for providing workers easy access to information after training, and on site prior to or during an assignment. It provides short, incident specific awareness and safety training that can be delivered prior to responding to an emergency situation. The proposed development under this phase II SBIR includes: a) a back-end document processing engine that is able to automatically parse, analyze, mark-up, and organize documents so that their content is easily cross-referenced, linked and re-organized for effective delivery on a mobile training platform or other electronic medium. This will be connected to a server and database architecture to facilitate its operation and support storing and accessing content; b) the front-end interface for the mobile training platform (mTraining) was prototyped in Phase I of this project for delivering training content to emergency responders, skilled support personnel, and volunteers before or during an incident. The improved back-end architecture will support intelligent search capabilities for a large repository of training documents with different  structures. This capability relies on the document processing engine&#039;s ability to semi-automatically extract relevant data and automatically translate this data into a structured format.  This data can then be used for display in the mobile application, stored into databases, and automatically populated into ontologies. Throughout this project the participatory-based design paradigm has been used for facilitating the integration of user requirements and the fast prototyping and testing of design alternatives. This approach will continue to be utilized in Phase  2 of the project.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research and development will advance the field of environmental health and safety training by bringing to it new and innovative advanced training technologies that are based on the mobile and just-in-time paradigm. Furthermore, the research and development proposed herein will advance the mobile information technology field by developing robust and scalable tools for processing and linking information residing in different source documents that are semantically related.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World Trade Center clean-up focused national attention on the inadequate training for skilled support personnel (SSP), OSHA&#039;s term for workers in trades (including construction, demolition, and transportation) deployed to support disaster responses. While the relevant OSHA standard (29 CFR 1910.120) provides detailed training for emergency responders, the requirements for training skilled support personnel--so-called secondary responders-- are less stringent, focusing only on awareness training through an initial on-site briefing. The negative health consequences of inadequate preparation have been profound, leading to efforts to better prepare SSP to work safely on disaster sites. This Phase II project focuses on biological hazards as the consequences of inadequate protection are potentially catastrophic to the skilled support worker as well as the public at large. Because skilled support personnel are subject to no statutory or regulatory requirement for training inadvance of a disaster response, training must not only be informative but also persuasive about the need to know, easily accessible, and sufficiently entertaining and graphically appealing to engage the attention of SSP. The basic training developed and tested in Phase I achieved the goals of engagement. This Phase II project will focus on adding animation and interaction to the Phase I product, developing shorter, incident- specific refresher trainings that can be reviewed on mobile devices prior to entering a disaster response action, and constructing an online Discussion Forum to provide trainees with opportunities for interactions with instructors and peers. Following the completion of tests measuring knowledge gains and retention, subscriptions to thispackage of products will be marketed to organizations that provide health and safety training to construction workers. As part of the marketing effort, a summary product will be developed to supplement more general disaster response curricula. This productwill be disseminated free of charge to non- profit training agencies in order to expand the reach and visibility of the Phase II products.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The World at Risk report issued in 2008 by the Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Proliferation and Terrorism concluded that while nuclear terrorism has been emphasized in Federal prevention efforts, bioterrorism is the more likely threat. Preparing skilled support workers to respond to this threat  is an urgent public health challenge that will be addressed in this project by developing and testing several products to prepare skilled support personnel to work safely in biologically contaminated environments. Products include a comprehensive basic training for use online or in class, refresher training in three incident-specific units that can be viewed on mobile devices prior to entering a response action, and an online Discussion Board that will allow trainees to interact with instructors and peers and receive on-going support.",

        "abstract": "Project Summary / Abstract Preserving genomic integrity is essential in order to suppress cancer, neurodegeneration, aging and other diseases. At odds with genomic preservation is DNA damage, which can drive mutations, sequence rearrangements and cellulartoxicity. DNA damage is unavoidable, as DNA damaging agents are present in our environment and in our cells. To counteract the deleterious effects of DNA damage, we have evolved sophisticated DNA repair systems. It is now known that every major DNA repairpathway suppresses cancer. Furthermore, since cancer is often treated using DNA damaging agents, it is not surprising that the DNA repair capacity of tumors modulates sensitivity to chemotherapy. Despite its importance, measurements of DNA damage and repair are far from routine, primarily due to the lack of reliable and rapid DNA damage assays. Here, by bringing together convergent expertise among engineers, biologists and computer programmers, we propose to meet this need by developing a platform for rapidsemi- automated single-cell DNA damage quantification that can be broadly distributed and readily applied by researchers in public health, academia, industry and medicine.  As defined in the Phase I submission, we created and tested a prototype for a 96-well CometChip platform and have optimized the engineering design and a production apparatus to produce spatially encoded 20 and 96 well demonstrated that supplementation of the Microwell Comet gels with extracellular matrix proteins (EMPs) supports the growth of human cells for up to two weeks and the EMPs do not impact the formation of comets. To enable characterization of the genotoxicity of chemicals used commercially, those found in the environment or newly developed pharmaceuticals, and to quantify DNArepair capacity without the need to identify specific DNA Repair technology. This proposal, to develop the &#039;DNA Repair on a Chip&#039; technology, combines the use of agarose based Microwell arrays, spatially encoded cellular recognition, automated data processing, and extra-cellular matrix proteins to optimize, validate and commercialize a series of Spatially Encoded Microwell Arrays. We will demonstrate that we have significantly advanced the manufacturing process (Aim1), have developed a macrowell former toproduce 96-well and 384-welll CometChips (Aim 2), and propose the implementation of a graphical user interface for data analysis (Aim 3). Finally, we will rigorously validate this new technology by analyzing the genotoxic effects of a range of compounds from the NTP library for their impact on DNA damage and repair responses and to reveal inter-individual and inter-cell type variation in DNA damage responses (Aim 4). Through the integration of traditional methods in biology and engineering, the DNA Repair on a Chip platform described here represents a significant technological advance, providing high-throughput, objective, and quantitative measurements that have the potential to become a new standard in DNA damage analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We describe a new methodology that provides for robust, high-throughput DNA damage and repair analysis by exploiting gravity capture of single cells into a Microwell array. DNA damage levels are revealed morphologically by single-cell gel electrophoresis. The Microwell array enables fully automated DNA damage and DNA repair measurement of multiple experimental conditions simultaneously. This technological advance opens the door to new strategies for drug discovery, genotoxicity testing, andenvironmental health research through objective, quantitative analyses.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION:   Vapor intrusion is the migration of volatile organic chemicals from below ground into overlying buildings and is a major cause of large population exposure to hazardous chemicals. To assess health impacts of exposure to vapor intrusion compounds, monitoring of indoor air is required.  Conventional vapor intrusion monitoring is done by on-site sample collection followed by laboratory analysis. Disadvantages of the conventional method include: the need for sample retrieval, extended processingtimes, inability to adequately track variations in concentration over time and high cost.  Portable analysis methods that can be installed or operated and provide continuous and/or short term measurements are needed to solve these problems. This Phase II Small Business Innovation Research proposal addresses this need through a compact cartridge-based sampling and detection method that, when combined with a portable Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, can detect vapor intrusion compounds at low concentrations and with high selectivity. The approach incorporates advances in solid phase extraction and exploits novel coatings for optical waveguides. The method is differentiated from most other detection methods because it provides chemical signaturesfor unambiguous identification of compounds. Additional advantages include: compact/portable size, near real-time results, readily automated, minimal expertise required, reagent- free, solvent-free and embedded telemetry. The Phase I study successfully demonstrated the method&#039;s feasibility by detecting chlorinated vapor intrusion compounds at low parts per billion levels. A Phase II follow on study is proposed emphasizing understanding the capabilities of key components used for selective detection and addresses the methods needed for assembly of a function portable device. The study will characterize the devices&#039; performance at a Superfund field site. The impact of this research goes beyond the immediate focus on vapor intrusion monitoring. Improvements insample preparation methods can be applied wherever portable on-site analysis is desired, such as: workplace safety, forensic analysis, food safety, pharmaceutical manufacture, and drinking water qualities.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A pocket-sized device for personal exposure level assessment  Abstract Detecting environmental toxicants is critical for better understanding of the relationship between chemical exposures and many diseases, and for more effective prevention of the related diseases. Due to large variations in the individuals&#039; genetic susceptibility and environmental exposure level, an ideal detection tool must be miniaturized, affordable and personalized so that it can measure the toxicants in real time and within each individual&#039;s breathing zone. Except for a few selected analytes, the current approach is to collect air samples at a certain location and time, and transport the samples to a lab for detailed analysis using sophisticated but expensive and difficult-to-operate equipment, such as gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The goal of the present project is to address the above need by introducing a new sensor technology, focusing on harmful analytes, such as carcinogens, which are important but currently not covered by any of the existing portable devices. The sensor technology is based on an innovative hybrid principle that combines intelligent sampling and separation mechanisms with a sensitive microfabricated quartztuning fork array and selective molecular imprinted polymer sensing materials to achieve high specificity and high sensitivity with a miniaturized device. The device is pocket-sized and contains a Bluetooth chip that communicates wirelessly with cell phones or other Bluetooth-enabled devices.  The new technology will provide unprecedented high temporal and high spatial resolutions for personal environmental exposure monitoring, which will benefit a large environmental health research community, support ongoing and future large-scale population studies, and impact on industrial and occupational safety and environmental monitoring. The team will develop, build and test the device in phase I. They will validate it with established collaborations, including epidemiologists, industry hygienists, occupational safety professionals and environmental scientists, and prepare for production of the device in phase II.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   A low cost and miniaturized hybrid device will be developed to detect,quantify, and identify toxic volatile chemical compounds. A particular focus of the device is to provide otherwise unavailable high quality chemical exposure information.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite the extensive work being performed to understand cancer and carcinogenic properties of chemicals and other agents, there are still gaps in our ability to efficiently identify carcinogens, and elucidate their mode(s) of action. The current state of assays designed to examine mutation and carcinogenic mechanisms are especially limited by their high costs and low throughput capacities. This laboratory has developed a gene mutation assay that is based on the endogenous Pig-a gene. The Pig-a gene product is essential for the biosynthesis of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. Mutations giving rise to nonfunctional GPI anchors prevent certain proteins from being expressed on the cell surface, and this represents a phenotype that can be measured by flow cytometry. The work proposed herein will extend our development efforts by creating a suite of assays that represent a platform for studying a key mode of carcinogenic action, mutation. By devising Pig-a based methods that examine cells in culture, laboratory rodents, and human subjects, a truly comprehensive bridging biomarker will be realized. The bridging capabilities and high throughput nature of the proposed mutation assessment tools will contribute significantly to important areas of research that include academic, regulatory, and industrial settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  The ability to efficiently and comprehensively study mutation, a key pathway of carcinogenesis, is critical for gaining insight into this complex disease, and for elucidating carcinogens&#039; mode of action.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this innovative proposal is to commercialize a non-invasive topical product that treats uveitis which is safe and easy to administer. Uveitis is the third leading cause of blindness in the United States. Heretofore, the primary treatment of intermediate and posterior uveitis has been either oral medications (with significant systemic side effects) or invasive local methods, such as an intravitreal injection (IVT), periocular injection or implantation of a sustained release drug delivery device into the eye. Thus, there is a great need to develop a superior drug delivery system in terms of safety, patient acceptance and efficacy for uveitis. The same product could be used to treat other indications such as diabetic macular edema, a substantial market involving more than 4 million Americans. Aciont has completed all necessary preclinical GLP safety, proof-of-concept work in uveitis and manufacturing of our dexamethasone sodium phosphate ( DSP ) Visulex system needed to satisfy the FDA&#039;s requirements to test our proposed treatment in man. There are 3 specific aims for our research plan:   Aim1-Phase I Clinical Study (safety of treatment modality). Demonstrate that our new drug delivery applicator and DSP formulations are safe and well tolerated in man.   Aim2-Phase II Clinical Study (efficacy in uveitis). Demonstrate that our non-invasive DSP Visulex treatment is both safe and effective in treating uveitis.   Aim3-Optimize Visulex-P System Design and Manufacturability of Components and Formulations. Potentially, our approach can lead to a non-invasive drug delivery system that allows for a very simple treatment which can be performed by a nurse or paraprofessional in the doctor&#039;s office within a range of 5- 10 minutes.

        "abstract": "Project Summary / Abstract - EY020017 Phase IIB Competitive Renewal  The overall goal of the proposed SBIR program is to implement and evaluate a low cost, portable retinal camera, the DLP-Cam, in a primary care system for diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening. Untreated DR has reached epidemic levels in underserved populations worldwide. To fully address this issue, DR screening must lead seamlessly from a patient&#039;s primary care provider to vision-saving treatment and must be widely available to the underserved, for instance within a community clinic setting.  Aeon Imaging LLC, in partnership with the Indiana University School of Optometry and the UC Berkeley Optometric Eye Center, is addressing the public health challenge of providing eyecare to the underserved by developing cost-effective DR screening cameras and internet-based telemedicine platforms. In Phase II of EY020017, over 1,900 underserved diabetic patients, of which over 90% were racial/ethnic minorities, were imaged at four Alameda County MedicalCenter community clinics using Aeon&#039;s Laser Scanning Digital Camera (LSDC), and commercial fundus and OCT cameras for comparison. Images and de-identified imaging session data are transferred for review and analysis to Aeon&#039;s cloud server and to EyePACS, aweb-based teleophthalmology platform developed by UC Berkeley and used in over 190 US and international sites.  In this Phase IIB Renewal, Aeon seeks to complete the final steps to successfully commercialize its novel DLP-Cam technology for sustainable DRscreening. Aeon&#039;s DLP-Cam provides high contrast, confocal views of the retina in natural appearing red/green color images, or monochrome in either red or green, avoiding blue light. No pupil dilation is needed. The compact and lightweight, microprocessorcontrolled, internet ready DLP- Cam is detachable from a standard slit-lamp style alignment base for ease of transport. The projected price is well below competing products. As in EY020017, data will be automatically encrypted and uploaded to secure servers for review and referral recommendations.  Clinical validation of the DLP-Cam will be performed by the Joslin Vision Network (JVN), a leading international diabetes research organization. Aeon will also test the integration of the DLP-Cam into the workflow and managed diabetic patient care at 3 primary care sites, where primary care providers (PCPs) will be trained in the evaluation of retinal images. In this DR screening model, referral decisions are communicated at the time of a patient&#039;s visit to increase compliance with recommended eye care. Certified telemedicine image graders provide quality assurance of the screening system, and ongoing image feedback for training.  The growing disparity in diabetes-related eye care among minority and underserved populations requires a solution such as the DLP-Cam that effectively screens for eye disease, thus assisting PCPs in providing managed care and promoting awareness among diabetic patients. If successful, the DLP-Cam&#039;s adoption by PCPs will enable widespread,efficient, and sustainable DR screening, thereby reducing barriers to eye care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aeon Imaging, LLC, will field test and clinically validate for diabetic retinopathy screening a low cost and portable retinalcamera that uses novel technology, the DLP-Cam, in both established telemedicine networks and primary care provider practices. The DLP-Cam provides high contrast retinal images without pupil dilatation, important in patients from diverse racial and ethnicbackgrounds. If successful, this portable and low cost retinal camera will significantly lower the barriers to eye care among the underserved.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose an innovative microtechnology-enhanced surgical device that solves a significant therapeutic bottleneck in the treatment of lens cataract in children. As the leading cause of childhood blindness, lens cataract interferes with the optical performance of the eye and if untreated, results in lifelong deficits in visual perception. The first step in pediatric cataract surgery is technically the most challenging and involves the creation of a hole in the thin and highly elastic lens capsule to provide access for the subsequent removal of the diseased lens and if needed, the implantation of an artificial lens. Due to the unique biomechanical properties of the immature lens capsule, adult procedures for creating the capsulotomy opening, if applied to infants and young children, only have a 20% chance of success. Capsule tears hinder lens removal and affect the mechanical stability and performance of artificial lens implants. Currently, pediatric cataract surgeons mustmake do using devices with tissue chopping functions originally designed for non- cataract surgical uses, resulting in suboptimal pediatric lens capsulotomies. In order to simplify and automate pediatric lens capsulotomies and thus enhance the delivery ofvision care to young patients, we propose a disposable microtechnology-enhanced capsulotomy device to achieve consistent results across a range of surgical skills. The device is based on a proprietary method of tissue cutting in  which a microfabricated cutting ring is housed within a collapsible elastomeric housing to produce precise capsulotomies on a sub-millisecond time scale. Our device is inserted through the standard 2.8 mm corneal incision and re-expands to produce a desired capsulotomy of 5 mm in diameter. In Phase I, we sucessfully demonstrated project feasibility by developing device protoypes that met specifications in terms of dimensions for intraocular use, compressibility, and capsule cutting. In the proposed Phase II studies, we will developa commercial version of the capsulotomy device, conduct engineering bench testing, and undertake surgical validation in an accepted rabbit model, with the goal of achieving product design freeze. In parallel, as a second aim, we will also develop a compacttable-top console to provide power, timing circuits, vacuum, diagnostics, and safety alerts for the casulotomy device. Results from this Phase II work will allow us to advance to device certification by good laboratory practice (GLP) accredited facilitiesas required for clinical trial initiation and ultimte FDA approval.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work seeks to develop a microtechnology-enhanced surgical instrument to aid in the treatment of childhood blindness due tolens cataract.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss and blindness in people over age 60 in the developed world. Progression of this disease results in the loss of the ability to perform activitieshighly correlaed with quality of life. This disease progression is not well understood and treatments address only portions of the underlying mechanisms of the disease, while there is no cure. The current standard of care is repetitive intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) pharmacologic treatment. However, only 34-40% of patients gain clinically significant vision and maintain that gain over the course of one to two years. Ocular Proteomics, LLC (OPL)&#039;s objective is to validate apanel of biomarkers that predict clinical non-responders to anti-VEGF therapy to allow physicians to quickly identify those who would benefit from alternative therapies. The current methodology is the alternative, where non-responders are identified onlyafter months of ineffective treatment. The OPL lab previously discovered the presence of cell receptors and their phosphorylated (activated) forms in the vitreous fluid of human eyes. Significant quantitative differences in several proteins between anti-VEGF treatment responders and non-responders were demonstrated. OPL&#039;s approach has been centered on the use of R.P.P.M. (reverse-phase protein microarray) technology to accurately discriminate different disease states in patients. Also, recent discoveries show quantitative differences between subsets of patients within some small disease groups. The next phase is to employ these past discoveries to uncover additional differences between responsive and non-responsive patients. Long term objectives include validating these unique quantitative differences among larger populations, as well as disseminating the molecular mechanisms of disease progression. The results achieved from these objectives will lead to predicting response retinal diseases, including wet AMDusing the Diagnostic Vitreous Proteome. The specific aims of this proposal include: 1) Recruit patients with wet AMD from multiple retina centers across the country to participate in the study 2) Validate Efficacy of potential Biomarkers to Predict Treatment Response and Disease Progression 3) Finalize most significant AMD biomarkers for determining and predicting Treatment Response and Disease Progression           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will improve publichealth by improving the vision of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration at reduced costs. It will do this by producing a product that will allow retina physicians to perform a diagnostic test that will determine how a patient will respond toa given treatment before starting the patient on this treatment. This will allow the doctor to choose the right treatment for the right patient at te right time, providing truly personalized medicine.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this grant proposal is to perform a clinical study which will allow the first foldable and injectable artificial cornea, the KeraKlear, to be used in the United States market for treatment of corneal blindness. This device may be implanted through an incision size that is approximately 1/10th the size of the incision that is required for the most popular artificial cornea available in the U.S. The smaller incision size is expected to allow a much quickersurgery for patients and a more accelerated recovery as compared to the currently available artificial corneas. In addition, the KeraKlear artificial cornea may be implanted in many patients with cornea blindness without penetration into the anterior chamber. This avoids two of the most serious complications of artificial cornea implantation including internal infection of the eye (endophthalmitis) and severe bleeding (expulsive hemorrhage). The use of the KeraKlear artificial cornea also avoids the commoncomplications of corneal transplantation including high astigmatism, corneal graft failure and corneal graft rejection. Finally, the KeraKlear would enable the treatment of cornea blindness in a much larger number of patients. Currently, corneal transplantation is limited to about 100,000 per year worldwide because of the lack of suitable donor corneas. This represents only 1% of the 10 million people worldwide who have cornea blindness in both eyes. By making the KeraKlear artificial cornea available a significantly larger percentage of the cornea blind patients around the world could be treated.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   A new type of foldable and injectable artificial cornea has been developed for placement through a small incision (3 mm). In thisproject, we will perform clinical studies to determine the safety and efficacy of this new device. Successful completion of the study will lead to the availability of this less invasive artificial to cornea blind patients in the U.S.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Seroma formation (fluid accumulation in the wound) is among the most common post-surgical complications, occurring in up to 50% of certain surgical procedures. TissuGlu(R) Surgical Adhesive is designed to adhere flaps of tissue and prevent the accumulation of fluid in surgical wounds, thereby reducing the need for drains and improving the time to recovery. Traditional wound closure approaches such as sutures provide point-to- point fixation, which is inadequate to fullyadhere planar surfaces. Surgeons need a strong but safe surgical  glue  that can adhere flaps of tissue, reducing fluid accumulation after surgery by eliminating dead space in the wound and maintaining tissues in position for natural healing to occur. Cohera Medical successfully completed all specific aims from both Phase I and Phase II SBIR grants that supported the development of TissuGlu(R) Surgical Adhesive. As a result, TissuGlu(R) has received CE Mark approval, giving the company permission to marketand sell TissuGlu(R) in the European Union and other worldwide markets. The long-term goal of this project is to meet the requirements to obtain FDA regulatory approval to launch TissuGlu(R) in the US market. Cohera proposes to test the hypothesis TissuGlu(R) Surgical Adhesive can meet all regulatory requirements necessary to receive FDA approval to market the product in the US. Since the first submission of this proposal, Cohera has achieved 2 of the 4 specific aims, in that the company has successfully completed all pre-clinical testing requested by the FDA and has obtained FDA approval to initiate the US human clinical trial. In addition the company has established GMP manufacturing procedures and has manufactured units required for the clinical trial. Therefore the revised proposal is focused on the remaining specific aims, which include completion of the US pivotal clinical trial, and the design and verification of moisture barrier packaging to extend shelf life to 18 months. Specific Aim 1: Design and verify moisture barrier packaging with 18 month shelf life. Criteria for acceptance are a) verify that product in moisture barrier packaging passes sterilization validation testing, b) verify that product in moisture barrier packaging can withstand the normal level of stress associated with its distribution to end-user locations by passing shipping validation testing, and c) establish 18 month adhesive shelf life in moisture barrier packaging through adhesive stability testing at multiple time points. Specific Aim 2: Perform pivotal efficacy clinical study in US to support Pre-market Approval (PMA) submission to the FDA. Criteria for acceptance are a) enroll at least 150 patients in study, b) complete all documentation and prepare statistical analysis, and c)submit final report for PMA approval.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION:  New Reagents for RNA-based Therapeutic Technologies Abstract Functional RNA molecules such as aptamers, siRNAs, miRNAs, and related compounds have enormous potential as human therapeutics and as tools for elucidating gene regulation in vivo.To reach this potential, such molecules must be highly potent and highly stable. Unmodified RNAs typically do not come close to meeting these requirements. Some success has been achieved in vitro and in vivo by using 2&#039;-O- methyl-ribose (2&#039;-OMe) and phosphorothioate (PS) backbone modifications, alone or in combination. However, both 2&#039;-OMe and PS modified RNAs have limited in vivo stability and activity, which can be problematic. In addition, RNA containing PS modification(s) are chiral at phosphorus, resulting in two distinct isomers at each PS substitution. Therefore, there is a need for further improvements.  In Phase I of this project, we demonstrated proof of principle for a new approach using RNA containing 2&#039;-OMe-phosphorodithioate (MS2) modifications, prepared by using novel 2&#039;-OMe-thiophosphoramidite (2&#039;- OMe-thioamidite) reagents. We successfully synthesized the four 2&#039;-OMe-thioamidites (A, C, G, and U) at small scale and used them to synthesize a variety of RNAs containing MS2 modifications. Significantly, we showed that incorporating MS2 modifications remarkably improved binding affinity toward the targeted VEGF protein more than 1000-fold, from 2 nM to lt 1 pM. In addition, we showed that siRNAs containing MS2 modifications had increased gene silencing activity against multiple gene targets in cultured cells. To realize the high potential o these new reagents, Phase II of this project will focus on the following aims: (1) increase the scale of 2&#039;-OMe-thioamidite production; (2) optimize protocols for solid-phase synthesis of MS2-RNA for in vitro and in vivo applications; (3) determine the thermal stability and structure of MS2-RNA duplexes; (4) validate the cellular binding affinity and specificity of the selected VEGF MS2-aptamers; (5) develop formulated MS2-siRNAs that provide increased potency and antitumor efficacy in a murine model of metastatic ovarian cancer. Successful completion of this project will demonstrate the value of MS2-siRNAs in vitro and in vivo, and will enable AM and its commercial partners to proceed with full commercialization of the 2&#039;-OMe- thioamidite reagents and contribute toward the realization of effective MS2 modified RNA-based therapeutics.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Functional RNA molecules such as aptamers, miRNAs, and siRNAs have exciting potential as therapeutics in areas such as viral infections, cancer, genetic disorders, and neurological diseases. However, these potential RNA drugs require chemical modifications to achieve the necessary potency and stability. AM Biotechnologies (AM) will develop 2&#039;-O-methyl-ribonucleoside thiophosphoramidite reagents that will allow the life science community to produce highly potent, highly stable phosphorodithioate 2&#039;-O-methyl-RNA-based therapeutics. The unique reagents that AM will develop under this project could ultimately have a profound impact on public health.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bioactive small molecules can act on multiple targets, and these off-target activities underlie many of the adverse reactions from which drugs suffer. The motivating idea of this proposal is that these Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) targets may be predicted comprehensively and systematically using chemoinformatic inference. The  Similarity Ensemble Approach  (SEA), developed by us, classifies targets based on their ligands rather than their sequence identity, structural similarity, pathway role or function, and predicts associations that are otherwise inaccessible and often surprising.  In the first phase of this SBIR  we constructed a global target map using ligand similarity, exploiting this to predict off-targets.  This map suggested mechanism of action targets for several drugs, candidates for repositioning-both aims in the first phase-and predicted ADR associations. It is this latter goal that we focus on here. Extensive preliminary results, including a collaboration with pharma and a proof-of-concept federal collaboration, support the scientific and financial pragmatism of exploiting this platform for predicting adverse off-targets. In the second phase of this project we  develop a direct drug-target-ADR map and developnew techniques to make the method more robust. The specific aims are:  1. To create a full drug-target-ADR map, and demonstrate proof-of-concept. We propose to create a direct drug-target-ADR map. This will be done comprehensively across all approved and investigational drugs, all accessible targets, and all adverse reactions for which targets may be associated. We anticipate that the most important commercial use of these methods and this map will be to prioritize ADR targets to test against for moleculesthat are clinical and preclinical candidates. To show proof of concept against such molecules, we will test investigational drugs for their ability to modulate ADR targets predicted for them.  2. To improve SEA with new methods and new ligand-physiology databases. To make the ligand- target-ADR association map more robust, we will improve the methods and databases underlying SEA. (a) We will develop descriptors of and filters for physical properties of molecules, rather than using ligand topology alone. (b)We will cluster target ligands, rather than assuming they always form a single, cohesive set. (c) We will incorporate ligand affinity weighting into SEA and test the resulting predictions. (d) Finally, we will derive drug-ADR associations from predicted target profiles, rather than relying on individual target predictions alone.  Substantial preliminary results support the promise of our platform for predicting target-based drug adverse events. These are among the most common reasons for drug failures in clinical trials, and there has thus been great interest in this method. The studies proposed here have the potential to greatly improve the breadth and reliability of the method and, correspondingly, its commercial application.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drugs can act on more targets in the body than intended. These off-target interactions underlie many adverse drug reactions and are difficult to anticipate.  In this proposal we improve on a computational method to predict undesirable off-targets proactively, to save time and money in drug discovery by improving drug safety.",

There are a number of unmodified mAbs currently available for patient treatment. However, in order to improve the therapeutic value of mAbs considerableeffort is being focused on enhancing their activity by attaching cytotoxic drugs to the biomolecules. This combination of small molecule drugs and antigen specific biomolecules results in a targeted system for drug delivery, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). However, many ADCs in development have had issues with variable potency as well as toxicity. A significant obstacle to the creation of a successful modified ADC therapeutic is the need to produce the conjugated product in a homogenous form with a defined and controlled toxic payload. However, the existing methods for chemical protein modification result in mixtures of product, with varying amounts of toxin conjugated to the antibody in numerous locations. We have developed a technology platform that enables the chemical modification of proteins in a controlled, site-specific manner. Using this technology we can generate a panel of modified recombinant IgGs that have homogenous attachment sites and are easy to chemically elaborate with a toxic payload. Theresulting homogenous ADCs are loaded with a defined amount of drug placed at a defined position on the protein. If successful, we believe this work will change the utility of ADC  therapeutics and will result in a robust pipeline of best in class drugs. Our first proposed ADC product is an anti-CD22 IgG site-specifically conjugated with maytansine to be used for the treatment of B-cell leukemia and lymphomas.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ion channel drug discovery and safety screening are limited by high cost per data point, low throughput, and complexity. To directly address these industry-wide pain points, Librede Inc. is developing an alternative cell-free technology for ion channel screening, based on the measurement of ion channels in artificial droplet membranes. By eliminating cells at the point of measurement, our technology enables much lower running costs and simplified assay development. In preliminary work, we have used our platform to measure TRPM8 and hERG ion channels and obtain drug IC50 and EC50 values in agreement with state-of-the-art ion channel electrophysiology platforms. In Phase I development of our technology, we created an automation- ready prototype array plate, and verified its reliability and high yield by using it to create over 1000 artificial membranes. In the Phase II work proposed here, we will validate our platform with four ion channels: hERG, Kv7.1, TRPV1, and Cav1.2, selected for their relevance to screening and their degree of complexity. We will optimize the methods of preparing these ion channels from commercially available host cells to achieve highly repeatable and reliable conductance measurements. We will then use these preparations to measure the effects of drugs on the channels&#039; conductance in a dose-dependent manner, generating reliable and repeatable IC50 and EC50 values that we will compare to those obtained from automated patch clamp screening instrumentation. These drug measurements will be performed using the array plates we developed in Phase I, allowing us to evaluate their performance for a simulated screening application. During the proposed work, we will collaborate with the research group of Prof. Jacob Schmidt at UCLA who, with the PI, initially developed the proposed technology. The Schmidt group will aid Librede by initially processing and measuring the ion channel preparations and then transferring this technology to Librede to replicate, optimize,scale-up, and ultimately commercialize. At the completion of this work, we will have validated four highly relevant ion channels pharmacologically in our system and demonstrated its operation in assay conditions. This validation will demonstrate our system&#039;s performance to potential end users and allow placement of instrument prototypes with identified beta testers and early adopters. The Phase II work proposed here is a critical step in the development of our new cell-free electrophysiology platform whichcan address the main industry pain points of cost, throughput, and ease of use (Librede&#039;s value proposition), and has the potential to significantly impact ion channel drug discovery and safety screening.

However, current correlative microscopy solutions require extensive sample preparation before biological specimens can be investigated using EM, which potentially alters the relevant structures and induces image artifacts. Therefore, this Phase II project is aimed to develop and bring to market a universal continuous-flow environmental specimen holder system for the light microscope (LM) and the scanning and transmission electron microscope (SEM and TEM) with a biofunctionable sample substrate and a micron-precision location reference system for correlative microscopy to take advantage of multiple imaging modalities spanning a range of spatial scales and frequencies.

It will also allow sample imaging across LM, SEM, and TEM platforms without additional manipulation. In Phase I we have successfully created a working prototype of the system. The proposed cross-correlated specimen holder platform offers the capability to transform any existing individual microscopes into a complete correlative microscopy system that permits the entire microscopy field to join forces to not only uncover many insights and research the most urgent advances in modern medicine, but more importantly to open new doors and offer opportunities to the entire field of life and health sciences.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultimate goal of this proposal is to generate, maintain, and distribute a new collection of duplication stocks that covers nearly the entire euchromatic autosomal portion of the Drosophila melanogaster genome. Sincethis collection will represent a powerful new set of tools that will benefit virtually all Drosophila geneticists, t is likely that there will be a high demand for this resource. Many of the most important advances in our understanding of human development have come from studies using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as an animal model system. Since many parallels exist between Drosophila and mammals in terms of the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling biological processes, knowledge gained from research in Drosophila can be either directly applied or readily adapted to understanding human biology.  We propose to generate a new duplication collection that, together with existing collections for the X and 4th chromosomes, will cover 99.7% of theentire Drosophila genome. This new duplication set supports a broad range of applications across different fields. First, it will allow rapid mapping and identification of new genes required for normal development and function. Compared to the current mapping approach that uses the molecularly defined Drosophila autosomal deletion kit (MDADK), this duplication collection will offer an average of 10-fold higher resolution. As this duplication kit is based on generating transgenic flies carrying genomic constructs, further manipulation of the same constructs can be performed for downstream functional analysis, including tagging of proteins and structure-function studies. Moreover, these stocks can be used for genetic rescue experiments that are essential for assigning gene function as well as testing and validating the huge collection of mutants held in stocks centers around the world. We estimate that a total of 3,315 transgenic stocks will be needed to complete this collection and we split this project into two phases: Phase I has been funded and is nearly complete: more than 350 of the proposed 400 BACs have been injected and 263 transgenics isolated. Here in Phase II, we will complete the collection. There are three Specific Aims: Aim 1. Select and validatea tiled array of BACs covering chromosomes 2 and 3. Aim 2. Generate and validate a complete autosomal duplication kit. Aim 3. Create and maintain an online searchable database for BACs and transgenics.  Success in Phase I has filled 74% of the bases in gaps in the current MDADK, and has also set the stage for expanding our effort to generate the complete collection. Harnessing the benefits of new technologies, this collection will be another key addition to the Drosophila research tool kit. As a highly desired resource by most Drosophila geneticists across the world, this collection will offer great utility or the entire Drosophila research community, with applications ranging from genetic fine mapping, genomic rescue, somatic clonal analysis, and genomic tagging.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The main goal of this project is to create a new resource for the Drosophila (a fruit fly) research community that will enable more efficient screening for new genes required for normal development and function. Specifically, we propose to create a large set of transgenic flies that will carry duplications that cover virtually all of the Drosophila genme but in pieces that represent only a few genes each. Since the vast majority of genes inDrosophila are highly conserved in mammals and often provide critical insights into human gene function, this resource will greatly benefit both basic and applied research.",

The prototype will be tested for its wound disinfecting capabilities with in vitro wound biofilm models of different clinically significant strains and polymicrobial biofilm. Penetration studies will be performed to evaluate the depth of plasma active species in tissue and mechanistic studies will evaluate the mechanism of inactivation of microbial cells by plasma treatment. We will demonstrate the therapeutic potential of atmospheric plasma to improve wound healing by the removal of microorganisms from the biofilm of splinted excisional wounds of normal and diabetic mice and the introduction of various gaseous nitrogen species. A second generation prototype will be built and tested in a clinical setting with equine lower limb wounds. Following this two year effort, APP will initiate FDA 510K regulatory approval process.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Public Health Impact Statement Chronic wounds affect 5 to 7 million Americans annually and generate healthcare cost in the billions of dollars. More importantly, chronic wounds contribute significantly to the mortality of patients in the United States, and lead to over 80,000 amputations annually due to complicationsin diabetic and peripheral arterial disease patients. Most chronic wounds are treated by outpatients wound care center requiring weekly visits and can take months to years to heal at high costs. The health-related quality of life of patients suffering fromchronic wounds is similar to that of patients wih recurrent cancer. There is an increase in lack of mobility and patients feel isolated and the incidence of depression is significantly higher than the general population. Since many chronic wound patientsare 65 years of age or older and covered by Medicare or Medicaid, there is a push to look at lower-cost alternative treatment technologies. Building upon our expertise in disinfection/sterilization of sensitive items, APP is meeting this demand to effectively treat chronic wounds by developing an Atmospheric Plasma Applicator using its patented atmospheric plasma technology.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetic beads have gained increasing use as a convenient separation technique for many forms of cell, nucleic acid and protein isolations and analyses. In particular, the manufacturers of clinical immunoassays utilizemagnetic beads both as a solid support for antibodies specifically targeted to analytes of clinical importance, and as the separation means to isolate and detect those bound analytes. But use of magnetic beads imposes a paradox. The magnetic beads must have sufficient size - normally on the order of several microns in diameter - in order to be separated in an easily achievable magnetic field. But magnetic beads of this size diffuse only very slowly, and present limited surface area for antibody binding compared to their volume. Thus the size of the current magnetic beads limits the speed and sensitivity that can be achieved in clinical assays. Through advances in template-directed polymer synthesis and nanotechnology, a new class of magnetic nanoparticles can be made. These magnetic nanoparticles, bearing stimuli-responsive polymers, can change from a monodispersed small diameter particle of roughly 20 nanometers diameter to a macro- aggregate of microns diameter in response to an environmental stimulus likea temperature or pH change. By using these advanced nanomaterials, assays can be developed in which the high surface area to volume ratio and the small size / high diffusion of the magnetic nanoparticles provides for higher sensitivity and faster binding reactions compared to current magnetic bead reagents. And then a discrete pH or temperature stimulus can cause these nanoparticle reagents to rapidly co-aggregate into a macro-complex of micron dimensions which can be separated by a magnetic field as easilyand quickly as currently used magnetic beads. This project will develop, optimize, and begin scale-up of these unique assay reagents, and will then demonstrate their value in a model p24 (HIV) protein immunoassay. Phase II of this project will also demonstrate the ability to multiplex various types of HIV tests using these reagents, and demonstrate the potential of removing serum interferences for certain important clinical analytes. The HIV target assay of this project is only a model. These materials present the promise of faster, more sensitive clinical immunoassays for important biomarkers of cardiac disease, cancer, endocrine disorders and other infectious diseases. The multiplex capabilities of these reagents and the potential for removal of serum interferences will be broadly applicable to other clinically important analytes.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Laboratory tests to identify infectious diseases, and cardiac markers, and cancer markers, have to be as sensitive aspossible in order to enable appropriate medical management of patients. There has been a consistent evolution of these tests to greater and greater sensitivity, and thus better patient care. This project is developing a whole new category of chemical reagents to improve these tests further and to enhance their speed and sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microscopic analysis of tissue mounted on glass slides is commonly used to study cancer, non-neoplastic entities such as heart disease and diabetes, and normal cell function. Researchers utilize micro and macro tissue dissection techniques in order to recover specific areas of these tissue sections from the slides for subsequent molecular analysis including real time PCR, microarrays, sequencing, and mass spectrometry. When the area to be dissected is relatively large (afew mm), manual macrodissection is adequate. If single cell resolution is required, Laser Microdissection (LMD) is often employed. Both of these methods have their short comings, particularly when an intermediate level of resolution is needed (100 m to 1mm). The Phase II project continues the goal to develop the MESO system, which is an affordable, easy to use, tissue milling and fragment recovery technology for slide mounted tissue sections. AvanSci Bio has met the Specific Aims of the Phase I grant by developing the manufacturing prototype and successfully completing the planned performance evaluation experiments. However, challenging improvements in accuracy, resolution, and sample preparation methods are necessary to expand the usability of the MESO system. In addition, significantly more testing and validation are necessary to ensure the system performs reliably and up to expectations and to encourage adoption. The two Specific Aims of this Phase II include: 1) optimization of sample prep and milling conditions, beta site testing including performance evaluation and validation, and novel application development; and 2) design refinement primarily to the stage precision and blade pressure control, and improved hardness of xScisor blade and more refined fluid control. This new technology and product is expected to further research and clinical diagnostics by greatly reducing the cost and therefore broadening availability of high performance microdissection. We have demonstrated feasibility for Phase II development and commercialization. Our Phase III goal will be to ultimately manufacture and distribute the MESO System, including instrumentation, software, and consumables to clinicians and researchers doing slide mounted tissue dissection.           PUBLICHEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Mesodissection Device will provide a highly affordable system for dissection of tissue sections from glass slides. This device will provide 50-100 m accuracy and resolution at more than an order of magnitude lower cost than that required for laser microdissection systems, enabling much broader researcher access to the new technology. The mesodissection technology will promote productivity and quality of results for researchers working in the fields of histopathology and cancer diagnostics, non-cancer research including heart disease and diabetes, and areas outside of disease research including cell development and cellular function.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mass spectrometry is now established as an essential tool in the biological research laboratory and is widely used for characterizing clinicaly significant peptides and proteins. However, more than twenty years after the advent of the enabling approaches of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization, there has been only marginal success in the implementation of mass spectrometry in routine clinical determination of proteins. In largepart, this may be attributed to the fact that t present there is no concerted enterprise that systematically tailors and produces devoted analytical platforms and matched standardized assays to meet the specifications and needs of clinical practitioners. In this project we respond to this problem by assembling pioneers in the design, production and application of MALDI-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and mass spectrometric immunoassay: two technologies that will be combined to form a Next- Generation Clinical Mass Spectrometry Platform. These team members are joined by experts in the fields of Clinical Endocrinology and Population Proteomics, whose guidance is essential in defining platform specifications and lead assays for routine clinical application, aswell as for producing the data that underpin an understanding of the importance of protein diversity in the human population.  In this project a cross-disciplinary Industrial and Academic team will design and build a new, dedicated high-performance mass spectrometry platform to clinical specifications, and translate it and accompanying standardized assays into tools that can be exploited in clinical research. The small business members of this team possess unique expertise, intellectual property, and facilities not only to develop the new mass spectrometry platform and assays but also to marshall the resources needed to make the results of the project commercially available in phase III. Completion of this Program will impact a Scientific Knowledge Gap (ofprotein microheterogeneity in human populations) aligned with numerous current and future Significant Research Opportunities in Basic and Clinical Research. Also a scalable Translational Mechanism will be created that expands beyond the initial scope of this Program and deeper into long-term clinical markets by adding more assays towards known clinically significant proteins, as well as other new candidate biomarkers. Consequently, we anticipate the increased use of our Next-Generation Clinical Mass Spectrometry Platform in clinical scenarios where standardized technologies are routinely applied toward known markers to help define pathobiology&#039;s underlying disease, the clinical status of individuals with disease, and as part of advanced workflows toward novel biomarkers stemming from numerous protein-based discovery efforts currently ongoing worldwide.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project takes advantage of a DNA sequencing technology newly developed by Pacific Biosciences called SMRT sequencing. In addition to providing the DNA base sequence, this approach also allows the detection of modified bases. DNA methyltransferases have traditionally been rather difficult to characterize and as a result, we do not currently know the accurate DNA recognition specificity of any DNA methyltransferases. In the case of those that form part of restriction-modification systems, it has always been assumed that they will have the same recognition specificity as the restriction enzyme. However, in some systems preliminary results indicated that this might not be so, and we now in a position to test that explicitly. A knowledge of the specificity will be key on many fronts. Firstly, in some cases it will allow these methyltransferases to become valuable commercial reagents. Secondly, we expect to discover novel DNA methyltransferases with properties that would make them suitable for specific applications. One such enzyme discovered very recently, is M.EcoGI, which appears to recognize all A residues in a sequence and convert them at very high efficiency to N6- methyladenine. The results of this project will also greatly enhance the value of the cloned restriction-modification systems that we have at New England Biolabs and will also help considerably in the functional annotation of newly determined DNA sequences. It is an ideal blend of academic and commercial research and therefore is especially suited for New England Biolabs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   This project will characterize a large number of DNA methyltransferase genes in terms of their DNA recognition sequences as well as the specific base modified. These methyltransferases, once characterized, can serve as useful research reagents and their characterization will also help to improve genome annotation, which can be especially important for bacterial pathogens.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biotherapeutics is a fast-growth sector in the pharmaceutical market with monoclonal antibodies accounting for almost 50% of the 100 billion USD spent each year on protein therapies. Bacterial fermentation, which accounts for about 35% of all protein therapeutics manufacture, continues to be the most economical method of generating proteins that do not require eukaryotic post-translational modifications. The need for efficient and economical bacterial bioprocessing becomes even more important as products such as single chain antibodies gain traction as inexpensive alternatives to monoclonal antibody therapeutics, which are the most expensive of all drugs. The common industry bacterial strains, however, can be problematic.Unmodified strains suffer from overproduction-induced stress responses that limit stable growth and can cause cell lysis. Further, biologics, such as single-chain antibodies, are often protease-sensitive and difficult to produce in common industry strains. Scarab Genomics&#039; unique production platform Clean Genome(R) E. coli was engineered by genomic modifications to the K-12 strain MG1655, eliminating unwanted or unnecessary DNA including mobile insertion elements and prophage. Other deletions were designedto eliminate noxious sequences that can limit their productivity in bioprocessing, and enhance recombinant protein synthesis and plasmid DNA production. The current application proposes to build on the most advanced Clean Genome strain now incorporating 69 deletions for a 20% genome reduction, by generating from this starting point, a new strain combining a low mutation rate with low protease activity. In Phase I we propose to remove protease genes and error-prone polymerase genes to construct a single strain with these properties. This strain will be tested for its capacity to produce simple proteins and plasmid DNA. In Phase II the genetic background will be further refined by deleting from the genome the 23 remaining stress-induced toxin/antitoxin genesand the quorum-sensing gene luxS. This unique stress-resistant strain will be evaluated for optimal growth and production characteristics including its ability to effectively produce single- chain antibodies and other protease-sensitive proteins. Further,it will be tested for production of plasmids with difficult-to-replicate secondary structure. Finally, to meet commercialization standards, the new strain will be compared with competing industry strains in fed-batch fermentations. When developed, the single all-purpose production strain will greatly simplify the manufacture of biologics such as single-chain antibodies and offer the pharmaceutical industry a tool by which the most difficult but high-value biologics can be made efficiently and cheaply.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   This project will enable biotherapeutics such as antibodies to be manufactured much more efficiently. Product quality will be improved by elimination of mutations and degradation. These advantages would help some of the world&#039;smost expensive drugs to be produced in larger quantities and much more economically.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION:  Synthetic Biology is full of promises ranging from discovery and production of new drugs, targeted therapies modifying organisms such as yeast or E. coli or creating totally new ones, higher crop yields, CO2 sequestration to bio-energy projects. However, these goals have been difficult to reach primarily due to the difficulty of De Novo gene synthesis and synthesis of new control and regulatory metabolic pathways all the way to synthetic chromosomes from chemically synthesized DNA. Just like any reversible chemical reaction DNA fragment synthesis by sequentially adding the monomers (A,C,G,T) gives less than 100% yield at each step( typical stepwise yields are ~97-99%) as a result the longer the length of DNA to be synthesized the smaller is thefraction of pure product at the end. Elimination of the errors take significant time and money. The goal of this project is to provide error free long oligonucleotides (100 to 300 mers) at a cost lower than the impure DNA fragments of today to unlock thepotential of synthetic biology. We are proposing to make libraries of clonally amplified and sequence verified long oligonucleotides. Our long term objectives are to implement a commercial service of affordable custom synthesis of sequence-verified long oligonucleotide libraries.  During Phase I, we will 1) to demonstrate that single oligonucleotide molecules can be clonally amplified and sequence verified, 2) to demonstrate that beads bearing clonal amplifications can be captured on a microarray bearing sequence-specific probes and 3) to demonstrate that sequence verified oligonucleotides enable gene assembly with ten fold reduced error rate.  During Phase II, we will 1) to develop a protocol/device to normalize the number of each oligonucleotide surveyed from a library, 2) to establish a standard operating procedure for the production of large libraries of sequence-verified oligonucleotides and 3) to determine the maximum oligonucleotide length that could be offered as a commercial product.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   The unprecedented availability of affordable custom libraries of sequence verified long oligonucleotides will enable faster, easier and cheaper gene and large DNA fragment assembly with major applications in Synthetic Biology.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For dental and other applications there is a great need for self-filling tissue expanders with the capacity to be reshaped to fit the void by the surgeon at time of implantation. Akina recently completed an initial Phase II study using its hydrogel-based reshapable swelling tissue expanders (Restiex(R)). The study validated the function of Restiex to generate additional tissue of rat skin as well as of dog mucosa. Our subsequent dog study indicated that the properties ofRestiex necessary for successful new tissue formation in dogs were very different from the properties identified from the rat study. Importantly, our current study has provided vital information on the Restiex properties required for successful insertion,expansion, and removal of the expander. This continuation Phase II study is to synthesize hydrogels possessing three critical properties identified from the dog studies. Controlling the swelling kinetics and expansion pressure is essential in preventing ischemia which causes necrosis and eruption of the expander. Controlling the mechanical strength is necessary for easy removal of the expander in one piece at the end of the expansion. The new hydrogel tissue expanders with tailor-made properties will be tested in our dog model for safety and effectiveness by Dr. Clark T. Barco, a co-investigator of this study. At the end of this Phase II renewal study, we will have the final formulation of Restiex expanders ready for clinical testing and commercialization.There are three specific aims of this Phase II renewal project: (1) to synthesize reshapable tissue expanders with controllable swelling kinetics, expansion pressure, and mechanical strength; (2) to validate safety and efficacy of tissue expanders in the intraoral dog model; and (3) to establish correlation between in vitro expander properties and in vivo performances. The renewed Phase II project will allow Akina to fully develop its hydrogel-based Restiex that has substantial advantages over current commercially available tissue expanders. No existing tissue expanders allow reshaping by a surgeon and also allow for the controlled swelling kinetics and expansion pressure. With these advantages, Akina&#039;s Restiex is expected to have immediate impact to the field. At the end of this renewal Phase II project, Akina will be able to produce safe and effective novel tissue expanders that are ready for human clinical trials.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This Phase II SBIR renewal project will generate novel hydrogel-based reshapable swelling tissue expanders (Restiex(R)) that are ready to use in clinical studies. In this Phase II renewal study, Restiex will be tailor-made to generate new tissue flap in dog intraoral mucosa without causing any side effects, such as tissue necrosis or expander expulsion through intact tissue. In addition, the in vitro expander properties, resulting from chemical compositions of expanders, will be correlated with in vivo performances of Restiex. This information will allow us to custom-design expander properties based on information on human oral mucosa. This ability will be critical for translation of Restiex from animal testing to clinical applications. The reshapable property of Restiex is superior to anyexisting tissue expanders, and Restiex will provide a new/alternative means of generating new tissues for clinical applications.",

Downstream processing currently accounts for as much as 80% of the overall cost of production of recombinant protein products. Recent advances in cell culture technology have created a  downstream bottleneck  due to the limited capacity and high expense of packed bed chromatography columns. CCTC overcomes many of the limitations of conventional column chromatography by using resin particles in the form of a slurry, which is pumped through a disposable flow path consisting of a series of static mixers and hollow fiber membrane modules. The CCTC system eliminates column packing, which is time-consuming and labor intensive. The system components are much less expensive and linearly scalable enabling a fullydisposable flow path design for large scale systems. This is particularly attractive for production of clinical product batches or for use in multi-product facilities, e.g.,in combination with single-use bioreactors. The overall goal of the proposed research is to design, construct and validate the first cGMP CCTC system. In Year 1, the technology will be refined by testing the performance of the CCTC alpha system at process development laboratories of our early adopters - Fujifilm Diosynth and Regeneron.In Year 2, Chromatan will scale up the technology to be able to process at least 1 kg of monoclonal antibody in the clinical cGMP environment. Chromatan envisions that CCTC technology will provide the following favorable impacts for large-scale commercialapplications of chromatography: ? 10-fold reduction in resin volume requirements compared with column chromatography ? A disposable flow path, eliminating costly cleaning, cleaning validation, and column packing ? Straightforward scalability and the ability to purify up to 1 kg of MAB ? Significant reduction of capital investment (80%) in large-scale operations,  pay as you make   approach with razor / razor blade design. Reduction of capital risk. ? Significant overall savings (65%) on downstream processing costs for clinical capture chromatography. The continuous and disposable nature of this technology will improve public health by decreasing time to market and reducing production costs, both of which will lead to a reduction in drug costs.

Fluidity Software, Inc., developed FluidMath as an educational software platform which enables teachers and students to create, solve, graph and animate math problems using an electronic stylus on the screen of a Tablet PC or an Interactive Whiteboard (IWB) via their own hand-written math symbols and sketches. Fluidity recently released Version 1 of FluidMath for use as an intervention for basic algebra curricula. In Phase I of the study linked to this PhaseII proposal, Fluidity built prototype core example problems for FluidMath that included teacher recommended functionality which optimized the didactic features of FluidMath. Classroom use of these example problems impacted student understanding of math principles and improved student performance as demonstrated by higher test scores. Phase I pilot studies involving 8 teachers and 229 students proved the feasibility of using FluidMath software as a platform upon which basic algebra specific functionality and content can be layered and used for teaching in the classroom. In Phase I, it was shown that when teachers solve example problems in class which optimize the didactic features of the FluidMath platform, student participation in math classes improved andtheir math scores, on average, increased by about 10% compared to when they were taught with other means. In Phase II, Fluidity, collaborating with the Program Evaluation and Research Group (PERG) at Lesley University, will work with about 36 teachers andabout 1200 students and build on a successfully completed Phase I by developing a commercial-grade bank of algebra example problems solved with FluidMath. During Phase II, the research and development team will iteratively develop each example problem andevaluate its research and development work by deploying the example problems with new features and user interface (UI) techniques to receive real-time feedback on student impact from the teachers using these problems in their classes. The product proposedherein, A Bank of Core Example Problems for Teaching Basic Algebra using FluidMath, will provide content for FluidMath aimed at improving student performance. The bank will include about 75 core problems comprising solutions and explanations created by software developers, math education experts, expert teachers and practicing math teachers. The bank of problems will cover basic algebra curricula and will comprise commercial grade software suitable for sale to, and widespread use by, middle and high schoolteachers and students. At the end of Phase II, Fluidity will have a robust product suitable for widespread use that, because of its unique functionality, has the potential to revitalize the teaching of math in our nation&#039;s schools and improve students&#039; math scores.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released updated recommendations onDevelopmental Surveillance and Screening in the Medical Home in 20065 and Autism Screening in 20076; the NICHD emphasize the need for Early Identification and Interventions for Infants and Young Children at Risk for Mental Retardation; and AHRQ has issueda Special Emphasis Notice for research on diagnostic errors (including delay in diagnosis) in the ambulatory care setting.7 Two key gaps noted in a recent AHRQ recommendation statement8 included the needed for screening strategies in diverse populations, and translating effective, evidence-based screening approaches for use in primary care practices. Screening tools are available for general developmental screening, but with no consensus on the specific screens to use in practice. While screening is being increasingly adopted by pediatricians, they often remain uncomfortable discussing the results with parents. This program addresses the need for educational materials that:   bring together information to assist pediatric primary care providers  in choosingtools from among those provided in the 2006 AAP recommendations5;   provide guidance on implementation of screening in practice; and   assist them to effectively communicate the purpose and results of these screens in practice. The key goals of this program directly address some of the difficulties involved in implementing developmental screening in practice. This resource will inform providers about the importance and challenges of conducting developmental screening; assist providers in understanding and communicating those results to parents, and identifying and acknowledging cultural considerations in screening strategies and delivery of results. The specific aims are: Specific Aim 1: To develop the full clinical content for a CME/CE program that will focus on implementation of the use, benefits, and limitations of development screening tools in primary care and communication of results. Specific Aim 2: Complete the web based CME/CE program based on the clinical content outline and findings from the PhaseI grant, including culturally and socioeconomically diverse pediatric populations. Specific Aim 3: Conduct a rigorous evaluation of the program with pediatric primary care providers.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this PhaseII program we will develop a CME/CE Web-based course to assist health care providers understand the purpose and approach to developmental screening, and more effectively communicate results with parents. This program will bring together existing researchand provide an easily accessible source for pediatricians on screening. By providing innovative content via an established medium, we aim, through this product, to reach primary care providers facing this important issue to improve outcomes through early identification and intervention.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by APPLICANT): An overlooked, neglected, yet significant problem in the United States today is the use and abuse of tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs by individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID). Increasing numbers of people with ID are living independently in the community with both its benefits and its risks. Many individuals with ID do not understand the dangers of nicotine use, alcohol, and illicit substances, are lacking in important prevention skills (e.g., assertiveness and problem solving), and have limited supportive social networks. Some of the characteristics found in people with I.D. - short attention span, difficulties with abstract concepts, overly compliant personalities, learning and memory deficits -- increase thelikelihood of substance abuse and its negative consequences. Given the unique learning needs of individuals with I.D., current prevention programs designed for people without cognitive limitations are too abstract, fast paced, and text-based. The goal ofthis project is to develop a comprehensive prevention program -- Dangerous Drug Prevention Skills for People with Intellectual Disabilities (DDPS) -- that will be targeted to this population  and address their unique learning needs. In Phase I a prototypeDVD was developed that covered the first two units. In Phase II the complete interactive, multimedia DVD will be developed for use by people with ID and their learning partner (LP). The final comprehensive DDPS program will consist of nine modules based onresearch-based prevention approaches for this population. The final product will be commercially packaged and video material will be available on DVD. The completed program will be highly interactive and utilize concrete materials, use video models of appropriate and inappropriate behaviors, provide opportunities for role-playing of the materials, frequently repeat key concepts, and provide visual rather than text-based cues. A unique feature of the program will be the use of a learning partner (e.g., direct support staff, parent, advocate) to help the person with ID learn and practice the information provided in the program.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Research on substance use and abuse prevention is highly relevant to public health given the negative consequences of misuse. Individuals with ID are a population at risk for abuse frequently due to their loneliness and need for social acceptance. There is a pressing need to develop prevention materials for this group. By focusing on these individuals with ID, this program brings needed intervention tools for an underserved population.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Phase II project, ADAPT Online (After Deployment: Adaptive Parenting Tools), is to strengthen family functioning and improve child outcomes in reintegrating military families. By developing an empirically supported, standalone, web-based parenting intervention for military families with school-aged children, we expect to strengthen parenting practices in families and prevent behavioral and emotional maladjustment in children. ADAPT Online responds to theurgent parenting needs of military families potentially at risk for depression, anxiety, substance abuse, mental illness, post-traumatic stress, and other  maladies. ADAPT Online is founded on a well-validated theory-based approach, Parent Management Training, Oregon Model (PMTO). In Phase I, we developed and successfully tested modules on emotional regulation and basic parenting skills. In Phase II, we will complete the program by adding PMTO modules. The Principal Investigators have extensive grant-management experience; project team members have years of experience in translational research involving media and Internet technologies. IRIS Media, a recipient of 12 Telly media awards, maintains an active parent-training product line. The project benefits from participation by scientists from the University of Minnesota&#039;s Department of Family Social Science, Oregon Social Learning Center, Department of Veteran Affairs, Department of Defense&#039;s National Center for Telehealth and Technology, and the Services University of the Health Sciences. Drs. Gerald Patterson and Marion Forgatch, key developers of PMTO, will provide expert consultation. ADAPT Online will be the first evidence-based, web-based program providing skills training to military parents. By delivering this material over the Internet, acces to this type of intervention will be greatly expanded and available to parents, therapists and organizations who serve military families. Program development includes focus groups, consultant input and review, usability testing, and a randomized waitlist-controlled trial (N=170) that will test the efficacy of ADAPT Online to reduce parent stress, increase positive parenting skills, and improve child behavior. The necessary institutional support, equipment and physical resources are available to develop and disseminate the program. IRIS has a history of completing Phase I and Phase II SBIR projects and prides itself on its commitment to commercializing training interventions. The proposed Phase II project is expectedto make an important contribution to the field of parenting interventions, and-most importantly-fill a critica gap in existing interventions that currently leaves the very specific needs of parents returning from deployment and their partners/spouses as well as children unmet. Building on a solid history of commercializing media-based training programs, ADAPT Online has the potential to become a widely used program that effectively addresses the needs of military families.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCEPUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The stress of military deployment to combat zones and subsequent re-integration can disrupt family functioning at home and lead to negative outcomes for children and parents that include depression, anxiety substance abuse, mentalillness, and other maladies. Thus, the overarching goal of this project, ADAPT Online: After Deployment Adaptive Parenting Tools, is to develop an innovative, internet-based delivery format to address the unique needs of families of re-integrating servicemembers.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of this project is to develop accurate, rapid, high throughput and cost-effective screening for fragile X syndrome (FXS) and related disorders. FXS is the most common known genetic cause of autism andinherited intellectual disability, and affects roughly 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 6,000 females. The incidence of fragile X carriers is as high as 1 in 130 in females and 1 in 250 in males, and these individuals are at risk for additional disorders that impact childhood early development, including  autism. Newborn screening (NBS) for fragile X is timely due to the disease prevalence, lack of a clear phenotype at birth and corresponding  diagnostic odyssey , current and emerging options for early interventions, and impact of associated syndromes. Access to an inexpensive and effective high throughput screening technology, however, has been a key hurdle. To address this technology gap, Asuragen has demonstrated feasibility in phase I studies for a streamlinedand automated system for blood card processing and fragile X gene detection that exploits an optimized PCR reagent set. Phase I studies were highly successful, resulting in a technology that can consistently and accurately detect fragile X expansions. InPhase II commercialization, these capabilities will be extended by automating a novel, multiplexed screening assay, developing and integrating an innovative set of controls that ensure reliable data interpretations,  establishing an automated algorithm foridentifying positives using a workflow that can accommodate thousands of samples per day, and incorporating a confirmation approach that leverages Asuragen&#039;s validated AmplideX  product technology. As a result, Asuragen will expand on previously successful fragile X SBIR proposals that have led to multiple cutting-edge products by leveraging a team and environment that is ideally suited to develop, optimize, manufacture, and commercialize the proposed Phase II product. The specific aims of this proposal are:  Aim 1: Develop and integrate a set of controls, standards, reagents and QC metrics in an optimized workflow that enables high throughput fragile X NBS from FMR1 normal and mutant blood spots.  Aim 2: Establish a screening system that integrates automated assay methods and software that can enable the automated analysis of up to 4000 blood spot samples per day.  Aim 3: Validate the system in a retrospective clinical study that includes at least 10,000 newborn blood spot samples, with confirmatory reflextesting of expanded alleles.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are developing an automated, rapid, accurate and cost-effective molecular test for screening newborns to detect the characteristic genetic mutation associated with Fragile X Syndrome. Fragile X is one of the most commonly inherited forms of mental retardation and can also cause conditions such as ADHD and autism. The diagnostic tests detects DNA from a small drop of blood spotted on paper and will support early diagnosis which may be beneficial because of current and emerging options for early interventions.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this Fast Track Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) application, submitted by KDH Research and Communication (KDHRC), is to develop and evaluate the School TIME Toolkit (Toolkit) to support parents and teachers of elementary school-aged children who have a chronic illness and intermittent school attendance (CICISA). Children with chronic illnesses, such as asthma, cancer, diabetes and other illnesses with physical and medical effects lasting longerthan three months are at risk of intermittent school absences which can negatively impact their academic and psychosocial outcomes. The burden of navigating and securing school services and easing transitions into and out of school because of absences falls heavily on the parents and teachers of CICISA and can result in their increased stress, depression, and anxiety. The Toolkit aims to reduce this burden by increasing parents&#039; and teachers&#039; knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy toward managing the educational needs of CICISA, providing parents and teachers with practical skills to understand, navigate, and advocate for school services for CICISA, and also decrease their stress and increase their coping abilities. Armed with these improved skills and lower stress, teachers and parents will then contribute to a more supportive school environment for CICISA characterized by greater access to school. The Toolkit will be a comprehensive, evidence-based, integrated set of print and multimedia materials, hostedon an interactive website.  The need for the Toolkit is significant. Approximately 4.4 million children with a chronic illness in te United States experience disruption to school because of their illness. Parents and teachers are key players in helping CICISA access school services, navigating transitions into and out of school because of absences, and establishing support to help CICISA succeed. However, parents and teachers face multiple challenges in providing CICISA with the support they need, and theresulting burden can lead to increased risk for stress and depression. With proper support, however, such as that offered by the Toolkit, parents and teachers can help CICISA spend more time in school and avoid the negative academic consequences often associated with chronic illness and intermittent absence.  In Phase I of the Toolkit, we will conduct formative research with a panel of experts in the field, an online needs assessment with parents and teachers, and a parent/teacher/administrator grassroots program development team. We will then develop the Toolkit prototype, which will consist of the print parent and teacher guides and a website architecture plan. Finally, we will conduct a feasibility evaluation of the prototype using a quasi-experimental, pretest/post-test group design to examine the extent to which the Toolkit prototype changes parents&#039; and teachers&#039; knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy. The Toolkit will be considered feasible if parents and teachers show statistically significant gainsin knowledge, attitudes, or self-efficacy from pretest to post test.  In Phase II, we will finalize th Toolkit by filming footage of streaming video and programming an interactive website. We will then conduct an outcome evaluation that will include threestudies. The first two studies will examine changes in knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, skills, and stress/coping from pretest to post test in parents and teachers. The third evaluation will be a case study examination and will explore how use of the Toolkit by parents and teachers can impact the creation of a more supportive school environment for CICISA. Together, the three evaluations will provide information on the evidence-base of the Toolkit as a foundation for dissemination, as well as a wealth of data for academic publishing.  In summary, the Toolkit will meet a documented need for greater support for parents and teachers of CICISA. The Toolkit will provide this support and increase parents&#039; and teachers&#039; ability to create a supportive school environment for CICISA, while simultaneously contributing to the scientific literature on the needs of these populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   The School TIME Toolkit (Toolkit) will significantly impact the field of public health and education intwo ways. First, the Toolkit will fill a documented need by providing a widely-available, comprehensive, scientifically- based resource to support parents and teachers of chronically ill children with intermittent school attendance (CICISA). The potentialsocietal impact of the Toolkit is significant. By increasing parents&#039; and teachers&#039; knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and skills and decreasing their stress, the Toolkit will provie parents and teachers with the tools to increase access to education for children with chronic illnesses and reduce disruption caused by frequent absences. Reducing school absenteeism is documented to increase high school graduation rates, which in turn reduces health disparities. In fact, increasing high school graduation rates may be more cost-effective in reducing health disparities than me",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Striking changes in dietary patterns and decreases in physical activity have driven the prevalence of obesity among American children to epidemic proportions; low-income and ethnic minority families are especially vulnerable to the socio-economic barriers that influence obesity, with Latino populations being the most severely affected. The proposed interactive, bilingual children&#039;s nutrition education curriculum is uniquely poised to fill the gaps in intergenerational health education and has the capacity to change the paradigm of obesity prevention in underserved, linguistically isolated communities through its attention to the interconnected relationships among the family, community-based care settings, and the powerfulweight of national and local media. These layers of influence comprise the social ecological model (SEM), which this proposal utilizes as a framework to explore the linkages among the multiple influences on children&#039;s nutrition knowledge, attitudes, and behavior. Through the concurrent use of interactive, educational media and activities in (i) low-income family homes, (ii) community-based organizations such as Head Start classrooms, and (iii) through public television, the proposed immersive program promises to provide exposure to nutrition education, enhance children&#039;s communication abilities regarding health topics, and promote intergenerational communication to foster sustained healthy dietary habits for the entire family.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCEIn recent years, the prevalence of overweight and obesity among American children has reached epidemic proportions and become a prominent public health issue in the United States; moreover, studies have shown that its adverse impacts are particularly salient in Latino communities, which display the highest rates of obesity among any racial/ethnic group. The proposed multi-level intervention is designed to affect behavior change by utilizing media to deliver health education while bolstering communicationamong children, parents, and community members. Several benefits may result from the effective implementation of this proposal, including (i) the reduction of health disparities among the underserved and/or communities with limited English proficiency, (ii) the elevation of communicative competence in linguistically-discordant families to improve dialogue between adults and their children around health-related issues, and (iii) the establishment of a new and enhanced paradigm for health promotion interventions designed specifically for underserved minority populations.",

It enables independent repositioning of devices by a person with little or no upper extremity function-from their bed or a wheelchair. With the SMART mount&#039;s ability to move, rotate and tilt devices and trays, a person can move essential items into usable positions, allowing them to easily and independently change activities. For example, they can change from using a communication device to taking a drink, or move things out of their visual field and into a better position for driving their wheelchair-without waiting for assistance Positioning of mounted devices is controlled through an accessible method of choice, such as a switch, voice or joystick control. The accessible and programmable controller allows the setting of custom  sweet spots  for quick and easy movement to reach specific positions.The system moves in a coordinated motion, synchronously adjusting the position of the arms, tilt and height. When preferred, rotation at the joints, tilt and height may be selectively adjusted with the chosen  accessible controls. SMART mounts are Scalable, Modular, and Accessible Robotic Technologies. The principal building block of the SMART mount is the SMART joint-an integrated package within a housing, consisting of a motor, gear set, bearings, and proprietary motor controller, including a position sensor and wireless transceiver. The SMART joint includes a worm gear set in order to provide the torque required to move a sizable load, up to 15 pounds, and to hold it place when a person tilts in their wheelchair. Each arm consists of two SMART joints connected by an extruded arm segment. Reorienting the SMART joint ninety degrees provides a tilt function. A SMART mount system consists of one or two arm segments, tilt and height adjustability, an accessible controller and user interface. SMART modules for tilt and height adjustment can be used and incorporated with manually-operated mounts, providing cost-effective powered functionality. Phase II focuses on: 1) Developing an accessible user interface with a touch pad; 2) develop approaches to expand access through adhoc networks, wheelchair controls, and USB devices 3) design hardware required for the full mounting system, including the SMART joint, and connections to devices and wheelchairs; 4) design and develop the lift module for height adjustability; 5)design for manufacturing; 6) performing tests to confim usability Research methods: 1) Design and develop product using SolidWorks; build prototypes 2) electronics design and firmware development and testing; 3) design, build and test fully-functioning units; 4) produce tooling and near-production units for testing with consumers; 5) involve people with disabilities and professionals in testing prototypes and use their feedback; 6)  use prototypes in emissions and immunity testing; 7) destructive testingPUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: People with disabilities need immediate and ergonomic access to a range of essential devices and activities across a variety of environments, from their beds, wheelchairs and workstations.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diagnosis of preterm labor is the most difficult and important task facing medical practitioners in maternity care today. Knowing when labor has begun as well as predicting when it will start is important for both normal and complicated pregnancies. Presently, there is no effective treatment of preterm labor. The most obvious reason for this anomaly is that there is no objective manner to evaluate the progression of pregnancy through steps leading to labor. Therefore, without methods to accurately diagnosis labor, treatment may never improve. Although preterm labor has major implications in OB-GYN, there are also tremendous healthcare cost ramifications in improving the ability to diagnose and monitor term pregnant patients, especially in regard to incorrectly admitting patients who are not in true labor, as well as incorrectly treating term patients with induction agents (such as oxytocin). It is extremely difficult to exercise proper patient management for women who present to labor and delivery with indications for delivery, but who are not clinically diagnosed as being in labor. Our preliminary studies provide convincing evidence that recording of EMG activity from the abdominal surface is clinically useful in evaluating the state of the uterus. RRT has already received FDA approval for uterine EMG patient monitoring methodology (See Appendix). However, no group has yet developed and utilized real-time, automated uterine EMG diagnostics in a clinical setting for term andpreterm patient assessment and drug treatment efficacy monitoring. No other study has ever compared such a diagnostic system to clinical parameters head-to-head, in a variety of patient subgroups and scenarios. The overall goal of RRT is to develop a marketable and profitable product that will help pregnant women and their babies, and save many maternal and fetal lives. The innovative studies proposed herein will allow us to replace crude obstetric assessment instruments presently used, such as tocodynamometer (i.e.  TOCO ), with a truly objective device capable of measuring the onset and progress of labor, as well as providing a tool to develop better treatment strategies for pregnancy complications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    According to a recentWorld Health Organization Bulletin (Bulletin of the World Health Organization 2010;88:31-38. doi: 10.2471/BLT.08.062554) on preterm birth:  ...Preterm birth is a significant perinatal health problem across the globe, not ony in terms of associated mortality but also with regard to short- and long-term morbidity and financial implications for health-care systems.   Unfortunately, there are currently no effective diagnostic measures for preterm labor resulting in preterm birth, and no effective early interventions for prevention.  The reason why there are no effective treatments for preterm labor and birth is because our ability to accurately diagnose it early and to monitor it while treatments are administered is very limited. New, promising real-time, automated uterine EMG technology proposed herein may change this. And this is just one of the many potential benefits that this system brings to obstetricians and their pregnant patients. This diagnostic equipment could also potentially: reduce cesarean sectionrates, reduce unnecessary treatments and admissions, improve clinicians&#039; ability to monitor efficacy of drug treatments, identify true labor patients, reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality, improve overall pregnant patient healthcare management and reduce associated healthcare costs",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metachromatic Leukodystrophy or MLD, is a genetic disease that affects the lysosomal enzyme, arylsulfatase A (ASA). People born with MLD develop extensive lysosomal storage product accumulation in tissues, including thebrain. Children with MLD develop multiple brain disorders including mental retardation and hydrocephalus early in life. The current therapy in clinical trials for MLD is Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) with the recombinant human enzyme, ASA. However, ERTdoes not treat the brain of MLD, because ASA does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The present work will continue work on the development of a new treatment of the brain of MLD, which is a genetically engineered IgG-enzyme fusion protein. The ASAenzyme is fused to a BBB molecular Trojan horse, which is a genetically engineered peptidomimetic monoclonal antibody (MAb) against an endogenous BBB peptide receptor, the human insulin receptor (HIR). The human ASA is fused to the heavy chain of the HIRMAb to create a new biological entity, the HIRMAb-ASA fusion protein named AGT-183. Phase I studies show the HIRMAb-ASA fusion protein could be engineered and expressed by stably transfected host cells. The fusion protein retained high affinity binding to the HIR, retained high ASA enzyme activity, was triaged to the lysosomal compartment of MLD fibroblasts, and rapidly penetrated the BBB in rhesus monkeys after intravenous administration. The proposed phase II work will develop a manufacturing plan that canbe replicated for future GMP manufacturing. The AGT-183 produced in phase II will be evaluated for safety, toxicology and pharmacokinetics in Rhesus monkeys. The completion of this work will enable entry of the AGT-183 drug development program into GLP toxicology and GMP manufacturing required for submission of an IND to begin treatment of the brain in patients with MLD.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: People born with the genetic disorder called Metachromatic Leukodystrophy, orMLD, develop severe abnormalities of the brain, owing to the inherited defect in the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme, arylsulfatase A (ASA). Enzyme replacement therapy is not effective for the brain, because the ASA does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This research will develop a new treatment for the brain in patients with MLD, which involves the re-engineering of human ASA as a fusion protein that crosses the human BBB.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the number of diagnostic technologies available for adult applications continues to grow, there remains a paucity of technologies suitable for fetal evaluation. In particular, noninvasive assessment of fetal cardiac electrophysiology has not been routinely possible despite many decades of fetal ECG research. Recently, a number of groups have demonstrated the efficacy of fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG), the magnetic analog of fetal ECG, as a new method of assessingfetal heart rate, rhythm, and conduction. The last few years have seen rapid progress in demonstrating the diagnostic efficacy of fMCG, as well as in magnetometer technology. The goal of this project is to reduce the price of a complete fetal MCG system from approximately  1M at present to below  100k. The system we propose to develop is based on new low-cost, room-temperature atomic magnetometers that are just as sensitive as existing superconducting magnetometers. During Phase I we established the feasibility of our approach through independent evaluation in a clinical environment. During Phase II we will develop a full-scale, turn-key system that is ready for commercialization.

Approximately 10% of these are sustained arrhythmias, which are often life-threatening and difficult to diagnose. Recently, a number of groups have demonstrated the efficacy of fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) as a new method of diagnosing fetal arrhythmia. The goal of this project is to develop an fMCG system based on atomic magnetometers that will be far more practical and cost-effective than current systems based on SQUID technology.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of our research is to develop and extend efficient exact statistical tools for testing genetic association, and to incorporate these methods into existing, widely used software packages that will servethe needs of data analysts in pharmaceuticals, epidemiology, public health, and other fields seeking to better understand the genetic causes of complex disease. The demand in this research area for greater statistical and computational innovation is risingdramatically, as rapid progress in genotyping technology is making it easier and less costly to measure sampled subjects for ever-larger numbers of genetic markers. Such investigative markers now predominantly include individual base pair mutations (referred to as single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) along strands of cellular DNA. Marker panels of 1-2M SNPs are now common for genome-wide studies, and developing technologies (such as exome or whole-genome sequencing) will allow routine comparisons overmarker sets that are orders of magnitude larger. With so many hypothesis tests, the need to preserve the rate of false positive findings presents some critical statistical and computational difficulties. Existing methods and their implementations often perform poorly under common conditions. The procedures developed during both phases of our project will significantly improve the efficiency, accuracy, and statistical power of genetic association tests, both for current GWAS panels as well as for next-generation technologies that are yielding even greater volumes of data. This project represents the joint efforts of investigators who are at the forefron of methodological research into genetic association, and software developers who have extensive experiencein making cutting-edge exact statistical methods available in user-friendly software. In this project, we will extend the work begun during Phase 1 by (1) implementing a battery of exact multiple testing procedures for genetic association studies with case-control data, and making their performance significantly more efficient by using a parallel processing approach; (2) developing and implementing new multiple testing procedures for family-based association studies; (3) providing a framework that will allow our parallel processing programs to be as widely compatible as possible with modern personal computing hardware; and (4) incorporating the procedures additionally within a SAS PROC, and developing an interface that will allow users to access R functionsand objects while using StatXact.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Studies of complex disease and genetics now commonly use thousands or even millions of different genetic markers. Conventional statistical analyses in such studies can suffer from a variety of challenges, connected primarily to controlling the rate of false positive findings when carrying out so many individual hypothesis tests. We propose to develop commercial software with computationally more efficient and robust procedures for modern genetic association studies.",

        "abstract": "This Phase II proposal will complete the development of an innovative sequencing platform (NPSeq) based on feasibility demonstrated in Phase I. This platform uses a nuclease protection assay combined with universal PCR to produce targeted sequencing libraries. The lysis-only protocol means there is no need to extract RNA or DNA or to reverse transcribe RNA. Consequently, sequencing from fixed tissue is as sensitive and accurate as sequencing unfixed tissue, addressing an unmet need for drug discovery, translational research, and diagnostics and making available vast amounts of archived clinical fixed tissue for which patient outcomes are known but are difficult to sequence via RNAseq. Comparative performance of NPSeq using FFPE vs. matched unfixed tissue results were better than RNAseq measurements from RNA extracted from the same samples. NPSeq is quantitative, sensitive, and highly reproducible with CV&#039;s of 3%, whether 10 or up to a thousand or more genes are measured. As a result, the same assay/platform can be used for biomarker identification as well as for verification, validation, and the final focused application measuring just a few genes, whether it is a drug discovery assay or an in vitro diagnostic (IVD). We demonstrated this capability with an assay of the whole miRnome of 1,942 miRNA from miRbase 18, overachieving on the Phase I Aims. We also demonstrated that mRNA and miRNA can be measured in the same assay, which is important: while miRNA can be measured from FFPE with greater success than mRNA,housekeeper mRNA genes need to be measured because the amount of diseased, non-necrotic tissue in each sample can be highly variable. Thus, the capability for dual measure of mRNA/miRNA can improve data and exploit the intrinsic (3%) reproducibility of the method. In this Phase II we will optimize, verify and validate the mRNA and miRNA commercial protocols, and develop protocols to measure mRNA mutations that are drug targets, such as gene fusions and expressed SNPs (eSNPs). We will generate an updated, whole-miRNome NPSeq assay (the miRbase19+ assay). We will also identify usable probes for the entire transcriptome and establish a database of gene-disease associations; these two tools together will allow for rapid development of customizable assays. Thesetools will be used to generate several assays during Phase II. We will then go through product development with the miRbase 19+ and several of the mRNA assays - generating data with cell lines and matched frozen and fixed clinical tissue to demonstrate the utility of these NPSeq assays and proceeding to kit development and product release. We expect that assays will provide investigators a pipeline for discovery, verification, validation, and application of biomarkers for their research or as diagnostic assays. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This Phase II SBIR program will develop, verify, validate, and commercialize a new quantitative targeted sequencing platform, NPSeq. Among other things, NPSeq will permit sequencing from the vast archives of clinical fixed tissue attached to known outcomes, allowing diagnostic assays and drugs to be developed more quickly and with a higher success rate. This technique will also improve and accelerate identification of drug discovery targets and diagnostic assay content and its reduction to application, with the end goal of improved patient health over a shorter timeline.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Remarkable improvements in throughput, accuracy and cost-effectiveness of next-generation sequencing (next-gen) technologies are ushering in a new era of clinical medicine. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) in particular have begun to leverage these advances to determine the complete catalog of common and rare variants for each member of a cohort. The resolving power of this approach has the potential to greatly accelerate our understanding, diagnosis and treatmentof human disease. Unfortunately, analysis of these massive data sets requires that several disparate pieces of software be cobbled together including a large capacity next-gen sequencing assembler, variation detection modules, mapping and comparison toolsfor tens to hundreds of variant reports, statistical analysis packages, reporting tools, and so on. Combining and using these tools typically requires extensive bioinformatic expertise as the software is rarely well documented or supported and often depends on having elaborate hardware. These hurdles makes next-gen based GWAS inaccessible to the vast majority of the crucial user base, the physician researchers.  The goal of this proposal is to assemble the essential next-gen based GWAS software components into a single coherent pipeline that that is fully equipped to meet the needs of the medical research community. Consistent with DNASTAR&#039;s 28 year tradition, the software will be easy to use, run on a reasonably priced (lt 3000) desktop computer, and will be fully documented and supported. The pipeline will consist of two modules already available through DNASTAR, SeqMan NGen 3.0 (SM NGen 3.0) and ArrayStar. SM NGen 3.0, our recently released human genome scale assembly and analysis package, forms the frontend of pipeline. Reference-guided assemblies of whole human genome or exome next-gen data sets produce variation reports including impact on gene features and associations with the dbSNP database. Putative variations can be verified by direct inspection ofthe alignment through the SeqMan Pro component of the package. Variation reports from each member of a GWAS cohort will then be fed into our multi-sample comparison and analysis program, ArrayStar, at the back end of the pipeline. ArrayStar has the infrastructure for multi-sample management and processing which can be easily adapted to GWAS analysis. These adaptations and their documentation are a central focus of this application.  Critical to the successful development of this software is our collaboration with Dr. Douglas McNeel (Dept. of Oncology, UW-Madison). The exomes from a panel of prostate cancer vaccine recipients, including responders and non-responders, from the McNeel lab will be sequenced as input from which to build the pipeline using iterative cycles of development followed by evaluation by the McNeel group. This relationship offers an ideal opportunity to build the analysis and reporting software needed by physician researchers to form, test and validate GWAS generated hypotheses.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   The easy to use tools to be developed and integrated in this project will dramatically enhance the efficiency of clinical and diagnostic research for a wide range of life scientists and medical professionals using next-generation DNA sequencing technologies, allowing new treatments to be brought to market sooner, enhancing scientists&#039; understanding of treatment efficacy, and supporting the tailoring of different treatments to specific groups of individuals based on their genetic composition. These tools will be flexible enough to support critical analysis of large populations for clinical research and easy enough to use for all life scientists and medical professionals to feel comfortable with them.",

        "abstract": "PROJECT SUMMARY Project Title: Cloud-Based Bioinformatics for Immune Repertoire Analysis Organization: GigaGen Inc. PI: David S. Johnson, Ph.D. The Specific Aim of this Phase II SBIR grant application is to launch ClonoByte , a website and cloud-based platform for the processing, storage, analysis, comparison, and visualization of immune signature data sets generated by deep sequencing of immune repertoires. There is a rapidly growing demand for T cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoire sequencing as a routine clinical and research practice, but the lack of computational resources and tools is blocking widespread adoption. There is thus a strong additional need for resources to translate immune repertoire data generated by NGS into a format useful to immunology researchers and clinicians. The innovation of our product is to enable researchers with little or no bioinformatics expertise or resources to analyze and interpret immune repertoire sequencing data using a cloud-based platform. In PhaseI, we first built individual computational algorithms and components for processing, analysis, and visualization of immune repertoire data, particularly (i) primary processing of sequencing data for V/J gene identification and complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) extraction, (ii) calculation of sample oligoclonality and sample-sample similarity, (iii) visualization of comparisons of multiple data sets, and (iv) statistical significance testing of findings via a Monte Carlo method. We tested the computational modules with actual immune repertoire data generated in-house for internal research and for external customers. We then integrated several of the key components into the alpha version of ClonoByte . In Phase II, we will take the following steps tolaunch ClonoByte : (i) integrate remaining standalone computational modules into ClonoByte for beta release; (ii) perform software quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) and front- end usability testing on ClonoByte beta; and (iii) refine ClonoByte beta to launch version. We will be successful if the website can achieve the following in the hands of end-users: (i) securely upload raw immune repertoire sequencing FASTQ files for automated primary processing; (ii) track abundance and expansion ofclonotype sequences across multiple annotated data sets; and (iii) compare data sets on the basis of whole- repertoire similarity, sample diversity, and behavior of specific clonotypes. After Phase II, the website will be fully available for commercial use by immune repertoire researchers worldwide. GigaGen's pricing plan will be to offer free use of ClonoByte for the first 10 samples, and then charge a 50/year subscription fee for users that upload more than 10 samples. Though ClonoByte will enable analysis of immune repertoire sequencing data generated by most amplification kits or third-party services, GigaGen will use ClonoByte 's best-in-class features and ease of use to promote its own GigaMune(R) lab services and amplification kits for immune repertoire sequencing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New DNA sequencing methods have the potential to revolutionize how we monitor a patient's immune system during disease progression and treatment. We are building web-based data processing and analysis tools that allow clinicians and researchers to use DNA sequencing data to better understand the immune system.",

At the heart of this mission is the 23andMe research engine, a novel platform for conducting genetic studies that allows individuals to participate in genetic research by enrolling in the company&#039;s Personal Genome Service(R) and taking online surveys. Over 130,000 individuals have contributed genetic and phenotypic data, andthis number is growing by over 50,000 each year. Our initial publications have shown the power and efficiency of this web-based approach for discovering novel genetic associations for a range of traits and diseases. These early successes, however, made only partial use of the rich and rapidly expanding 23andMe database. Our current challenge is to fully mine the genetic and phenotypic information that we are collecting in order to accelerate the pace of human genetic research.  In Phase I of this grant, wehave demonstrated the feasibility of this unique research approach. We have developed new computational tools to facilitate analysis of thousands of phenotypes in hundreds of thousands of people, curated survey data related to many new phenotypes, studiedthe reliability of our genetic data, and conducted user interviews for several surveys.  Building on this foundation, in Phase II we will refine existing survey questions, develop and post new surveys, and analyze a subset of the resulting data to furtherdemonstrate the utility of this platform (Aim #1); implement novel web-based data collection tools to efficiently gather longitudinal and cognitive data (Aim #2); capitalize on the upcoming explosion of whole-genome sequence data through statistical imputation, making it possible for us to discover rare SNPs associated with disease (Aim #3); and test and refine a new tool, the 23andMe Research Portal, that will provide external researchers access to the 23andMe database (Aim #4).  We expect that by the endof the proposed project the 23andMe database will include genetic and phenotypic data for over 400,000 individuals, including members of several understudied populations. This database has the potential to yield thousands of novel genetic associations fordiseases and traits, leading to a greater biological understanding of these conditions, potential drug targets, and improved tools to predict an individual&#039;s genetic risk of disease. A key commercial outcome of the project will be a database and researchengine that is more valuable to potential research partners. Furthermore, discoveries will drive new reports for 23andMe customers, thus increasing the value of the Personal Genome Service(R).

We discovered that a specific protein called MARCKS is a key molecule in themucus secretary pathway. Based on this finding BioMarck developed a novel peptide, BIO-11006, which inhibited mucus hypersecretion as well as release of inflammatory mediators in human airway epithelial cells in culture and in various rodent models. BIO-11006, being a dual function inhibitor mucus secretion and inflammation, is an ideal drug to potentially treat various lung diseases including COPD. With funding from SBIR grants, BioMarck continued work on this project and has recently successfully completed, under an active IND, a 21-day proof-of-concept Phase 2A clinical study in 172 COPD patients suffering from chronic bronchitis with its lead compound BIO-11006. This SBIR Phase II Bridge grant application will allow BioMarck to undertake a 90-day Phase2B multi center, double blind, dose selection clinical study with BIO-11006 with 300 COPD patients suffering from chronic bronchitis. A successful completion of the proposed project will allow BioMarck to select a dose level for the final Phase 3 clinicalstudy. Worldwide the social and economic burden of COPD is enormous. COPD, being the 3th. leading cause of death, accounts for over 5 million deaths worldwide. Although there are more than 25 different drugs currently available in the market, the patientsand the care providers are desperate for effective drugs for the treatment of COPD. BIO- 11006, by reducing both excess mucus and airway inflammation, has the potential to be a first in class drug to effectively treat this patien population.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  More than 200 million individuals worldwide suffer from COPD. As many as 14.8 million people were diagnosed with COPD (and an equal number of undiagnosed) in the U.S. during 2008-09 (NIH Morbidity and Mortality Chart Book, 2012). COPD is known to have caused 140,000 deaths in the U.S. during the same year, and is now the 3rd leading cause of death. The incidence of COPD around the world is rapidly increasing and is largely driven by an increase in the number ofsmokers and increasing air pollution. The World Health Organization estimates that 2.7 million people died of COPD worldwide in 2000. COPD is characterized by progressive destructive changes of airway and lung architecture that leads to limitations in airflow. These physiological changes lead to poorly reversible airway obstruction  and impairment of gas exchange in the lungs. The most common clinical expression of COPD is a combination of chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Chronic cough, frequent clearingof the throat, wheezing, and shortness of breath after mild exertion are common symptoms. COPD is a slowly progressive, mostly irreversible disease characterized by a gradual loss of lung function. Hypersecretion of mucus into the lungs is a major contributing factor in several lung diseases, including COPD, asthma, and cystic fibrosis. Despite the obvious medical importance, there presently are no effective therapies to control excess mucus secretion in these diseases. We discovered that a specific proteincalled MARCKS is a key molecule in the mucus secretion. Based on this finding BioMarck is developing a novel compound, BIO-11006, as a potential new treatment for patients with COPD. With funding from SBIR, BioMarck has recently completed a proof-of-concept early clinical study of short duration in a small number of COPD patients. BioMarck intends to continue working on this project and to develop this potential drug to help needy COPD patients.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be one of the best technologies for the evaluation of cardiovascular pathologies. The broad application of this promising technology is expected to significantly improve the treatment of patients with heart disease in general and ischemic heart diseases in particular. However, widespread adoption of this beneficial technology has been held back by the lack of both software infrastructure and specific software sequences that take advantage of this infrastructure to provide a rapid, complete cardiac ischemic examination. The aim of this application is to bridge our cardiac ischemia package to the clinical arena through targeted technical developments, phantom testing, and clinical data collections designed to facilitate FDA approval.  Under previous NIH grant support through Stanford University, we established real-time rapid imaging sequences for the assessment of wall motion and perfusion. We also established theutility and accuracy of rapid coronary imaging sequences for the assessment of proximal coronary anatomy. Our goal in this proposal is to integrate these methods into a robust ischemic heart disease system to realize the clinical potential of cardiac MRI in the evaluation of  coronary artery disease.  During Phase I and Phase II of this proposal, HeartVista developed and tested the alpha version of the cardiovascular software infrastructure that provides an integrated environment for rapid cardiovascular imaging. This package includes real-time evaluation of myocardial function under stress conditions, volumetric perfusion imaging, high-resolution examination of myocardial viability in real-time and high-resolution examination of the proximal coronary anatomy. We installed the system at selected alpha sites and collected patient data.  Generally, our methods concern  obtaining adequate temporal resolution, spatial coverage, and contrast production for stress imaging using customized pulse sequences and hardware to reduce data acquisition time,  developing an underlying real-time imaging platform that allows the seamless real-time integration of receiver coil  functions, pulse sequences, and post-processing and display that optimizes the workflow for studying patients  with ischemia. This proposal focuses on completing the final technical steps necessary for regulatory approval of our product. This combined examination would provide a robust and intuitive complete ischemic evaluation package that can be performed comfortably in less than 1 hour.  During Phase IIb of this proposal, we will focus the development of our product on the safety and reliability requirements to obtain a 510(k) FDA approval. We will also conduct a clinical study to demonstrate the non-inferiority of our product compared to conventional cardiovascular MRI examinations in robustness and diagnostic accuracy.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Ischemic heart disease remains the number one cause of mortality in the United States. Current diagnostic techniques have significant shortcomings that can result in inaccurate diagnoses. The reduced accuracy leads to a large number of unnecessary procedures. Given the enormous number of these procedures, even a modest improvement in diagnostic accuracy will have a large public-health impact.  Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has been shown to be one of the best technologies for the evaluation of cardiovascular pathologies. It is the only imaging modality that could provide allof the important  parameters of ischemia evaluation in function, perfusion, viability and coronary anatomy in a single examination. The broad application of this promising technology is expected to significantly improve the treatment of patients with heartdisease in general and ischemic heart diseases in particular. However, the adoption of this beneficial technology has been held back by the lack of both a software infrastructure and specific software sequences that take advantage of this infrastructure to provide a complete ischemic examination that can be performed rapidly in the clinical environment. The aim of this application is to develop a robust commercial cardiovascular subsystem that will enable the broad clinical application of this technology.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop a novel quantitative flow through cell counting method for enumeration of CD4+ T lymphocytes in human blood. CD4 cell counts are needed to stage and monitor HIV-infected patients. In adults, the absolute number of CD4+ T cells per microlitre of blood has critical prognostic and therapeutic implications, and is used for both HIV staging and treatment decisions. The gold standard technique currently used for quantitation of CD4 cells is flow cytometry. However, flow cytometers, including smaller single-purpose CD4 cell counting devices developed recently are expensive and inaccessible in resource-limited countries. In addition, they require trained laboratory technicians to handle and process samples and to analyze and report data. Because flow cytometry-based CD4 cell counting is beyond the reach of so many HIV-infected people, the World Health Organization (WHO) has urged the development of simple point-of-care CD4cell count assays designed for resource-limited settings. It is in this context that the less expensive, rapid and easy-to-perform method, which is  free from the limitations of the conventional assays, for determination of CD4+ T cells is proposed to be developed.  The proposed method, flow-through cell counting assay (FTCA) is based on the use of the special membrane and a proprietary flow-through cassette to measure cell count status. The test can potentially be completed in less than 15 minutes and canbe performed by laboratory technicians with low levels of training. The specific aims of Phase II are: 1) To design and assemble a pre-production  -prototype of the FTCA cassette and adapt a blood glucose meter for the FTCA signal measurements; 2) To explore all variables affecting the performance of the FTCA CD4+ T-cell counting method and optimize the performance of the assay; 3) To prepare lyophilized immuno-reagents for performing FTCA and examine the stability of all FTCA reagents; 4) To validate the FTCA by examining a statistically significant number of clinical samples.  Advantages of the proposed technology such as the speed, convenience, and low cost of the analysis substantiates our belief that the FTCA will be widely used in clinical practice.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of the proposed method will allow using CD4 cell counting tests for staging and monitoring HIV infection. Successful completion of these studies will be beneficial for public health,and make available all of the technology needed for a  substantial business opportunity to license the technology and manufacture commercial products.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects 9 to 12 million Americans [1] and 1.5 million will require an intervention (407,400 receive bypass or amputation; 1,080,000 receive angioplasty, stent or atherectomy) each year [3]. Unfortunately, only one-third of patients have a patent artery one year after balloon angioplasty of the femoral artery [4]. Bare metal stents [5-7] have eliminated elastic recoil and flow-limiting dissections bu have not significantly impacted restenosis due to intimal hyperplasia [3, 8-10]. Indeed, stents placed in the femoro- popliteal segment provide patency rates of only 54-63% at 1 year and 28-55% at 2 years [5, 7, 11-12], and drug eluting stents have fared no better than bare stents in eliminating restenosis [13-15]. Recently, use of drug-coated balloons in the peripheral artery has shown potential to improve patency without the need to implant stents [16]. However, the kinetics of luminal-based therapy (drug-eluting balloons and stents) place themaximal concentration of drug at the luminal-wall interface. This has the distinct disadvantage of hindering healing and re-endothelialization of the vessel. Recent data suggests that the adventitia plays a critical role in intimal hyperplasia, contributing to both neointimal cell volum and adverse remodeling. We have successfully completed the aims of Phase 1 research and in pre-clinical studies we have demonstrated non-toxic, efficacious doses of rapamycin, a well-known anti-restenotic agent in a novel nanoparticle formulation, delivered directly into the vascular adventitia through a percutaneous catheter at the time of angioplasty. This method avoids foreign body implantation and creates a high concentration in the adventitia and a lower concentration at the luminal surface. Mercator MedSystems has developed a catheter that slides a single needle through the vessel wall when a balloon is inflated, allowing direct therapeutic access to the adventitia. The catheter has been used in human pilot studies withsuccessful adventitial delivery leading to cylindrical deposition of drugs around the vessel, creating a natural drug-eluting reservoir. We are now proposing to advance this research into human clinical trials, with Specific Aims of confirming safety while demonstrating the positive biological effect and clinical benefits of rapamycin delivered to the adventitia at the time of peripheral artery angioplasty. The innovative product that will be developed in this proposal is a combination device/drug therapythat will be broadly applicable to vascular disease. We believe that the significance of this proposal lies in the fact that (a) we are addressing a recalcitrant clinical problem (b) perivascular or adventitial therapy may be used as an adjunct to severalcommon interventional revascularization techniques and (c) therapeutic success in PAD could be rapidly translated to settings such as coronary and renal artery restenosis or restenosis following coronary and peripheral bypass grafting. If these Phase 2 studies are successful, we intend to move into pivotal clinical trials and ultimately seek FDA approval for a novel combination product.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The changing demographics of Western societies include an aging population with a near epidemic of obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes mellitus, causing a dramatic rise in the prevalence of PAD, which impairs the ability to walk and causes pain, nonhealing ulcers and gangrene in the lower extremities. It is asignificant public health burden and, at its worst, leads to leg amputations. Among individuals most severely affected, revascularization of the lower extremities to restore circulation is the most effective therapy. However, to date, there has been no effective pharmaceutical strategy to reduce the incidence of restenosis due to intimal hyperplasia in peripheral arteries. Therefore, the relevance of this proposal lies in its potential to improve patency of lower extremity interventions, reduce morbidity, and reduce the significant financial burden currently associated with the treatment of peripheral artery disease (PAD).",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bacterial contamination of platelets is considered the greatest infectious risk of blood product transfusion today at about 1 in 2000 platelet units, which is several orders of magnitude greater than that of HIV. Bacterial contamination at high levels can lead to severe morbidity or mortality in transfusion recipients. The American Association of Blood Banks issued directives in 2004 and 2011 requiring bacterial testing on all platelet units. Two recent studies have demonstrated that current FDA-approved culture-based methods that test for contamination 1 to 4 days prior to transfusion miss a majority of contaminated units. The time elapsed between sampling and actual transfusion and the associated risk of bacterial contamination is a fundamental problem that cannot be addressed by current culture-based platelet testing. A rapid and sensitive point-of-issue test for bacterial contamination would overcome this problem by providing an assessment of potential contamination immediately prior to transfusion. Such a test would be used by a hospital laboratory close to the point of transfusion or by a transfusion center preparing to ship platelet units to a clinical center. A rapid test would ideally require less than 15 min, havedetection sensitivity of 104 CFU/mL or better, be fully automated, and be comparable in cost to current tests. BacTx technology, developed by Immunetics for detection of bacterial contamination in platelets, employs a unique and innovative assay chemistrycapable of rapidly detecting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in platelet units. The first-generation BacTx Bacterial Detection Kit recently received clearance from FDA (CBER) as a quality control test for pooled, leukocyte-reduced whole blood derived platelets, but this test is not ideally suited for use as a point of issue test due to its length (45 min) and complexity (requiring centrifugation and accurate pipetting). In the Phase I project, we successfully demonstrated feasibility of a simple, filter-based BacTx assay which is rapid (lt15 min) and highly amenable to automation, while maintaining the high sensitivity and specificity of the original BacTx test. In Phase II, we will optimize and configure the rapid test for automated performance and will design, build and evaluate prototype instruments and software to run the test. The instrument and software development will be carried out in collaboration with engineering partners who have many years of experience in the development of medical test systems with comparable functionality. At the conclusion of Phase II, we will have developed and validated an integrated rapid BacTx test system ready for clinical studies aimed at 510(k) approval. Commercialization of this rapid test will enable aparadigm shift in platelet testing and a significant reduction in the number of bacterially contaminated platelet units transfused into critically ill patients. Furthermore, adopton of the rapid BacTx test could ultimately lead to a change in policy regarding platelets, significantly reducing costs for blood banks by allowing an extension of the storage life of platelet units from 5 to 7 days.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to complete engineering development and pre-clinical testing of a transapical miniaturized ventricular assist device (tMVAD) to treat patients with less advanced heart failure (HF). HFis increasing worldwide and represents a major burden in terms of health care resources and costs. Despite advances in medical care, prognosis with HF remains poor, especially in advanced stages. Currently, LVAD therapy, though increasing (4,000 cases/year), has not yet met the clinical demand (gt 100,000 HF patients/yr). It requires a major operative intervention, arrested heart with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and blood component exposure, which have been associated with significant adverse event ratesand longer recovery periods. To overcome these limitations, HeartWare (Miami Lakes, FL) has developed a miniaturized transapical left ventricular assist device (tMVAD). Unlike other MCS devices currently in clinical trials, the tMVAD is significantly smaller in size and weight and only requires a single insertion through the apex of the left ventricle. The tMVAD is designed for intraventricular implantation with an outflow  cannula that crosses the aortic valve. The device can be inserted via a minimally-invasive approach (subcostal incision or mini-thoracotomy) to access the LV apex, and eliminates the need for creation of the preperitoneal pocket, and anastomosis of the outflow graft. The tMVAD consists of a pedestal section that is attached to the epicardial surface near the left ventricular  (LV) apex, a standpipe that carries the drive cables for the motor externally to the LV, a pump housing that contains the tMVAD core assembly and a vane diffuser, and a self-centering outflow cannula positioned acrossthe aortic valve. The technological advantages and clinical benefits of the tMVAD include antegrade flow, beating heart surgery with no CPB, and ease of implant (and removal) that enables physicians to treat patients with less advanced HF, improve patientoutcomes shorten recovery time, and lower hospital costs. In this phase II proposal, we will complete engineering development and pre-clinical testing of the tMVAD to support a FDA submission for phase one (n=10) and phase two (n=300) clinical trials. Toachieve this objective, we will complete the engineering development and design freeze of the tMVAD in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) specifications for a human implant quality system; demonstrate efficacy and biocompatability of the tMVAD by completing Validation and Verification (VandV) testing (fatigue), anatomical fit and surgical procedure study (human cadaver, n=10), and in vivo acute (n=8) and chronic 90- day (n=8) studies in a bovine model; and demonstrate long-term safety and reliability of the tMVAD in normal (N, n=8) and chronic ischemic heart failure (IHF, n=8) animals in a 90-day Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) study. The GLP study design includes statistical comparison of normal and ischemic heart failure bovine model in control (no LVAD support) to test (tMVAD support) groups. The pre-clinical GLP, VandV, and GMP study data will be used to support an IDE application for a clinical trial in patients with advanced heart failure. Our long- term goal is to successfully translatethe  HeartWare tMVAD into clinical practice to treat earlier stage HF patients to achieve improved patient outcomes and restore their quality of life.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HeartWare (Miami Lakes, FL) is developing atransapical miniaturized ventricular assist device (tMVAD) that can be implanted using a less invasive surgical procedure (subcostal or mini-thoracotomy) on a beating heart (&#039;off pump&#039;) without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The clinical benefits of the HeartWare tMVAD include the opportunity to treat patients with less advanced HF for bridge-to-transplant (BTT), destination therapy (DT), and/or bridge-to-recovery (BTR), which will shorten recovery time and lower hospital costs while improving patient outcomes and quality of life.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Problem: Over 60% of the 600,000 patients undergoing cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB) procedures in the US each year experience excessive bleeding, which requires transfusions of blood products. There are four treatment options available, each corresponding to a specific hemostatic defect: (a) fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to correct the plasma coagulation factors, (b) platelet concentrate to restore platelets, (c)  cryoprecipitate to restore fibrinogen, and (d) anti-fibrinolytics to slow the activity of the clot-dissolving proteins. However, clinical literature strongly indicates that morbidity and mortality risks increase in a dose-dependent way with increased use of blood products. It has been estimated that each unit transfused increases the post-operative odds of severe infection by 76%, cardiac morbidity by 55%, neurological morbidity by 39%, and overall in- hospital mortality by 77%. Furthermore post-operative length of stay increases by 0.82 days per unit transfused.Meanwhile, targeted use of these products can produce savings of up to  4M/year per hospital. Unfortunately, there is no global test of hemostasis available at the point of care (POC), which is  able to provide rapid results about the best treatment option. The tests that are available at POC can&#039;t provide the required information, even if used in combination. Thus, current clinical practice is iterative transfusion of blood products and subjective evaluation of bleeding. This process is slow and prone to over transfusions, resulting in increased risk of worsened outcomes and unnecessary expenses. HemoSonics&#039; Proposed Solution: HemoSonics LLC is developing a POC instrument, the Global Hemostasis Analyzer (GHA) that can quantify the function of the four hemostatic components, enabling correct selection of treatment. The GHA is based on sonorheometry (SR), a novel technology able to assess not only time to clot (dependent upon the plasma coagulation factors) but also clot formation rate (dependent upon fibrinogen), clot stiffness (dependent upon fibrinogen and platelets), and time to lysis (dependent upon clot-dissolving proteins). The GHA will help: (i) the surgical team administer the correct treatment, (ii) the hospital save costs by reducing unnecessary transfusions, (iii) the  blood bank save blood products, and, most importantly, (iv) improve patient care. Proposed SBIR Work: In Phase I, we successfully completed demonstration of the feasibility of SR to measure the function of the four hemostatic components. In Phase II, we intend to finalize prototype development and evaluate its performance in CPB, in order to test the hypothesis that SR can provide information that will aid in minimizing unnecessary transfusions, reducing overall healthcare spending andimproving patient outcomes. Furthermore, data obtained in these studies will be utilized for FDA regulatory approval. This research is a collaborative effort  between HemoSonics, the University of Virginia Department of Biomedical Engineering and School ofMedicine, and Medical College of Virginia (Virginia Commonwealth University).           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinical evidence strongly indicates that improved management of bleeding with targeted use of blood products can reduce morbidity and mortality risks while producing significant cost savings. It has been estimated that each unit of blood products transfused increases the post-operative odds of severe infection by 76%, cardiac morbidity by 55%, neurological morbidity by39% and overall in-hospital mortality by 77%. Post-operative length of stay also increases by 0.82 days per unit transfused. Meanwhile, targeted use of these products can produce savings of up to  4M/year per hospital. Unfortunately, management of bleedingremains suboptimal due to the limitations of current diagnostic tests. The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel point-of-care (POC) diagnostic instrument that will improve the current management of bleeding and usage of blood products, thus improving patients&#039; outcomes and generating substantial cost savings.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a global health issue that affects ~100,000 Americans and over 13 million people worldwide. The complexity of the disease dictates that a multimodal approach to treatment will likely be needed. SCD is manifested physiologically during acute events of sickle crisis as the distorted red blood cells impede blood flow, causing physiological damage and severe pain. Generally characterized as a molecular disease, SCD exhibits many similarities withthe pathophysiology of inflammation and reperfusion injury. As such, various forms of antioxidant therapies are being actively pursued as a new approach to treat SCD. No commercial therapeutic is available to treat or avert acute events of crisis, as thedevelopment has been stifled by the high (and toxic) concentration required for efficacy. Acute events are currently only managed with pain medication. Product and Long-Term Goal: Nanometics has developed a new type of multimodal therapeutic, termed AIC- 6020, as a small-molecule medication to be taken by patients at the onset or during sickle crisis. AIC-6020 directly modifies hemoglobin (HbS) to both inhibit sickling  and to release a known antioxidant to help attenuate oxidative stress events in the microcirculation by antioxidant/anti-inflammatory mechanisms. AIC-6020 will be the first commercial therapeutic useful to treat acute events and the first multimodal therapeutic for SCD. Technical Innovation: Nanometics has developed a new class of multimodaltherapeutics to treat sickle cell disease that incorporates two distinct therapeutic mechanisms into one chemical compound. The lead therapeutic reacts with HbS at stochiometric concentrations by a distinct transaldimination mechanism. Phase I Hypothesis and Specific Aims: The Phase I hypothesis was that AIC-6020 would be more effective and less toxic than 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (5HMF). This hypothesis was successfully validated in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo (mice) where the efficacious concentration ofAIC-6020 was gt50% lower than that of 5HMF. Phase II Objectives: The Phase II objectives will be to 1) optimize the AIC approach to inhibit sickling at the lowest possible concentrations of AIC-6020, (2) establish the bioavailability of AIC-6020 and determine its toxicological and histopathological profile, and (3) examine the impact of AIC-6020 to attenuate events in the microcirculation that are etiologic to sickle cell disease. Commercial Opportunity: In the US alone, there are ~190,000 emergency room visits annually by patients seeking treatment for acute events of crisis, and ~42% of these visits required hospitalization for  an average of 5 days. Additionally, there are ~300,000 babies born each year with sickle cell disease, and as infant death ratesin developing countries decrease, the target market of patients is expected to rise dramatically over the next 20 years.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that affects ~100,000 Americans and 13 million people worldwide.

Transplants using stem cells from umbilical cord blood provide an alternative for these patients, allowing transplantation to proceed with less stringent HLA-matching requirements. Unfortunately, in addition to the risk of relapsed disease, patients undergoing cord blood transplants have a high risk of death from infections due to slow reconstitution of their immune system.     In this clinical observational study, we propose to use high-throughput DNA sequencing of T- Cell Receptor (TCR) and Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes from peripheral blood to study the reconstitution of the adaptive immune system following cord blood transplant. We will use high-throughput sequencing to estimate the diversity of T- and B-cell receptors in each of approximately 240 patients at defined time-points following transplant, and demonstrate a correlation between our measure of adaptive immune receptor diversity and subsequent morbidity and mortality from infectious complications.     Further development of this technique would lead to a Phase III application with a clinical interventionstudy in which this assay would provide a diagnostic method to identify patients at high risk for infectious complications soon after transplant. Clinical care would be administered for an increased-intensity regimen of antimicrobial prophylaxis to high-risk patients.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute limb ischemia reperfusion injury (LIRI) is characterized by an imbalance in the free radicals nitric oxide and superoxide anion. Accordingly, replenishment of nitric oxide and removal of superoxide are each partially effective, but greater protection of muscle injury is expected from the simultaneous correction of both abnormalities. To address this unmet clinical need, Radikal Therapeutics (RTX) is developing R-100, a novel small molecule agent formed from the covalent linkage of an organic nitrovasodilator that releases nitric oxide, and a pyrrolidine nitroxide that acts as a superoxide dismutase mimetic, catalase mimic, and peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst. In combination, these functionalities allow R-100 toremove toxic reactive oxygen species and deliver nitric oxide without the confounding effect of producing peroxynitrite. In a Phase 1 SBIR, we demonstrated in a severe murine model of acute LIRI that R-100 resuscitation profoundly reduces limb histologicdamage, lipid peroxidation, neutrophil infiltration, and % of injured muscle. Given the centrality of these pathophysiologic mechanisms to clinical LIRI, our Phase 1 SBIR data justify progression to the Phase 2 SBIR scope of work. Aim #1: Rank order the potency of R-100 and its analogues in a rodent model of LIRI R- 100 (both enantiomers) will be compared to 10 analogues in a murine LIRI screening model. The top 3 performing agents will be compared over their full dose-responses (20, 40, 80 mg/kg/day) in order to annoint the best performer as the candidate molecule (CM). Aim #2: Establish the pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of the CM in a porcine model of acute LIRI. We will scale-up and manufacture gt 99% pure CM in to support large animal efficacy studies andfollow-on GLP toxicology and safety pharmacology investigations. In a large animal model of acute LIRI (n=6 minipigs per group) induced by an endovascular balloon occlusion of the femoral artery for 6 h, we will establish the dose-response of parenteral CM (0, 10, 30, 80 mg/kg/day TID) initiated 10 min before reperfusion via direct arterial infusion, f0llowed by an IV infusion thereafter. At 7, 14, and 21 days after reperfusion we will correlate limb perfusion (by Doppler flow), nerve conduction velocity (NCV , per electromyography,  EMG ), and muscle strength (by foot pressure on a walking surface) with simultaneous plasma concentrations of CM in order to construct a PD profile. Aim #3: Establish the acute safety, toxicity, and tolerance of IV CM in the minimum set of  GLP toxicology and safety pharmacology studies required for FDA IND application. We will carry out the minimum set of required FDA-mandated IND-enabling GLP studies to support application for a first-in-man, dose-escalation, single-dose investigation of IV CM in healthy human volunteers. Genetic toxicology studies will include: the Ames, chromosomal aberration, and rat micronucleus assays. Safety pharmacology investigations will include: 1) rat neurobehavioral and respiratory studies, and 2)canine cardiovascular studies.

In the United States, the estimated annual incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) is 745,000 new and 410,000 recurrent episodes. There is a critical need to develop new therapies since end-stage heart failure is only treated through heart transplantation or left ventricular (LV) assist devices, and current pharmaceutical regimens do not adequately prevent post-MI negative LV remodeling. As an alternative to total heart transplantation, cellular cardiomyoplasty, or cell transplantation, has been explored for the  treatment of MI and heart failure; however, more recently a cellular biomaterials have shown great promise in providing similar functional benefit without the complications associated with cell delivery. Biomaterial products have the key advantages of being off-the-shelf available and relatively inexpensive to manufacture. Existing materials have howeverbeen limited since none have been specifically designed for the myocardium, and none mimic the degraded post-MI extracellular matrix (ECM) they are intended to replace. The materials suffer from 1) their inability to be delivered via current catheter technology, and/or 2) their lack of complex, myocardial specific ECM cues, which promote repair. The material used for the Ventrix product is the first example of a myocardial-specific material that can be delivered via catheter to promote repair in the post-MI environment. This material is liquid at room temperature and forms a porous and fibrous scaffold upon injection into the myocardium. We have shown that it promotes cell influx, increases areas of surviving cardiomyocytes, and preserves LV geometry and cardiac function in a rat MI model, and can be delivered through a percutaneous transendocardial approach in a porcine model. In our Phase I SBIR, we demonstrated that VentriGelTM increased cardiac muscle, improved cardiac function, and prevented negative LVremodeling following catheter based delivery in a porcine MI model. The studies proposed in Phase II are part of the final steps to initiate studying VentriGelTM in patients, and a key step i bringing a biomaterial product to market, which will be complementary or mostly parallel to the current MI pharmaceutical market. In Phase II, we will achieve the following two specific aims to reach our goals: 1) To demonstrate an improvement in cardiac function and negative LV remodeling following delivery of VentriGel  post-myocardial infarction and to determine its optimal volume and delivery time window in a porcine acute myocardial infarction model and 2) To assess safety of VentriGel  via toxicology studies required for IND submission to the FDA. The objective of the proposed project is to complete the key preclinical studies for VentriGelTM to translate to the clinic. This will be the first catheter deliverable regenerative biomaterial product for treating the millions of patients suffering from MI.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Artificial cardiovascular devices (ACDs) including ventricular assist devices (VADs) and mechanical heart valves (MHVs) have been implanted into millions of patients, to save or improve their lives. The increasing success of ACD implants has been accompanied with the unfortunate fact that these patients have to take powerful anticoagulant drugs and maintain a critical dosage level in the blood to avoid thrombosis or hemorrhage. Long-term anticoagulant maintenance is individually, socially and economically expensive considering the complications to individual patients and the huge world-wide case load. In addition, most pregnant and immune compromised patients cannot normally take anticoagulants. Advanced Diamond Technologies (ADT) proposes to eliminate thrombus without the help of anticoagulants, by introducing a biocompatible interface material, Ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD(r)), for all the immune-triggering surfaces of ACDs. UNCD is an extremely smooth, hard, andlow-cost polycrystalline diamond developed by the applicant. In the Phase I project, as a world first, UNCD was successfully integrated on a Jarvik 2000(r) heart VAD and implanted into a sheep which survived for 3 weeks with no adverse consequences from the diamond coating. The minimal thrombus build-up in the VAD implanted in the sheep suggests UNCD will be a near-ideal anti-thrombogenic material. With the partner collaboration and experience gained from the Phase I work, UNCD coated ACDs will be developedto near commercial stage through this Phase II project. Based on the sophisticated UNCD coating technology, the goal will be expanded from short term VAD implants to the long term ACD, mainly mechanical heart valve (MHV) in close collaboration with JarvikHeart and Meril Life Science. The Phase II goals will address the issues of concern identified in Phase I, e.g., improving adhesion to an extremely robust level targeting long-term implantation. A major coating challenge in terms of the principle materialfor MHVs, pyrolytic carbon (PyC), will be addressed too. As a key step to bridge our technique to a product, ADT will work with Oklahoma State University to study the biocompatibility, hemodynamics and durability of the UNCD coated ACDs. If the project issuccessful, the potential US market for UNCD VADs and MHVs is at least 40,000 and 250,000 units respectively per year, over  400 million in total for UNCD coating worldwide. More importantly, the human, societal, and economic implications of the successful application of this novel antithrombogenic material would be staggering. As Dr. Gott, one of the fathers of the MHV commented in his review,  Eventually, with the right valve design and the right valve material, it is conceivable that we may someday havea mechanical valve that does not require lifelong anticoagulation therapy.  We are making effort with an expectation that UNCD will be this  right material.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Artificial cardiovascular devices (ACDs) have been implanted into millions of patients, to save or improve their lives, but leaving almost the only issue of the  dependence on using anticoagulants. If successful, the proposed research will lead to a durable, affordable and biocompatible UNCD(tm) interface to inhibit or eliminate thrombosis on implanted ACDs without using anticoagulants.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will introduce a completely new approach for inducing mild hypothermia and cerebral cooling. Therapeutic Hypothermia (TH) has previously been shown to improve patient survival and neurological outcomes, butit has only been adopted by a small fraction of medical healthcare systems. The lack of adoption has, in part, been due to poor implementation methods that are either impractical, ineffective, or they interfere with EMS resuscitation efforts. This projectwill test and demonstrate a novel trans-nasal evaporative cooling device that solves these issues, which will facilitate a broader level of adoption and use of the therapy. Current induction techniques rely on some form of active cooling, whether by ice packs, cold saline or evaporative fluids. Our approach is novel in that we are harnessing a physiologic process that triggers the body to cool itself. There are no active cooling systems or evaporative chemicals. Our cooling method uses only dry, ambient air. The upper respiratory tract is very efficient at conditioning inspired air (prior to arrival at the luns), i.e., it can humidify dry air to full saturation very quickly. This humidifying process requires energy to convert water in the body to a vapor that is then mixed with the incoming dry air. Our cooling approach uses this physiological response to achieve the desired hypothermia. We force dry air through the nasal track and then extract the moisturized air, which effectively pulls energy and heat outof the body. This project will be completed in several sequential stages. In Phase I, we will build on our preliminary studies with pigs to optimize the cooling process variables, looking at a range of air flows and temperature. We will also develop a simple prototype device to deliver the therapy and to confirm the safety of the method. In Phase II, we will develop a clinical-grade device and perform additional pig studies to confirm that the induced hypothermia is safe, effective and is associated with improved outcome of resuscitation and short term neurologic function. We will end Phase II with a small human study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the process in humans. This work will validate a new method for inducing hypothermia that can be easily deployed during treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, as well as other ischemic injuries to the brain and the heart. We plan to continue our development program into larger clinical trials (post Phase II) to assess clinical benefitsassociated with introducing this therapy early after ROSC. Ultimately, we plan to leverage this grant program into the creation of a new product and therapy model that will have significant clinical and economic value.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   Cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death in the developed world. This project will develop and test a new device that will be able to quickly and safely cool the brain and body after a heart attack, which will be used by emergency medical services (EMS) personnel. This type of cooling has been shown to dramatically improve rates of survival and reduce brain damage.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Blood-Typing is the progenitor of the entire field of personalized medicine. In the recently awarded 6-month Phase I, we proposed to take the first step in the development of an extremely-low-cost microarray test,  TheTransfusion-Chip  (T-Chip) which convert the historical practice of Blood-Typing by serology into a simple inexpensive DNA test. Here, in this follow-on Phase II, we demonstrate substantial success in achieving key Phase I milestones: we have developed andoptimized 22 PCR reactions, comprising the entire 7 gene blood group gene set [ABO, Rh, Duffy, Kidd, Kell, Dombrock and MNS]; we have fabricated a Transfusion-Chip microarray prototype capable of analyzing all known genetic variation in the 7 gene set; and via technology that we had not yet invented when we filed the Phase I, we have developed a new variant of the original GenUSA microarray test which will drop the manufacturing cost of T-Chips to values as low as  1 per microarray.  In Phase I we have also shown that the raw, unpurified OrageneTM-stabilized saliva can used as the basis for DNA based Blood-Typing on the T-Chip. We feel that the coupling of raw OrageneTM-stabilized saliva collection with the low cost T-Chip could become a unique technology pairing: because it would allow self-collection of DNA samples, at home, then low- cost ambient temperature shipping to centralized labs, to be followed by very-low-cost, very high throughput Blood-Typing on T-Chips. This model for population scale Blood-Typing will be the development focus in this Phase II: thereby enabling, we propose, an entirely new vision for population-scale blood banking and transfusion medicine, and in the process, will allow Blood- Typing to return, in the 21st century, to prominence as the model and gold standard for the field of genetically personalized medicine: as it first did a hundred years ago. Based on that model for population-scale blood group genetic testing, we propose the following set of Phase II Aims. SA1. Complete andValidate the Multiplex PCR Front-end to the Transfusion-Chip, for DNA Samples. SA2. Complete and Validate the Multiplex PCR Front-end to the Transfusion-Chip, for Raw Samples. SA3. Optimize and validate fabrication of the Transfusion-Chip in the 48 arrayper slide   1 microarray  format. SA4. Modify existing GenUSA analysis software, RicimerTM, for automated blood group typing. SA5. Validate the Transfusion-Chip for purified DNA, raw blood and raw OrageneTM-stabilized saliva samples.  Phase II Deliverablesand Commercialization Plan. Upon completion of this Phase II, we will have ready a Transfusion-Chip kit prototype (microarrays, PCR reagents, Hybridization Reagents, Specialized Software) for subsequent Beta Testing. This kit will be prepared under manufacturing control (ISO 13845) similar to the HLA-Chip products from GenUSA which are currently being launched into tissue compatibility and immunogenetics markets. Subsequent to completion of Phase II, GenUSA will launch the T-Chip into the RUO Blood-Typingmarket and prepare simultaneously for FDA 510(k) submission to enter into the diagnostics market either alone, or in partnership with those with a proven market presence in transfusion medicine or at-home sample collection, or both.           PUBLIC HEALTHRELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Blood group antigen typing by serology (Blood-Typing) has been, for a century, the progenitor and gold standard for the entire field of personalized medicine. Here we propose to pair two technologies recently developedat GenUSA [Raw Sample Genotyping +  1 Microarrays] to allow Blood-Typing to become a low-cost genetic test: A saliva or a dried blood sample could be self-collected at home in a simple clinic, then shipped by ordinary book-rate mail to a central lab, whereupon arrival in the lab, Blood-Typing would be performed inexpensively via   1 microarray testing . We propose that this new vision for very-large-scale public health genetics will not only revolutionize the regulation of the blood supply and the practiceof transfusion medicine, but will also serve as a model for a new approach to genetically personalized medicine: much as Blood-Typing, by serology, created (personalized) Transfusion Medicine a century ago.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most costly and second most common hospital-acquired infection (HAI), accounting for over 86% of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Some 300,000 HAP patients are treated annually in the U.S., at an estimated annual hospital cost of more than  1.5 billion. The current paradigm for preventing VAP has been to implement patient care bundle practices and to use antimicrobial agents that reduce bacterial colonization on the tube surfaces. However, these strategies have not demonstrated consistent efficacy or widespread adoption. A major concern is the use of antimicrobial agents that lead to resistance patterns that make infections more difficult to treat. Under this multi-phase SBIRproject, Sharklet Technologies therefore proposes to advance the state-of-the-art in this key area by developing, validating, and commercializing a novel endotracheal tube (ETT) design that is capable of sustained biofilm inhibition and that does not relyon traditional antibiotic coatings. This novel technology is based upon the proven Sharket-patterned surface that has been developed successfully under previous SBIR funding. Phase I studies met and exceeded research goals to optimize the Sharklet patternand to obtain at least 50% reduction (plt0.05) of bacterial biofilm coverage of P. aeruginosa and MRSA in conditions that exacerbated biofilm growth such as mucin-rich media and presence of sub-lethal concentrations of antibiotics. The overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to further develop, validate, and commercialize the use of the biomimetic Sharklet microscopic pattern to inhibit bacterial biofilm formation on the ETT surfaces without the use of antimicrobial agents.  The Specific Aims forPhase II are to 1) manufacture prototypes of the Sharklet micro-pattern for completion of regulatory verification and validation testing; 2) carry out an FDA-recognized in vitro ventilator-endotracheal- lung model to test Sharklet micro-patterned ETT prototypes for inhibition of colonization and biofilm formation with clinical isolates of the most common VAP causative pathogens; 3) demonstrate reduced microbial colonization, biofilm formation, and lumen occlusion in a sheep model; and 4) carry out a clinical pilot study in the Massachusetts General Hospital&#039;s Surgical ICU to demonstrate reduced ETT colonization, biofilm formation and lumen occlusion. We will also submit a 510(k) with all of the Phase II data to obtain a device-level claim. The Phase II project will be carried out by the expert interdisciplinary RandD team that  completed the Phase I work and that has completed successful Phase I and Phase II SBIR projects for NIH previously. Post-Phase II commercialization will involve scaled-up manufacturingmethods for ETTs with Sharklet-patterned inner, outer, and cuff surfaces. The Phase II SBIR data will be essential in attracting and fully engaging industry partners with whom we are already discussing this technology (see letters).      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every patient who receives mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube (ETT) is at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)-the second most common hospital-acquired infection, which has a high mortalityrate and results in medical costs of some  1.5 billion annually in the U.S. alone. Given that an effective solution to this problem will require ETT device alterations, Sharklet Technologies, Inc., proposes to pursue the needed advance in the state-of-the-art by incorporating its Sharklet  microscopic pattern onto the ETT surfaces to inhibit biofilm formation that leads to infection and to ultimately reduce  the incidence of VAP. This multi-phase SBIR research effort is focused on developing/commercializing a Sharklet- patterned ETT that significantly augments current ETT designs with the goal of increasing patient welfare and safety while greatly reducing medical costs.",

Current methods for assessing the extent of cardiac ischemic injuryin an acute setting offer limited sensitivity and specificity, which leads to both under- and over-treatment of  patients with suspected ACS. In the current project, we propose to develop a novel molecular imaging agent for visualization of recent myocardial ischemia using echocardiography. Specifically, we aim to develop an ultrasound contrast agent targeted to a molecular marker of recent ischemia. In Phase I of this project, we synthesized a contrast agent bearing a selectin-binding ligand, confirmed itstarget-binding activity in vitro, and demonstrated specific uptake in  a mouse model of myocardial ischemic injury. In Phase II, we propose to develop the synthetic and analytical methodology to allow for clinical-scale manufacture of this agent, performsingle-dose toxicology studies in two species, characterize the behavior of our imaging agent in mouse models of complex coronary disease, and validate imaging efficacy using clinical-scale imaging equipment in a closed- chest canine model.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal lethal disease characterized that affects ~30,000 individuals in the US. CF lung disease, the major cause of mortality in CF, is caused by dehydration of airway secretions that leads to mucous adhesion, infection and airways inflammation. A simple means to restore hydration and mucous clearance in CF airways is the inhalation of hypertonic saline (HS), which osmotically draws water onto the airway surface. Rehydration of the lubricant layer of the airway surface liquid facilitates mucociliary clearance (MCC) and therefore the removal of inhaled infectious agents.  Previously published evidence has shown that short-term administration of HS improves the rheologic properties and transportability of sputum, hydrates the airway surface, and improves MCC and lung function in patients with CF. Recent clinical studies support the efficacy of daily HS treatments for CF demonstrating improvements in lung function, a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations, and improvements in quality of life. As a result, inhaled HS is becoming a standard of care for CF and is now used by ~50% of patients nationwide. One consequence of the addition of HS to CF treatment regimens is the time required by CF patientsfor its administration. Daily HS treatments require ~1 hour of time commitment, which is superimposed on the ~2 hours of care typically asked of these patients for other aerosols and physiotherapy. Thus, there is a great need to reduce the treatment burden(time commitment) of this therapy to improve the quality of life of CF patients.  Parion Science&#039;s goal is to develop therapies that provide major improvements in efficacy over current treatments for CF. Parion is developing a specialized device of overnight administration of HS that will reduce daytime treatment requirements for CF patients. Parion has developed a novel nasal aerosol delivery device designed to administer a therapeutic dose of HS overnight that is comfortable, quiet, and compatible with sleep. The device was tested in a clinical deposition study where it achieved a higher than expected pulmonary deposition of HS aerosol, confirming that the device will be able to achieve a sufficiently high deposited pulmonary dose of HS to support futureclinical trials. Based on the success of the deposition study, Parion will continue the development program by evaluating the tolerability and efficacy of HS delivery via the device in a Phase 2 clinical study. If successful, we believe that this approachwill improve the quality of life of CF  patients by decreasing the treatment burden associated with daily HS treatments and improve compliance of this therapy.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common lethal genetic disorders in the US. Inhaled hypertonic saline is a simple, safe, and effective therapy for CF, but  it also adds a significant time burden to patients, requiring an additional hour per day on top of the ~2 hours spent taking other treatments. Parion Sciences is developing a device to administer hypertonic saline overnight to patients in order to reduce the treatment burden and improve compliance with this therapy.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease is a critical health issue in the US and Western countries. The leading cause of death is heart failure (HF). Almost 5.5 million patients are diagnosed with congestive HF in the U.S and the majorcause of HF is myocardial ischemic disease. Therefore, improvement of therapy for post myocardial infarction (post-MI) HF is extremely important, and the development of a new class of medicine which prevents progression of HF would have a large market opportunity and represent a significant clinical advance.  The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a new drug for heart failure (HF) by inhibiting type 5 adenylyl cyclase (AC5). Recently our studies demonstrated that inhibition of AC5 would be a strategy for treating HF. Disruption of AC5 gene in mouse prolongs lifespan by attenuating aging-related HF, protects against HF induced by chronic pressure overload, by excessive sympathetic stimulation and by myocardial ischemia, suggesting that an AC5 inhibitor would be a new class of HF drug.  The phase I study will provide definitive evidence that a novel AC5 inhibitor has beneficial effect on post-MI HF in a small animal model. In our preliminary screening for AC5 inhibitors, adenine 9-D-arabinofuranoside (AraAde, also known as Vidarabine or Vira-A(R)), which was used in the clinic for a different indication, showed protection against HF in mice, suggesting a possible clinical utility of AC5 inhibitors for treating HF. In the presen application we will validate the effect of a novel AC5 inhibitor, PMC-6, on post-MI HF by using a mouse HF model.  In the Phase II, we will further investigate the effect of PMC-6 on post-MI HF in a large animal model. Additionally, we will develop second generation PMC-6-type drugs with improved potency, better specificity and minimal adverse effects.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congestive heart failure (CHF) is one of the most serious medical challenges of our day. With 5 million Americans compromised by the ravages of this disabling disease, CHF is the leading cause of Medicare hospital admissions. The economic burden exceeds  40 billion annually. A comprehensive approach to this ominous healthcare threat includes prevention and early intervention, an ever-increasingly complex medication regimen, surgical treatments, and devices such as stentsand pacemakers. Despite these available therapies, heart failure for many remains progressive. Current approaches to replacement include heart transplantation and blood pumps to provide mechanical circulatory support. While clearly important, transplantation falls short of meeting the CHF need - only 6 donor hearts today for the 3,000 on the waiting list - only 2,200 a year for the 50,000 who need heart replacement but will never get a donor heart. The current generation of heart pumps, known as Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs) have demonstrated the remarkable capacity of technology to extend life with quality. Survivorships are approaching that of heart transplantation and patients are living functional lives at home. However, there is still much need for improvement to reduce complications including: bleeding (10-30% of recipients), infection (30-50%), and thromboembolism (6-20%). Right ventricular failure occurs in 20-44% of LVAD recipients following the pump implant, prolonging ICU and hospital length of stay, requiring continued indwelling lines for intravenous medications (an infection risk), and significantly increasing the risk of mortality, yet there are no suitable chronic right ventricular assist devices (RVAD). Thus, we propose to develop the world&#039;s smallest implantable blood pump, the REVOLUTION, to serve as a surgically implantable adjunct to existing LVADs to provide chronic treatment of right ventricular failure. The circulatory support device proposed for development in this SBIR proposal is based on a novel miniature hydrodynamic bearing concept. Therefore, we propose a Fast Track, combined Phase I/II SBIR program with the objectives: (1) to demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the pump as an RVAD in vitro and short term animalexperiments during the Phase I effort; (2) to conduct chronic animal implants to evaluate the long-term function, biocompatibility, and durability of the system during the Phase II. By the end of the program, we will reach a  design freeze  clinical bloodpump system in preparation for clinical trial and Phase III funding.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   This project seeks to develop a miniature implantable blood pump to assist the right side of the heart in pushing blood through the lungs and to the leftside of the heart to be circulated through the body. Right-sided heart failure occurs in one fifth of patients receiving left ventricular assist devices to treat heart failure and in other disease such as pulmonary hypertension, where an increased workload on the right heart leads to compromised function, then failure. Currently, there are no devices suitable for long-term use to treat right heart failure.",

The graft is made by culturing allogeneic human smooth muscle cells in a bioreactor to produce an engineered vascular tissue, which is then carefully decellularized. Vascular dialysis grafts that are 6 mm in diameter function well in a baboon model of arterio-venous grafting. In our Phase II proposal, our aim was the construction and testing of a prototype, disposable vascular graft bioreactor.  In this PhaseIIB proposal, we will build on our successful Phase II work, and we will  develop a closed, FDA-compliant manufacturing system that can produce manufacturing batches of 100 grafts/unit, enabling production sufficient to support clinical trials and eventualcommercialization. This Phase IIB application will also support a Phase I/II clinical trial examining the safety and efficacy of the engineered vascular graft for hemodialysis access. Manufacturing data from this system, combined with clinical data from our Phase I/II trial, will be  submitted to the FDA. At the conclusion of this study, we will file a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) in support of a Phase III trial in the U.S. on Humacyte&#039;s vascular grafts in hemodialysis patients. These grafts have thepotential to decrease morbidity from graft-related complications in patients with end-stage renal disease, as well as other patients requiring arterial bypass grafts.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This Phase IIB SBIR application addresses a critical need in regenerative medicine: the development of scaled manufacturing systems that produce engineered tissues in a reproducible and economical fashion. This application also tests an engineered vascular graft in end-stage renal disease patients requiring hemodialysis access.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds on the foundation of the Phase 1 SBIR work that demonstrated that diagnostic decision support software (DDSS) can improve accuracy of diagnosis and efficiency of workup. Phase 2, described here, brings these capabilities more into the clinical workflow through interoperability across multiple Electronic Health Records (EHRs). This will be done using the model of interoperability enunciated by Mandl and Kohane, in which deep clinical experience is provided to multiple EHRs by  best of breed  decision support software. The proposal builds on partnerships with Intermountain Healthcare, which has its own EHR, and with Geisinger Health System and others that use Epic. The specific aims are to improve access to DDSS from the EHR, improve the DDSS itself, use the DDSS for coded documentation in the EHR, and use the DDSS to improve test ordering and medical necessity justification. The underlying theme of this work is to use the knowledge of the DDSS to compute with medical information as data, and use this data to improve the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of medicine. Data is collected in ways that prompt for information based on the deep understanding of the clinical situations of the DDSS. The informationis classified by pertinence, which is made possible by the knowledge in the DDSS. The data is coded using interoperable codes passed to the EHR, allowing the data to be re-used for an evidence-based discussion among clinicians and those performing and interpreting lab tests. The data is also used for an evidence-based process of medical necessity justification. The data is also used as the basis for evidence-based curation of information to improve the DDSS itself, thus learning from clinical experience. The data is also used in the background to  lurk  in the EHR and advise use of DDSS when appropriate. Doing so using the interoperability model enunciated by Mandl and Kohane makes this information in the DDSS available to multiple EHRs. The resulting benefits of accuracy and efficiency will provide not only a platform for the success of the SimulConsult DDSS in the marketplace, but also help advance the interoperability model more generally. Doing so will facilitate the use of  best of breed  knowledge toolsmore widely in medicine to improve medical care and make it more affordable.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project uses the power of diagnostic decision support software to provide advanced capabilities to multiple electronic health records. The aims are to use the deep knowledge of such a tool to improve accuracy and cost- effectiveness of medical care.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of the proposed research is to develop and market a commercial software product that can be used to facilitate the analysis of genetic changes in order to elucidate chromosomal abnormalities that underlie diseases such as autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Recent technological advances allow samples of DNA from patients to be analyzed on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, generating up to millions of data points from each sample. In parallel, next- generation sequencing (NGS) of whole genomes (or whole exomes) allows the determination of sequence data from individuals with mental health (or other) diseases, as well as sequence data from affected and unaffected family members. These data must be analyzed to identify chromosomal abnormalities (e.g. DNA mutations, hemizygous or homozygous deletions, or translocations) that confer risk for these diseases. Software such as Partek(R) Genomics Suite  (GS) offersa robust set of tools to perform data analysis and visualization. A goal of this proposal is to enhance the Partek GS and Partek Flow  commercial products by introducing innovative, practically useful software modules that define genetic relatedness in studies based on SNP and/or NGS data. Specific Aim 1 is to develop and incorporate methods for the determination of genetic relatedness based on SNP data (including data sets of pedigrees and large populations). These methods allow the relationship between all pairs of individuals in a data set to be determined with high accuracy (even for large studies with thousands of samples). Specific Aim 2 is to develop and incorporate methods for the determination of genetic relatedness based on NGS data, including whole genome sequences of individuals. These methods will provide a significant new dimension to the analysis of genome sequence data, facilitating the identification of variants that are relevant to disease. For  Specific Aim 3 we will apply these novel methods to two data sets: whole exome sequence data from individuals with autism (data from over 800 trios obtained from dbGaP), and SNP and whole genome or whole exome sequences from quintets of father/mother/child1/child2/child3 in which at least one child is diagnosed with autism. These studies will demonstrate the utility of the novel software methods and demonstrate how they can facilitate the discovery of genetic variants that underlie autism and other mental health disorders.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Newly available technologies allow the measurement of millions of variations in DNA sequence between samples from individuals with diseases (such as autism and schizophrenia) relative to unaffected individuals (controls). The proposed research is designed to create software analysis tools that will facilitate the discovery of chromosomal abnormalities in diseases. This may lead to improved diagnosis and treatments for these disorders, serving a large public health need.",

Uniquely, the Tetra drug will address inflammation as a contributor to depression. This is a new mechanism of action for an antidepressant drug which should prove complimentary to current therapeutics. Addressing inflammation will target currently untreatable patients, such as those receiving interferon-a (IFNa) for viral illness, depressed patients with co-morbid psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, traumatic brain injury, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Given the limitations of current treatments, there is a need for new medications with novel mechanisms of action. The prevalence of major depression is staggering with around 20% of people experiencing depression at some point in their lives. The company estimates that 10-20% of patients with depression have inflammation and will be ideal candidates for the Tetra drug. The market for antidepressant drugs is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.2% to US  10.9 billion by 2018. The World Health Organization predicts that by 2020, depression will rival heart disease as the health disorder with the highest disease burden in the world.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has slowed the onset, but has not altered the prevalence of HIV-associated neurologic disease (HAND). In aging patient populations, the prevalence of HAND is increasing, despitethe ability of cART to reduce viral load in the CNS to undetectable levels. Half of the population living with HIV may experience symptoms of HAND. Development of more CNS penetrant antiviral drugs may be counter-productive, since it has been shown that antiretrovirals with good CNS penetrance are associated with impaired neurocognitive function. This may be a result of direct or indirect neurotoxicity, possibly resulting from induced metabolic states that favor pro-inflammatory vascular disease. The hallmarks of HAND include: 1) a dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, 2) the recruitment of immune cells (monocytes) to the CNS, 3) the viral infection of glia leading to interruption of their normal function, and 4) extensive synaptodendritcdamage. A host of inflammatory mediators are implicated in this cascade, but a limited subset of mediators has been identified as being up-regulated in the cerebrospinal fluid and postmortem brain tissues of HAND patients: TNF-??, the monocyte chemoattractant MCP-1, and mixed-lineage kinase 3 (MLK3), an important control point in MAPK kinase regulated inflammation pathways. Previously in collaboration with Dr. Harris Gelbard and Stephen Dewhurst at the University of Rochester Medical Center, we have identified URMC-099, a first generation compound that inhibits MLK3 and blocks up-regulation of MCP-1, TNF-? and other inflammatory mediators in HIV-1 Tat stimulated human macrophages. In vivo brain imaging experiments in mice exposed intracerebrally to HIV-1 Tathave shown that i.p. administration of URMC-099 prevents Tat-induced leukocyte infiltration and microglial activation, and reverses Tat-induced damage to synaptic architecture. Damage to synaptic architecture is the key pathological process of HAND in cognition and memory impairment. URMC-099 is a  selectively non-selective  kinase inhibitor and inhibits a large number of protein kinases, a property that may hinder future development. In our Phase 1 SBIR research we sought to identify second generation, much more specific MLK3 inhibitors, that would protect neurons in in vitro models of microglial activation by HIV-Tat. We have successfully discovered a series of potent and much more selective MLK3 inhibitors, exemplified by CLFB-1134, with excellent in vitro activity in neuron protection assays, excellent blood brain barrier penetration, and satisfactory in vitro safety profiles for CYP450s, hERG and genotoxicity. In Phase 2 research we will optimize these compounds for MLK3 potency, specificity, oral bioavailability and activity in mouse brain imaging models of HIV-Tat challenge. Compounds showing efficacy in animal models will be profiled in in vitro safety and genotoxicity screens and dose ranging toxicity studies for selection as development compounds for late stage preclinical testing.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This Phase II SBIR proposal is aimed at the discovery of potential small molecule therapeutics to treat HIV/AIDS-associated mental and neurological disorders. In2007, 33.2 million people worldwide were infected with HIV/AIDS. In the United States, it is estimated that more than 1 million individuals live with HIV, and an estimated 40,000  new HIV infections occur each year. It is estimated that as the population of HIV infected individuals ages, under the supportive care of combined antiretroviral therapy, as many as 50 percent of these patients will experience symptoms of HIV-associated neurological disease, which may range from severe dementia, to neuropathies and motor dysfunction.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed study is to develop a subcutaneous implant of risperidone which provides consistent therapeutic blood levels of the drug for 3 months. The benefits of such product include improved medication adherence, the ability to withdraw the medication if needed due to treatment emergent Adverse Effects (AEs), fewer relapses, and improved efficacy. Atypical antipsychotics have been used for several years with great results for the treatment of schizophrenia. However, the effectiveness of these agents in maintenance treatment is limited due to patient non-adherence. Lack of medication adherence has been shown to highly correlate with relapse and re-hospitalization. With each successive relapse, the patient&#039;s long- term prognosis deteriorates and previous level of functioning is rarely achieved. Patient non-adherence also places an additional burden on the US healthcare system, which is estimated at  2.3 Billion per year. The proposed formulation of risperidone will be delivered through a small subcutaneous reservoir, which can be implanted during a simple, 15 minute, in-office procedure. Although some subcutaneous implant technologies already exist, none of them is suitable for the delivery of risperidoneor other antipsychotics. Results of recent studies show that 86% of physicians and 50% of patients support the use of implants in this disease area. Delpor received Phase I support for this project last year with the objective to complete the preclinical proof-of- concept (defined as a PK and local tolerance study). All Phase I Aims have now been successfully completed and Delpor has demonstrated that the technology is capable of delivering the drug in a zero-order fashion and can maintain steady plasma levels with minimal variability for over 3 months. Furthermore, the local safety of the device has now been shown in animals. The next major milestone, as the company approaches commercialization, is to complete the clinical proof-of-concept which is definedagain as PK and local tolerance. The proposed study will allow the company to assemble and file the IND as well as validate all the necessary QA/QC methods in order to achieve such milestone. After the clinical validation of the technology, the product will be very attractive to investors and partners as it will be closer to approval and further de-risked. The clinical benefits of long-acting antipsychotic formulations have already been proven with depot formulations. Relative to daily oral therapy, a 2-week injectable depot formulation of risperidone is associated with improved treatment adherence, improvement in clinical symptoms, and greater reduction in hospital stays in patients with schizophrenia. However, two critical barriers have impeded the development of longer acting depot formulations: Safety issues since the drug cannot be withdrawn after administration, and technical limits of depot technology to provide consistent blood levels for more than 2-4 weeks. The proposed program is designed to address these problems and provide multiple benefits over existing depots including extending the release to 3 months, offering the ability to withdraw the medication, and achieving a safer PK profile.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:Patient non-adherence in schizophrenia is estimated at 24%-74% of patients and accounts for approximately 40% of all relapses. Compared to existing schizophrenia treatment alternatives, the proposed product will reduce relapses during maintenance treatment, improve safety, and increase overall treatment success. The final outcome will be an improvement in patient lives, and a reduction in overall healthcare costs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexual transmission is the predominant route of HIV infection in the United States, and it is men who are primarily spreading the virus. Male-to-male sexual contact accounts for 72% of all new HIV infections in men while heterosexual contact accounts for 83% of all new HIV infections in women. Extrapolating this incidence data reveals that 75% of all new HIV cases result from high risk sexual activity by men. These new infections are also not evenly distributed throughout the population. African Americans comprise only 14% of the US population, but account for 44% of the new infections. Black men, in particular, are disproportionately burdened, accounting for 70% of new HIV cases among African Americans. In addition, African Americans tend to have sex with people of the same race. As the prevalence of HIV increases within this community, the risk of infection concomitantly increases with each new sexual encounter. Given this epidemiological reality, reducing sexual risk behaviors among African American HIV+ men who have sex with men (MSM), with women (MSW), and with both men and women (MSM/W) is a prevention imperative. To address this, we intend to develop and test Positively tHrIVing, an HIV behavioral intervention basedon modules 2 and 3 of the Healthy Living Project (HLP; a  best evidence  CDC intervention), and then tailored it to fit the unique needs of HIV+ African American men (both MSM and MSW). This will include a focus on the distinctive challenges faced by all men independent of race (e.g., the influence of gender roles on sexual risk behaviors), faced by African-Americans living in the United States (e.g., discrimination, socioeconomic issues), and the intersection of these factors with the gender of sexual partners (e.g., managing power inequalities in heterosexual relationships v. facing homophobia and cultural issues). Additionally, Positively tHrIVing will adopt a pro-health point of  view so that it will be perceived as supportive and nonstigmatizing. Finally, Positively tHrIVing will be computer-based to further increase acceptability among patients and physicians, reduce staff time, lower costs, increase fidelity of treatment delivery, and enhance the probability of widespread dissemination. The results ofPhase I strongly support the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the program - far exceeding the three usability benchmarks established in the Phase I proposal. In Phase II we will complete development of the Positively tHrIVing program and test itseffectiveness in a pretest-posttest experimental design. 240 HIV+ African American men will be randomly assigned to receive either the computer-based Positively tHrIVing program or flash-enabled STD CDC fact sheets. Before, and at two points after randomassignment, participants&#039; sexual transmission risk behavior, medication adherence, disclosure, health behaviors, and substance use will be assessed through an online survey-questionnaire.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to develop a computer-based HIV behavioral intervention for HIV+ African American men. For clinics, this will allow them to provide an empirically validated HIV prevention intervention to their clients without creating additional demands on theiralready overburdened staff.

This development will not only enable rapid advancements in the study of basic network-level electrophysiology, but it will also create new opportunities for CNS disease modeling and phenotypic screening. This Phase IIb proposal involves two significant developments for neurological research, both building on the commercialized 768-channel multiwell MEA system developed in Phase II. Specifically, Aim 1 automates compound administration and experiment management to produce a turnkey platform for dosing neural culture as well as capturing, com- pressing, and storing network electrophysiological datasets. Among its many advantages, this platform will recover signals traditionally obscured by stimulation artifacts. This capability, combined with the ability to simultaneously manage 768 microelectrodes and automate experimental protocols, will capture single-cell and network-level neural activity at unparalleled rates.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Organophosphorus (OPs) compound are potent neurotoxic chemicals that are widely used in medicine, industry and agriculture; most notably as insecticides. The neurotoxicity which is primarily a result of AChE inhibition, may take the form of cholinergic crisis and death as a consequence of acute exposure or psychiatric symptoms and may lead to delayed neuropathy following chronic exposure. Usually, treatment of insecticide poisoning consists of supportive care and specific therapy e.g. atropine and oximes, which often fail to prevent morbidity or death. Currently, recombinant (r) BChE is a leading pre-exposure treatment candidate for OP toxicity due to its potent bioscavenging ability but because of its 1:1 stoichiometrywith OP, large doses will be required and without post-transitional modification, rBChRE exhibits poor circulatory stability when administered im, iv or sc. To overcome the potential challenges associated with parenteral delivery, PlantVax has taken advantage of the large size of the BChE molecules and has developed an innovative delivery approach using an aerosolized (aer) form of rBChE. Thus BChE delivered as an aerosol coats the airways of the lungs forming a  pulmomary bioshield  that can scavenge incoming (inhaled) OPs in situ: preventing both their entry into the systemic circulation and their inhibition of AChE  on RBC and in neuromuscular junctions. This route of administration is highly relevant since inhalation of vapors and particles is the predominant form of exposure to insecticides and G-type nerve agents and serves as a major means of intoxication because of rapid accesses of the OP to the blood. In Phase I Phase I feasibility studies, aer-rBChE was shown to protect against paraoxon (Px) toxicity in mice while in Phase II, unmodified aer-rMaBChE and aer-rHuBChE were shown to almost totally protect macaques even when aer-Px exposure occurred 40 hr following pretreatment. Since, in these experiments, aer-rBChE and aer-Px were delivered using a microsprayer, the proposed Phase IIB studies will extend these findings and will perform efficacy and early non-GLP safety testing using aerosl inhalation (nebulizer) devices to directly assess whether an inhaled  pulmonary bioshield  is efficacious in preventing OP toxicity and whether it is safe. These studies represent the first time BChE has been shown to protect against an insecticide and bode well for an aer-rHuBChE pre-exposure treatment against inhaled OPs in humans even when repurposed for use againstnerve agents and inhaled cocaine toxicity.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many glycoproteins which are potent antidotes, exhibit very important physiological functions but cannot be used as therapeutic treatments because theyare difficult to deliver via injection due the high dose required The aim of this project is to administer butyrylcholinesterase via the pulmonary route in an aerosol inhalation device to that it deposits in the lung and forms a  bioshield  and detoxifiesinhaled indecticides poisons in the lung and prevernts them from reaching the blood and the neuromuscular junctions where they can quickly cause severe toxicity.",

In short, there is a need for an integrated cost-effective prosthetic system which can reliably control multiple degrees of freedom. In a direct response, and in accordance with the scope of PA-11-135 as related to the development and integration of complex instrumentation, we now propose an SBIR Phase IIB effort to develop such a system, based on the following innovative solutions: 1) the MyoLiner: a textile-electrode based system for comfortable all-day acquisition of multichannel  high- definition  electromyograms (HD-EMG); 2) the PRO-Controller: a novel classifier algorithm and associated electronic hardware for decoding intentionality of coordinated hand movements; and 3) FlexCells: flexible high energy-density batteries that are conformal and adaptive to the limb. These technologies will be integrated for the first time with dexterous hand technology from our commercial partner to create an affordable, highly functional prosthesis, the Pattern-Recognition-Operated Arm (PRO- Arm). The system will be tested in a study designed to evaluate performance on an objective basis as well as from the standpoint of the patient. Of note, our goal is to have significant clinical impact, starting far before the end of the project. First, we have already launched FlexCells into the market and they have been well received. Second, we will prepare the MyoLiner system for clinical launch within the first year of the project. Third, we will build the system in a modular fashion, thereby allowing prosthetists to utilize the components with other companies&#039; products. Fourth, the algorithm development and training is focused on real-world performance over the course of the day, not just idealized performance in the lab setting. And finally, fifth, the system will be sold to prosthetists well wihin the existing Medicare reimbursement codes - thus, there should be no financial impediments to clinical adoption of the technology. In short, we believe that this Phase IIB grant will enable us o bring this project, initiated through NIH support, to its logical conclusion. We will bring the PRO  Arm into clinical use: an affordable but innovative solution, providing significant benefits to uppr extremity amputees.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The loss of an arm is devastating to almost any individual. In this project, we will develop and launch a prosthetic limb that will enable intuitive control of a dexterous prosthesis.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surgical resection of epileptogenic foci is a commonly practiced and often beneficial treatment for patients suffering debilitating seizures arising from otherwise intractable epilepsy. The success of this procedure depends on the ability of the medical team to precisely locate the epileptogenic zones in the patient&#039;s brain and to identify important cortical regions that must be avoided during resection. The accepted best method for locating the epileptogenic zones is torecord seizure activity with subdural electrodes implanted chronically for up to seven days. The electrodes are connected by cables to external recording equipment for the duration of the monitoring period. This invasive procedure has disadvantages: (a) Alengthy and costly hospital stay is required. (b) Long-duration implantations increase the likelihood of serious and potentially lethal infection. (c) A family member or sitter must be with the patient at all times. (d) Being in bed and tethered to the wall by numerous cables makes it difficult for some patients to cope. (e) There is a risk of intracerebral hemorrhage if the cables are accidentally pulled and the grids move. (f) Ten to twenty percent of patients do not have enough seizures during the hospitalization period to identify the epileptic zone with certainty. We  propose to develop wireless subdural electrodes that will avoid these disadvantages. Wireless electrodes will allow complete closure of the craniotomy used for surgical placement and willavoid the use of the transcranial multiwire cables that connect the electrodes to data processing hardware. The ability to close the dura and skull, avoiding wired conduits to the brain, will reduce the risk of morbidity due to infection and reduce cost by allowing the patient to leave the hospital for the majority of the monitoring phase. A potentially significant benefit of wireless outpatient monitoring is the ability to provide longer monitoring periods, up to 29 days, which allows the recording of habitual seizure activity while the patient is on their full regimen of ant-seizure medication. Localization based on habitual seizure activity will improve outcomes of the resective surgery and expand the population of patients for whom surgery is an option.The Phase II objective is to establish the diagnostic capabilities and safety of wireless devices over  29-day implantation period in dog using a side-by-side comparison to clinical, hardwired subdural grids and recording systems as a basis for the assessment. Program success is defined as achieving clinically equivalent seizure localization data to conventional grids and equivalent or reduced pathology. These data will serve as the basis for an IDE application for a safety and efficacy study in patients under the direction of our clinical collaborators at the University of Chicago. The Phase II Aims are as follows: Aim 1. To develop wireless ECoG devices for functional and safety testing in dog. Aim 2. To design and test external hardware and software fordog studies. Aim 3. To evaluate wireless ECoG device function and stability over 29 days in dog. Aim 4. To evaluate biocompatibility and safety of 29 day implants in dog. The Phase II program is a collaboration between EIC Laboratories (Norwood, MA), Sigenics (Chicago, IL), Illinois Institute of Technology (Chicago, IL), and the University of Chicago. Array  fabrication and testing will be conducted at EIC. ASIC design and procurement will be managed by Sigenics. IIT will oversee the telemetry system and electrical interface development. Animal studies will be conducted at the University of Chicago. We estimate the market for wireless devices used in intracranial monitoring for resective epilepsy surgery will be  12-19M annually in the United States. Expansion of the market to include other clinical monitoring applications and devices that provide stimulation-based therapies will be sought. A modest market for research devices is also anticipated.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: For epileptic patients whose seizures cannot be controlled by medication, the next best option is surgical removal of that part of the brain responsible for initiating seizures. This procedure can be highly successful and patients may achieve a seizure freestatus with very little if any neurological side effects. To identify precisely the brain tisse that must be removed, many patients undergo intracranial electrical monitoring in which electrodes are placed on their brains for up to seven days. During thistime, the patient is tethered to recording equipment by cables that exit their skull. The procedure carries significant risk to the patient and must be conducted in a high-level-of-care neurological facility. To reduce risk and improve the outcome of the surgical procedure, a wireless brain recording system is proposed. The wireless system will allow complete closure of the patient&#039;s skull during monitoring and permit monitoring in an ambulatory setting. Improved seizure control will be obtained by the ability to safely monitor patients for longer periods of time and to mon",

The scaleable  MyNeuroSci system will integrate two signal modality options including innovate instrumentation and/or simulations and web-based modules for neuroacquisition, neuroanalysis, and neurogaming. This student- centered learning tool will reinvent the way high schools can integrate neuroscience with limited overhead to promote a positive impact in neuroscience knowledge and careers.  Once the global leader in science and technology, the U.S. currently lags behind other countries. Economic growth can be stimulated through education investments and the field of neuroscience greatly contributes through new medical technologies and scientific careers. However, technological advancements and new career opportunities must be bootstrapped by promoting a strong understanding and interest in neuroscience during pre-college education. For America to remain competitive, our next generation must develop critical- reasoning and problem-solving skills that can be provided by foundations in neuroscience. Simple to implement, cost efficient learning tools that can easily integrate into high school curriculum should provide a solid foundation for students to recognize neuroscience opportunities,acquire a neuroscience knowledgebase, and expand critical reasoning and problem solving skills. Furthermore, it is critical learning tools are scalable and appropriate across genders, race, and wide ranging socioeconomic conditions so all students have opportunity to engage neuroscience and contribute to careers, technology development, and economic growth.  The project will integrate CleveMed&#039;s expertise in lab instrumentation, neurosignal acquisition and analysis, and web-based software with the educationexpertise of Project Lead the Way, a world leader in high school curriculum development.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II SBIR will develop Continuous Real Time (CRT) ShuntCheck, the first portable, non- invasive device for real time, continuous monitoring of changes in flow in CSF shunts. This device will result in improvedclinical management of hydrocephalus by providing a non-invasive method for monitoring and researching shunt function. Hydrocephalus, a common condition in which CSF accumulates in the brain ventricles, is corrected by placing a VP shunt that drains excessCSF to the abdomen. Shunts frequently malfunction, usually by obstruction, but the symptoms of shunt failure are unspecific - headache, nausea. Diagnosis of shunt malfunction is expensive and presents risks (exposure to radiation from CT Scans, risk of infection from radionuclide testing). Additionally, ongoing clinical management of shunted patients is complex (due to a lack of tools for investigating CSF over drainage, for assessing the performance of specific shunt valves and siphon control devices andfor streamlining the adjustment of programmable shunt valves). NeuroDx&#039;s existing device, ShuntCheck-Micro-Pumper, is a shunt obstruction detector and addresses the need for a non-invasive test for shunt malfunction. While this makes it a valuable tool forthe Emergency Dept, the short duration of the test limits its utility for shunt valve adjustment, investigating suspected shunt over drainage, etc. A non-invasive, non-radiologic device which can track changes in CSF flow rate would address many ongoing clinical management needs and become a valuable tool for the neurosurgery clinic. In our Phase I studies, we developed a laboratory prototype CRT based upon a breakthrough innovation in our thermal dilution technology and validated its safety and accuracy in bench and animal studies. CRT can reliably differentiate between no, low and robust shunt flow and can track changes in shunt flow rates over extended time periods. The goal of this Phase II project is to refine CRT ShuntCheck from a laboratory prototypeto a production-ready device, validate its safety and accuracy in bench and animal testing, and complete a 510k submission for FDA clearance. Post-Phase II clinical studies will demonstrate the clinical utility and cost effectiveness of CRT ShuntCheck forstreamlining valve adjustment in pediatric and in adult NPH patients. NeuroDx&#039;s business model for this product involves the generation of revenue primarily from the ongoing sale of single-use, disposable sensors for these tests. Shunt management testingconstitutes approximately 105,000 shunt flow tests annually in the United States alone. The need for new diagnostic tools for managing hydrocephalus patients is highlighted by the NIH announcement  Advanced Tools and Technologies for Cerebrospinal Fluid Shunts  (PA-09-206), to which this application is responding. Our application directly responds to the request for Diagnostic tools for use in a hospital or outpatient setting that work in real-time to quantitatively determine shun function.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The past decade has seen a rapid increase in the application of brain stimulation devices to treat a variety of movement disorders, such as Parkinson&#039;s disease (PD), and other neuropathologies. Present noninvasive brainstimulation technologies suffer from fundamental limitations and have yet to reach the level of efficacy of invasive methods, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS). Electrosonic Stimulation (ESStim) is an improved noninvasive modality, which offers the potential of more focal and deeper effects. Preliminary studies with this technique have confirmed improved focality and penetration compared to other forms of noninvasive stimulation (e.g., transcranial DC stimulation (tDCS)), which have translated into a greater magnitude and duration of stimulatory effect compared to the other technologies. This application is focused on evaluating the therapeutic impact of ESStim in PD patients. First in Phase I, we will follow 24 PD patients (12 SHAM, 12 active ESStim stimulation) after giving a constant fixed dose of ESStim for 10 days of stimulation, 20 mins/day, over a two-week period. We will assess a battery of electrophysiology, cognitive, and neurological safety markers in the patients including 64 channel EEG, California Computerized Assessment Package, verbal fluency test, n-back working memory test, PD Adverse Effects Questionnaire, and neurological exams. Additionally, we will evaluate the Unified Parkinson&#039;s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), bradykinesia test, and walking abilities/gait in the PD patients, evaluated over the 2-week period and for at least six weeks following the last stimulation session. Next in Phase II, we will follow 48 PD patients (12 SHAM, 12 active ESStim stimulation, 12 tDCS, and 12 TUS) aftergiving a constant fixed dose of stimulation for 10 days, 20 mins/day, over a two-week period. We will evaluate these patients with a battery of Motor, Safety, Mechanistic, and Quality of Life (QOL) tests, comparing the efficacy of the tested interventions. In parallel with the PD treatments, field models of the electromagnetic and sonic fields generated in the brain will be developed with MRI based computational models of each patient and correlated with the efficacy measures recorded during and after thetreatment sessions to develop dosing models based on the individualized patient data. Overall, we hypothesize that the proposed experiments, computational studies, and technology development will allow us to test the effectiveness of ESStim compared to other noninvasive technologies in PD patients. The results of the proposed work will serve as the basis for a future large-scale multicenter study to further validate the technique and optimize equipment for use in PD therapy. Future developments with this technology and stimulation method could provide a platform for innovative and improved neurological treatments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Parkinson&#039;s Disease (PD) is a debilitating motor disorder with limited treatment options and as the disease progresses itcan require invasive surgical procedures to implant brain stimulation devices in patients&#039; brains to treat the disease. Electrosonic Stimulation (ESStim ) is a noninvasive neurostimulation method which improves upon current noninvasive technologies with superior focality, targeting control, and penetration, and for the first time offers the possibility of noninvasive deep brain stimulation (i.e. stimulatig deep brain structures without maximally stimulating the surface). This study analyzes stimulation treatments in PD patients, while exploring technology that can impact other neuropathologies that are currently underserved by present noninvasive options.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Researchers and contractors are under increasing pressure to produce rapid turnaround times for data releases and publications. Inadequate data management is a common threat to good research and impedes the quick release of high value data. Despite its importance, many organizations do not have standardized data management practices that allow them to prepare high quality datasets quickly, effectively, and with transparency. As a result, production delays, inefficiencies, inconsistencies, and data errors are common. This proposal describes the development of a practical, user-friendly electronic tool, the Data ExpediterTM (DE) Syntax Generator, which uses step-by-step data management procedures combined with cutting edge,innovative algorithms to standardize and automate processes involved in creating high quality analytic files. Designed with researchers in health, social, and educational sciences in mind, the product walks the user through a best practice model for datamanagement, specifically for tasks involved in creating clean and accurate data analytic files. Readily available metadata, syntax, and reports make monitoring studies, creating new databases, controlling data file releases, implementing changes, analyzingdata, and training new project staff faster and more cost effective than ever. Phase I aims are to: (1) develop and test a working prototype; (2) conduct focus group research to assess the acceptance of the prototype; and (3) develop a full set of functional specifications. Upon demonstration of Phase I feasibility, Phase II aims are to: (1) build the commercialized DE Syntax Generator; (2) conduct usability testing to demonstrate ease of use; (3) conduct field tests in actual research settings at Harvardand Brown Universities; and (4) develop educational and product support materials. As an outcomes-driven innovation, the product will occupy a unique place in the market with its guided data management process and large array of automation tools. The products provides a unique and affordable solution to a common problem by using a standardized, uniform framework and automated syntax generation while allowing data users (e.g., researchers, administrators, those working with electronic patient records) to house data in their existing statistical software. The DE Syntax Generator replaces the chaotic, slow, and error-ridden, data management process with an organized, streamlined, and complete sequence of steps with interwoven quality control and automation to ensure rapid production of quality data. The DE Syntax Generator will improve the efficiency of studies, enhance data sharing, and decrease data and reporting errors. In sum, the product addresses an unmet need by helping researchers and data managers to follow state-of-the art practice guidelines for data management (transparency and proper documentation of all procedures) while getting the job done better, faster, and less expensively.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   The Data Expediter  Syntax Generatorsoftware application offers health, social, and education researchers a practical, cost-effective solution for managing, rapidly processing and documenting study data utilizing technology that makes these high-value activities readily transparent.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  An estimated 116 million US adults suffer from chronic pain at an estimated cost of  635 billion and, unfortunately, existing pain management training is not adequately preparing health professionals to address this area [1]. To address this gap we propose to create iPad EMR Pain Management Simulator, an iPad- based application to provide a learning and shared experience environment for health professional students to enhance their skills related to pain assessment andcontrol. The simulated EMR will echo core features of any EMR used in clinical practice and present case simulations. For learners it will provide easy and affordable access to standardized skill-based pain management training. For faculty/educators it will assess: 1) a student&#039;s clinical competence and skills in diagnosing and treating patients with pain, while 2) decreasing the chance of opioid misuse and diversion. For each iPad EMR simulated pain management case, health professional students will collect data, examine the patient, choose the appropriate course of action, outline a treatment plan, and receive feedback. Feedback from choices and decisions made will be based on best practice. The instructor will have control over the clinical components ofthe application by providing increasing or decreasing clinical information, challenge, feedback, or prompts. Phase I will develop a prototype and perform basic usability of the potential intervention based on the active involvement of different target audiences: 1) health professional students in medicine and nursing, and 2) educators in medicine and nursing. Phase I will proceed with a carefully planned formative analysis involving needs analysis surveys, semi-structured interviews, guidance from consultants, creation of prototype experiences, and usability assessments. Phase II will complete the program and conduct an evaluation using a randomized, cross-over [wait-list control], pretest-posttest design with an estimated 60 participants from medicine and nursing. We will specifically assess if the simulated learning and shared experience environment positively impacts target clinical skills and increases core competencies related to assessment and treatment of pain. Phase III will market the product actively via existing and novel partnerships with Clinical Tools. We will pursue additional tailoring of the content to specific audiences beyond physicians and nurses such as dentists, P.A.s, physical therapists and others. Our solution will support ongoing assessment of the training to determine areas of weakness which can be refined and improved over time.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   The agony that is life with chronic pain is made worse by a health care system ill-equipped to assist. The gap in quality care due to poor training of future health providers will remain until solutions are pursued. This product will enhance the education of health care providers via a simulated Electronic Medical Record (sEMR) environment that provides simulated patient experiences. Health professional trainees will develop proper pain management skills including screening, full assessment, treatment interventions, and making a referral to treatment when appropriate. Future health professionals who are more proficient in corecompetencies related to pain management will be better equipped to reduce the suffering and costs of inadequate pain treatment.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Introduction: Ai Cure Technologies LLC was established in 2009 to develop automated medication adherence monitoring solutions using computer vision technology. This SBIR Phase II will allow Ai Cure Technologies to testthe accuracy and validity of its flagship product, AiView . The SBIR Phase I demonstrated that the AiView  platform was technically feasible and capable of confirming medication administration. Significance: Poor medication adherence is a huge burden on clinical research and clinical practice. The inability to accurately measure or improve adherence significantly compounds the problem. Clinical trials depend on people taking the drug being tested. The problem of medication adherence has been addressed - determinants of adherence are being studied and new monitoring methods developed - but no solution has been able to accurately confirm real-time medication adherence while also being affordable, flexible, and likable. The Product: Ai Cure Technologies will provide an automated DOT (Directly Observed Therapy) software platform, AiView , for use in clinical trials which uses sophisticated computer vision technology on webcam- enabled smart phones or tablets to visually confirm medication administration. AiViewwill visually track and confirm medication administration without human supervision. Long-Term Goal: The AiView  system will combine sophisticated computer vision technology with the best attributes of DOT for 1/400th of the cost. Automating and standardizing the way medication adherence is captured will help clinical trials better define their subjects&#039; rates of compliance and allow them to intervene immediately in case of non-compliance. Phase II hypothesis: AiView  can be used to accurately measure and improve medication adherence across different patient populations, and positively impact self-perception and clinical outcomes. Specific Aim #1: To demonstrate that the AiView  system can accurately measure and improve medication adherence in a depression and a stroke patient population. Specific Aim #2: To demonstrate that the AiView  system can improve self-perception and improve clinical outcomes in the AiView  intervention groups Expected Outcome: The patients in the AiView  intervention groups (depression and stroke) are expected to have statistically significant higher adherence rates than those in the pill counting groups.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor medication adherence is a huge burden on clinical research and clinical practice with the inability to accurately measure or improve adherence significantly compounding the problem. In accordance with this SBIR Phase II grant, Ai Cure Technologies will continue development and testing of its Automated DOTSM (Directly Observed Therapy) software platform, AiView , for use in clinical trials which uses sophisticated computer vision technology on webcam-enabled smart phones or tablets to visually confirm medication administration. Automating and standardizing the way medication adherence is captured will help clinical trials better define their subjects&#039; rates of compliance and allow tria administrators to intervene immediately in case of non-compliance, thus improving the accuracy of clinical trials the overall safety of thedrug development process.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION:  Undesired platelet activation can be result of many common pathologies or interventions. Arterial thrombosis and the acute ischemic events that follow, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, are among the leading causes of death, incapacitation, and rising health care costs in the developed world. Therefore antiplatelet drugs have significant market share and clinical importance, and advances in this area can have a significant social impact.  In the previous phases of this project we developed a series of new bis-adenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A) analogs, which inhibit platelet aggregation by a unique new mechanism, targeting both platelet ADP receptors, P2Y1 and P2Y12. Our studies have indicated that this simultaneous targeting might have asynergistic effect on platelet aggregation inhibition. Simultaneous targeting of two synergistic targets can also provide for an additional margin of safety against undesired off-site target side effects.  In phase II we studied the specificity and selectivity of he class, and identified a candidate with efficacy in vivo for further development. This candidate (CD) inhibits ADP and collagen induced platelet aggregation in the low nanomolar range. Furthermore, it showed high antithrombotic activity in the well-established preclinical, canine model of recurrent thrombosis mimicking unstable angina ( Folts model ). In this model it completely abolished the cyclic flow variation (recurrent thrombosis) in injured and restricted coronary artery at an infusion doseof 1.8  g/kg/min. In a dose escalation study in rats the CD had a profound effect on platelet reactivity, and relatively small increase of the bleeding time only at the highest dose studied (100 times higher than the maximum efficacious dose). It also showed no effect on hemodynamic parameters at any dose. It did not act as agonist or antagonist of human P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, or P2X1 receptors, and had good safety margin in the endothelium P2Y-dependent guinea pig aorta relaxation model. Moreover, the antiplatelet effect of the CD is reversible, has very fast onset and offset of its in vivo activity, and is quickly clered from the systemic circulation. We also demonstrated that the CD can be synthesized and purified in multi-gram scales.  In view of the uniqueproperties of the class and the promising results obtained in phase II, we propose to continue the preclinical development of the CD, in order to obtain the package of data which would enable us to secure investor or partner funding for initiation of clinical testing after IND submission, or alternatively to license the CD to a maor pharmaceutical company for further clinical development.  Despite the recent advances in development of new types of antithrombotics and because of the high mortality and recurrence rate and major bleeding events among acute coronary syndrome patients, there is a significant need for new antiplatelet agents that: a) can reduce ischemic events without causing excessive bleeding, b) have low interpatient variability of the effect,c) are fast acting, assuring immediat patient protection, d) have quick reversibility of the effect, so the treatment can start before fial diagnosis and intervention strategy are in place. The main antiplatelet drugs in clinical use today  - aspirin and clopidogrel - target platelet COX-1 and P2Y12 platelet receptors, respectively. Limited response to both drugs, often referred to as  resistance , occurs in significant numbers of patients and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. No drugs have yet been identified that inhibit both P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptors. No rapidly reversible (within 1-2 hours) injectable antiplatelet drugs are currently available for clinical use for patients who are in need of antiplatelet therapy, and may be at risk for bleeding complications, or may need surgical intervention. Therefore, we expect the further development of the CD to result in a new antithrombotic drug with superior safety and efficacy, and therapeutic properties that will satisfy  important unmet clinical needs,and reduce the mortality rate among patients with acute coronary syndrome.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Platelets play critical roles in hemostasis, but their aggregation can cause thrombosis. Antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel (Plavix(R)) are slow to exert effects and cause irreversible inhibition of platelets. We have synthesized novel compounds that have a unique mechanism of action and fast onset/offset of action, and could be used effectively during acute events, such as stroke, and during surgery.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to evaluate new imaging agents for (1) real-time detection of residual cancer in the tumor bed during surgery in primary colon and lung cancers in mice to eliminate or significantly reduce the need for repeat surgeries and local recurrence, and (2) guiding resection surgeries in canine patients with naturally occurring cancer. In a pilot study, we will also test our imaging technology to improve the detection of lesions during routine colonoscopy examination. Failure to remove cancer cells during surgery is a leading risk factor for local tumor recurrence and subsequent reoperation. Rates of secondary surgeries because of positive margins range between 10-50% depending on cancer type, grade and anatomical site. For colon cancer screening, many small lesions go undetected that are only found after progressing into malignant carcinomas. Furthermore, even for larger carcinomas, colonoscopy using white light will not identify these 22% of the time. Thus, a technology that can assess whether tumor cells have been adequately removed during surgery or can identify colon lesions with higher efficiency will have a major impact on cancer therapy worldwide as more than two million people undergocancer surgery every year. During the SBIR Phase I work, Lumicell developed several imaging agents by using our novel mathematical model to predict their performance across species. The goal was to develop high-performance, lower cost imaging agents to satisfy the needs for colon cancer screening and eventually skin cancer surgeries. These imaging agents are based upon the design of our lead candidate for sarcoma and breast cancer indications, LUM015, which has been approved by the FDA to start first-in-human clinical trials with our clinical collaborators at Duke University Medical Center. Based upon modifications to LUM015, the new imaging agents cost about 66% less to manufacture with improved yields. After testing them in our baseline mouse model for breast cancer, these new agents proved equal or better performance than LUM015. A lower cost imaging agent is mandatory for entry into several of our new target markets and will be an additional offering for the other markets. For Phase II, we propose in Aims 1 and 2 to evaluate the performance of these imaging agents in state-of-the-art genetically engineered mouse models for lung cancer and colon cancer with our collaborators at Duke University and Massachusetts General Hospital. In Aim 3, we will move forward with the selected lead candidate (based upon results from Aims 1 and 2) into a veterinary clinical trial conducted at Duke/Veterinary Specialty Hospital of the Carolinas and Tufts University Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. Canine patients suffering from any type of cancer will be recruited to evaluate the performance of the lead candidate in naturally occurring cancers. Aim 4 is focused on reaching the endpoint of this proposal: submit an IND to support a Phase I clinical trial for colon and lung cancer surgeries and colon cancer screening using our new lead candidate.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project aims to address the unmet clinical need for intraoperative assessment of residual cancer cells in the tumor bed after tumor resection in colon and lung cancer patients, and to improve the efficacy of detecting small lesions during routine colonoscopy examinations. Lumicell has developed new imaging agents to address these needs that also reduce the costby 66% over our original imaging agent. Their performance will be evaluated in mouse models for lung and colon cancer, and in naturally occurring cancers in canine patients before translating the technology for human use. A lower cost imaging agent is mandatory for entry into several of our new target markets and will be an additional offering for the other markets. This technology has the potential to save lives, prevent  secondary surgeries, minimize patient discomfort and surgical risks, and provide substantial savings in healthcare costs.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women with about 200,000 new cases and 40,000 deaths each year in the United States. Novel approaches for the detection of primary and metastatic breast cancers are urgently needed to increase the survival of patients. Current imaging techniques are limited in accuracy of diagnosis and staging of malignancy. Accuracy in current CT, PET, MRI and ultrasound diagnosis can be as low as 50% and a significant portion of patients are either misdiagnosed or under staged. MRI can provide both morphological and anatomical information with high spatial resolution and large penetration depth, thus a promising imaging modality for preoperative staging of breast cancer and monitoring tumor response to treatment. MRI is non-invasive and better than CT that uses x-ray radiation and nuclear imaging that uses radiolabeled agents. MRI-based cancer diagnosis without exposure to ionizing radiation will be of great interest to clinical cancer care andpublic health. However improvements in MR imaging specificity and sensitivity are needed to improve clarity and diagnostic accuracy. In this project we propose the development of a cancer biomarker-targeting metallofullerene contrast agent with very high molecular relaxivity. Metallofullerene has been demonstrated to be a better T1-weighted imaging agent than gadolinium- based chelates in a number of preclinical studies. The proposed cancer imaging agent incorporates Luna&#039;s promising Hydrochalarone contrastagent and angiogenic targeting molecules in one polymeric nanoparticle. Our goal is to develop an improved contrast agent for use with MRI in patients with malignant disease. It may be used to improve accuracy and staging of cancer malignancy, and to eliminate false positives and false negatives. The proposed preclinical study is designed to demonstrate the technical and commercial merits of this nanotechnology-enabled cancer diagnosis.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: NarrativeBreast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths of women, and it is estimated that early 200,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing-aid users often complain of poor sound quality and difficulty understanding speech in noisy situations. The current standard of care, acoustic hearing aids, cannot restore audibility across the whole frequency spectrum of hearing because technical constraints severely limit acoustic amplification above 4-5 kHz. A prototype EarLens Photonic Hearing System (PHS) was designed and built to allow subjects to hear amplified sounds from 125 Hz up through 10 kHz. The system is comprised of two components: a PhotoKinetic Contact Transducer (PKCT) that directly vibrates the eardrum upon receiving power and signal through a wireless light and a Behind-The-Ear sound processor (BTE) that processes incoming sound and transmitsthe light. An FDA-approved IDE study has demonstrated the safety, performance, and feasibility of users to benefit from the extended-bandwidth PHS. The proposed multi-site definitive clinical study will provide the safety and performance data required forregulatory approval in the US. The study will be conducted on a total of 80 subjects with mild-to-moderate hearing impairment. 20 subjects will be enrolled at each of four external clinics. The study protocol involves the following steps: (1) Screening, Enrollment, and Unaided Audiometric and Performance Testing; (2) PHS fitting; (3) PHS Audiometric and Performance Testing; (4) PHS Removal; and (5) Study Exit. Outcome measurements will be made with regard to: (A) safety; (B) air-conduction audiometric thresholds; (C) speech-understanding thresholds under quiet conditions and in the presence of noise and speech maskers; and (D) assessment questionnaires to examine self-perceived benefit and quality-of-life improvements. PHS aided measurements will be performed after initial fitting and at the end of the four-month study period. Measurements B-D will also be made using the subjects&#039; own acoustic hearing aids, as applicable, to determine benefit of the PHS over the current standard of care. The significance of having an extended-bandwidth assistive hearing device on the market in the US is that such a system will, for the first time, allow individuals wih mild to moderately severe hearing impairment to benefit from the improvements in sound quality and speech-discrimination ability that become possible when high-frequency acoustic cues are clearly perceived. Such advancement in hearing technology may lead to increased adoption rates for hearing devices, which would help to relieve communication difficulties and improve the overall quality of life for those affected by hearing loss.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to hear high frequencies improves sound quality and speech understanding; however, high frequency amplification has not been achievable with acoustic hearing devices. The EarLens Photonic Hearing System is advancement in hearing technology that amplifies high frequencies and can help to relieve communication difficulties and improve overall quality of life among thoseaffected by hearing loss. This device is likely to increase rates of hearing- aid adoption and patient satisfaction",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Previously performed and published studies have demonstrated that MultiStem(R), Athersys&#039; patented adult adherent stem cell product, modulates the inflammatory component of secondary brain injury in rodent models of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Further, there are supporting published data illustrating the efficacy of MultiStem in other CNS injury models including stroke, hypoxic-ischemic injury, and spinal cord injury among others. Athersys, Inc., and the University ofTexas Medical School at Houston have a collaborative research agreement in place for the development of proof-of-concept studies in vivo and in vitro for the treatment of TBI and stroke. The ultimate goal of this relationship is to translate these initialpositive findings into clinical trials and novel therapeutic approaches for neurological injury. The specific objective of this SBIR Fast-Track Research Proposal is to define and successfully execute pivotal pre-clinical safety and efficacy studies required for a successful Investigational New Drug submission to the FDA for an optimized cellular therapy regimen for treatment of TBI and its related outcomes. This application proposes an initial GLP toxicity study in Phase 1, followed by sequential studies to address clinically relevant translational issues in progenitor cell therapy for neurological injury/disease. The specific aims are: Phase 1: Define the safety profile of MultiStem delivered intravenously after TBI with both short and long-term GLP toxicity/pathology-necropsy evaluation. The rationale for the proposed groups is that safety must be defined in naive and injured animals, since injury affects biodistribution secondary to chemo-attractant signals from injured tissues. NO GO decision will be based principally on the development of ectopic tissue in any organ (not just cell presence), or significant exacerbation of inflammation/organ function. Phase 2a: The goal of Phase 2a is the completion of comprehensive toxicity studies in TBI, with doses shown to be efficacious in our previous proof-of-concept efficacy testing in rodents. Comprehensive toxicity and anatomic pathology studies will need to be completed at higher doses/multiple doses based on previous proof- of-concept studies. GO/NO GO decisions will be made by assessing the dose toxicity profiles (compared to Controls) relative to previous proof-of-concept efficacy data. Phase 2b: The goal of the Phase 2b portion of the proposal is to establish the optimal dosing scheme based on primary and secondary outcomes measures, after clearing safety studies in Phase 1 and Phase 2a. Translational issues of catheter delivery systems and osmolarity of the cell infusion environment will be evaluated in terms of affecting cell survival and potency. Phase 2c:The primary goals of this sub-phase are (1) IND submission for both adult and pediatric protocols using intravenous MultiStem for severe TBI, and (2) addressing/revising the submissions in response to any critiques, and (3) approval and local IRB submission to allow initiation of the clinical trials. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  The treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an unmet medical need of significance in the United States, especially for children under the age of 5, young male adults aged 15-25, elderly men and women aged 75 and older and military personnel in active combat zones (NINDS Website). According to the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke there are currently more than 5 million Americans living with permanent deficitsresulting from TBI that require daily help or assistance, with a resulting burden in direct and indirect costs to the United States health care system of  56 Billion annually. Although cell-based therapies have emerged as experimental treatments for a number of other neurological and cardiovascular disorders, there is currently no treatment for TBI other than post-injury supportive care. The specific objective of this research project is to develop an optimized cellular therapy regimen for treatment of patients suffering TBI.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Abstract: Capricor, Inc. has an allogeneic cell therapy product, CAP-1002, presently in clinical development. CAP-1002 consists of cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), grown from a donor unrelated to the recipient, using a proprietary process exclusively licensed to Capricor. Autologous CDCs have demonstrated their utility as a regenerative agent: able to reduce infarct size (a.k.a scar size), add viable tissue mass, and attenuate adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling when administered to patients several months after a myocardial infarction (MI). The magnitude of benefit seen in CDC-treated patients could foreshadow a reduction in future adverse clinical events. Allogeneic CDCs are currently being tested in a similar post-MI population in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-center safety and efficacy study. The current proposal aims to test the safety of  CAP-1002 administered in the acute MI setting, adjunctive to the gold-standard treatment(i.e. PCI [percutaneous coronary intervention]), rapidly after restoration of blood flow (or reperfusion), as a cardioprotective agent. Capricor has an approved IND (Investigational New Drug application) for the use of CAP-1002 in the treatment and/or prevention of LV dysfunction following MI, and the proposed clinical trial falls under the umbrella of this indication. Preclinial data support the safe use of CAP-1002 in acute MI and reveal the product&#039;s ability to limit infarct  size and reduce acute myocardial damage. CAP-1002 is manufactured in an existing GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice compliant) facility and will be stored at the clinical site for immediate availability. CAP-1002 is formulated such that it can be prepared for use within minutes and administered within minutes. Patients will be treated open-label with CAP-1002 within hours of successful reperfusion. Safety endpoints will include assessments of blood flow in the coronary arteries and microvasculature, resolution of myocardial damage, immune reaction, arrhythmias, and MACE (major adverse cardiac events). Efficacy assessments will examine infarct size, LV volumes, and ejection fraction by MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Funding for a follow-on trial that would demonstrate efficacy will bepursued concurrently. Capricor is well-positioned to secure financing for the next study, particularly with an ongoing multi-center study utilizing the same product in a complementary patient population. The company has a sound regulatory strategy and advisors in place to guide interactions with the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) as CAP-1002 is advanced toward approval. The current manufacturing scale and facility will suffice through early commercialization and plans to scale up are underway. Capricorhas identified several potential avenues by which to enter the public market and maintains active business development efforts. The company anticipates being revenue generating within a few years of project completion. The ongoing and proposed clinical trial series encompass nearly the full continuum of disease states following MI. CAP-1002 developed successfully for all MI patients would offer both a cardioprotective and regenerative therapy, to be administered as needed.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCEPUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative: Cardiovascular disease is the No. 1 cause of death in the United States and myocardial infarction (MI) affects more than 1 million Americans every year. Cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) will be tested as a safeand effective therapy when administered immediately after MI, in the hopes of limiting the amount of damage caused by the event, lowering the number of adverse clinical events experienced in the future, and reducing the population of Americans living withand dying from heart failure after MI.",

Some loss of utero-vaginal support occurs in most adult women, however, the true etiology of prolapse and differences seen among individuals is not entirely understood. Changes in the elasticity of the vaginal walls, connective support tissues and muscles are thought to be significant factors in the development of pelvic organ prolapse. We propose to develop a device entitled Vaginal Tactile Imager (VTI) for 3-D visualization and assessment of mechanical properties of pelvic floor tissues. VTI is based on the Tactile Imaging (TI) technology founded on the principles similar to those of manual palpation.In Phases I and II we designed and built a and prototypes of VTI with tactile sensor array and a motion tracking sensor, completed VTI testing and verification with the tissue mimicking phantoms, completed Phase I and initiated Phase II clinical study. Clinical results demonstrated capability of the proposed approach for 3-D imaging of the vagina and pelvic floor support structures. Our findings suggest that the normality ranges for tissue elasticity of vagina and its support structures evaluated by VTI might be used as the markers in diagnosis of pelvic floor conditions. We further demonstrated VTI capability in characterization of outcome of pelvic floor reconstructive surgery. Tactile Imaging technology developed at Artann Laboratories is highly innovative and unique. Artann scientists are the first in the world to introduce and develop  Tactile Imaging technology into the practical and proven successful applications described in numerous publications and 21 issued patents. The main goal of Phase IIB is totransform the Phase II VTI  -prototype into medical device ready for regulatory review and commercialization. Upon completion of regulatory compliance testing, verification and clinical validation of the VTI, technical and clinical files will be preparedfor FDA application. The endpoint for the Phase IIB of the project is the FDA 510(k) submission. The VTI commercialization will follow the FDA approval. The completion of proposed project promises to gain scientific knowledge, provide new technical capability and improve clinical practice in gynecology.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With one out of every four youth in the United States currently living with a chronic illness, it is critically important to empower youth to take ownersip of their own healthcare. Research suggests that a key componentof a successful transition from pediatric care into adult-focused health care systems is proper management of treatment regimens [1]. Unfortunately, treatment adherence among adolescents with chronic illness is disappointingly low, with poor adherence found in 50-70% of all patients [2]. Reviews of adherence studies indicate the risk of treatment nonadherence declines with greater disease- and treatment-related knowledge and that providing a behavioral management component optimizes adherence [8-10]. The goal of this Phase II SBIR project is to continue the research and development of the Online Medical Monitoring System (OMMS), an integrated online and mobile technology infrastructure specifically designed to (a) enhance youths&#039; disease- and treatment-related knowledge through interactive and game-based educational materials; (b) support adherence to the treatment regimen through customized task prompts via mobile and web-based delivery; and (c) promote patient-provider communication through real-world datacollection and synchronized feedback loops. During Phase II, we will build on Phase I feedback to finalize the fully functioning product and conduct a field test examining the degree to which the OMMS enhances treatment adherence outcomes among adolescents with a variety of chronic illnesses. This Phase II project will accomplish three specific aims: 1) fully develop the OMMS product; 2) conduct a field test of the benefits of the OMMS with adolescents with chronic illness; and 3) finalize the OMMS and ready for broad scale commercialization. To our knowledge, the OMMS will be the first technology product that integrates educational, adherence tracking, and patient-provider communication tools into one comprehensive, streamlined package. We expect the OMMSto effectively provide essential information and much needed support to youth with chronic illness to help them successfully negotiate their treatment regimen and transition into self-managed healthcare.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical non-adherence has been identified as a major public health problem among youth that imposes a considerable financial burden upon modern healthcare systems [3-7]. Because of the complexities in measuring adherence, no estimate can be generalized, but poor adherence is to be expected in 50-70% of all adolescent patients with chronic illness, irrespective of disease, prognosis, or setting [4, 6, 8-10]. This burden has been estimated to cost  100 billion each year in the United States [5], including 10% of hospital admissions [4, 6]. Adherence is also critical to the integrity of clinical research findings to preserve sufficient statistical power for analysis and to minimize the potential for obscured findings. Indeed, as clinician&#039;s increasinglyrely on treatment protocols that are based on clinica trial evidence, it is critical to address adherence in the realm of research as well [11-16]. The proposed Online Medical Monitoring System (OMMS) would remove barriers to adherence monitoring and provide significant advantages in convenience and utility over existing clinical options.",

        "abstract": "Title: Development of a Stand-Biased School Desk to Reduce Childhood Obesity According to the state demographer for Texas (Eschbach and Fonseca, 2009), childhood obesity has more than doubled in the past 20 years, and overweight/obesity rates for Texas fourth graders are twice the national average for fourth grade students. In addition, obesity rates for Latino and African American children in Texas are among the highest in the nation. This is problematic because 70 percent of overweight and obese youth become overweight and obese adults, which significantly increases the risk other chronic diseases.  In Brazos County, Texas, a group of local stakeholders have identified and prioritized childhood obesity as a key community issue. These stakeholders have beenloosely networked, and the current project will strengthen that network to build on resources and capacities to engage in policy-relevant childhood obesity research.  Most school-based childhood obesity interventions target some aspect of energy balance-either reducing the calories consumed or increasing physical activity. The gap in those programs has been affecting physical activity during the entire school day, not just during physical education or recess time. Dynamic classrooms-using stand/sit workstations for students-are a relatively low-cost, low-effort method of passively increasing children&#039;s physical activity during instructional time, as standing burns up to 30 percent more calories than sitting in children at this age. The stand-biased desks allow students to stand or sit at their discretion, without being disruptive or conspicuous among their classmates.  The study seeks to examine health and academic outcomes in order to present comprehensive information to PositiveMotion LLC regarding their unique designs for stand-baised work stations. Relevant to CDC&#039;s mission, this research has the potential to produce commercial products that could be produced domestically to reach the vast majority of children through the public school system, enhancing their ability to stay healthy and be successful in their education and increasing their chances of a full and productive life. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall research goal for this proposal is to evaluate the safety and acceptability of our unique U.S. Patent Pending design for a stand-biased desk for students, teachers and administrators. School-based obesity interventions that align with schools&#039; academic goals to improve academic achievement are more likely to be implementedand have higher rates of success and sustainability. Dynamic classrooms may provide one strategy for winning the battle with childhood obesity, while simultaneously improving educational outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Project Summary/Abstract Owing to the high cost of pharmaceuticals, there has become an ever increasing incidence of drug counterfeiting which has entered the market place. These counterfeit products represent significant danger to the public as it deniesthem safe access to needed medications. Current technologies to thwart counterfeiters include special packaging labels, ensuring lot and source of drug. However, these packages do not prevent refilling of empty bottles with counterfeit dosage forms. As anincreased measure to prevent counterfeiting, the proposed effort will demonstrate the scalable manufacturability of a  per tablet  3-D serial number labeling process. In Phase I we demonstrated UV writing to onto commercially available edible ink depositedon edible paper through an integral edible lens array. In addition, we demonstrated the ability of the spatial light modulator to project simple dot-matrix patterns, relay an image, or if required, to produce a detailed holographic projection. This flexibility, along with the added capability of the lens arrays, provides a matrix of choices for the level of complexity of encoded information which itself relates to the degree of difficulty in manufacturing and of course the associated cost of protecting thepharmaceutical. This will provide the industry with a sliding scale of capabilities in terms of information encoding. Everything from simple patterns to enable traceability of common over the shelf and well-established drugs to more complex encoded information to protect high end pharmaceuticals that are more likely to be the target of counterfeiting attempts would be available. During Phase II we will study the trade-offs in manufacturability and cost to develop a variable  custom  manufacturing process that would including everything from simple marking to 3-D imaging using lens arrays or even constructing full holograms. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Counterfeit drugs are widely recognized threat to both public health and the bottom line of pharmaceutical manufacturing companies. This proposal addresses a means to improve safety, reduce fraud and provide traceability. In Phase I of this research we demonstrated the feasibility of writing information to edible surfaces coated with edible lens array material using UV illumination and also the ability to project complex information using a short wavelength spatial light modulator. For Phase II we propose to demonstrate the manufacturability of encoded pharmaceutical tablets with edible integral lens array imagery as an anti-counterfeit device where individual tablets can each be uniquely coded with a hologram-like marker with a matching, non-edible, hologram-like marker placed on the outside of the bottle or as a security seal around the cap. The successful development of manufacturing processes under the effort proposed here will provide a means to fight pharmaceutical counterfeiting and thereby safeguard public health.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Rapid microbiological methods offer great potential for increasing the reliability of pathogen detection in foods while reducing labor costs and product hold times, however, small analysis volumes limit the usefulness of these methods. Pre-enrichment is often used to overcome this limitation, but the significant time advantage of these methods is then lost. Mechanical concentration or enrichment approaches hold promise, but their development has lagged. In an effort to fill this void, InnovaPrep has developed a rapid concentration approach with single-use membrane filter tips and a novel elution process to allow for straightforward, user- friendly concentration of pathogens from foods while eliminating cross contamination between samples. Through internal and Phase I project support InnovaPrep was able to release a commercial Concentrating Pipette (CP) device and flat membrane filter Concentrating Pipette Tips (CPTs) in March 2012 and the response has been strong - with 35 devices sold, two leased, and five loaned for evaluation. During Phase I and during the early months after release of the commercial CP system, it became clear that the approach was viable and that the market was ready to embrace this approach. It was, however, also apparent that the useful range of the current device was somewhat limited due to a relatively small membrane filter surface area of only 8.5 cm2. In particular, the upper sample volume size can be significantly limited when working with difficult food matrices. In Phase II, InnovaPrep proposes development of hollow fiber membrane filter CPTs (hf-CPTs) with up to 15 times more surface area than current flat membrane filter CPTs. This increased surface area will dramatically expand the useful range of the device, allowing for larger process volumes, greater concentration factors, reduced development time for new food methods, as well as allowing for the introduction of viral CPTs. Producing hf-CPTs at costs that fit the requirements of the food safety laboratory will requireinnovative manufacturing processes that can be automated. InnovaPrep has secured the help of Dr. Pierre C t  and Mr. Steven Pederson, two experts in the field of hollow fiber module design and production, to assist in the development of a novel static potting method in order to achieve these goals. A novel static potting method and new manufacturing processes will be developed and 3,500 beta hf-CPTs will be produced for use during the final Aims of the project. Using beta hf-CPTs, InnovaPrep will develop eleven concentration methods covering 11 high priority foods, five organisms, and six rapid detection methods. The developed methods will demonstrate the value of the CP over a range of food types, organisms and rapid detection methods and lay a broad basedgroundwork that serves as a starting point for development of additional methods by other users. The developed methods will be evaluated by at the University of Missouri - Columbia. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: InnovaPrep launched themarket disruptive Concentrating Pipette device in early 2012. In the proposed Phase II project the usable range of the system will be further extended through development of novel hollow fiber membrane filter Concentrating Pipette Tips and innovative manufacturing processes required to produce them at a low cost. The value of the combined system will be demonstrated and a basis for development of new methods will be established through development and evaluation of eleven concentration methods covering 11 high priority foods, five organisms, and six rapid detection methods.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION:  Oil spills can cause tremendous environmental damage and are a serious threat to public health. Petroleum contains many toxic compounds, including polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Some PAH compounds are highly carcinogenic and cause DNA mutations in humans. When petroleum is spilled into the sea, PAH compounds rapidly spread through the marine environment and eventually accumulate in marine life and threaten our seafood supply. The FDA has mandated that petroleum-contaminated seafood is unfitfor human consumption and should not be harvested or sold. Therefore, after an oil spill, careful monitoring is needed to assess the extent of the contaminated areas, ensure that seafood supplies are free of PAH compounds and monitor the return of affected areas to a normal state to allow re-opening of closed areas. Unfortunately, despite this critical need, the most currently used screening method is somewhat inaccurate and unreliable for the detection of potentially hazardous levels of PAH compounds in seafood. New alternative testing methods are sorely needed. In Phase I, we created a rapid enzyme-based assay to detect PAH compounds. Our method is much simpler, faster and more convenient than current test methods. The superior attributes of our assay give it the potential to revolutionize seafood PAH testing. In Phase II we will optimize and commercially develop the assay to produce a reliable and rugged test kit. To enable dockside testing and eliminate the use of toxic organic solvents, we will create anovel detergent-based method to process seafood samples. Next, we will scale-up manufacturing of our proprietary enzyme reagents to meet market needs. Lastly, to gain customer acceptance, we will validate our enzymatic assay against the accepted NOAA testmethod. Our test kit will provide seafood producers and government agencies such as the FDA and NOAA with a much-needed cost-effective, reliable and sensitive tool to detect petroleum in seafood after oil spills.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Oil spills are major threats to public health and the environment. Petroleum contains many toxic and carcinogenic substances; these substances can contaminate seafood near oil spill sites. It is important to test for toxic oil substances in seafood after an oil spill, but current methods are not adequate for thorough testing. In Phase I we created a novel enzyme-based test for the rapid detection of petroleum in seafood. In Phase II we will develop this assay to create a reliable commercialtest kit. The improvements to our testing capacity provided by our new method will greatly assist the FDA to ensure the safety of our Nation&#039;s seafood supply.",

        "abstract": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Even as we move into the 21st century, mining accidents are still a regular occurrence, often resulting in the loss of dozens of lives. Many of these fatalities could have been averted had there been a reliable emergency communications system in place to provide life-saving information to search-and-rescue parties and to trapped miners. To address this problem, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to advance the development of our new Magnetic Through-The-Earth Miner Transceiver for Emergency Communications (MATHEMITE) System. This system is a transceiver for two-way through-the-earth (TTE) communications, which was proven feasible in Phase I by demonstrating a 375 ft TTE communication range at the Edgar Mine (Idaho Springs, CO) and at the NIOSH Experimental Mine (Pittsburgh, PA). MATHEMITE integrates a novel zero-power mine transmitter (ZPT) and communication protocol to maintain mine-to-surface communications in all emergency situations. Innovations in the mine transmitter enable maintaining a communication link with a surface receiver through more than 2000 ft of overburden with no external power or batteries required. Application of digital noise-reduction data processing allows the surface receiver to detect the unique signature arriving from the mine transmitter, amid the mine environmental noise. These advantages also make the proposed transceiver commercially attractive, since it is based largely on integration of existing technology. The potential markets for the proposedtransceiver include not only mine safety but also construction and energy industries, in addition to numerous military and security applications. As a result, POC&#039;s proposed research will significantly and positively impact the safety of personnel involved in underground operations by providing a reliable, compact, through-the-earth communications system. This directly supports the mission of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to improve safety and health of mining workers. In PhaseI, POC successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the MATHEMITE system in mine operation with a scaled-down prototype over a 375 ft TTE communication range. The goal of Phase II is to develop and demonstrate a full-scale prototype system with a range ofup to 2000 ft that is completely safe for mine use and does not require additional infrastructure. Besides the prototype development, POC will conduct extensive measurements at mine test sites to accurately characterize the mine environment, including environmental noise and interference. POC will ensure the design meets Mine Safety and Health Administration regulations. Successful development of this technology will result in an entirely new emergency communications system that will overcome the safety, reliability, power, and size issues of current mine communications technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   The proposed mine radio transceiver will provide two-way through-the-earth communications for underground mine workers to communicate with search-and-rescue teams on the surface during a mine emergency such as fires, explosions, or roof cave-ins. Fully compliant with mine safety regulations, the transceiver offers robust communication through up to 2000 ft. of overburden without requiring external power or batteries.",

        "abstract": "Despite advances in our understanding of excessive alcohol intake-related tissue injury, high morbidity and mortality due to infections in alcohol abusers remain a prominent challenge. Milk fat globule epidermal growth factor-factor VIII (MFG-E8) is involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells. We previously discovered that acute alcohol exposure and infections down regulate MFG-E8 expression. Administration of recombinant murine MFG-E8 (rmMFG-E8) reduces apoptosis, decreases inflammatory responses, and attenuates organ damage in a rat model of acute alcohol exposure and subsequent polymicrobial infections. However, one obstacle that hampered development of MFG-E8 as a therapeutic agent for alcoholic patients with infections is the potential immunogenicity of animal proteins in humans. To overcome this, we successfully expressed and purified recombinant human MFG-E8 (rhMFG-E8), and our data indicated that rhMFG-E8 is as effective as animal MFG-E8. In our SBIR Phase I Contract, we scaled up the production of recombinant human MFG-EB (rhMFG-EB) and confirmed the beneficial effect of rhMFG-EB in a rodent model of acute alcohol exposure and sepsis. The goal of this SBIR Phase II Contract is targeted towards completing the preclinical development of rhMFG-EB as a novel therapeutic agent in reducing mortality after alcohol/sepsis.

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer type among women. Approximately one in  every eight women is diagnosed with breast cancer at some time in their life and 30% to  40% of the women who get breast cancer die. Early and accurate detection is  viewed asthe best method to decrease breast cancer mortality. Therefore  improving the accuracy and effectiveness of breast cancer detection has a vital value in  improving women&#039;s health in US and worldwide. Mammography is an effective tool and currently widely used for early detection of breast  cancer. It has played a substantial role in reducing the breast cancer mortality rate  by over 20% in the last decade. However, limitations of mammography have  been well publicized, such as very high false positive (70 -90%) and false negative  (-30%) rates. The problem arises from the difficulty in identifying cancerous mass  and Mes due to overlapping breast tissues. Today&#039;s mammography techniques rely on a pair of 2-D X-ray images of the breast,  taken from two different directions: top to bottom and side to side. The breast is pulled  away from the body, compressed, and held between two glass plates to ensure that the  whole breast is viewed. The images are then read by a radiologist. Breast cancer, which  is denser than most healthy nearby breast tissue, appears as irregular white areas. Due  to the 2-D imaging nature of mammography, breast cancer structures can be hidden in  the overlapping tissue and not show up on the mammogram. Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) isa 3-D imaging technique which can overcome the tissue overlap problem.  It takes multiple x-ray pictures of each breast from many angles. The breast is  positioned the same way it is in a conventional mammogram. In all current commercial  DBT scanners, the x-ray tube moves in an arc around the breast while 11 to 25 images  are taken during an 8 to 40-second examination. Then the information is sent to a  computer, where it is reconstructed to produce 3-D images of the breast. DBT has the  potential to revolutionize mammography by significantly reducing the tissue overlap  problem inherent in conventional 2-D mammography. In principle, DBT may lead to  improved sensitivity and specificity, fewer recalls, fewer biopsies, lower false alarm  rates, and reducedemotional impact, and DBT is expected to become a standard  screening and diagnostic tool for breast cancer in the future.

        "abstract": "O-GlcNAcylation of proteins plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis and signal transduction. Modification of O-GlcNAcylation of proteins by O-GlcNAc transferase is reversible by the activity of O-GlcNAcase. Addition and removal of O-GlcNAc moiety to serine or threonine regulate the function of proteins directly or via decreased phosphorylation. O-GlcNAcylation of c-myc proteins induces ubiquitin-dependent c-myc degradation. GlcNAcylation of p53 prevents p53 degradation and stabilizes p53 proteins, which are beneficial in cancer cells by arresting cell growth and inducing apoptosis in response to DNA damage. To elucidate functions of O-GlcNAcylation of the proteins it is necessary to develop site-specific antibodies for O-GlcNAcylated proteins. Few site-specific antibodies have been successfully produced so far. A lack of site-specific O-GlcNAcylated Abs prevents facile detection and quantitation of the site to elucidate the function of O-GlcNAcylated molecules in physiology and disease. Availability of O-GlcNAcylation site-specific antibodies will facilitate mechanistic studies on O-GlcNAcylation   and phosphorylation-dependent signal transduction pathway in cancer, which will result in development of O-GlcNAcylation-inducing anti-cancer drugs.

        "abstract": "The development of biologic drugs for cancer treatment often requires formulations that must be lyophilized to produce stable drug products. The process of developing a drug formulation and freeze drying process begins with laboratory experiments followedby scale-up to pilot and production scale lyophilizers. A major challenge during early formulation and lyophilization process development is the cost and limited supply of API available for development and the lack of representative small scale lyophilizerthat emulates a production scale dryer. Current laboratory dryers hold hundreds of vials and their operation and product drying behavior with jsut a few vials is different than with a full load of vials due to highly atypical radiation heat transfer. Theprocess information gathered drying a few vials in a standard laboratory dryer is relatively useless. The goal of this Phase I SBIR program is to design, fabricate, test and apply a mini lyophilizer that dries one to seven product vials under heat and masstransfer conditions typicaly encountered in larger production freeze dryers. The mini lyophilizer will be outfitted with process analytical technology tools that enable the use of scientific and engineering principles for successful scale up and economically viable drug product manufacturing.

        "abstract": "Folic acid is a water-soluble vitamin that serves as a cofactor in 1-carbon transfers required for DNA replication. Humans lack the enzymes to synthesize folate, so dietary intake is necessary. Its deficiency is associated with neural tube defects (NTDs) in fetuses. The global burden of folate insufficiency as it relates to NTDs is estimated to be over 200,000 pregnancies yearly. Many NTDs can be prevented if a woman consumes folic acid daily before and during early pregnancy. Although mandatory folic acid fortification has increased blood folate concentrations in the U.S .. folate insufficiency remains a severe problem on a global scale. The lack of data on blood folate levels hampers public health efforts to identify, intervene, and evaluate populations at risk for NTDs. This gap in data is primarily due to the inability to perform large-scale national surveillance studies of folate levels and NTDs in countries with remote and isolated populations. To this end, Lynntech proposes to develop a field-based assay that will allow for the measurement of red blood cell (RBC) folate levels. Our technology utilizes Lynntech's sample preparation module to first capture RBCs, followed by RBC hemolysis to release the folate for visual detection by lateral flow assay (LFA). Relevance of this research to public health: Folate insufficiency is directly linked to neural tube defects which are birth defects of the brain and spinal cord. The ability to collect data of folate level in a population in non-laboratory settings will allow the government to implement proper policy to increase the folate intake and reduce the health issues associated with folate deficiency.\n",

There is a critical need for a simple diagnostic tool for cryptococcosis that can be used in resource-limited countries. An innovative cryptococcal antigen lateral flow assay (CrAg LFA) has been developed in order to address this need. The CrAg LFA has been shown to be effective for use with serum, plasma, cerebral spinal fluid, and urine specimens, but has not been optimized or evaluated for use with whole blood specimens, which is the ideal specimen type for resource limited countries with minimal laboratory infrastructure. The specific aims and anticipated results are the optimization of the CrAg LFA and the determination of the range of detection of CrAg in whole blood specimens. The success of this proposed study would have a profound public health impact, leading to earlier diagnosis of cryptococcosis and a reduction of CM-associated deaths.",

The platform will feature an M-ETL engine that applies a Semantic Web data modeling feature interactively during the design of the data extraction, transformation and loading procedures. The innovative approach will be used to analyze the ontology models of data sources and related biomedical ontologies and identify matching definitions to guide the ETL process to build a more efficient data warehouse. EpiDIA will also feature a semantically-enabled data analysis framework within a Web-based user interface for the semantic connection of proven statistical, hylogenetic and sequence analysis tools. The achievement of this objective requires the definition of a standardized representation of analysis tools and the establishment of a mechanism to provide semantic annotations to such standardized representations and to reference concepts from semantic models such as ontologies. During Phase I, prototypes of the EpiDIA components will be created and evaluated to demonstrate feasibility of the proposed approach.\n",

        "abstract": "The mountain pine beetle (MPB), Dendroctonus ponderosae, is one of the most destructive pests of North American forests as it attacks large lodgepole pine trees. During outbreak years, beetles mass attack these trees causing irreversible damage that leads to the death of the tree, usually within one year of a successful attack. Large acreages of pristine forests are turned into fire hazards as previously healthy trees decay and dry out. Insecticide applications have remain ineffective at protecting trees, since the process requires thorough insecticide spray along the entire base of the tree. Pine beetle repellents have shown promise but do not achieve satisfactory level of pine beetle control. Innovation in the management tools against the pine beetle are thus tremendously needed.  Using ISCA Technologies &amp; #39; proven semiochemical delivery system, SPLAT &amp; reg; (Specialized Pheromone and Lure Application Technology), this research project will optimize SPLATverb a mountain pine beetle repellent which has demonstrated effective tree protection, surpassing current pine beetle repellents on the market. Optimizing SPLATverb application metrics for protection of single trees and area wide protection and optimizing mechanical and aerial spray equipment so that SPLATverb can be applied to larger areas faster as opposed to manual applications currently seen with insecticide treatments and pine beetle repellents. This Phase II USDA SBIR project will further optimize SPLATverb in order to make its operational use easier and more efficient. The successful optimization of SPLATverb to manage MPB will create opportunities for expansion into management of other important bark beetle species that also respond to verbenone as their primary anti-aggregation pheromone (e.g., Dendroctonus brevicomis, the western pine beetle and Dendroctonus frontalis, the southern pine beetle), thus increasing the economic and societal benefits of this project.",

        "abstract": "The goal of the Developed Outdoor Recreation Assessment Process (DORAP) will be to create a reliable and repeatable method for evaluating 18 different types of constructed features in outdoor recreation areas for compliance with applicable federal guidelines. On-line and in-person training and certification will be made available through a partnership with American Trails, a not-for-profit trails organization for all trail types. Guidance for disseminating the results of site assessments will be created and ADA transition plan templates will be created to assist with meeting accessibility requirements. This project will create an efficient, reliable, and accurate assessment process to determine if outdoor recreation elements meet accessibility guidelines. Travel monies for city, county, state and Federal agencies are limited so everyone from Scout Troops to professional assessment coordinators need on-line training and certification to ensure that valid assessments of outdoor recreation facilities are conducted. Electronic templates will be created to efficiently and accurately collect the data on mobile devices. The data can then be collected for land managers so that they can use it to meet their ADA obligations by creating transition plans and to schedule access improvements. Data can also be collected and made available to the public so accessible facilities can be easily identified. Congress mandated an evaluation of accessibility to outdoor recreation on federally managed lands in 1998 and the results highlighted that many federal agency units had not completed their transition plans. To add to the problem, no standardized format has been adopted for outdoor recreation transition plans. This project will develop and validate a standard method for assessing, disseminating, and planning the corrective action of constructed features in our nation &amp; #39;s outdoor recreation areas. DORAP will be used by managers of public and private recreation areas to assess the accessibility of their facilities. DORAP will be used by product manufacturers to make sure their products are accessible for marketing purposes and avoid liability if they are not. DORAP will be used by private accessibility inspectors who will be able to obtain the training, certification, and tools they need to perform accessibility assessment services in the outdoor environment.",

        "abstract": "This Phase II project will work toward increasing the math and science problem solving capacities of high need rural students and their teachers. Math and science and the ability to solve problems in these disciplines lie at the heart of technical innovation and economic security in today &amp; #39;s global marketplace. Research has demonstrated that early math skills are the strongest predictor of future academic performance across many domains, including reading. Similarly, the acquisition of higher skill levels in math and science can have significant effects on labor market success. Sustainable development at the local level requires a technically proficient workforce capable of complex problem solving and high achieving schools, especially to attract the agriculturally-related manufacturing and alternative or renewable energy innovation contracts that are drivers in economic development for rural communities. Yet despite nearly a decade of research, access to the high quality math and science curricula that will prepare students for this level of competition is severely limited by a complex set of circumstances including outmigration, geographic isolation and the national shortage of trained math educators and math specialists. Learnimation &amp; #39;s distance learning solution will help rural school districts provide access to a high quality math and science problem solving program that is research-based, aligned with the new Common Core Math Standards and integrates internationally-acclaimed problem solving instruction techniques. The research timeline will design, build and validate a web-based Student Problem Solving System that trains students in the full breadth of problem scenarios recommended by the National Math Panel and the Common Core Math Standards. Learnimation will translate current research-based techniques into an engaging learning experience that will be individualized for each student based on his/her unique needs. The team will work with rural teachers and school administrators to tailor the program for their needs, including refining reporting interfaces that enable data-based decision-making. Using these methods, this project will build, refine and deliver a distance learning system that has the potential to increase capacity for problem solving in both students and their teachers. Additionally, the methodology may result in increased understanding in the software development process, in the translation of research to practice and in the structure of research studies that examine the efficacy of intervention tools.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes is an epidemic disease in the United States and worldwide. Diabetes care accounts for 10% of all U.S. healthcare costs, most of which is consumed in the care of complications from diabetes, but also includes lost economic productivity from illness, disability and blindness. Despite the high incidence of diabetes, low health literacy and limited access to health care resources keeps families in a cycle of poor health that continues from generation to generation. Critical socio-economic and geographical barriers to health care in rural, health disparity communities pose unique challenges to identify those patients at the greatest risk for complications of diabetes, which are not met by current health care delivery models. As an emerging technology, telemedicine is an efficient and cost-effective way to deliver health care services over large geographic regions including rural, health disparity communities. Hubble Telemedical provides remote management of diabetic retinopathy using retinal images acquired in the primary care practice space, through its award winning TRIAD Network. Hubble &amp; #39;s network leverages image and metadata analysis algorithms and the connectivity to the Internet to provide a scalable, web-based, and cost effective solution for high throughput, point-of-care assessment and management of diabetic disease complications in large health disparity populations. The result? Improved efficiency and health outcomes. This proposal will leverage an ongoing partnership with the Delta Health Alliance (Stoneville, MS) and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center to implement a translational, informatics-based diabetes management program. In our Phase I study we developed a proprietary software interface to automatically acquire remote electronic health record data and established the feasibility of using clinical metadata mining to identify and more effectively manage those patients at highest risk for the complications of diabetic retinopathy. Our goal is to identify and target high-risk patients for medical intervention and referral as a cost-effective approach to improving health outcomes in rural America. In this Phase II study, Hubble Telemedical and its partners will demonstrate that metadata-based health care analytics can be provided to rural communities to effect a scalable and cost effective solution to diabetes management and disease progression. We will demonstrate improved and cost effective health care outcomes in at risk patients in a cohort of over 800 patients using data mining analysis. In Phase III, Hubble will deploy the developed system to a multiplicity of rural, health disparity communities throughout the US in partnership with its managed care and wellness partners to apply this novel paradigm to optimize management of diabetes, obesity and their complications in rural America to help curb the spiraling costs of US health care using a cost effective data mining model.",

        "abstract": "The U.S. is suffering from a $10billion and growing trade offset in fisheries products, with the majority of these products coming from farmed sources abroad. Several limiting factors exist that are inhibiting the growth of aquaculture in developed nations like the U.S., one of which is the efficiency at which farms in developed nations need to operate at to maintain profitability. One of the major expenses in the aquaculture business is the ability of a farmer to keep netting clean on cages. Clean nets promote better water flow, and a healthier stock than fouled nets. Current solutions to the problem are both inefficient and expensive. This project provides a solution to this problem, through a novel, mechanical cleaning approach. The main deliverable in this project will be a scrubbing machine that mechanically removes fouling from netting surfaces in aquaculture applications. Phase I was completed and yielded positive results that will continue into the Phase II effort. A more comprehensive study, with focus on design for manufacturing and refining the Phase I design will be complete. A marketable, final design, ready for Phase III investment and manufacturing, will be complete at the end of Phase II.",

        "abstract": "The US aquaculture industry, which is around a $2B per year business consisting of 6,343 businesses that employ 15,198 people is greatly in need of a non-toxic and long-lasting antifouling coating. Biofouling is the undesirable accumulation of microorganisms, plants, and animals on man-made surfaces. This biofouling is extremely detrimental to the outdoor marine aquaculture industry. For the netting used in fish pens by farmers and hatcheries, biofouling has been found to rapidly accumulate and fill in the open areas of nets in a matter of weeks. Closing off of open cells of nets leads to huge problems due to the inhibition of water flow that limits availability of dissolved oxygen and restricts the removal of fish excrements and waste that leads to a multitude of problems such as diseases like netpen liver disease, amoebic gill disease, and parasites. Current antifouling paints utilize agents that are toxic to a variety of marine species. The most effective antifoulant agents have been heavy metal based, which are now known to not be environmentally benign. In particular, the very effective tributyltin (TBT) antifoulant additive was banned and totally removed from the market in 2008. The current most popular substitute has been copper oxide, which today can be found in over 400 different marine paints. Although not as toxic as TBT, copper oxide &amp; #39;s toxicity may lead to its eventual ban. Even though copper oxide based paints are still used, it is not totally accepted by many aquaculture farmers and for some cannot be used because of their particular crop &amp; #39;s sensitivity to copper oxide, specifically those raising crabs and scallops. In summary, fouling causes problems for aquaculture farmers and hatcheries that include increased fish mortality, slower fish growth, premature harvesting and increased labor and material costs that translate to lower profitability. In addition to detrimental effects to the fish, the extra weight added to the netting system can be enormous. It has been reported that an increase by a factor of 200 in the weight of the net has been observed, which means a 50 pound net could end up weighing 5 tons after fouling. This often will result in net failures and extra maintenance. Phase I research verified that certain benign antifouling agents added to clays impart antifouling properties when added to marine paint. Phase II work will entail the optimization of the encapsulation, the addition to various other paint matrices for the maximization of the antifouling efficacy while minimizing costs, and in vivo testing at four sites that possess completely different marine environments. Not only will an effective environmentally friendly antifouling paint be very marketable to the aquaculture sector but will also be very attractive to the much larger marine coatings industry for use in coating bottoms of ships and boats.",

        "abstract": "As aquaculture, particularly marine aquaculture continues to expand worldwide environmental regulations pertaining to waste discharge from fish farms are also becoming more stringent having an environmentally sound waste management, recovery and disposal plan are thus becoming increasingly more important, particularly in marine aquaculture. Two of the primary concerns for extending water reuse and recovery are the suspended solids and phosphorous in the effluent. The direct filtration process provides aquaculturist with a tool to allow both freshwater and marine recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) (including zoos and aquaria) to recover and extend the use of water in their facilities resulting in a significant cost savings through the reduction of the volume of waste water being discharged and the cost of make-up water, especially on marine systems which rely on expensive artificial sea salt mixtures or transport of saltwater from offshore sites. The direct filtration process is a simplified strategy for implementing a coagulation/flocculation process. Coagulation and flocculation aids have long been used in the drinking water and wastewater treatment industries. Traditional water treatment utilizes the process of dosing chemical coagulation and flocculation aids for the removal of turbidity-causing fine solids in a progressive, 4-step process. To improve upon the traditional coagulation/flocculation approach to water treatment, the direct filtration process combines the individual unit processes with the particle capture benefits of a floating bead filter (FBF) to create an efficient, integrated, and streamlined package. The integration of electro-flocculation, a promising new technology which does not require the dosing of chemical coagulation and flocculation aids, may reduce the amount of residue from the coagulation/flocculation process and simplify the direct filtration process. Electro-flocculation is the application of electrical current to a pair of electrodes to improve and facilitate the flocculation of fine solids. While highly effective at the removal of fine suspended and colloidal particles, the direct filtration process may potentially be tuned to have the secondary benefit of effective phosphorus removal. As a result of the Phase I research, the application of the direct filtration process with a FBF was shown to be incredibly successful in the removal of turbidity-causing fine suspended solids. Likewise, the effect of orthophosphate sequestration and removal with an appropriate coagulant makes the direct filtration FBF even more desirable. Combining the removal of turbidity-causing fine suspended solids with the removal of orthophosphate in a space-saving, innovative package will serve as an excellent addition to the existing line of highly successful FBFs which AST has successfully marketed for over 17 years. The key to successful aquatic animal production systems is the availability of reliable and cost effective production technologies. AST has successfully commercialized a family of FBFs, or bioclarifiers, which can accomplish both solids capture and nitrification in a single unit economically and efficiently. AST believes that this &quot;next generation&quot; of FBF optimized for direct filtration will provide an efficient and cost effective solution which directly addresses the regulations imposed on the aquaculture, zoo and large aquarium industries.",

        "abstract": "Most small and mid-scale livestock producers have been unable to take advantage of growing consumer demand for premium, all-natural, locally-raised meats, especially through wholesale channels. This relates to a host of factors, including the vertically-integrated nature of existing meat supply chains, constraints surrounding slaughter and processing capacity, and the specific demands of wholesale buyers. It also reflects the fact that local food systems suffer from a lack of connectivity between producers, processors and buyers. Working towards vibrant regional food economies requires supporting the development of businesses that can strengthen these relationships and &quot;connect the dots&quot; along local meat supply chains. In the case of proteins, it suggests a strong need for middle businesses that can provide the skills and infrastructure needed to aggregate, distribute and market meat products at the local level. Firsthand Foods, an innovative food hub, offers a regional solution to many of these challenges. Firsthand Foods, LLC was awarded a Phase I grant to prove the feasibility of its business model through research and development of a range of marketing strategies and supply side partnerships. Firsthand Foods is a branded, regional food hub in North Carolina that delivers local, high-quality beef and pork to restaurants and retailers. We are one of the only food hubs in the nation that focuses exclusively on proteins.

By working with a range of producers, Firsthand Foods &amp; #39; business model allows livestock producers to remain small while being part of a network that supplies larger-scale institutional and retail markets. As a Phase II applicant, Firsthand Foods proposes to conduct research that strengthens its business systems and practices to: 1) support sustainable livelihoods for a growing network of small and mid-sized livestock producers, 2) assist with the professionalization and business advancement of the small-scale meat processing sector, 3) solve numerous challenges that wholesale buyers encounter in sourcing local protein products, and 4) significantly expand consumer access to local, pasture-raised meats.",

        "abstract": "High Tunnels (commonly called poly tunnels or hoop houses) are a type of field protected agriculture. They are essentially an intermediary between the full environmental risk-taking of outdoor production, and the controlled conditions, and relatively high energy use, of a conventional greenhouse. There are hundreds of thousands of acres in cultivation under high tunnels across the world. Domestically, the technology is rapidly expanding and this trend is likely to continue for a number of reasons: increased consumer demand for local produce, strong government support, rising diesel fuel prices, more frequent incidences of extreme weather, and increasing aridity and water shortages in major produce growing regions. Growers adapt high tunnel technology because it allows them to extend the season, boost yields, produce new crops, and improve overall quality without the large capital expenditures of greenhouses. Lacking precise, automated control of the growing environment, however, poly tunnel agriculture will be limited in size in many regions of the country. The research attempts to address this problem by designing and developing affordable, rugged technologies tailored made for high tunnel growers. The first objective of the researchproject is to modify the early prototype control system developed in the previous phase so that it can monitor and manage multiple tunnels. The second objectiveis to design a method of retrofitting tunnels with solar thermal heating systems that are completely integrated by the control systems. As part of this objective, we will design and develop unique air distribution manifolds that transfer fluids from the solar collector to the thermal mass. The technology will impact US agriculture by making high tunnel processes more efficient and cost-effective. It will reduce labor expenses, lower on-farm energy inputs, minimize risks and increase yields. This in turn will allow for greater domestic expansion of poly tunnel agriculture. Production will be able to move closer to major markets in the Midwest and Northeast, thereby reducing carbon emissions associated with food transportation. The expansion of tunnel agriculture will also provide growers a means to adapt to changing climate conditions such as more extreme weather and pronounced droughts.",

There are very few pest management tools available to blueberry growers. A neuro-active neonicotinoid, is the only effective insecticide blueberry growers have to control the Oriental beetle (OrB), Anomala orientalis Waterhouse, a destructive root feeding pest in the larval stage. However, most blueberry growers are reluctant to use this pesticide because of the fear that neonicotinoids may be linked to the devastating colony collapse disorder (CCD) of bees.  Following the achievements of the Phase I USDA SBIR project, ISCA Technologies will seek to refine all parameters of SPLAT OrB application to make adoption of SPLAT OrB formulations economically feasible for all blueberry growers. Further refinements to the final SPLAT OrB formulations include reducing the total amount of SPLAT OrB applied per area (acre or hectare), reducing the size of each SPLAT OrB point source, or dollop, while maintaining a 12 week field life, and assessing the reduction in beetle mating success following a SPLAT OrB application. This Phase II USDA SBIR project, Effective Semiochemical Management of the Oriental Beetle for the Small Blueberry Grower, will result in an effective line of SPLAT OrB products for mating disruption control of adult oriental beetle and will be available on the market to all US blueberry growers in response to few management tools available for this pest.",

Mussel rafts at these sites experience significant production losses from structural damage, drop-off from the culture ropes, reduced growth due to agitation during storms, and eider duck predation. While there are limited areas for expansion of the mussel raft industry in sheltered waters, at semi-exposed Maine embayments, where thousands of hectares are available for development, there is excellent water quality resulting in high mussel growth rates, high meat yields and good natural seed collection. What is needed is a new generation of mussel rafts for those sites which can allow for the expansion of the industry to satisfy market demand, improve food security, reduce the U.S. seafood trade deficit, while creating sustainable jobs in rural areas.",

        "abstract": "We are seeking to develop a new technological approach to managing and harvesting citrus in High Density Groves, which is an emerging production system that offers solutions to the Florida citrus industries battles with pest, diseases, and high cost of labor. This multi-function platform will be used for harvesting as well as other production tasks such as spraying, hedging, mowing, and etc. The long term objective is to interchangeably harvest either fresh market or process destined fruit with the same platform. This USDA SBIR Phase II proposal will develop an Over the Top Citrus Harvesting (OTCH) system called the GeoSpider, which is specifically designed for high density groves. The GeoSpider is a multi-purpose equipment system which will operate in high-density size-controlled groves much in the same way that a tractor and implements operate in traditional field agriculture. The prime mover will be an Over the Top Platform (OTP) which is sized for the APS citrus grove. The most critical function will be citrus harvesting using mass harvesting approaches for process fruit market. In phase I, we developed and tested the Over the Top Citrus Harvester (OTCH) approach for mass harvesting, along with designing a suitable concept Over the Top Platform (OTP), which will support and power the OTCH, and allow mounting various implements for grove management. This Phase II project development will implement the mass harvesting system on an enhanced performance OTP with load leveling, along with the catch frame and material handling systems. In Phase I, prototype testing was conducted under research controlled field conditions, while the proposed Phase II will fully develop the Geo-Spider OTCH prototype and further validate mass harvesting under commercial grove conditions. Long term, Geo-Spider will have mass and selective harvesting capability plus other functionality which will give GeoSpider a significant market advantage and thus should be highly attractive to large and small citrus growers and custom production and harvesting companies. plan with our manufacturering partners, and potential investors so that by the end of Phase II we will be ready to implement the Phase III plan.",

        "abstract": "Innovation in perishable foodstuff track-and-trace is of critical importance to cost and time-sensitive customers such as the food industry where contamination and spoilage are of concern, safety and security are paramount, and counterfeit and bio-terrorism prevention are urgent priorities. The proposed research would evaluate the feasibility of a low cost, highly accurate track and trace supply chain technology that would minimize the recall costs of contamination events in the food supply chain, and ensure source authentication. Research will develop and test a novel autonomous track-and-trace system customized for perishable foodstuffs that would be feasible for widespread industry adoption in that it is cost-effective (no portal infrastructure), accurate, and easy to use. Research deliverables will include identifying optimal RF labeling and packing manufacturing solutions to support integrated item/pallet-level field-to-fork tracking of North Carolina agricultural products, and optimizing the technology for the controlled temperature/humidity/air circulation environments required for shipment and in-transit storage of food perishables. The mobile device prototype design will undergo rigorous tests of its ability to track, accurately compute, map, and log the location of tagged perishables in real time. Bar code integration into the technology will allow for the ability to track both at the pallet level and item level in order to accommodate, and not disrupt, current industry practice. The R &amp; amp;D effort will be documented and validated by test data (both electronic and video-taped results), and the application of WISER &amp; #39;s Redundant Radio Location Technology (RRLT) will be evaluated under live conditions, along with system costs. Cost-benefit analysis will be conducted to determine whether the RRLT impementation cost is in fact substantially below conventional practice--which requires exensive physical infrastructure, high TCO, and is difficult to customize to user coverage density preferences. In addition, the technology will be evaluated as a potential application for governments and regulators interested in mitigating the impact of contamination events and even allowing for the &quot;lock-down&quot; of a problematic supply chain, for example, in the event of a bio-terrorism threat to a specific food product. An inexpensive, easy-to-use, and accurate tracking solution will produce benefits including facilitating the ability of regulators to establish manifest tracking mandates acceptable to industry. To the degree that the nation &amp; #39;s agriculture and food supply can be electronically certified and closely monitored electronically, protection and safety of the food supply will be enhanced, and contamination event victims and dollar losses minimized.",

        "abstract": "The respiration of fresh fruits and vegetables (FF &amp; amp;V) converts oxygen from the surrounding air into carbon dioxide, moisture and ethylene. While ethylene is used under controlled conditions as a ripening agent, the presence of even small amounts of ethylene gas in shipping and storage containers causes most fresh produce to deteriorate much faster, potentially spoiling it before it reaches the store or consumer. Current ethylene control technology is based on reactive potassium permanganate filters. While they are effective, they pose logistics problems because they must be frequently replaced. In addition, the used filters are considered hazardous waste and require special and expensive disposal procedures.  TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes an ambient temperature oxidation catalyst that can be integrated into current shipping containers and storage facilities to eliminate ethylene. The catalytic oxidizer does not require replacement and disposal of the used media. The high activity of the catalyst at low temperatures eliminates the need to heat the air that flows through it and reduces complexity, capital and operating costs.  In Phase I, we prepared and evaluated different catalyst formulations under representative conditions to prove the technical feasibility of the concept and carried out an economic analysis to demonstrate its commercial viability of the concept. The results suggest that the catalyst is highly effective in converting ethylene into CO2 and H2O, without generating undesirable by-products (such as carbon monoxide). The catalyst also maintains its performance over long durations without any loss of activity. The preliminary economic analysis suggests a clear cost advantage over one-time use permanganate filters.  In Phase II, we will continue to improve the catalyst formulation and scale-up production using high throughput manufacturing equipment. We will fully design the catalyst filter and prepare several prototypes to carry out demonstrations to assess its efficacy in extending the life of fresh fruits and vegetables. We will also carry out a detailed cost analysis to identify the full economic benefits against competing technologies.",

The current composition of Fatty acids constitutes Myristic (C14) and Palmitic (C16) acids. Prior Phase I work has demonstrated that sugars (C6 and C5) and industrially produced biomass hydrolysate can be efficiently converted to these fatty acids. The proposing team has far exceeded the original phase I targets and is now significantly more prepared for a phase II and subsequent commercialization. Since, the fatty acids formed are extra-cellular, separation is anticipated to be significantly simpler. Moreover, fatty acids formed do not contain any sulfur that can poison the downstream catalyst for conversion to fuels.

        "abstract": "According to the USDA (2012) approximately 80% of the Nation &amp; #39;s consumptive water use, and over 90% in many western states, is used in agriculture. Groundwater provides over 50 billion gallons per day for agricultural needs. Long term water level declines caused by sustained groundwater pumping for agriculture are impacting the environment at large and the agricultural community specifically. Farmers are painfully aware of these facts because they affect the future livelihood of their farms and communities. Using software to streamline, automate, and reduce irrigation by as little as 10% can save the average farmer between $47,000 and $318,000 annually. Significant conservation can arise through rational irrigation and so, the economic incentive for the grower aligns well with the overarching need for agricultural sector to contribute to the conservation of aquifers, energy and other resources. HydroBio, Inc. developed an innovative software product, Targeted Irrigation Management (TIM) to provide farmers with an easy-to-use irrigation decision support system that is being applied initially for center pivot irrigation systems. The software uses weather data and Earth observation satellite (EOS) data analyzed through proprietary methods to estimate the precise water needs of each field. Coupled with online pivot monitoring and control units TIM automated software enables the grower to deliver an optimal irrigation strategy to his field from his computer, tablet, or smart-phone that includes (1) the previous day &amp; #39;s water use map, (2) daily and weekly irrigation schedules based on crop water use and soil water banking, (3) strategies for preparing and storing soil water to meet irrigation deficits during times when crop requirements exceed pumping capacity, (4) pivot speed control to apply the exact amount of water to different crops, the same crop started at different times, or serving sectors of the field that grow with different vigor, and (5) data storage and retrieval to permit the grower to assess for each field what has worked best and where to improve, all at a granularity of one-ninth of an acre.  HydroBio received a USDA SBIR Phase I award that funded the transition between conceptual science and proof that TIM is sound and commercially viable. Phase II funding will enable gathering and testing the data necessary for launching TIM commercially. These data include measurements of soil water, enhancing workflows, and proofing data input and output in a 2013-2014 beta test on a target population of 250 center pivots in the north Texas Panhandle.  In response to grower requests, a suite of TIM tools was developed during Phase I to provide maps, updated every 72 hours, upon receipt of new EOS data, of relative crop yield, potential crop problems (e.g. pests), and for optimizing inputs for the crop to enhance return on investment. Through the medium of the internet and wireless technology, coupled with responsiveness to irrigated agriculture needs and grower feedback, HydroBio aspires to provide scalable tools for precision irrigation and crop management delivered throughout the world.  Phase I funded the transition from conceptual science to proof concepts and data calculation necessary preparation for on-the-ground, near real time, and sub acre precision agriculture. Phase II funding provides a final transition from beta test to full commercialization.",

        "abstract": "In this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) effort, Los Gatos Research (LGR) proposes to utilize its patented Off-Axis ICOS technology to develop an analyzer for the accurate determination of 15N/14N, 18O/16O, and 17O/16O isotope ratios in nitrates (d15N, d18O, and d17O). The system will employ the bacterial denitrification method to convert nitrates (NO3-) into N2O, and then utilize a mid-infrared Off-Axis ICOS analyzer to rapidly ( &amp; lt; 5 minutes) determine nitrate concentration, d15N, d18O, and d17O to better than &amp; plusmn; 1%, &amp; plusmn; 0.2 &amp; permil;, &amp; plusmn; 0.5 &amp; permil;, and &amp; plusmn; 0.5 &amp; permil; respectively. Nitrate contamination in water is an ubiquitous, world-wide problem, and the resulting instrument will help provide nitrate source apportionment, identify multiple nitrate sources, study spatial mixing of nitrate pollution, and identify areas in which natural nitrate attenuation processes are taking place. Additionally, the SBIR analyzer can be used to help quantify the nitrate pollution and N2O emission impacts of emerging biofuels.  In Phase I, LGR demonstrated technical feasibility by fabricating a prototype system for quantification of N2O, 15N14NO, 14N15NO, and 14N14N18O in digested nitrate samples. The prototype was tested on a variety of gas cylinders and found to quantify [N2O], d15N, d15Na, d15Nb, and d18O with a precision of &amp; plusmn;0.01 ppb, &amp; plusmn;0.42 &amp; permil;, &amp; plusmn;0.40 &amp; permil;, &amp; plusmn;0.50 &amp; permil;, and &amp; plusmn;0.75 &amp; permil; respectively (1s, 1000s for [N2O] = 320 ppb). Repeated measurements of discrete reference gas injections demonstrated that the Phase I sensor was precise to better than &amp; plusmn;0.25 &amp; permil; and &amp; plusmn;0.53 &amp; permil; for d15N and d18O respectively with minimal dependence of the isotope ratio on nitrous oxide concentration over a wide dynamic range of [N2O] = 0.25 - 2 ppm. Potential cross-interferences with ambient water vapor and higher hydrocarbons were mitigated by using front-end cold trap. The instrument was then used to characterize nitrate-polluted water samples obtained from the Abbotsford aquifer (British Columbia, Canada). The Phase I system was directly compared to isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) measurements and found to be accurate to within &amp; plusmn;2.4 &amp; permil; and &amp; plusmn;3.2 &amp; permil; for d15N and d18O. This data clearly showed that the high levels of nitrate pollution were due to animal waste and fertilizer ammonium runoff and not to atmospheric deposition or fertilizer nitrate runoff. Due to the novelty of the Phase I measurements, they will be presented at the European Geophysical Union Spring Meeting (Vienna, Austria) and the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting (San Francisco, California). Finally, the results were also used to help identify Phase II improvements.  In Phase II, Los Gatos Research will refine the Nitrate Isotope Analyzer hardware, electronics, and software to improve the instrument accuracy, precision, and stability. Then, the technology will be extended to include measurements of d17O. The instrument will be automated by including provisions for autonomous sample conversion and handing. Subsequent to extensive laboratory testing at LGR, the analyzer will be deployed at the International Atomic Energy Agency (Vienna, Austria) and tested by the Isotope Hydrology Laboratory at no charge to this SBIR effort. A second Nitrate Isotope Analyzer will be fabricated and deployed at Purdue University, where Professor Greg Michalski in the Department of Chemistry will verify its accuracy against an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) and use it to quantify water pollution sources including atmospheric deposition, nitrate fertilizers, and soil runoff.  During Phase III, LGR will sell the N2O isotope analyzers to isotope measurement laboratories, environmental research groups, global monitoring stations, and water quality management agencies. A preliminary market analysis suggests a 5-year commercial revenue exceeding $40M for these",

        "abstract": "The objective of this Phase II SBIR proposal is to develop a prototype boron measurement system for use with oil and gas produced water. Oil production is water intensive, requiring large volumes of fresh water for production, and producing even larger volumes of contaminated water. In some older California oilfields, nine barrels of contaminated water are produced for every barrel of oil. Producers have three options for this contaminated water: it can be trucked to a water treatment facility, impacting typically rural communities with heavy truck traffic, stressing local water treatment facilities, and providing the producer with a significant expense; it can be disposed by injection in a different geologic structure or by evaporation and percolation in a surface pond, placing ground and/or surface water supplies at risk; or it can be treated and reused. Water reuse is the ideal outcome, both for the oil producer in decreased costs and also for the local, typically rural, communities in decreased local environmental, health, and societal impacts. The high contaminant concentrations in the produced water make reuse difficult without advanced treatment and monitoring technologies. Unlike existing laboratory-based analysis methods that may take weeks to complete a test, OndaVia &amp; #39;s chemical testing system ideally addresses the high-frequency, rapid-turn testing needs of oil and gas producers with a sub-five-minute, on-site test. With frequent and more quickly obtained data, these companies can improve the efficiency of water treatment, reuse, and even extraction of petroleum, making water conservation a profitable activity. In addition to reduced heavy-industry stress on rural communities, increased water reuse will reduce competition for fresh water sources while producing a clean waste product suitable for irrigation.",

        "abstract": "In the United States today, the health consequences associated with childhood and adolescent obesity are projected to produce the first decline in life expectancy since the Great Depression. Addressing childhood obesity requires addressing nutritional needs, including dietary fat to support physical and psychological changes during growth and maturation. Researchers have reevaluated the focus on low-fat diets for low-calorie diets because low-fat diets can lead to fat-soluble vitamin deficiency and dietary fat promotes satiation, slowing digestion by triggering the release of satiety hormones. Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) and oil blends containing MCFAs have received considerable attention for their potential in reducing abdominal obesity because they increase energy expenditure (EE), enhance thermogenesis, and potentially diminish fat storage. The effects of MCFA on EE and enhanced thermogenesis in obese children are unknown. However, higher fat oxidation rates and postprandial EE have been observed in adult studies with doses of medium chain triglyceride (MCT) as low as 5g. MCFAs occur in their highest quantities in coconut oil. Phase I efforts successfully developed MCFA-based baking fat innovation tested for oxidative stability and for raising EE in obese adolescents. The baking fat innovation is derived from the table spread version of Rich &amp; amp; Creamy Melt &amp; reg; Organic (Melt Organic) - produced by Prosperity Organic Foods (POF) and is the first commercially available butter substitute in the U.S. that is based on virgin coconut oil. Phase 1 outcomes included validating baking fat product requirements for taste, texture, and oxidative stability, proof of concept study with adolescents, and final direction for prototype baking fat product refinement and product line expansion prior to commercialization. Phase II application seeks funding to address developmental and technical milestones: finalize and expand the baking fat innovation into a broader product line of saut &amp; eacute; blends; scope specifications for packaging format of bake and saut &amp; eacute; products; source raw materials; initiate shelf life studies for defining &quot;Best By&quot; date; confirm oxidative stability studies of bake and saut &amp; eacute; line extensions with expanded analysis; optimize shelf life and oxidative stability; and conduct expanded clinical study on EE in overweight and obese adolescents, building on the pilot study that provided initial indications of the innovation &amp; #39;s effectiveness in raising EE in overweight and obese adolescents.",

        "abstract": "Convincing scientific evidence provides the association between dietary choices and chronic disease expression. Dietary guidelines now in place are designed to prevent the onset of such chronic diseases as tissue-specific cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and osteoporosis. The cornerstone of recommended dietary guidelines is increased consumption of fruits and vegetables. Current USDA dietary guidelines recommend eating 7-9 servings of fruits and vegetables per day. However, average adult consumption in the United States is only 4.4 servings per day, with an estimated 42% of Americans eating &amp; lt; 2 daily servings for fruits and vegetables. Consumption of vegetables provides the human diet with many essential vitamins and minerals important for health maintenance. Vegetables also contain secondary metabolite phytochemicals, which provide benefits beyond normal health maintenance and nutrition and play active roles in chronic disease reductions. If these beneficial compounds could be significantly increased in fresh fruits and vegetables through environmental manipulation, these &quot;functional foods&quot; could have a significant benefit to human health and well being. The objectives of the plant-based research projects will be to use the unique characteristics of LEDs to investigate the impact of various lighting parameters on the concentrations of: (1) nutritionally important carotenoid pigments; (2) organoleptic quality factors including glucosinolates; (3) mineral nutrient concentrations important in human nutrition; and (4) antioxidant compounds; in brassica and other leafy specialty crops, herbs, and tomatoes. These crops are high value, commercially important, and will serve as model systems to refine our hypotheses on the impacts of the use of LED systems as supplemental light in commercial protected culture systems. Results from Phase 1 established that specific wavelength LEDs have a positive impact on several plant metabolites (carotenoids, glucosinolates, minerals such as Ca) of importance in human nutrition.

        "abstract": "Obesity is a growing epidemic that threatens the health of both adults and children. The problem is exacerbated by challenging economic times and increasing food costs that put pressure on consumers to purchase lower priced meals, which may be of inferior nutritional value and/or contain excessive proportions of animal fat. Whereas many ingredients can lower fat and calorie contents of foods, their use is limited because, compared with full-fat, full-calorie alternatives (i) they are of limited nutritional value; (ii) their eating properties are inferior, and (iii) they cost more. Therefore, there is an urgent need for fat replacement food ingredients that are (i) more nutritious; (ii) have improved eating properties; and (iii) cost less. Fiberstar Bio &amp; #39;s platform technology extracts fibers from surplus natural plant materials in an innovative method that allows the fibrous material to rehydrate readily, a unique property that is key to replacing the favorable eating properties conferred by fats. The innovative technology was used in developing the Citri-Fi &amp; reg; line of food ingredients, introduced in 2004. Citri-Fi is a line of unique, multi-functional fibers derived from orange pulp. Citri-Fi tightly binds moisture to improve quality and yields; partially replacing oil, fat, eggs and meat to reduce costs; and replacing less label-friendly ingredients to improve label declarations. However, Citri-Fi &amp; reg; requires orange pulp (the material left over from orange juice manufacture) as its input raw material, and the continued use of Citri-Fi &amp; reg; is quickly exhausting the available supply of orange pulp. Moreover, only ~50% of fat can be replaced by Citri-Fi &amp; reg;--above this level, eating properties of several foods is diminished. In this SBIR Phase I project, we successfully tested alternative sources of raw material, and modified the manufacturing process at laboratory scale, in order to begin to address the raw material supply challenge we are facing with Citri-Fi &amp; reg;, and to determine whether alternatives may be able to replace more than 50% of the fats normally present in popular foods. We identified several promising alternative fibrous raw materials (sugar beet pulp, citrus peel, inner segment membranes from citrus fruit, and potato fiber), and in this SBIR Phase II application, we now propose to identify an optimum raw material and process for a new fat substitute. Briefly, we propose (i) to expand processes developed in Phase I from laboratory to pilot plant scale; (ii) to test whether the products made at pilot scale match the properties of the same products made at lab scale; (iii) to incorporate the products into several different foods and perform compositional, stability, and functionality testing to assess their performance in end products; (iv) to carry out preliminary process engineering work and develop economic models; (v) to rank the raw materials for their commercial potential; (vi) to confirm the raw material &amp; #39;s long-term availability; then, based on these prior steps, (vii) select the one best raw material for subsequent steps to prepare for commercialization; (viii) carry out testing and prepare documents to ensure the material meets the criteria for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status; (ix) prepare documentation for customer usage; and (x) send samples of the new fat substitute to selected customers and elicit their feedback.",

        "abstract": "Medigen successfully designed and tested a conceptually novel VLP design as a vaccine for avian influenza (AI). This vaccine isnot dependent on egg production and allows protection against multiple AI viruses by using a single preparation of VLP vaccine. For example, we demonstrated that co-expression of H5, H7, and H9 HA proteins along with other influenza proteins resulted in a triple-HA H5/H7/H9 VLP that contained HA proteins derived from three distinct AI viruses. We showed that such triple-HA VLPs without adjuvant elicited protection of laboratory animals (ferrets) against multiple AI strains, when administered through the respiratory route. Here we propose immunogenicity and efficacy testing of triple-HA VLPs in poultry species as a broadly protectiveAI vaccine. Protection against multiple AI challenges will be tested in HPAI and LPAI models including multiple strains of H5N1 virus. If successful, this technology may allow rapid preparation of cost-effective and highly effective polyvalent poultry vaccines against AI.",

        "abstract": "Johne &amp; #39;s disease (JD) or paratuberculosis in animals (infection with M. avium ss. paratuberculosis, M. ap) is a contagious, chronic, and potentially fatal disease affecting the small intestine of ruminants. All ruminants are susceptible, but the largest economic impact is felt in dairy farming, where infected cattle suffer from chronic diarrhea, weight loss, low milk yield and low (but persistent) mortality. Estimated annual losses to U.S. dairy farms range up to $500M. Evidence indicates a link between JD in dairy herds and Crohn &amp; #39;s disease in humans. Currently, no feasible antibiotic regimen or efficient control strategy exists to combat JD. It spreads through fecal shedding of M. ap by infected cattle. The current (killed) vaccine does not prevent shedding from vaccinated and infected animals;failing to control JD transmission within a herd. Because of these deficiencies, some farmers no longer use the vaccines, instead using a reactive test and cull strategy: diagnose JD infection and isolate affected cattle. However, the lack of reliable diagnostic tools to detect early stage JD means that farmers rely M. ap antibody development and shedding, which can occur two to four years after initial infection. In addition, whole organism vaccines can cause false positive antibody diagnostic tests. Thus, a diagnostic that can differentiate vaccinated from infected animals is important for any vaccine/monitoring strategy. An efficient vaccine and a reliable diagnostic assay together represent cornerstones of an effective control strategy for JD. These are the ultimate aims of this Phase II project. During the Phase I project (USDA-SBIR), we tested the performance of 2 live attenuated vaccine (LAV) candidates using a mouse paratuberculosis model. We deactivated key genes involved in M. ap &amp; #39;s virulence and persistence in our candidates. Our analysis showed initial replication and host colonization, followed by a significant decline to levels undetectable by culturing. However, the candidates generated robust cellular, humoral, and protective immune responses in a challenge. Compared to controls, vaccinated animals showed significantly lower M. ap tissue levels after challenge. Additionally, during Phase I, we also developed a proprietary LAMP-based assay that can differentiate infected and vaccinated animals. In Phase II of this project, we will evaluate the performance and safety of our candidates in ruminant (goat and calf) paratuberculosis models. Our specific goals for this project are to optimize the vaccine candidates for use in farm animals, evaluate their protective efficacy in ruminants (goats and young calves), and then characterize the candidates immune responses and environmental impact. LAV candidates will be compared to na &amp; iuml;ve controls and commercially-vaccinated animals. We will also evaluate our diagnostic assay to differentiate infected and vaccinated/infected animals. If this project is successful, we will have identified a very promising LAV vaccine candidate that will elicit a strong and consistent immune response while allowing for little tissue colonization and shedding. We will also have an efficient assay that can differentiate vaccinated animals from infected animals. This research will provide a basis for licensing, and commercialization of these necessary products. Once commercialized, these products will provide two vital components for the world-wide goal of controlling JD and limiting its economic impact. With more than 100 million head of cattle worldwide, the commercialization potential for these two products is enormous. In addition, this research lays a foundation for vaccination of other ruminants (sheep, goats, and camels) that are harmed by M. paratuberculosis.",

        "abstract": "\"In this program, we will develop a breakthrough technology that will enable wafer-scale epitaxial lift-off (ELO) of GaN power device heterostructures from low-dislocation-density bulk GaN substrates. This technology will be used to provide a low-cost vertical junction field effect transistors (VJFETs) with high breakdown voltage (greater than 1,200 V) and high current capability (greater than 100 A).   Despite the recent commercial success of GaN-based optical and electronic devices, the high dislocation density resulting from the use of mismatched substrates leads to fundamental performance, reliability, and thermal conductivity limitations in vertical power device applications. Bulk GaN substrates with low dislocation density (less than 10^5 cm-2) are under development in small diameters (1 inch - 2 inch) but at high cost.   MicroLink is an industry leader in the commercialization of ELO and in the reuse of GaAs and InP substrates for multi-junction solar cells. MicroLink is also a leading producer of GaAs VJFETs and HBTs. The proposed principal investigator carried out pioneering work on photoelectrochemical wet etching of GaN materials. We will leverage this expertise to develop a new ELO-based layer transfer technology using reusable bulk GaN templates for epitaxial growth to enable high quality GaN materials at dramatically lower cost. We will demonstrate the viability of this technology using a novel vertical junction FET device, which leverages our experience in producing GaAs VJFETs. We have assembled a team of world-class partners with expertise on GaN epitaxial growth, bulk GaN substrates, modeling,  power device design, and device testing.\n\"\n",
