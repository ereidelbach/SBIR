        "abstract": "60165       The Gulf Stream off the southeastern coast of Florida is a natural source of renewable energy that is ready for development using today\u00bfs technology.  Unlike other renewable sources, water flows 24 hours a day and can be counted on as a base source of electric power.   This project will utilize the Underwater Electric Kite, which has been tested in the Niagara River and is ready for ocean deployment.  A multi-discipline team has been assembled to determine the best location, taking the cost into consideration as well as such technical factors as:  (1) the anticipated water velocity and its tolerance in magnitude and direction, (2) detailed plans for cable and vessel design for the water velocity and the ocean environment, and (3) the electric design to bring the power to shore safely and reliably.  In Phase I, the Underwater Electric Kite was sized for the 180 cm/sec water flow and all power components were selected.  The cable and mooring technique was conceptually completed.  In Phase II, a detailed design of the Underwater Electric Kite will be completed and production drawings will be created.  A communication method between the shore and the vessel will be developed along with a maximum power tracking strategy.  Finally, a prototype ocean current power generator will be built and tested in Chesapeake Bay.              Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Present estimates show that a 10MW generator park can be built for $3.56 per watt.  This would have a factor of six advantage over photovoltaics: a two-to-one advantage in installation cost and a three to one advantage in running 24 hours per day instead of 8.  Once the prototype is operational, Florida utilities should be anxious to take advantage of a free fuel source of power that needs no real estate, can\u00bft be seen, can\u00bft be heard, can\u00bft be smelled, and is environmentally, ecologically, and economically attractive.",

However, their adoption is impaired by the lack of a robust, cost-effective fabrication process, principally because the autoclaves used to consolidate composite laminates are so expensive for large parts. This program develops for US aerospace companies the processing equipment that avoids the autoclave. In particular, this program will develop in situ deposition heads that can fit on aerospace company's existing placement machines so that air and spacecraft composites can be fabricated out of the autoclave.In phase I, the deposition head concept designs will be prepared and reviewed with leading aerospace industry contacts who we know from working with them on a multitude of non-autoclave processing programs in the past. There, we will get feedback for our head concept designs suitable for fabricating the thermoset and thermoplastic composite parts that they need.

These transmitters must be UAV flight deployable and operate efficiently at a high repetition rate and low pulse energy. Aculight proposes to address this need with a compositionally tuned garnet laser that operates directly at the wavelength of interest. This quasi-four level laser material requires a very bright pump source to operate efficiently at low pulse energies. Aculight's innovation is a revolutionary technique that when applied to diode bar can increase their output brightness by well over an order of magnitude. This will be the first demonstration of a solid state laser pumped using this technique and will lead to an entirely new class of laser systems. Coupling this with Aculight's advanced manufacturing techniques that allow lasers can be dropped from a height of three feet without effecting their performance and Aculight's extensive background in laser engineering will lead to a flight worthy water vapor DIAL transmitter in Phase II.",

Thermal issues in solid-state lasers have so farlimited the performance of these devices at long wavelengths.  By contrast gas lasers can provide power scalability, however these devices are typically large and require significant logistical support to deploy.Aculight proposes a new approach to address this problem through the use of a fiber laser based pump source in combination with an optically pumped molecular gas laser. This approach blends the best properties of diodes and fibers (efficient, compact,reliable) with the power handling capability of gas converters. The proposed approach is inherently scalable to very high average powers by combining the outputs from many smaller fiber-based pumps in the gas converter, and is electrically driven,simplifying deployment logistics.In Phase I Aculight conclusively demonstrated the viability of such a pump source generating, to our knowledge, the highest narrowband pulse output from a fiber-based system with energies in excess of 100 microJoules. In Phase II we will develop anddeliver a narrowband, pulsed, diode-pumped fiber system operating at 1.567microns utilizing Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA's)such as those employed in the telecommunications industry. This source will be used to demonstrate optical pumping of a COlaser which operates in the atmospheric transmission window at 4.7 microns.",

        "abstract": "In December 2000, EPA announced its intent to regulate the emission of mercury from coal-fired power plants. ADA Technologies, Inc., is developing a family of new disposable sorbents for this application. The sorbents consist of a natural silicate doped with chemicals to capture and immobilize vapor-phase mercury and mercury compounds. Laboratory testing in Phase I has shown the new materials to have two to three times the capacity for mercury compared to activated carbon, with projected costs lower than those for activated carbon. In Phase II, a reproducible preparation process that can be scaled to mass production will be developed. Additional laboratory tests will be run to characterize the relative mercury removal performances of the several candidate dopant chemicals. Once the optimum formulation has been identified, a test will be run in which sorbent is injected into the exhaust gas from a pilot coal combustor. The project team includes an architect/engineering firm and a major supplier of the natural silicate raw material. One project team member has committed to a cash investment to secure Option funding for Phase II, when prototype sorbent performance milestones are met. In the Option task, the project team will set up a pilot test system at an operating power plant, and will evaluate performance of the new sorbent on a slipstream of flue gas from the plant. A joint venture will be established in parallel with the Phase II project to commercialize the new sorbent. EPA is due to issue draft regulations for mercury control in 2003, and finalize them in 2004. By 2007, a total of 1,100 power plants in the United States will be required to control mercury emissions. Estimated control costs using activated carbon range from $2 billion to $5 billion annually, with carbon costs comprising well over $1 billion of that total. The high-performance ADA sorbent will be a drop-in replacement for activated carbon, with similar low capital equipment and installation costs. The joint-venture partners will bring experience in the utility industry, production of the raw material, and development of mercury control technologies to the new entity. The joint venture will market a mercury control solution to the utility industry - one that includes equipment, sorbent, and installation/startup elements. Additional applications for the new sorbent include replacement of activated carbon in municipal waste and medical waste incinerators, and in industrial processes where mercury control is an issue, such as precious metals production.",

        "abstract": "This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research proposal will develop porous dielectrics as a low-cost, large-area detector for high spatial resolution x-ray detection. An alternative to microchannel plates, porous dielectric electron amplifiers are formed by a thin layer, generally less than 1 mm, of a low density dielectric. The microscopic pores formed in such material, provide a natural, but miniaturized, dynode chain for electron amplification when an electric field is applied. An x-ray photon striking the material sets off an avalanche of electrons, creating 100,000 or more electrons per incident photon. However, the small size of the pores along with a preference for propagation in the direction of the electric field result in a limited spread of output electrons from the location of the incident photon. By coupling the porous dielectric to a high resolution anode, we will be able to achieve spatial resolutions of 30 microns or better. Porous dielectrics are easily deposited, which allows the construction of detectors with areas exceeding 100 cm2, at a fraction of the cost of microchannel plates. Phase I work will produce a laboratory area imager to demonstrate the technology, while Phase II will produce commercial prototype x-ray cameras and electron amplifiers.",

The thruster and tailored propellant blends developed during the course of this proposed program would eliminate the temperature-limiting catalyst beds that currently prevent the full realization of green monopropellant performance and impede wide-scale commercial and military replacement of toxic propellants. Adroit Systems, Inc. (ASI) and its industry partners propose to develop and implement a space propulsion system that would dramatically reduce the launch and operational costs of future satellites, bolstering US industrial competitiveness in the global marketplace. Benefits to the commercial spacecraft community include increased mission payloads, decreased procurement and launch costs, and improved mission reliability.",

The freeform fabrication also could create open porosity ranging from 100-2000 &#61549;m.  The results so far have demonstrated the capability to create low cost, in situ,metallic foams with oriented microstructures.  Since the extrusion is coupled with a freeform fabrication technique, the proposed technique can potentially yield geometrically complex metallic foam components directly from CAD files. This approach is notmaterial specific and could be used for a wide range of metals and alloys. Guidelines and procedures for optimizing the performance of metallic foams and a preliminary cost/economic analysis will be completed before the end of phase I program.

The production of future semiconductor and optoelectronic devices will depend critically on continued advances in process sensing and control. In present-day manufacturing, process yield and productivity are limited by the high sensitivity of layer properties to process conditions, and by an inability to control process conditions adequately throughout the process sequence. Current technology relies primarily on open-loop control using indirect sensor signals; a costly practice resulting in significant scrap and equipment downtime for preventative maintenance. To address this problem through improved closed loop control, this project will develop a high performance imaging radiometer with advanced thermographic and wafer mapping algorithms. Phase II includes hardware, software, and applications development that addresses important components of the sensor technology for monitoring blanket and patterned substrates. The sensor will provide near video-rate, spatially resolved whole wafer measurements of temperature and film properties from a model-based analysis of thermal radiance images. In-house testing on a rapid thermal processing tool and field testing on a MOCVD reactor will be performed.\n\nPotential commercial applications are anticipated in optimization and control of many advanced semiconductor fabrication processes such as rapid thermal processing (RTP), molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Improved whole wafer sensors have potential for significant increase in the number of process steps performed by RTP and thus increase the RTP as a generic process method.

In recent years, there has been exponential growth in time-lapse seismology project activity. These projects have yielded seismic difference anomalies that result from monitoring time-variant changes in the earth's subsurface related to fluid flow. However, such anomalies are often qualitative and ambiguous--what causes the anomalies, and what do they mean? The proposed Phase II research will enable the capability to make quantitative estimates of the 3D distribution of subsurface fluid pressure and fluid saturation changes that cause the seismic anomalies, using wave-equation seismic imaging and inversion techniques, coupled with rock physics analysis. The research consists of three parts: optimized parallel software and computational design, amplitude preserved seismic imaging and impedance inversion, and robust rock physics inversion to estimate pressure and saturation. The software and services generated by this Phase II research will be invaluable to help guide new wells and optimize reservoir management decisions in the 70+ oilfields world-wide that are being actively monitored with time-lapse seismic data.\nNear-term commercial applications of the proposed research include petroleum industry mapping and monitoring of commercial oil reserves, monitoring of costly injected fluids (water, steam, CO2, miscible gas), and imaging pressure compartmentalization and the leaking or sealing properties of faults and fractures. Non-petroleum applications may include monitoring groundwater reserves, near-surface monitoring of contaminant plumes and environmental clean-up projects. Potential far-market applications may include sub-sea acoustic imaging, synthetic aperture radar satellite imaging, and medical imaging",

        "abstract": "60143         Multicomponent shear-wave seismic data reveal information about subsurface lithologies and fluid properties that is difficult or impossible to obtain with compressional-wave data alone.  Although commercially available three-dimensional (3D), multicomponent simulations handle many aspects of the 3D behavior of shear waves in complex media, there are serious gaps.  In particular, steps to ensure vector fidelity, separation of P and S wave fields, and correlation between P- and S-wave events are often neglected; consequently, converted-wave imaging may not be performed as efficiently and accurately as required.   This project will develop new tools to fill the gaps in commercially available flow simulations for processing 3D multicomponent data.  Phase I investigated and prototyped four novel approaches:  (1) surface-consistent multicomponent amplitude balancing and vector fidelity, (2) vector wavefield separation, (3) prestack converted-wave imaging algorithm in both the time and depth domains on parallelized computer architectures, and (4) cross-correlation of P- and S-wave events and spatial adjustment of the converted-wave section in time or depth to conform to that of the P-wave section.  In Phase II, a 3D multicomponent processing package will be developed, integrating the tools developed in Phase I.   Phase II will include comprehensive testing of the individual processing algorithms using synthetic seismic data as well as field seismic data.                     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The novel methods described in this proposal should improve imaging of hydrocarbon reservoirs and thereby increase domestic oil and gas assets in those areas where multicomponent data have been acquired.  The multicomponent processing software can be marketed to major oil companies and smaller independents as well as to seismic contractors.",

A time-slicing technology is incorporated in each pixel of a two-dimensional array.  When a laser pulse returnsfrom one or more objects, a high-range-resolution 3-D image is produced from the captured data.  The ADLR concept is based upon state-of-the-art integrated circuits and image tube technology.  The concept is very innovative with enormous potential forincreasing performance above existing multiple-independent-channel, discrimination-ladar-receiver designs used for reentry vehicle and decoy discrimination.  Phase I test data shows the range resolution of the current-technology ADLR is 20cm.  The spatialresolution is, for practical purposes, limited only by chip size; 230 x 230 pixels are possible.  The Phase II ADLR will have at least twice the range resolution as the current technolgy.  Data is multiplexed off the ADLR sensor between laser pulses and sothe receiver is not limited by real-time, multiple-independent-channel processing.  A 12-bit digitizer can easily be used at the output of the sensor; whereas other real-time designs are limited to far fewer bits.  There are also substantial reductions inweight, size, power consumption and cost over conventional receiver approaches.  The most direct commercial application of a successful Phase II demonstration will be the incorporation of the ADLR technology in both atmospheric and underwater imagingsystems by at leaast two well-know companies.  Additional benefits include:a 3-D ladar, target-discrimination, missile or target seeker; a human or machine visual aid to see through net camouflage and fould weather; a 3-D, eye-safe, imaging system forcivilian aircraft and road vehicles; a 3-D streak camera.",

Mice       \n will become more important upon completion of the sequencing of the mouse          \n genome. In 1994, Advanced Targeting Systems commercialized 192-Saporin, a          \n reagent that causes death of cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF) neurons in the      \n rat. A major detriment to the reagent is its lack of activity in the mouse. In     \n our Phase I work, we created an agent that removes CBF neurons in the mouse        \n without affecting other neurons or systems. In Phase II, it is proposed to         \n characterize this lesioning agent and to demonstrate its usefulness as a           \n reagent for modeling and studying neurodegenerative diseases such as               \n Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a common, devastating neurodegenerative            \n disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Loss of cholinergic       \n innervation occurs frequently and severely in patients with AD. The degree of      \n cognitive decline has been correlated to the extent of cholinergic degeneration    \n in the neocortex and loss of cholinergic neurons from CBF.   \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nThe primary market for a mouse p75-Saporin immunotoxin includes scientists in both \nacademic and pharmaceutical laboratories who are involved in the study of Alzheimer's \ndisease (AD) and other disorders of the brain. These researchers are studying neuronal controls, behavior and/or treatments that affect a wide population suffering from \nAD. The new mouse-specific immunotxin described in this application will be key\n in the discovery process because the mouse is the only other mammal, besides \nhumans, scheduled for complete genetic sequencing. Another important asset \nof a mouse-specific research tool is the ability of the researcher to combine \ntheir use with transgenic models.",

This approach to cooling is not as effective as possible because heat must flow from the rotor and stator through the housing to the cooling media.  Because the housing must contain the coolant, it is also larger, heavier, and more expensive than necessary.  This project will develop a motor that uses a direct lamination cooling (DLC) system, passing coolant directly through the stator and eliminating the need for bulky housing, thereby improving heat transfer.  Motor size could be reduced by up to 30-40%, mass by up to 20-30%, and cost by up to 30%.  Phase I demonstrated that reliable lamination-to-lamination seals and reliable stack-to-manifold seals can be achieved using the methods identified.  The addition of the selected sealants adds only slightly to the thermal resistance and pressure drop compared with unsealed counterparts.  Phase II will build electric motors and inductors using the DLC method, obtain comparative performance data on the effectiveness of the method, and then obtain operational use data on these components through long term testing in a representative environment.  The long-term testing will ensure that real world aspects of motor and inductor operation (including vibration, temperature cycling , and the presence of electrical and magnetic fields) do not degrade the seals such that leaking occurs or that the thermal performance degrades.               Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The DLC method should reduce the cost and increase the power density and specific power of electric motors and inductors/transformers thereby increasing the market penetration for these systems",

        "abstract": "The specific innovation proposed is to design an advanced composite airframe panel for damage tolerance by incorporating biologic solutions to a similar problem found in nature, using a biomimetic approach. We will identify principal material (fiber) directions and density profiles about naturally occurring holes in bones through a microscopic and radiographic techniques. These holes are known to be damage tolerant, as they clinically do not represent a fracture or fatigue failure initiation site. In addition to its novel microstructure, bone is also a 2 fiber composite material, consisting of stiff bone mineral crystals embedded in a scaffold of compliant collagen fibers. We will demonstrate the expected low stress concentrations about the hole through mechanical testing and moir\u00bf interferometry. We will then incorporate these principal material directions and density and use a 2 fiber system in a computational model of a representative airframe panel. This model will be used to demonstrate the advantages of biomimetic design. We believe biomimetic design principles can be used to reduce aircraft weight, as bones are weight optimized due to the energy expenditure required to carry such a relatively heavy tissue. Furthermore, by increasing damage tolerance, life cycle costs of airframes can be reduced significantly.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase1 project will involve the development of a novel method of simultaneously measuring multiple trace chemical species in jet engine exhaust, based upon an extension of the technology of tunable diode laser (TDL) spectroscopy. We will develop and demonstrate a new means of combining the light from two or more diode lasers into a single analysis beam. This will enable a multiplication of the number of chemical species which are simultaneously measured. The type of beam multiplexing technique which we intend to investigate has not been previously demonstrated in a TDL system. This type of measurement system will serve the needs of quantifying aircraft exhaust in several ways. The simultaneous measurement of minor constituents and either CO2 or H2O allows the determination of an emission index for the minor species. A greater number of simultaneous concentration measurements allows a better understanding of the basic chemistry of the combustion process and will enable development of engine systems with reduced emissions. The proposed technology can enhance existing TDL systems, including two currently used by NASA in combustion emissions studies, and others in use in atmospheric applications.",

        "abstract": "60520         The atmospheric abundance of carbon dioxide and methane have increased dramatically during the industrial era.  Since these increases can perturb the global climate, it is vital to understand and quantify the factors controlling them.  This is difficult because CO2 and CH4 have a wide range of complex surface sources and sinks, which have both natural and anthropogenic components.  However, since the sources (and sinks) produce (and remove) the isotopic forms of these species at varying rates, atmospheric measurements of the isotopic composition of the carbon cycle gases provide a powerful tool for quantifying their sources and sinks.   Most measurements are currently performed with large, expensive mass spectrometers using complex and time consuming analytical methods.  This project will develop a compact, deployable, easy to use isotopic monitor using Tunable Infrared Laser Differential Absorption Spectroscopy (TILDAS).   During Phase I, a novel optical design was demonstrated for isotope measurements, and isotopic ratios with precisions as small as 0.2% were obtained with a very simple instrument.  The optical design compensates for the large difference in concentration between major and minor isotopes by measuring them with vastly differing path lengths within the same multipass cell.  An infrared difference frequency source was also designed, and it was shown that using a built-up cavity to produce the difference frequency radiation would increase output power by a factor of 40.   Phase II will design and build a prototype isotopic monitor for CO2 and CH4.   The infrared source will be produced using a build-up cavity to produce sufficient power and will be widely tunable in frequency.  The source will be integrated into a prototype isotopic monitor which employs the novel optical and signal processing methods.  Finally, standard isotopic gas samples will be tested to validate the instrument\u00bfs performance.                        Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The instrument should compete with existing mass spectrometric isotope instruments which are expensive, large, and relatively slow.  In addition, the infrared source should have application to the measurement of many other gas species and also should have wide application in atmospheric monitoring, industrial process control, and medical research.",

        "abstract": "60921       Although there are large uncertainties in the quantification of aerosol particles, they have important effects on visibility, acid deposition, climate, and human health.  Organic compounds, generated from energy related activities, are known to constitute a large fraction of the ambient aerosol mass in many locations.  The quantification of these compounds is hindered by the lack of real-time, size-resolved, quantitative instruments for the measurement of the chemical composition of organic aerosols.  Especially needed are instruments with the size, weight, ruggedness, and time resolution required aboard research aircraft.  This project will utilize an innovative aerosol mass spectrometer for size-resolved, quantitative chemical composition data on aerosol particles.  The instrument will be upgraded for aircraft deployment, and improvements in organic composition analysis, particle shape measurement, and particle counting will be added.  In Phase I, the response of the aerosol mass spectrometer to organic aerosols was demonstrated in two field campaigns and in laboratory experiments.  The analysis of organic aerosol data was improved and quantified.  An aerosol inlet for aircraft sampling was designed, and design specifications for an aircraft compatible instrument were completed.  In Phase II, the aircraft deployable aerosol mass spectrometer will be constructed, and the aerosol inlet will be built and tested.  Both will be installed on a Department of Energy research aircraft and tested.                   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Because of the breadth of species potentially accessible with mass spectrometry, an autonomous, light weight aerosol mass spectrometer instrument should provide aerosol measurement capabilities for atmospheric research, ambient pollution monitoring, chemical and biological warfare agent identification, and explosives/buried munitions detection.

Initial indications are that an accuracy of \u00bf 10 dB in transmission loss would be more than adequate to classifyeven the smallest of submarines. Since accuracy better than this has been achieved in the past, we believe this approach has a good possibility of succeeding with an integrated network of sensors.The proposed classification concept is that the sonobuoys would collect unclipped direct arrival information using attenuated hydrophones.  This information, along with other information characterizing potential contacts, would be transmitted to theaircraft at a low data rate. An aircraft based processor would then assemble all the data from the sonobuoy network, adaptively compute a global transmission loss model for the area, and classify contacts based on their consistency with the target strengthmodel.",

        "abstract": "The occurrence of causative agents such as Cryptosporidium parvum and other pathogens in water supplies presents a critical issue. Transmitted through water and animals, these organisms provide a reservoir of infection, which results in the excretion of the environmentally stable cysts or oocysts that are impervious to inactivation by many drinking water disinfectants. Cryptosporidium infections are particularly problematic for immuno-compromised individuals because drug therapy to control or eliminate this organism from a human host is not yet available. The method currently used for detection of these pathogenic microorganisms at the water source is not only laborious and time consuming, but often inefficient in accurately recovering and identifying waterborne pathogens. Various alternative technologies have been investigated; however, none to date have been able to provide the possibility of rapid, sensitive, and low-cost field testing. The use of nucleic acid based detection technologies, such as DNA probes, provides the greatest potential for highly specific and sensitive detection of potentially hazardous biological agents. The most promising approach to developing the ideal biosensor is microfabrication of identification systems that mimic diagnostic schemes utilized in microbiology laboratories to detect and identify specific microbial agents. Although there is much activity in this area, most efforts suffer from the inability to properly marry microfabrication technology with the molecular biology required for sensitive and specific detection.",

What is needed is an electromagnetic hardening technology that is lightweight yet offers high shielding effectiveness and can be integrated into the system design, is low-cost,field-expedient, and transparent to the user.  Transient liquid phase sintered (TLPS) conductive inks, now emerging as a low-cost approach to fabrication of printed wire boards, will fit all of these requirements if low-cost application methods, reducedsure/sinter temperatures and improved electromagnetic shielding properties can be achieved.  TLPS inks comprise a combination of polymers and metal powders that fuse together at low temperatures to form a continuous metallic layer that bonds to commonsubstrate materials.  The objective of this proposed efforts is to develop a spray-applied electromagnetic paint-shield with superior shielding effectiveness that sinters and cures at temperature well below those of current TLPS inks.  This conductivepaint will allow low-cost shielding to be applied to just about any electronic device.  The emergence of high-speed-information products is creating a need for new EMI shielding technologies that can be incorporated as part of the design of the tinypackages now emerging.

Currently available superconducting materials are either unable to reach these levels (NbTi) or they are much too expensive (Nb3Sn, Nb3Al and HiTcSC).  This project addresses the design and manufacture of Nb3Sn superconducting wire that holds promise for both better performance (3000 A/mm2 at 4.2K and 12T) and lower cost ($1.50/kA-m at 4.2K and 12T).  The proposed architecture is a hybrid that includes features from both the Modified Jelly Roll (MJR) and Tin Infiltrated Niobium Sponge (TINS) methods.  The niobium will be in the form of an expanded sheet, like the MJR, but the tin will be distributed uniformly across the cross-section, like TINS.  This approach substantially increases the amount of niobium in the non-copper cross-section and will increase the amount of Nb3Sn in the completed conductor, which leads to an increased Jc value.  Phase I demonstrated that the Modified Jelly Roll/Distributed Tin (MJR/DT) structure can be extruded, under certain circumstances.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms        \n (SNPs) are the most frequent DNA sequence variations that affect human health,     \n and better methods for scoring known SNPs in the human population are needed.      \n This SBIR project is designed to develop a sensitive, high-throughput,             \n efficient and affordable method of scoring known SNPs. Phase I work and            \n subsequent interim efforts have clearly established the feasibility of our         \n approach. The overall project goal is to develop an advanced electrochemical,      \n peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe-based array system that can rapidly and           \n reliably measure SNPs. The electrochemical arrays will be developed within the     \n standard microtiter plate format, allowing researchers the ability to adapt        \n their existing automation instrumentation to this more-efficient                   \n electrochemical platform.                                                          \n                                                                                    \n This expanded, 3-year Phase II project will lead to 1) development of specific     \n PNA-based electrochemical sensor assays for the identification/quantification      \n of known SNP sequences; 2) design/fabrication of innovative sensor arrays and      \n appropriate array-reader instrumentation for high-throughput, accurate,            \n easy-to-use, and inexpensive SNPs scoring in human genomic samples; and 3)         \n demonstration, through collaborative studies, of the utility of this approach      \n to SNPs scoring for use by researchers and clinicians.\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nThe new SNP  scoring system proposed here is rounded on a versatile, automated chip-based system for probe analysis of DNA or RNA. It will serve as a companion instrument to PCR as well as a new tool for direct nucleic acid analysis. The laboratory market for PCR is currently $300 million per year. Our PCR related system would represent a significant new, complementary product in this marketplace. Furthermore, as the clinical market matures, we anticipate a range of diagnostic applications that will increase the opportunities for the instrument.",

Unfortunately, the scintillator is often the limiting technology that impedes product development and adds substantial cost.  Many materials have been tried, but few can deliver both qualities.  The two approaches are (1) making small incremental improvements in common scintillators or (2) studying new materials that offer greater potential.  This project addresses the second route and will examine rubidium gadolinium bromide (RGB) as a versatile gamma ray and neutron sensitive detector material for a variety of scientific, industrial, and medical applications.  In Phase I, several ingots of RGB were grown with differing concentrations of an activator (to stimulate light output).  Single crystals, far larger than previously reported, were produced and analyzed as detectors.  Both speed and light output were exemplary, with several high quality spectra recorded.  The Phase II goals for producing RGB will be to increase scintillator size and optimize activator concentration.  Following processing, the scintillator will be evaluated as both a gamma ray and a neutron detector.                           Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: As a gamma ray scintillator, RGB would find use in nuclear and radiological physics as an alternative to NaI or similar scintillators where large volumes and fast timing requirements are needed.

In this band, a wealth of astrophysical processes occur in an even greater diversity of astrophysical objects and phenomena, both on a compact and diffuse scale. Surprisingly, for such a pivotal region of the spectrum, the high energy sky is still quite unexplored in that the number of sources detected is still too small to allow a comprehensive study of the various phenomena involved. An instrument used for planetary scientific investigations is an X-ray/ gamma-ray spectrometer; it must be lightweight, stable, reliable, rugged, and long-lived. Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc. (RMD) proposes to develop an innovative detector with a matrix of CsI(Tl) scintillators coupled to an array of avalanche photodiodes (APDs). Such a detector can be integrated into an imaging spectrometer to achieve improved angular resolution using a shadow-casting technique with the use of one or two-coded apertures. The improved angular resolution in the hard X-ray and gamma-ray regime will enable the studying of spatial and temporal development of solar flares, repeating gamma-ray bursters, and hard X-ray transients.",

Fiber optic tracking is a potentially simpler and less expensive method for large volume detectors that use conventional photomultiplier tubes coupled to scintillators.  The key technology that needs to be linked to these trackers is a compact, high density photodetector that can provide sufficient readout of low light signals.   This project will adapt a benchmark avalanche photodiode (APD) technology to the precise requirements found only in high energy physics.  To accomplish this, small, sub-millimeter pixilated arrays must be fabricated, radiation hardness must be improved, lower noise thresholds must be reached, and quantum efficiency must be maximized.  The planar processed APD arrays produced in Phase I met or exceeded all expectations.  Multielement APD arrays with small pixels (< 1mm2) were couple to fibers and evaluated for gain, noise, cross-talk, and detection efficiency.   Crucial tests of radiation hardness validated that the arrays can withstand fluences of 1012 n/cm2 without degradation.  Phase II will produce larger arrays, integrate packaging, continue the evaluation of radiation hardness, and add pulse processing electronics.  A prototype system to more fully demonstrate the technology will be designed.                         Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Combined fiber optic/APD detectors will largely remain in the realm of high energy physics, but many more applications are available for the APD arrays themselves.  As radiation detectors (and combined with scintillators), position sensitive APDs should find use in other scientific disciplines and in medical imaging.  As purely optical detectors, the low light levels that APDs can record make them an attractive alternative to photomultiplier tubes in a whole host of photonic devices (LIDAR, LADAR, spectrometers, etc.)",

This planner will intelligently guide the user through plan synthesis by filtering out inconsistent planning options.  Bytransforming partial plans into a dynamic constraint network, based on our constraint-based interval representation of the problem domain, the software can reason about temporal and metric resource constraints during continually evolving plan development.We will use path-consistency algorithms on the constraint network to detect flawed partial plans, and heuristically propose possible repairs and alternate plans.",

Heterogeneous components can be encapsulated so that they can inter-operate through a set of common APIs and a shared definitionof a common domain of interest. The resulting system, called the Java Trans-Knowledge Toolkit (jTKT), will build upon, extend, and will be interoperable with the existing Adaptive Sensor Fusion (ASF) architecture by incorporating Java based technologies.The jTKT system will be fully interoperable with ASF. We will extend the persistence capabilities of the combined jTKT/ASF system with: a) Support for an effective query mechanism for generic transport data b) Support for commercial relational databases c)Use of JavaSpacesT technology as a distributed persistence mechanism. Furthermore, we propose to implement the ASF publish/subscribe mechanism in terms of both JavaSpacesT and CORBA along with appropriate performance metrics to quantify system performance.In addition, jTKT will have the capability to seamlessly integrate with the Internet for data access and system control. The overall goal of this SBIR is to make the system more widely applicable by supporting multiple persistence and communicationsstrategies and to make further substantial progress toward the JBI vision.",

The main detection principle is based on new sensing approach employing thinfilms of molecular aggregates and the effect of energy migration for amplification of the fluorescence reponse signal.  In Phase I of this project we studied the luminescence compounds and demonstrated that thin films of porphyrin based aggregates exhibitquite specific signal response to different kinds of target molecules.  It has been found that energy migration in the aggregate films provides additional signal amplification due to antenna effect and increases sensitvity to the analyte vapors.  These newfings can considerably improve the sensor performance.  Since the tested material exhibits high selectivity to the  analyte vapors and the proposed new detecting scheme provides the possibilty of simultaneous processing of several parameters, the sensorarray may contain only a few sensing elements.  This simplifies the entire system and makes it very cost efficient.  In Phase II of the project a prototype sensor system will be designed, assembled, optimized and field tested with final product deliveredto DoD.  The inherent flexibilty of the sensor array allows simple reorienting and tuning its sensing functions to different groups of VOC or toxic gases including such important chemical warfare agents as Sarin, Soman and others.  The fiber opticalimplementaion of the sensor system is important for remote control the large contaminated areas without any risk for operating personnel.

In Phase I of the project we investigated such semiconductor materials asGaAs and InP, and demonstrated that the process of modification changes chemical composition in the near-surface region of the material and eventually creates nanoclusters (quantum dots) in the semiconductor dramatically changing its electromagneticproperties, refractive index and adjusting bandgap.  In phase II of the project the demonstrated modification technology will be optimized and applied to fabrication of basic semiconductor-based components critical for monolithic integration ofoptoelectronic device.  The large index change can be employed for fabrication of a broad class of semiconductor-based active or passive components using simple direct laser beam writing.  These components include relief-free waveguide structures,micoresonators, diffractive grating and diffractive optical elements with high index contrast.  The grating having period of the order of wavelength and sufficiently large index contrast may exhibit photonic bandgap structure, resulting in new photoniccrystals with unique properties.  In addition to immediate military applications, the proposed technology is an excellent candidate for fabrication of different photonic and diffractive optical products in several markets, including: opticalcommunicaitons, WDM and signal processing, diffractive grating, computer generated holograms, spatial light modulators, diode lasers, photonic bandgap structures, thin film photvoltaic devices, etc.",

Dramatic improvements in electronics technology have rendered many prior SEU solutions ineffective and have created theneed for more advanced and innovative design tools.  One of the more promising SEU solutions has been triple modular redundancy (TMR), where each processing and control circuit path is tripled and voted, such that when the outputs of the three circuitpaths are not the same, assuming single failure, the odd circuit is disregarded.  Through an algorithmic approach, the same results can be obtained with single circuits by reusing idle clock cycles.  Such an approach is far more economical, and morereliable, became there is no need to triple the circuit.  Except for a small increase in area and power, a radiation hardened circuit can be produced for the same cost, area and power as a non rad-hard commercial component.  The feasibility of developing atool named ART (Automatic Reconfiguration Tool) to create Virtual Redundancy in circuits was proven during Phase I, which included a demonstration at Space and Missile Defense Command in Huntsville, Alabama on September 12, 2000.  Improve reliability andradiation tolerance of electronic devices efficiently through automated circuit reconfiguration in design phase.  Specifically, the program will create a tool able to modify a completed design to add tolerance even to Single Event Upsets(SEU), theradiation effect which eludes most hardening techniques.

In Phase I we made a significant step towards addressing this    \n central issue by successfully demonstrating a novel ceramic material with          \n superior mechanical properties. An enhancement of 50 percent in fracture           \n toughness, 50 percent in weibull modulus and significant damage resistance over    \n conventional ceramics was demonstrated.

Furthermore, we have been able to adpat the       \n ceramics for articulation with CoCr. From a bio-compatibility aspect, no           \n adverse effects are expected in-vivo. Early wear performance results of            \n head/cup components made from these ceramics also clearly show the ultra low       \n wear characteristics, with wear volumes 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than         \n present CoCr-PE.

This technology is based on the Laser Dynamic Range Imager (LDRI) and a cross-plane point tracking algorithm. The LDRI provides the range measurement from the laser unit to the field of view for far or near inspection distances. The LDRI is a dynamic adaptation of the Scannerless Range Imager (SRI) technology developed for the USAF by DOE/Sandia National Laboratories. The Point Tracking (PT) software package is an improvement of the tracker algorithm initially proposed at Langley Research Center and later developed at Johnson Space Center. The advantage of this technology over the conventional photogrammetric methods resides in the feasibility in obtaining, simultaneously, the 3-D motion of multiple points without the necessity of using multiple cameras. Other advantages of this technology are the improvement in the resolution of the position of a point and the elimination of special illuminating conditions in the scene. This proposal will provide a software package for automated docking.

        "abstract": "This Phase II project addresses the development of technology that would provide field-based quantitative detection of a wide range of environmental contaminants through the use of molecularly imprinted polymers and fluorescence detection. The proposed method would complement immunological methods of analysis that have been adapted to contaminants such as herbicides and pesticides. The well-documented advantages of these methods, including high sensitivity and selectivity and fairly low cost per analysis, are offset by a number of disadvantages. Antibodies have somewhat limited physical and chemical durability and cannot be used at elevated temperatures, beyond a fairly restricted pH range or in nonaqueous environments. In the Phase I program, American Research Corporation of Virginia developed a compact displacement flow sensor utilizing molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) technology and diode laser-excited near-infrared fluorescence detection. In the Phase II program, work will be performed to optimize and field test the MIP sensor. The innovation of the Phase II program is the development and use of a new generation of biomimetic MIP to provide analyte selectivity and down-stream near-infrared fluorescence as a sensitive means of detection. Phase II also will address the selectivity of the MIP system. The Phase I results have shown that MIP specific for atrazine and 2,4-D can be conveniently prepared and processed. Methods were developed to fabricate rapidly interchangeable cartridges. A low-cost diode-laser based fluorimeter was developed and shown to be capable of extremely low detection limits and very stable operation. Synthetic strategies for preparing fluorophore labeled analyte molecules were developed. The Phase II technical objectives include the preparation of MIP and competition reagents and development of assay methodology optimized for environmental analysis, and fabrication extensive testing of the sensor system.",

Their presence in large numbers can have a detrimental impact on land development and tourism. In addition, these insects are the vector of bluetongue, an arbovirus which is transmitted in cattle and sheep during repeated blood-feeding by biting flies. Our approach is to identify attractants used by Culicoides locate potential vertebrate hosts. In Phase I of this grant, we identified and characterized the carbon dioxide receptor neuron found in sensilla on the maxillary palps of this insect. However, these maxillary palps sensilla were not sensitive to any other chemical tested. Therefore, in Phase II, we will continue these electrophysiological studies on the antenna. We expect to locate neurons sensitive to other chemical attractants. Concurrent with these studies, we propose a series of field test aimed at determining what signals Culicoides use to orient to host. Such studies will lead to the development of an effective trap for Culicoides and should be useful for control of this economically- important pest species.",

Requirements exist for a smaller, less expensive, and more covert SAR system. ZAI/Amelex has introduced a new SAR waveform and systemwhich is very small, light weight, and low power. Recent experiments have demonstrated excellent resolution (~1.0 inch) while simultaneously reducing the energy required for SAR imagery by -30 dB for Low Probability of Intercept (LPI). This SBIR proposalhas two primary Navy goals: 1) Validate the LPI SAR imaging waveform, and 2) Focus the development for transition to P-3 missions in a follow-on program. The Phase II prototype will be designed to demonstrate and validate SAR imagery with an initial designgoal of 2-3 KM. The Phase II effort will then focus on the design of scalable modules for the power supply, power amplifier, and antenna array for an increased range capability of 20+ nm for possible implementation into a P-3C upgrade. A Transition Programwould then take the approach identified as a starting point for final development, test, and evaluation of an extended range version of the LPI SAR, suitable for application to covert P-3 Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missionsrequiring all-weather high resolution.",

The lack of such a method is an impediment to the commercialization of TPV and reflective concentration systems.   This project will use multi-layer substrates to imbed protective diodes underneath the PV cells so that precious module aperture area is not used.  Additionally, PV cell reconfiguration will maximize the potential for dense packing.  Phase I proved the viability of the dense cell packing concept as well as the concept of burying protective diodes into the dense cell array substrate.  Computer analysis identified three potential substrate candidates.  Phase II will take these three candidates to the prototype level.  Performance, manufacturability, reliability, and cost analysis will be performed, and a successful substrate configuration will be chosen.  All production processes, tooling, and equipment will be developed and implemented.

However, fusion has been ten years away for forty years. We have an available solution that combines new technology with an old concept \u00bf \u00bfProject Orion\u00bf. The proposed MagOrion Propulsion System combines a magnetic sail (MagSail) with conventional small yield (0.5 to 1.0 kiloton) shaped nuclear fission devices. At detonation, roughly eighty percent of the yield appears as a highly-ionized plasma, and when detonated two kilometers behind a robust MagSail, approximately half of this plasma can be stopped and turned into thrust. A MagOrion can provide a system acceleration of one or more gravities with effective specific impulses ranging from 15,000 to 45,000 seconds. Dana Andrews and Robert Zubrin published a paper in 1997 that described the operating principles of the MagOrion. We have taken that concept through conceptual design to identify the major operational features and risks. During Phase I of the SBIR, we will quantify the system risks and establish either solutions or areas for risk mitigating demonstrations. The risks are considerable, but the potential payoff is staggering. Our proposed MagOrion will enable affordable exploration of the solar system.",

In December 2000, EPA announced that it would regulate mercury emissions from coal-fired boilers under Title III of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. EPA plans to issue final regulations by December 2004, and is expected to require compliance by December 2007. The Department of Energy estimates that control of mercury emissions from coal-fired utility boilers will cost billions of dollars annually. Prior to installing a mercury control system, improved measurements of mercury emissions would allow EPA and the utility to make better decisions concerning control options. Real-time continuous monitoring of mercury would provide options for advanced process control feedback and for monitoring the performance of the control system, thus lowering the cost of mercury controls. Although a few mercury analyzers show promise for measuring elemental mercury, a reliable sampling system that allows these analyzers to measure total (particulate, vapor-phase) and speciated mercury continuously and in real time in the flue gas of coal-fired boilers is needed.

Advance optical coupling techniques developed at Apollo Instruments will provide the basis forconstruction of the system.  The laser system will be high compact, simple, and low in cost.  The success of the program will eliminate a major obstacle in current fiber laser development.  The enabling technology will also benefit telecommunication,medical laser laser material processing, diode pumped solid-state lasers, and high power laser beam transmission.  One of the main guidelines in the system design is to develop a high perfromance fiber coupled laser diode product that system is easy torealize, simple to use, and inexpensive to build.",

Unique software toolsets will be employed for complete design and evaluation of the antenna array directly on the UAV installation. These simulations will be validatedwith measured data at higher frequencies to establish a baseline for the proposed design tools that incorporate element to element coupling as well as substructure coupling. At the lower HF/VHF frequencies, these simulations will be used to design thearray and establish reference AoA vs Phase curves that account for platform interactions and possible non-planar installations of the array. Designs that cover the entire band of interest are proposed accounting for the necessity of using multiple arrayconfigurations over the different bands.",

Hall and ion thrusters are two types of electric propulsion systems that are commonly used on earth-orbiting spacecraft and very recently on interplanetary probes. These propulsion systems use hollow cathodes to thermionically emit electrons that are used for propellant ionization and ion beam neutralization. These cathodes require propellants and heaters that place lower limits on their size and power scalability and efficiency. Field emission cathodes compatible with electric propulsion systems will fill voids in electric propulsion technology that are needed for deep-space microspacecraft applications. Other field emission electron sources such as metal microtip cathodes are unstable and strongly susceptible to damage in the thruster ion environment. Preliminary tests on carbon film cathodes show them to be much more robust. We propose to demonstrate the feasibility of using carbon cathodes in electric propulsion systems for microspacecraft applications.",

These devices have one or more disadvantages, including high cost, limited lifetime, large expense for maintenance and/or replacement, and complexity of mounting, cooling and triggering.  This project will develop a modular switch design that uses thyristors capable of high di/dt without saturable inductors; uses a portion of the energy that is being switched to drive the gates, simplifying isolation and triggering; is easy to mount and cool; and will result in an economical switch.  In Phase I, an experimental switch module was developed and tested.  It was  shown that a 10 kV module can operate reliably at >8kA, at di/dt\u00bfs >30 kA/\u00bfs, for a 3 \u00bfs pulse.  Operation of 3 modules in series at 30 kV with similar current pulses showing simultaneous turn-on and good voltage sharing between modules was demonstrated.   In Phase II, a prototype 10 kV module will be developed and tested at high power with emphasis on thermal design and packaging to maximize its power handling capability while minimizing thermal fatigue.  This module will be used as the basis of a compact 50kV prototype switch that will be developed, tested and delivered to the Department of Energy.  This switch can be used to replace thyratrons in existing systems.

        "abstract": "Next generation design software will support fully associative geometric and physics-based analysis models throughout the entire product life-cycle. Most current CAD systems directly support finite element systems, but use proprietary database formats that do not promote diverse tool use and may not exist throughout the entire product life-cycle. Model sharing in common practice has been limited to exchanging model instances (without parametric information) via data interchange files (e.g., STEP) or data translation software interfaces (e.g., Parametric Technology's Associative Topology Bus). This approach makes parallel, multi-corporation design inefficient. Additionally, although CAD systems support finite element analysis, this capability usually does not support coupled multidisciplinary, multiple level-of-fidelity analysis models, and so significant effort is expended preparing models for analysis. Software integration packages such as Engineous' iSIGHT and Phoenix Integration's Model Center provide intuitive tools for automating analysis by linking legacy codes together, but do not simplify the development of the analysis model itself. Alternative solutions such as TechnoSoft's AML are more flexible, but require an object-oriented software developer to generate source code for each model. This research will develop a lightweight, platform-neutral analysis model bus (AMB) that exploits Internet data modeling and collaboration technologies to make possible the widespread, distributed storage of and collaborative access to diverse analysis models.",

Despite these unique features, the high cost of fuel cells compared with competing technologies has prevented commercial introduction.  One of the key factors that increases fuel cell power plant cost and complexity is the typically poor fuel flexibility, i.e. fuel cells generally operate only on hydrogen.   This project will demonstrate technology to allow low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) to operate directly and efficiently on hydrocarbon fuels including natural gas, propane, and gasoline.  Phase I developed new anode materials that effectively oxidize hydrocarbons at fuel cell operating temperatures ranging from 500-800\u00bfC.   Specifically, different anodes were found to be most suitable for use with the different fuels studied; i.e., methane and propane.  The new anodes were successfully demonstrated in single fuel cells.   Phase II will demonstrate a simple SOFC stack that directly utilizes a range of hydrocarbon fuels.  The low-cost fabrication methods developed in Phase I will be scaled up to make large-area, thin-electrolyte SOFCs, and a novel stack design will be implemented.   Long term cell stability and susceptibility to sulfur contamination will be addressed, and anode compositions will be refined to optimize performance.                   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The technology should impact the commercialization of fuel cells, currently being developed for medium-scale generation applications, by simplifying the system and reducing costs.

H.323 is expected to be one of the predominant terminal standards forimplementing such applications over the Army's integrated services networks of the future. The major technical challenges that must be addressed to enable the deployment of battlefield multimedia applications over such networks are: 1) ability toefficiently integrate with existing multimedia terminals on circuit switched networks 2) development of end-to-end security mechanisms for multimedia streams, (from SBU through Top Secret levels) over integrated networks and 3) the development ofmechanisms for bandwidth-efficient transport of real-time multimedia (video, audio, data) streams with predefined QoS requirements over bandwidth-constrained IP backbone network. The Phase I SBIR effort successfully designed and established the feasibilityof building programmable distributed gateway architecture, called SAINCaP (Secure Architecture for Integrated Circuit and Packet Switching Applications), to address these requirements. SAINCaP is a highly adaptable architecture that is designed toaccommodate technology evolution. The Phase II effort will build a functioning prototype of SAINCaP.

The device will detect changes in the              \n composition and micro-architectural properties of bone by measuring the            \n ultrasound velocity, attenuation, spectral, and non-linear acoustic (NLA)          \n parameters of bone at multiple sites along the skeleton with varied proportion     \n of spongy and compact bone components. The manual scanning probe operating in      \n surface pulse transmission mode will be used to obtain ultrasonic profiles in      \n tested skeletal area. The diagnostic potential of NLA spectroscopy as a novel      \n method for detecting the accumulation of microdamage in living bone will be        \n evaluated. The feasibility of the proposed methods and devices has been proven     \n in laboratory model studies and in pilot clinical trials. In Phase II of the       \n project designed during Phase I will be developed into a fully functional and      \n compact bone ultrasonometer with the manual scanning and NLA modes of              \n operation, and clinically tested. Indexes of bone quality composed of several      \n ultrasonic parameters will be developed for differential diagnostics of            \n osteoporosis and mixed osteopenia.                                                 \n PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:\n Early evaluation and monitoring of osteoporosis is imperative for timely and effective\n treatment of the disease. According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation [1998 Report]\n the current economic burden associated with osteoporosis-related fractures is estimated\n at about $13.8 billion annually.  There is an urgent need for advancement of the existing\n diagnostic techniques.

        "abstract": "Various planned NASA missions depend on the availability of reliable and efficient coolers that achieve temperatures below 6K. These coolers are needed as the upper stage for lower temperature coolers such as dilution refrigerators or adiabatic demagnetization refrigerators. Astronomical missions utilize such low temperatures to enhance infrared detector sensitivity and to cool optics. Low temperature cryocoolers form an indispensable part of astronomical missions which require long-term cooling of detectors (e.g. bolometers). Without active coolers the duration of cryogenic missions is limited by the size of the cryogen that can be incorporated in the respective space missions.A pulse tube cooler (PTC) driven by a long-life linear compressor embodies the high reliability and low vibration required in space missions. The absence of cold moving parts reduces wear and vibration and increases reliability which makes PTCs ultimately suited for space. Single-stage PTCs, driven by linear compressors and with a porous, stainless steel regenerator matrix, have achieved no-load temperatures below 50K. To provide cooling at lower temperatures the PTC requires additional stages with regenerators made from high heat capacity materials. The innovation we propose involves development of a multistage PTC driven by a linear compressor that achieves temperatures below 6K.",

        "abstract": "Superconducting generators and RF magnets will be the leading technologies for high electrical power systems on aircraft, spacecraft and ground based systems in future DoD applications.  These systems employ High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) materialsoperating at cryogenic temperatures.  Future HTS systems will employ Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide (YBCO) which requires cooling near 65K.  At present, the more mature HTS conductor Bismuth Strontium Calcium Copper Oxide (BSCCO) requires cooling down to 30K.Two cooling requirements have been set forth.  The HTS rotor coils and RF magnets will need 30W of cooling at 65K, while the HTS armature windings will require an order of magnitude higher cooling power at the same operating temperature.  We propose todevelop cryocoolers that will meet both these requirements.  A single-stage pulse tube cooler (PTC) will be developed to provide 300W at 65K, which may be used in cooling armature windings.  The lower temperature requirement (30K) will be met by developinga two-stage PTC.  In order to achieve high efficiency and reliability, and to reduce mass, both cryocoolers will employ a linear compressor.  Inertance tubes will be used for optimum phase shift between pressure and mass flow.  The pulse tube will betapered to minimize streaming losses.A study will be conducted to identify methods by which the weight and size of the  cryocooler can be minimized.  We anticipate that it will be possible to define a design that is more than 75% lighter overall (less than 130 lbs. total) than the Phase IIprototype unit (~505 lbs.) without compromising any of the performance, life and reliability requirements.We have developed strategic alliances with worldwide leaders of three different cryogenic markets.

Therefore,    \n the ability to accurately determine photosensitizer levels in tumors and           \n at-risk normal tissues is of utmost importance. The goal of this work is to        \n develop and test a prototype system for fluorescence based measurement of          \n photosensitizer uptake in tissue, to improve photodynamic therapy (PDT)            \n dosimetry. The fiber optic system is designed to quantify photosensitizer          \n concentration by detecting a fluorescence intensity signal which minimizes the     \n impact of the tissue optical properties. The bundle is also designed to            \n maximize the signal intensity, allowing quantitation of low concentrations of      \n photosensitizers. Specialized designs have been developed for tissue surface       \n measurement, interstitial measurement and sampling of drawn blood samples. The     \n system is flexible enough to measure either porphyrin-based or                     \n phthalocyanine-based photosensitizers, and will specifically be tested in          \n aminolevulinic acid-induced protoporphyrin IX (ALA - PpIX), Photofrin and          \n aluminum disuiphonated phthalocynanine. The system design will be tested in        \n three specific applications where PDT can be successfully commercialized,          \n including (i) veterinary animal tumor therapy, (ii) research in experimental       \n animal tumors, and (iii) adjuvant therapy for human brain tumors after             \n resection. In order to successfully evaluate the system in these different PDT     \n markets, prototype systems will be developed and tested in academic research       \n labs at Dartmouth Medical School and the University of Toronto. The tests will     \n (i) determine how robust the design is, (ii) determine if this dosimetry method    \n improves PDT treatment outcome and (iii) demonstrate safety in human use, prior    \n to commercial development.                                                         \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nNot Available",

Abatement methods have changed little in the past 20 years, and there is a need for a cheaper, faster, and safer abatement method.    This project will design, build, test, and commercialize an in-situ asbestos abatement system, called PipeTaz,  designed to: (1) reduce the personnel required to abate asbestos, (2) increase the speed at which asbestos insulation can be removed, (3) allow the cleaned pipe to be recycled, and (4) reduce the volume and weight of asbestos.   In Phase I, laboratory tests of various concepts for PipeTaz were conducted, design specifications for the system were developed, the functionality of a pre-prototype cutting system was tested, and a hand-held asbestos removal tool was modified.  The Phase I effort showed that the conceived PipeTaz abatement approach is feasible and demonstrated optimal cutting and pipe transport technologies.   Phase II will: (1) develop a complete and detailed system design; (2) fabricate, assemble, and test the prototype system using simulant-material; (3) develop a Technology Safety Data Sheet, Human Factors Assessment Document, and a regulatory and operational review; and (4) perform pilot-trials with asbestos-containing materials under realistic field conditions.                        Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: PipeTaz should be useful for any pipe-asbestos demolition job, and the system could be used by most companies.  PipeTaz will (1) reduce pipe-asbestos removal costs, (2) increase abatement productivity, (3) increase abatement safety, (4) reduce waste packaging in handling costs, (5) allow for waste stream separation, (6) allow for waste volume reduction, (7) result in reduced disposal costs, (8) enable the recycling of steel pipe waste, (9) reduce the volume of asbestos waste, and (10) reduce environmental costs/burdens.",

        "abstract": "The overall project objective is to develop a commercial software product to improve the resolution and allow for quantitative analysis of specimens imaged using differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, by reconstructing a map of the optical path length distribution. This will essentially enable a DIC microscope to operate as a \"virtual\" transmitted light interference microscope. Phase 1 has shown the feasibility of reconstructing both 2D and 3D biological specimens. This resolution improvement will allow sub-cellular components of sizes that are near, or just below, the microscope diffraction limit to be resolved. Among other advantages, the optical path length information will enable the dry mass of a cell to be quantified, and for the reconstructed data to be used with standard 3D visualization methods or for automated cell analysis. The Phase 2 objectives are to refine the algorithm development to a commercial level, including; integration of the reconstruction and deconvolution algorithms, and improvements in robustness and speed. The accuracy of the optical path length information will be verified using test targets and biological specimens with known characteristics. Additional 2D and 3D biological specimens will be captured and processed to analyze performance and establish the required imaging protocol. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: DIC microscopy is a widely used modality for observing live specimens, and the instrument will be enhanced by the quantitative results produced by the reconstruction software. DIC could now be quantitatively used when photo-toxic epi-fluorescence is undesirable. 3D specimens can now be captured in DIC and volume rendered. Changes in cell growth can be tracked, which will benefit genetic engineering. Increases in resolution will enable analysis of structures beyond the optical diffraction limit.",

        "abstract": "The vision for routine space access and rapid turn around rates requires space vehicles to be more aircraft-like in their reliability. To achieve this reliability requires robust, high temperature material systems. Systems under consideration includeceramic or carbon matrix reinforced composite structures. The history of these structures however, suggests their brittle nature and limited design options provides a barrier to their reliable availability to the Military Space Plane. Aztex has recognizedthis limitation and has developed technologies for through-thickness reinforcement, thermal tailoring, and high temperature cures. The proposed Phase II program targets the development of robust durable multi-functional structure and thermal protectionsystems for SOV. Together with our team partner, Boeing Space Systems, we will demonstrate a reinforced high temperature core system, which will serve both as the TPS and the primary load carrying structure. This system will be a major improvement over theredundant TPS and airframe structure considered baseline today. The Aztex/Boeing team understands however, that it is not just one effective structure that makes reliable space flight feasible but robust, design flexible material systems. Thus a keyactivity will be to demonstrate basic materials improvements in interlaminar properties, thermal capability and stiffener attachment.",

        "abstract": "Interest in increased flight safety, aircraft survivability, and performance improvements has led to significant advances in the design of adaptive fault tolerant (reconfigurable) control systems.  However, there is a substantial gap between the researchand application of these methods.  One reason is that most of the designs are not practical for use in existing aircraft because they require a complete redesign of the software (control system) and, in some cases, additional hardware (sensors, flightcomputers, etc.).    The proposed work addresses many of the challenges associated with upgrading a production flight control system to improve capabilities of current Navy fleet aircraft.  Reconfiguration is accomplished by computing increments to thepilot's commands that remove unwanted motions during maneuvering with control surface failures, battle damage, and mechanical, electrical, or hydraulic problems.  This add-on (retrofit) control system is unobtrusive - i.e., it only generates nonzeroreconfiguration commands when the aircraft is responding unexpectedly.  Another key advantage of the approach is that the command limiting, structural filters, and safety logic of the production control system remain in effect.  This lessens certificationrequirements compared to other reconfigurable control methods.  Phase II will advance the technology through algorithm and software development, hardware implementation, and F/A-18 flight testing.",

Improving aerodynamic performance to meet the mission goals of next-generation civil/military aircraft and launch vehicles requires dramatically new methods of predicting and controlling nonlinear fluid-structure dynamics. The proposed innovation will provide a rational design tool for analysis and control of resonant fluid-structure interaction without compromising the effects of shocks, viscosity, separation, and shock-boundary layer interaction. Stability of a coupled fluid-structure system is accurately predicted in an eigenvalue formulation where eigenvalues correspond to coupled-system modal frequencies in the time domain and their growth rates. Limit cycle oscillations may then be computed and bifurcation diagrams constructed. The eigensystem formulation is tailored to accommodate state-of-the-art, frequency-based flow and structural controllers. The NASA Langley Aeroelasticity Branch and researchers such as Dr. Walter A.

The net effect of this massive capital investment is to replace 1.2GHz with 2.9GHz computers.

Research has demonstrated    \n a relationship between impact stresses on the upper extremities during             \n wheelchair propulsion and upper extremity injury. Impact stresses occur when       \n the hand contacts the pushrim, transmitting the stresses to the wrist, elbow,      \n and shoulder.

The FlexRim consists of an innovative flexible interface          \n between the pushrim and wheel that reduces the impact stresses related to upper    \n extremity injuries. In Phase I, three FlexRim concepts were developed and          \n evaluated. The concepts allowed the pushrim to translate relative to the wheel,    \n lowering impact forces.

Electrochemical detectors    \n are ideally suited to microchip CE because they can be easily miniaturized and     \n integrated into the analysis system.                                               \n                                                                                    \n Monitoring phenylanlanine concentration in plasma samples of newborns is           \n required by law. The current assay has a relatively high rate of failure (1:70)    \n and requires instrumentation frequently not found in-house, especially in small    \n hospitals. High levels of homocysteine in plasma has been associated with          \n cerebrovascular, peripheral vascular, and coronary heart diseases. The assay       \n for homocysteine involves online reduction of the protein-bound homocysteine       \n with tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, separation by electrophoresis, and            \n electrochemical detection at a gold/mercury electrode. Phenylalanine will be       \n determined in plasma in a similar manner using a copper electrode. The chips       \n will be used with a portable analysis system based on a battery-powered high       \n voltage power supply, miniaturized potentiostat, and integrated data analysis      \n system. The chips we develop will generate a foundation for other clinical         \n assays based on electrochemical detection.      \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nThe current trend in clinical analysis is away form large centralized labs and \ntoward point of care testing. Thus, a compact device for performance of assays \nfor homocysteine and other clinically relevant animo acids in the clinic or physician's \noffice has large commercial potential. Recently, the American Heart Association \nrecommended homocysteine screening for patients at risk for cardiovascular \ndisease. This should lead to a large demand for accurate and cost-effective assays \nfor homocysteine similar to the current cholesterol screening assays. The development \nof a small, fast and reliable assay for phenylalanine in blood will make it possible to \ntest infants quickly and accurately for PKU. The electrochemical based clinical analyzers developed here will provide a format that can be used for the development of a number \nof other assays for clinically important analytes. What is demonstrated with homocysteine \nand phenylalanine is just the beginning of a large array of clinical analyzers based on \nmicrochip CEEC.",

Reduction of           \n 2-substituted-beta-ketoesters, the key precursors for chiral aminoalcohols,        \n gave products of high enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (Verbatim from the Applicant's Abstract): Pneumothorax refers to       \n air accumulation in the space between the lung and the chest wall. The many        \n potential causes include spontaneous rupture of small alveoli or blebs,            \n progression of inflammatory diseases, complications of diagnostic or               \n therapeutic procedures, plus penetrating (e.g., knife or bullet) or blunt chest    \n trauma (e.g., motor vehicle accidents). It is estimated that over 50,000 cases     \n occur each year. Morbidity and mortality would be reduced with improved            \n diagnosis of pneumothorax. We propose development of an innovative technology      \n for immediate and accurate detection of this condition using (audible              \n frequency) sound waves. (This is now ultrasound, nor an imagining technology.)     \n The essential hypothesis is that sound travels through chest structures            \n differently when a pneumothorax is present, and that these changes are             \n diagnostic. The envisioned final product would display an answer as \"positive,\"    \n \"negative,\" or (rarely) \"indeterminate.\" The proposed device would be portable,    \n inexpensive, safe, and easy to use. The core method involves inputting an          \n acoustic signal into the mouth, and \"listening for\" changes at the chest wall      \n with computerized analysis of signals from an \"electronic stethoscope.\" It         \n would consist of a sound generator (\"speaker\"), acoustic sensors                   \n (\"microphones\"), plus signal processing and display units. The first generation    \n commercial device will be for incubated patients and use a notebook computer       \n studies aimed at optimizing the technique and demonstrating its utility under      \n likely use restrictions. Given the medical and cost advantages of the              \n technology, significant commercial potential is anticipated with purchase by       \n emergency departments, intensive care units, ambulances and military medical       \n units.\n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nNot Available",

This project will examine the extent to which a family of boron-containing cyclic amino acids are taken up by tumors and evaluate their promise as agents for use in clinical BNCT.  In Phase I, a series of new tumor seeking unnatural cyclic amino acids were designed, and two were prepared.  The materials were tested for toxicity in Balb/c mice and were found to be non-toxic.  One of the new boronated amino acids was used in a biodistribution study involving Balb/c mice bearing EMT-6 tumors on their dorsal hip area.  The results demonstrated that the reagent was taken up by the tumor while rapidly clearing from the blood.   Based on the selectivity of the first compound prepared in the new family of water soluble cyclic amino acids, a series of boronated unnatural amino acids will be prepared in Phase II, varying the position and chemical type of the boron.  These new boronated pharmaceuticals will be evaluated for tumor specificity using immune deficient mice bearing implanted tumors.  The materials will also be screened for toxicity.

        "abstract": "There are many data acquisition systems available for neuroscientists interested in multi-channel neurophysiology but all use proprietary, independently-developed file formats for the acquired data. This creates several problems including difficulties in sharing data between laboratories and poor interoperability between equipment, data processing tools and spike classification software from different vendors. Moreover, neuroscientists wanting to develop their own data acquisition hardware or analysis software are forced to support a limited set of proprietary formats or create their own. In Phase I, Bionic Technologies, Inc. will work with all interested data acquisition companies and representative users to develop an open, industry-standard file format for neurophysiological data, create a web- based user forum to support this standard, and provide a C/C++ code library for importing and exporting data in the open format. In Phase II, the usability of the format will be increased by the development of public-domain, open-source software tools for: importing/exporting the data in various programming languages and between a variety of analysis environments; editing, splicing, annotating and reviewing experiment data in the standard file format; generating data files for analysis from simulation environments, and classifying spike waveforms with classical or custom algorithms. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The open file format for neural data developed in Phase I and the neural data management tools developed in Phase II will be made freely available to everyone on a neutral, non-affiliated web site. Researchers will also be able to use this site to exchange information and user- developed tools and techniques within an Open Source environment.

        "abstract": "The largest groundfish resource for Oregon commercial fisherman is Pacific whiting (Merluccius productus). This fishery is economically important to many rural, coastal communities and in 2000 over 60,000 metric tons of whiting were delivered to Oregon shore-based processors. Processing Pacific whiting generates very large amounts of carcass waste. Over 70 percent of the landed weight of fish is discarded and in recent years disposal of this material has become problematic and expensive. Presently, expansion of shore-based processing of whiting is unlikely without first solving the problem of waste disposal. One solution to this problem is to use Pacific whiting scrap as a raw material for higher value products. Our Phase I research successfully demonstrated that it is economically and technically feasible to convert whiting scrap into both hydrolyzed and non-hydrolyzed, high protein fish meals. The goal of our Phase II proposal is determine if converting Pacific whiting carcass waste into hydrolyzed and non- hydrolyzed high protein fish meal can be a profitable commercial endeavor. Our research will focus on how best to produce commercial scale quantities of consistent quality fish meals from whiting scrap that meet the nutritional and physical criteria for high value use in aquaculture agriculture and horticulture.",

The enhanced        \n performance of our novel probes is by virtue of a set of high performance dark     \n quenchers we refer to as \"Black Hole Quenchers,\" or BHQs. The BHQ quenchers        \n have been designed to optimize quenching by two independent modes, 1) formation    \n of a ground state complex between the fluorophore and quencher leading to          \n quenching by non-FRET mechanism, and 2) maximize spectral overlap between the      \n fluorophore emission and quencher absorption to maximize FRET quenching, We        \n have prepared a set of three quenchers to provide effective quenching from 480     \n nm to 720 nm. BHQ probes will have several desirable features which                \n differentiate them from currently available probes. First, BHQ probes have         \n extraordinarily low spurious noise (ie no non-specific reporter signal) and        \n thus have a very high signal to noise ratio (S/N). This property will result in    \n enhanced sensitivity and lower detection thresholds when compared with             \n currently available probes, thus fewer copies of gene targets will be              \n detectable. Secondly, BHQ probes will be more readily purified than                \n conventional FRET probes and thus will be more cost effective to manufacture.      \n Since BHQs are \"dark\" quenchers they expand the available bandwidth thus           \n allowing the multiplexing of several different probes at once. BHQ quenchers       \n will improve the performance of virtually all FRET probe mediated assays,          \n including Taqman, Molecular Beacons, Sunrise Scorpions, and Invader.               \n\n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nSelf-quenching fluorogenic oligonucleotide probes have become important tools for the detection, quantitation, and discrimination of genetic matter. However current probe designs are difficult and expensive to prepare and often have extraneous noise which limits their usefulness. The new class of probes proposed here will be more economically manufactured and will have very low noise. It is estimated that probe cost will diminish from the current average of $400 per probe to less than $100 per probe, thus opening quenched probes to entirely new applications and markets.",

        "abstract": "This proposal addresses the design and development of dynamically controlled protein crystal growth payloads for Space Station application. The Space Station will afford the protein crystal growth community the unprecedented opportunity to grow crystals in a microgravity environment for extended periods of time and then retrieve them. This will add a new dimension to determining the structures of hard to crystallize proteins such as membrane-bound proteins. To take full advantage of this opportunity, the BioSpace International Dynamically Controlled Crystallization System will be used as the basis of a system that will conduct a series of crystallizations and screens over extended periods of time. During this time the system will be monitored and controlled by the researchers via a laptop and the internet. Each of these systems will be completely compatible with all the Refrigerator/Incubator systems currently planned for the Space Station.The Phase I effort will include the analysis of protein crystals grown in space and on the ground using the concept proposed for the Space Station. In addition to the diffractometry analysis that will be performed at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory, there will be X-ray topographic analysis performed to determine the influence of microgravity and to analyze growth induced defects.",

The relationship       \n between viral load (VL) and transmission is critical and requires careful          \n quantitative studies and systematic and vigorous monitoring of VL in breast        \n milk of women (i) to identify the number of women who constantly shed virus and    \n (ii) to prove the utility of reducing the VL in milk and HIV transmission to       \n babies by a short course of anti-viral drugs. Currently, the routine monitoring    \n of HIV-infected breast feeding women and their infants in developing countries     \n is cost prohibitive and new inexpensive technology for early detection,            \n diagnosis and accurate monitoring of treatment efficacy is necessary. BIOTRACES    \n Inc. has developed a Multiple Photon Detection immunoassay (IA/MPD) for HIV-l      \n p24 protein which is 1,000-fold more sensitive than standard assays. In Phase      \n I, an improved p24 IA/MPD enabled robust quantitation of H1V-l with a              \n sensitivity comparable to current PCR based assays, i.e. sensitivities             \n equivalent to 10 virions per ml. The aim of Phase II is to develop a clinically    \n relevant, ultra high sensitivity, low cost, quantitative p24-based VL assay for    \n use in developing countries. To achieve this, an IA/MPD with a sensitivity of 5    \n fg per ml or 50 virion per ml, will first be optimized for the detection and       \n quantitation of Clade C p24 and used for measuring (a) VL from breast milk and     \n plasma from treated and untreated African women in Zimbabwe (a HIVNET 023          \n Study) and Zambia (pending study) (b) for the early detection of very low viral    \n copies in infants born to seropositive mothers. Parallel VL measurements on        \n aliquots of the same samples, using the Roche assay, will allow a direct           \n comparison between the RNA-based and the less expensive p24 -based technology.     \n This assay will also be used for VL testing of HIV-l Clade B-infected              \n individuals as a first step towards a commercially viable assay.  \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nNot Available",

Pressure-tolerantbatteries can increase an AUV's effective energy capacity by 50%to 100%, with no reduction in vehicle payload and no increase invehicle size.  To get a corresponding increase in capacitythrough improvements in electrochemistry or cell manufacturingwould require investing many millions of dollars over many years,with no guarantee of success.  In our Phase I effort we performedthe first systematic testing of appropriate cells under deepocean ambient pressure. Our results are promising. COTS cellsunderwent many electrical cycles at high rates (nominally C/2)while under isobaric conditions of over 6,700 psi, with noevidence of pressure-induced failures in either set of cells.Thus, there exist today COTS cells that can be used to build ahigh-capacity pressure-tolerant battery pack for Navy vehicles.For our Phase II effort we propose to engineer a pressure-tolerant battery pack based on the current state-of-the-art COTScells. Furthermore, the pack will be designed to allow it toreadily accept improved cells as they become commerciallyavailable",

Phase III will result in a commercial instrument. Besides the importance of these measurements in studying and modeling the climatic effects of aerosols and clouds, we anticipate commercial applications in the monitoring of pollution, air quality, and industrial clean rooms.

Additionally, there are some challenges in EFP, particularly related to fracture and adaptivity,which are not addressed in any current solvers.Previous work has shown that a Java based software system allows us to address many of these difficulties in modeling.  For example, a specialized EFP modeling system has been able to reduce user efforts from one week to develop a model to a few minutes.Modifications that required days can be reduced to seconds.  The object oriented nature of the system has also allowed us to develop unique solver techniques that speed the simulations over traditional solvers.The major effort in this project will be dedicated to developing fracture algorithms that are suited to the needs of EFP modeling.

        "abstract": "60176          Current high power gyrotron tubes, used for heating fusion plasmas, produce power in high order TE modes, which are converted to a Gaussian like mode through use of an internal mode converter and launcher.  However, these converter systems typically achieve only 85-90% efficiency for conversion of cavity output power to a usable Gaussian mode, leading to significant efficiency degradation.  Current analysis software used to design the mode converter and launcher system are based on approximations that  limit solution accuracy, thereby limiting the ability to achieve designs with high efficiency.  This project will develop an exact integral formulation of the problem that will allow for the design of high efficiency converter/launchers.   In Phase I, an exact magnetic field integral equation analysis computer code, which used the forward-backward method for an iterative solution, was developed.  Using this code, calculations for a test launcher had excellent agreement with measurements, demonstrating the feasibility and accuracy of the integral equation approach.  In Phase II, an advanced engineering code for the converter/launcher analysis will be developed that uses integral formulation analysis and techniques to minimize the computational load.  A high-efficiency mode converter and launcher system for use in a high average power DOE gyrotron will be designed.                 Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Successful development should increase the efficiency of Gaussian mode gyrotrons used for plasma heating in fusion devices.  The technique should also be applicable to other overmoded, high-power microwave components such as waveguide converters, power combiners, elbows, and mirrors.  These components have applications in research and medical accelerators, materials processing, and high-power millimeter wave radars.",

        "abstract": "60459      The current generation of charged particle codes are unable to model practical three dimensional problems, such as those in high energy physics research, because of the large number of nodes required in the analysis.  Without this design capability, it is not possible to develop many new, innovative devices that could dramatically advance the state-of-the-art in charged particle electronics for commercial, research, and defense applications.  This project will develop an advanced charged particle code that will incorporate finite element, adaptive meshing.  This will reduce the computational requirements so that real-world, three-dimensional (3D) problems can be analyzed on desktop computers.  The computer program will include an intuitive graphical user interface and geometrical input using a state-of-the-art computer aided design (CAD) engine.  In Phase I, all major elements of the proposed program were developed to the point of demonstrating feasibility.  Significant advances were achieved in adaptive meshing technology and application of Monte Carlo Techniques for modeling secondary emission.  Interaction between a CAD-based graphical user interface and finite element mesh generator was demonstrated.  In Phase II, the major elements of the code will be completed, and additional features will be implemented to provide the functionality required to meet foreseeable applications.  All features will be extensively tested to insure proper operation and accurate results.

        "abstract": "This proposed program will result in the developmentof the next generation of millimeter and submillimeter wave, tunable Backward Wave Oscillators (BWOs). Successful development will result in devices that require significantly less input power, require less cooling, have reduced weight, and improved mode purity than current devices. Calabazas Creek Research, Inc. (CCR) is proposing to develop the first BWOs with a depressed collector, spent beam energy recovery system that will reduce the prime power requirement and allow air cooling instead of water cooling. An additional goal will be to develop mode converters between the the slow wave sturcture and the the overmoded output to allow for single mode operation. Finally, advanced permanent magnet technology will be applied to reduce the magnet and system weight.BWO sources are presently used for ground based atmospheric sensing of trace chemicals, testing of solid state sensors, and for basic spectroscopy research. The innovative development proposed here will allow these devices to be used for airbourne or space atmospheric sensing missions, as well as reduce the cost and complexity of BWO sources, making their unique tunability and output power capability more accessible to both private and government laboratories.",

In Phase I it was demonstrated that fabrication of Pt:Ru electrocatalysts as unsupported, metallic nanoparticles is possible using CCVD. These electrocatalyst layers behave electrochemically in a similar manner to commercially available Pt:Ru electrocatalysts prepared on carbon supports using wet chemical methods, but can be deposited directly onto both gas diffusion media and proton exchange membranes. The Phase II project would involve optimization of catalyst composition, continued development of web coating technology for mass production of membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) and commercialization of the technology through construction of production equipment and licensing.\nFuel cells are of huge interest to the marketplace, as illustrated by sizable investments in the technology and market capitalization of fuel cell companies. For example, Daimler Chrysler has targeted the year 2004 for planned production of fuel cell vehicles, and has slated more than $1.4 billion in investments to reach that goal.

This project will develop a residual oil purification process based on the use of unique, low-cost ceramic membranes to separate residual oils into two fractions: (1) a product stream in which asphaltenes and metals are reduced to the level where this stream can be processed by cat cracking, and (2) a reject stream that can be disposed of in the same manner as residual oil.   Laboratory experiments in Phase I demonstrated that the ceramic membranes can achieve the required purification  at economically attractive filtration rates.  In Phase II, extensive laboratory scale experiments will be conducted to optimize the operating variables.  A pilot plant will be built and operated on alternative residual oil feedstocks.

        "abstract": "The Phase I work has clearly demonstrated the feasibility of the Multi-Disciplinary Computing Environment (MDICE) for prediction and control of twin-tail buffet of fighter aircraft.  Several flow control methodologies have been proposed and appliedsuccessfully to a generic fighter aircraft to reduce the twin-tail buffet responses.  A new method of flow control using normal leading-edge blowing has been devised in Phase I and it has produced the most favorable results.  The goal of Phase II study isto develop and validate a computational analysis capability for the control of buffet responses of modern fighter aircraft.  Due to the availability of flight and experimental data through our collaborators from Boeing and NASA LaRC, the F/A-18 fullaircraft will be used as the test bed for Phase II work.  A comprehensive parametric study of flow control effects on the buffet responses will be carried out.  Active smart-structure control using Piezoelectric actuators will also be investigated.Eventually, the combined effects of flow control and active structure control will be investigated.  The structure dynamics module will be upgraded to three-dimensional nonlinear finite-element module in order to model the piezoelectric actuators.  Theproposed Phase II effort will result in a state-of-the-art multi-disciplinary design methodology to control buffet responses of a new generation of fighter aircraft.",

CFDRC will examine additional instrumentation, sensing systems and control techniques to both improve the gel mixing and automate the batch process.CFDRC will coordinate the gel propellant definition with TRW and AMCOM FMTI development personnel throughout Phase II to insure all propellant specifications meet or exceed program requirements.  CFDRC's Huntsville location provides convenient access tothe AMCOM facilities and personnel, resulting in close coordination of software, hardware and controller development.

Most are located some distance from the pumps themselves, requiring high voltage distribution cables that can break down electrically due to radiation induced damage and cause fires.  Those power supplies that do mount on pumps do not have serial control or adequately processed current reporting.  This project will develop a modular vacuum ion pump power supply with long-mean-time-between-failures.  The power supply will use radiation hard parts and will mount on the pump connector, eliminating high voltage cables.  It will be light weight, be serially controlled, report log current, and be sufficiently powerful to sustain vacuum.  Phase I designed and breadboarded an interim module using a commercial off-the shelf microcontroller instead of the ASIC-based design (application specific integrated circuit), but with many of the radiation hard parts to be used with the ASIC.  Phase II will test the Interim Module, and the radiation hard ASIC design will be modeled for functionality using methods proven by the interim module.

        "abstract": "In complex man-machine systems, increasing performance of computing and sensor technology often places proportionate new demands on system operators.  For example, in Naval sonar systems, tremendous increases in sensor and signal processing capacity haveimposed increasingly difficult demands on sonar operators conducting search.  Consequently, overall system effectiveness is reduced and varies widely with operator level of expertise.  The objective of this research project is to continue development ofnew means for improving overall sonar system effectiveness through activity-based automation.  In Phase I, feasibility of a novel operator Performance Support System (PSS) for managing operator passive search tasks was demonstrated.  This PSS incorporatesan embedded cognitive agent, based on knowledge elicited from expert sonar operators, that assists the sonar operator in managing their search effort in response to tactical, environmental, and system context.  Phase II will continue advanced developmentof this PSS as well as extend its application to other tasks such as active search.  This effort will include refining  and extending cognitive models of expert sonar operators, as well as design and implementation of appropriate controls and displays.Resulting prototypes will be tested and evaluated as part of the sonar Advanced Processing Build (APB) program peer review process.If successful, such technology can be transitioned into laboratory and at-sea testing leading eventually to certification and deployment in the AN/BQQ-10 sonar system.  Such technology could also find application in other Naval and military sensor systemssuch as Electronic Surveillance, as well as commercial systems where human operators are required to continually monitor and/or search large data streams, such as in process control and security systems.",

Cognitive agents offer a significant advantage over current rule-based aids, such as the C++ COA aid developed for the Future Fires Decision Support System (F2DSS).  IGEN-based agents,such as CODA, can assume complex roles, react believably to new and modified scenarios without changes, handle very complex environments in real time, and provide an explanation of recommendations that is understandable to the crew.

A standard rapid-prototyping formative analysis technique will    \n utilize input from physicians and expert consultants to produce successively       \n improved versions of each course as input is received. The final courses will      \n be presented to the Center for Continuing Education at the University of           \n Pittsburgh, the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and the AAFP for CE     \n credit. In Phase II we will evaluate the suite of courses for their effect on:     \n knowledge, clinical skills, self-efficacy and reported behavior using a two        \n group, pre-post testing design.

Portable and affordable remotesensors that give U.S. forces several minutes warning of approaching threats are necessary so that troops have adequate time to take appropriate protective measures.  Compact, eyesafe coherent Doppler lidars have been demonstrated as able to providesearch/detect/track functions for biological defense.  Importantly, these sensors are significantly smaller and lighter than competing active sensor technologies due to the much greater sensitivity of heterodyne, relative to direct, detection lidars.Additionally, these lidars provide volumetric, range-resolved, wind field measurements to ranges exceeding 20 km.  Ancillary benefits include providing input to plume dispersion models to provide accurate forecasting of plume tracks and integrated exposuremapping.  This can result in reduced contamination of mobile assets, minimization of personnel exposure, optimization of decontamination resources and minimization of the time needed to restore operations.  In this effort, CTI proposes integrating (1) aDoppler lidar for aerosol search/detect/and track functions and wind velocity measurements with (2) a plume dispersion and hazard assessment model to provide a capability for downwind hazard prediction and (3) a multi-pronged BW agent discriminationtechnique.

To this end, CTI proposes an innovative high pulse energy laserthat maintains average power, minimizes cost and size impacts, and is optimized for low repetition-rates ~10-30Hz.

Longer pulse systems can provide few-cm range-precision with wide dynamic range receivers and adequate SNR.However, both may be problematic with emerging ladar FPA technology and range-resolution is intrinsically difficult to extract from longer pulses.  As such, the proposed short pulse laser maximally exploits near/longer-term ladar FPAs.  The laser canutilize laser diode pumping for sustained operation, or low-cost flash-lamps for limited rep-rate/shot operation.  Phase II delivers a brass-board transmitter for transceiver testing.  CTI's experience in flight-qualified ladar systems provides leverageand a timely path to market.",

        "abstract": "Modern conflict areas are a complex mix of urban and natural clutter, adverse weather and a high density of friendly forces, foes, and non-combatants.  Owing to the increasing complexity of conflict areas, long standoff detection, non-cooperativeidentification (NCTID), and targeting of both air and ground targets has increased in importance.  At the same time, surveillance (UAVs) and strike platforms have become smaller while missions have increased.  Multi-function systems can address the diverseneeds of reduced size/weight/power and increased functionality.  CTI proposes the continuation of a Phase I effort in combined FLIR-Coherent Laser Radar Cell Design to produce the first midwave infrared focalplanes with combined functionality of direct andcoherent detection.  Midwave infrared (MWIR) sensor capability is of particular interest for weather & obscurant penetration, enabling our forces to detect critical signatures in the conflict area under all conditions. The shape and vibrometry informationprovided by a coherent laser radar (coupled to a MWIR FLIR) can provide the critical data for rapid NCTID.  Significant leverage with a multi-million dollar DARPA MTO 3D Imaging Device program has already been shown in Phase I, and is expected to continueduring Phase II.  With the implementation of the proposed technology, this sensor would provide the combined capabilities of high-resolution MWIR FLIR for passive infrared search & track (IRST), combined with active remote sensing of surface vibrations(ground & hard target).  With continued technology development, expansion of the functionality is possible to include standoff detection of effluents, chemical & biohazards, hard target identification/designation countermeasures, flight data gathering, andsensing of winds & aerosols.",

It is proposed that a mirror constructed with metal coated carbon fiber reinforced cyanate ester facesheets and lightweight core can meet all of these requirements. The facesheets and core must be designed using very high modulus, thin facesheets, and a stable and uniform core structure.

        "abstract": "The objective of this SBIR is to demonstrate feasibility of correcting figure errors on composite mirror substrates by systematic deposition of a thin film polymer. This process is analogous to ion figuring but in reverse. In the proposed process, a polymeric film is added to the mirror surface where needed to correct figure errors. The film is created by flash evaporating an acrylic monomer through a nozzle and e-beam (or UV) polymerizing the monomer in-situ. The evaporation process occurs under vacuum conditions. Since the evaporation rates are typically orders of magnitude faster than ion figuring removal rates, with proper flow control, a significant cost and time savings could be realized. Since the monomer is cured by electron beam or UV light, the process can occur at room temperature, whereas ion figuring heats the mirror surface adversely affecting some mirror constructions.Successful execution of this project could provide enabling technology for mirror programs such as FIRST, where ion figuring rates might be too slow to be practical and where thick sacrificial resin coatings (necessary for ion figuring composite mirrors) could adversely effect cryogenic performance. This technology could offer advancements for mirror programs such as FIRST, NGST and LIDAR mirrors.",

The overall goal of this research is to         \n design, develop and test in vivo a novel collagen-based endoprosthesis (CBE)       \n for reducing the rate of post-PTA restenosis.                                      \n                                                                                    \n In the phase I investigation, we have designed and developed a CBE prototype       \n that can be reliably delivered by standard transluminal percutaneous               \n intervention techniques. The CBE prototype had a superior patency rate compared    \n to an ePTFE vascular graft-based endoprosthesis prototype in a canine femoral      \n artery model. In the phase II, we will further improve the design of the CBE,      \n and evaluate the in vivo performance of the CBE in an atherosclerotic animal       \n model. Upon completion of the phase II research, we will continue the phase III    \n program and actively pursue clinical trials and commercialization of the CBE       \n device.                                                                            \n  \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nThere were more than 150,000 percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) procedures performed to treat patients with peripheral atherosclerotic lesions in the U.S. in 1995 alone. The occurrence of late restenosis typically lead to reinterventions that result in a significant increase of the total costs of patient care. If the proposed endoprosthesis device functions well, a 5% reduction of the restenosis rate can be translated into a savings of more than $100 million dollars a year in the associated healthcare costs.",

        "abstract": "An internal aircraft weapons bay, when exposed to freestream flow, experiences an intense aeroacoustic environment and varied suppression concepts have been tested for attenuating flow-induced oscillations.  Recent tests with open-loop, high-frequencyexcitation have shown great promise in providing broadband attenuation and elimination of tones.  High frequency actuation apparently alters the dynamics of the turbulent energy cascade and accelerates the transfer of energy from low frequency, large scaleeddies to high frequency, small-scale eddies, where it finally gets dissipated as heat. The proposed program is focused on using a Hartmann-Sprenger resonance tube as a high frequency actuator for cavity acoustic attenuation.  Large Eddy Simulation (LES)will be complemented by Phase-averaged Schlieren and by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements in miniature and sub-scale cavities. These diagnostics will provide insight into turbulence-acoustic interactions. Testing at varied scales will providevalidation of scaling laws for high frequency actuation physics. CFD simulations will provide guidance for the design of the high frequency actuator. These investigations will provide the foundation for designing a prototype High Frequency AcousticSuppression (HFAS) system for eventual flight-testing on a RAAF F-111.

Through phase I effort, we developed apractical solution of the problem via a GPS/INS-guided-ATRalgorithm, and demonstrated the general feasibility of theintegrated missile seeker signal processor. The first objective ofphase II work is to develop a detailed specification for theintegrated signal processor with processing rates consistent withnext generation imagers, compatible with the power and packagingrequirements of the missile seeker, and with sensorexchangeability. Phase II objective also includes developingalgorithms, software, and hardware for seeker informationprocessing, and developing a demonstration of the system throughapplication simulation and evaluation.",

Unfortunately, existing databases do not meet the needs of industry due to insufficient chemical elements, improper modeltypes, and inconsistencies. In Phase I, CompuTherm LLC successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using our new USAF SBIR funded software, PANDAT, to quickly produce core databases for nickel, aluminum, and titanium-based alloys.

Several companies-General ElectricCompany, Ford Motor Company, ALCOA, Howmet Castings, and Ladish Inc.-expressed great interest in these databases and agreed to provide $79,000 hard investment and $160,000 in-kind support for the proposed database development.

        "abstract": "Not Available This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to provide the means to reliably calculate turbopump stiffness and damping matrices based on dynamic force measurements collected using a magnetic bearing rig. During Phase I exploratory development of a high suction specific speed (NSS) = 65,000 rocket engine turbopump pump stage was carried out and laid the foundation for this project. A complementary Phase I project for NASA focused on an NSS = 85,000 stage. Earlier Air Force funding concentrated on demonstrating magnetic bearings as a useful lab instrument. More recent breakthroughs include a novel fix for auto-oscillation and establishing the structure of an innovative dynamic force matrix measurement methodology. The primary challenge in this work is to isolate those forces on the rotor (with and without cavitation) due to the interaction of the impeller with the stator using innovative test and signal processing techniques. By testing a series of impellers, a database of rotordynamic coefficients will be established based on component dynamic force data. An additional objective is to evaluate the capability of CFD for replicating those physical force measurements. The goal is to create scientifically based design methods for lighter high-performance turbopumps. \nSmaller, lighter, and higher speed rocket engine turbopumps are required to meet lower space launch cost requirements. Successful accomplishment of this fundamentally based approach for measuring component specific rotor dynamic forces and a method for using experimental results on a broader basis in the design process can lead to a breakthrough technology. It will enable turbopump designers to overcome current thresholds due to hydraulic induced rotor dynamic instabilities. In addition to reducing equipment size and cost, reliability will improve.

Off-target drift of pesticides and herbicides during aerial spray applications remains a major source of environmental concern, due to its potential human health impacts, downwind contamination and damage to crops and livestock, and endangerment of ecological resources. New design tools, including the computer model AgDRIFT? (developed by Continuum Dynamics, Inc., and funded through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement between EPA's Office of Research and Development and the Spray Drift Task Force, an organization of 39 chemical companies manufacturing pesticides and herbicides in the United States), provide the enabling technology with which to complete the development of the optimized wingtip-mounted device in mitigating drift from aerial application. The preliminary device, developed and analyzed in Phase I with these validated tools, has been shown to reduce drift fraction over the edge of the spray block by 60 percent or more. A preliminary stability and control analysis indicates that the net effect on aircraft dynamic response and static stability will be minimal. The Phase II effort will verify the drift reduction of the device found by the numerical models, through fabrication and installation of the optimized design on a selected agricultural aircraft, and execution of an extension field study. Phase II results will demonstrate that the device can significantly reduce the buffer zones currently being considered around sensitive areas (by up to a factor of three or more), expand the usefulness of available pesticide and herbicide products, lower application costs, reduce environmental risk, and permit the delivery of these materials in a more accurate and environmentally safe manner. Smaller buffer zones provide an incentive for the pilot to spray more of the field, thereby improving productivity and protecting more crop. They also open the chemical market, permitting the pilot to use products in situations where these chemicals cannot now be used.

The focus of this Phase II application is to develop novel               \n therapeutic regulators of alphaIIbbeta3 function, by modulating the integrin       \n cytoplasmic domains themselves. Phase I studies identified a strategy for          \n regulating integrin signaling by inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation of the        \n cytoplasmic domain of beta3. We postulate that compounds capable of inhibiting     \n this cytodomain activity will disrupt alphaIIbbeta3 function thus having the       \n potential to be a new class of anti-thrombotics. In the long term we will          \n develop these novel inhibitors of alphaIIbbeta3 to offer improved therapy for      \n the large population afflicted with ischemic cardiovascular diseases.              \n PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: NOT AVAILABLE",

        "abstract": "This proposal discusses the development Real-time PCR assays using novel prostate cancer markers for the diagnosis/prognosis of prostate cancer.  Prostate cancer is a leading cause of deaths among men in the U.S.  Good prognosis depends on the early detection of the disease.  However, the sensitivity and the specificity of the current available diagnostic markers is insufficient.  Using state of the art technology, differential display PCR and cDNA, PCR and electronic subtraction methods, we have identified 8 prostate cancer markers and established their tissue specificity and relationship to tumor stage using Real-time PCR.  Five of these novel genes will be evaluated to determine the optimal combination for use in Real-time PCR assays to detect micrometastases in blood using epithelial cell immunocapture methods.  Antibodies to proteins derived from the additional three genes will be used to develop a prostate specific immunocapture assay.  Real-time PCR with some of the genes using blood samples has already been achieved at Corixa and will be expanded and standardized assays developed.  This in combination with collaborations with key investigators in prostate cancer and access to an extensive blood and tissue bank should enable the goals and objectives of this proposal to be achieved.\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nThe proposed studies will lead to commercialization of a high throughput RT-PCR assay for diagnosis and/or prognosis of prostate cancer.  Such tests would be marketed both in the U.S. and worldwide. The estimated world wide market for such a tests is $200-300 million/year.",

        "abstract": "Payload planners of earth imaging systems have always struggled with the fundamental problem of designing a delicate, pointing system that survives the severe vibro-acoustic environments of launch.  The standard solution is to  mass load the spacecraft busand lock down the pointing stage during launch.  However, the parasitic mass and unwanted complexity are unacceptable for future RLV systems.  CSA Engineering therefore proposes a modular, tunable, dual-use suspension system that protects payloads duringlaunch and positions them on-orbit.  The proposed innovatin consists of a suite of modular, reusable active struts arranged in a hexapod configuration that mechanically isolated a payload from structureborne vehicle vibration while providing on-orbitstabilization and pointing. The proposed technology will be the only commercially available long stroke positioning system that combines long stroke isolation and precision pointing.  The electromagnetic system offers value for any complex, high-accuracypointing task where isolation in six degrees of freedom is required.  The research will develop an engineering demonstration strut, followed by a six degree-of-freedom isolation pointing system.  The system will have performance charatertics directlyrelevant to the X-37/X-40/SMV.  The developmental effort will produce a product directed towards the X-37/X-40/SMV.  CSA will work with Boeing to insure relevance, and CSA will be positioned to deliver the product for early RLV flights.  A precisionstabilization derivative product for Internatinal Space Station platforms pallets will be also offered.  Component technology will be inserted into commercial communications satellites via established channels.  Finally, in the space market, the technologywill be highly appropriate for reconnaissance systems.  Airborne platforms such as the Airborne Laser will make use of the combined isolation and pointing.  The precision motion control technology will contribute directly to CSA's expanded emphasis on thisarea for precision manufacturing.  In combination with a larger corporate partner, CSA will offer new long stroke, high resolution positioning stages for manufacturing.",

The motivation for this work comes from several areas.First, M/I structures, being optimized for minimal weight through thereduction of load bearing material structures, are highly stressed. Thusany additional dynamic stresses can lead to eventual fatigue failures.Secondly, unknown structural dynamics can lead to control structureinteraction and the possible loss of the spacecraft.

Currently, only shallow Information Extraction (IE), mainly the identification of named entities andsimple events, is available for deployment. There is an acute demand for concept based, intermediate-level extraction of events and their associated time and location information.  The results of this effort will be applied for information visualization tosatisfy the need for information analysts and decision makers.  To extract concept-based, general events from free text requires the application of `cutting edge' Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology.  The approach Cymfony proposes consists of ablend of machine learning techniques, hand-coded FST (finite state transducer) rules, and hard-coded procedures.  By taking this flexible approach in combining different techniques and methods, it will be possible to exploit the best of different paradigmsdepending on the specific task being handled.  The final deliverable includes (i) an IE system for intermediate-level extraction of concept based events, and (ii) an event visualization prototype to demonstrate the application of the new IE technology forinformation analysts.",

However, contaminating      \n tumor cells within HSC harvests are problematic since their contribution to        \n disease relapse has been unambigiously established through gene-marking            \n studies.

However, the majority of collaborative tools today are application specific and require collaborators to develop new or additional skills with computing proficiency.    This project will develop an alternative approach that will propel collaboration forward by employing a collaboration engine that allows for the mirroring of key files across a group of users.  This application-independent service would allow all existing single or multi-user applications to be used in a more collaborative manner across existing infrastructures.  In Phase I, a mirroring prototype was developed to demonstrate the feasibility of real time mirroring as a service, and its application independence was verified.  Additionally, the requirements for a kernel set of mirroring components needed to provide for thick or thin features to a client system were examined, while addressing contention, security, and scalability issues.  Phase II will research the intelligence elements necessary for a client agent and server agent and develop client and server software components that provide for a powerful and robust mirroring capability.  Additionally, contention, security, and scalability features will be built into the kernel components.

Commercial standalone LIF detectors are based on CW lasers and collect data at a fixed wavelength. Consequently, they add minimal capability for resolving complex mixtures beyond that inherent in the chromatographic separation itself. On-the-fly fluorescence lifetime measurements at a single emission wavelength have been proposed as a better way to resolve the signals of co-eluting species. Our approach is far more powerful because it provides lifetimes on-the-fly and at several wavelengths simultaneously. A new prism flow cell fiber optically coupled to the emission spectrograph was introduced in Phase I. In addition, two different algorithms strategies for analyzing the multi-dimensional fluorescence data were developed and demonstrated. In Phase II a diode-pumped laser will replace the flashlamp pumped excitation laser, thereby providing 100 times higher pulse repetition frequency, 10 times shorter pulse duration, and 10 times better shot-to-shot stability. New digitizer technology will be incorporated to accommodate the laser's high repetition frequency. Important Phase II activities include fluorescence methods development to extend the range of applications to drugs and drug metabolites and elaboration of the chemometric algorithms.\nThe instrumental approach to be realized through the Phase II research will have a profound impact on QA/QC assessments of drug purity, bioequivalence and pharmacokinetic studies, and research investigations in humans and animals.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): The power of polymerase chain reaction         \n (PCR) as an analytical tool has been widely tested. Recently, many clinical        \n diagnostic procedures used especially for screening several types of cancer, a     \n wide range of bacterial, viral and parasitic diseases, individual                  \n identification in paternity testing, forensic analysis, and tissue typing have     \n started employing PCR technology. Despite the invention of PCR 14 years ago,       \n most researchers and diagnostic labs conduct PCR analyses one step at a time,      \n with manual transfers and dedicated, single-function instruments at each step.     \n Furthermore, both extensive manual handling and the physical heat-transfer         \n constraints in the thermal cycling step, can contribute to 1/2 to two day long     \n PCR tests. Although there are some automated tools available to reduce the         \n manual work at each step, there are currently no cost effective instruments        \n that completely automate the PCR protocol in a flexible manner. This contrasts     \n with many of the completely automated non-PCR-based diagnostic instruments in      \n the modern clinical labs. We propose to apply several recent advances in small     \n sample handling, fast thermal cycling and general sample processing to the PCR     \n protocol in order to speed analysis and reduce costs and manual labor. A           \n technician would simply load a plate of DNA templates and a plate of the           \n required PCR primers, then start the instrument. The instrument would precisely    \n aspirate the required volume of each sample, then perform the thermal cycling,     \n post-PCR cleanup, detection and results-tracking steps in a completely             \n automated fashion, offering full automation. The instrument would reduce entire    \n test costs (reagents, disposables and labor) by a factor of 20 or more.            \n Considering the wide applications of PCR, we propose to make the instrument        \n flexible (e.g., different types of detection protocols with few changes to the     \n instrument hardware). The basis of the new instrument is to perform all            \n functions: mixing, thermal cycling, clean up, detection and sterilization          \n within the same set of nano-pipetter reaction vessels. In the Phase I, the         \n target is on two PCR-based protocols: one for DNA diagnostics and one for SNP      \n analysis. The key features of the proposed instrument, namely fast,                \n small-volume PCR, fluorescent detection and reaction chamber cleaning will be      \n developed and demonstrated within the Phase I project. Phase II will entail the    \n development of a complete prototype instrument and demonstration of high-speed,    \n low-volume processing of samples using selected protocols.                         \n PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\n This work will result in advanced-performance commercial PCR analysis instruments.\n These will allow researchers to more rapidly make important discoveries using high-throughput\n screening assays and be the basis for an efficient and cost effective system for genetic and\n infectious disease diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): The numbers of youth who are addicted      \n to nicotine continue to rise. Provided that people who become addicted to          \n nicotine during adolescence are much more likely to continue smoking as adults     \n and thus, suffer the devastating health consequences of smoking in later           \n adulthood, great efforts must be initiated to help youth to quit smoking. To       \n date, few interventions have been developed to assist youth to quit smoking. In    \n response to the need of cessation interventions targeting youth, Danya             \n International, Inc. developed a multifaceted smoking cessation intervention        \n (Adolescent Smoking Cessation Escaping Nicotine and Tobacco: ASCENT)               \n developmentally appropriate and based on cognitive theory for ages 14-18 (in       \n Phase I). The intervention includes a six session smoking cessation curriculum,    \n incorporated facilitator's guide, and a motivational video (Last Drag, First       \n Step). During Phase II, a support website will be developed, and the curriculum    \n and video from Phase I will be finalized. In addition, in Phase II, a              \n two-tiered evaluation of the intervention will be conducted. The first tier, an    \n outcome evaluation, is designed to determine the efficacy of the program in the    \n target population and the second, the process evaluation, is intended to create    \n a \"real world\" case study to document the process of implementing the entire       \n program and determine effectiveness of the additional website component.           \n \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nThe proposed intervention package will provide an attractive, comprehensive, and relatively immediate method to address teen smoking in this country. It is anticipated that the program will be marketed to schools, community-based programs and clinics, health maintenance organizations, and state health departments.",

        "abstract": "60119          Swiftly flowing ocean currents represent a significant untapped renewable energy resource for the United States.  However, ocean current energy systems have not been economically feasible due to: (1) the difficulty of maintaining system stability while concurrently being able to quickly relocate the system to maximize power generation efficiency as current speeds change at varying depths, and (2) the difficulty of maintaining underwater systems.    This project will develop an ocean current turbine,  based upon wind turbine design and adapted for operation in the marine environment.  This turbine design provides robust, cost-competitive electricity generation and allows for depth-adjustable operation such that power generation may be optimized and extreme velocities and effects of surface traffic and events may be evaded.  In particular, this project addresses one of the principal areas of concern, that of controls development and demonstration.  Phase I constructed a solids model of the generating platform, identified the distribution of masses and displacements, and developed a complex three-dimensional computational model to predict platform response to operating conditions and controls algorithms.  A controls document was established that defines the controls architecture of the platform and establishes a basis for model sensing and actuation of control surfaces.  Phase II will expand this effort by constructing a scale physical model of the platform and systems controller, and testing them in the Navy\u00bfs tow tank.                        Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The competitive cost of generated electricity, coupled with the development of a native, renewable energy resource should drive rapid commercialization of the proposed current turbine towards large-scale electricity generation.

The PF Rare Isotopes breeder should produce very intense beams (1010RI/s), be larger by a factor of thousands, save time for experiments, and permit study of problems not otherwise possible.  In Phase I, experiments proved 90-95% evacuation of RI from the PF chamber, consistent with the model increase of RI breeding when energy storage was upgraded from W=7kJ to W =18kJ (quadratic increase of breeding with W).  Theoretical work estimated that to satisfy the needs of the accelerator at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the leader in nuclear research with Rare Isotopes Beams, the PF machine should have W =75kJ with 2 Hz pulse repetition rate.   Phase II will build the PF machine (W =50kJ) to operate in single pulse mode (0.1 Hz) and demonstrate RI breeding efficiency for 17F and other RI.

Although several techniques are used to make diffractive optics, no single method is currently capable of the large clear aperture size, wavefront accuracy and surface quality that our proposed hybrid method offers. Using existing tools, an accurate DOE pattern is transferred to the final substrate through three proprietary steps, successively removing surface roughness and edge errors with each step. Our approach will allow the fabrication of large (greater than 1 meter), lightweight, low cost diffractive optics on both planar and curved surfaces for NASA applications. The resulting surface smoothness and flatness should be as good or better than is found on refractive optics made by traditional polishing processes, with a wavefront perfection only found with diffractive optics. These devices can fulfill advanced imaging and light gathering missions never before attempted using off-the-shelf fabrication methods, and materials that cannot be diamond turned. The proposed method can also be used in the fabrication of plane and powered gratings and multilevel sub-wavelength structures.",

        "abstract": "Active sonar operations are a key to effective USW performance in ocean environments. The performance of active sonar in these scenarios is often limited by clutter. Most active de-cluttering approaches have identified classification clues that are used totry to discriminate target echo returns from clutter echo returns. These approaches have historically suffered from performance sensitivity to changes in the ocean environments.Phase I of this SBIR developed a non-parametric approach to classification thatis robust against multiple environments. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated against both simulated data and recorded at-sea data. The new classification algorithm demonstrated consistent performance across various ocean environments, includingthose where the performance of conventional classification approaches were significantly degraded.Phase II will fully specify the processing, analyze performance, implement the capability, and integrate it into the existing SH-60R Dipper software. Theintegration with the SH-60R software provides a clear transition to a Phase III effort consisting of sea test performance validation and delivery to fielded SH-60R platforms.  The DSR-TecFocus team has the unique background and experience to provide thiscapability by incorporating the existing SH-60R Dipper signal processing into an Advanced Processing Build (APB) program like the one developed by PMS425.",

In general, several classes of noise limit the performance ofthese types of acoustic systems. Two key classes are the near field noise generated by the platform itself and the far field noise generated by interferences.We addressed these problems with an innovative approach that allows the different noise problemsto be addressed individually. In particular, the DSR/TecFocus approach offers a combination of processing algorithms to provide effective cancellation of near field noise sources and the suppression of far field interference in the data output fordetection and classification processing. The Phase I project demonstrated that the innovative concepts proposed were viable. Viability was demonstrated both in simulations and in laboratory experiments. The thrust of this Phase II proposal is to continuedevelopment of the concepts and demonstrate the performance that can be provided by using acoustic sensors on an operating vehicle.

The overall goal was and is     \n to develop and commercialize the new human bioassay system employing defined       \n Amgel matrices. This human biomatrix exhibits many advantages over existing        \n models. Amgel's unique physiologic properties allowed one to generate matrix       \n environment with defined or controllable bioactivity. Phase I work definitely      \n established that the 3-D Amgel system simulate discrete human vascular cell        \n functions in vitro. We propose two extended tasks in this second Phase to fully    \n accomplish our R&D objectives. They are:                                           \n                                                                                    \n 1.

The first objective of this project during Phase II is to continue the research anddevelopment of three shock mitigation approaches, and apply them to develop a mount or housing that protects the most susceptible component of a fuze, the accelerometer.  The three fundamental approaches in Phase I that are proving to be powerful methodsof mitigating extreme shock loads are:  (1) filter certain frequency bands with layers of materials having dissimilar impedances, (2) prevent or restrict energy flow to the device of interest using a momentum bottleneck, and (3) dissipate energy with ashape memory alloy in its superelastic mode or with other alloys that have high damping capacity.  Our second Phase II objective is to understand the mechanical properties of encapsulates, which are typically rigid polymer foams cast into place around thecircuit boards and other components to protect them from shock.

During the base portion of the proposed Phase IIeffort, we will extend and optimize a set of detection algorithmsdeveloped and tested during Phase I, and demonstrate theirability in a non-real-time format for wake detection andautocuing.  We will also perform a series of analyses designed to(1) assess the sensor imagery simulation capabilities of existingwake/IR propagation models, (2) determine the performancecharacteristics (probability of detection as a function of falsealarm rate) of the detection system over a range of environmentaland operational parameters, and (3) analyze the concept ofoperations for use of the sensor in combination with othersurveillance data.  In the option phase of the Phase II effort,we will perform a requirements analysis and develop a detaileddesign for the real-time detection autocue processor, and beginwork on a prototype.

        "abstract": "A field portable monitoring system is proposed that will provide ARO with the capability to measure the 3-D in-situ state of stress in soils which results from vehicle element's terrain interaction. The system will comprise a compact 3-D stress sensingpackage that is connected via a rugged flexible cable assembly to a field-portable controls/ excitation-and-amplification source and to an integrated data acquisition / Lap Top PC arrangement. The approach to stress measurements will consist in using threesolid- or fluid-coupled high-output thin-film piezoresistive Carbon stress gauges that are orthogonal-mounted on the faces a suitable solid substrate block or behind its faces at the bottom of small fluid cavities. The 3-D sensing package will beintegrally attached to a short rigid stem that extends into a set of armored and flexible output leads. Such arrangement can be made very small ( one cubic centimeter ) or as large as needed to meet the requirements. The Carbon stress gauge is capable ofresolving stresses as low as a few PSI up 15,000 PSI or above in dynamic or static environments. Relying on nearly thirty years of experience in designing and manufacturing numerous types of soil stress sensors for UGT and AGT applications in support tonearly all US DOE and DOD Laboratories, the proposed system will be constructed and fully evaluated, and rendered functional at our test facility under simulated but representative stress environments prior to its delivery to the Army. Coupling to soil andmethods for minimizing ground disturbance will also be investigated. A very degree of success is anticipated from this effort.

Current scientific, engineering, and economic analyses of the method from the Phase I SBIR project indicate that this recovery system located at a 1,000 hide per day American tannery can save the facility over $200,000 year in avoided virgin tannin purchase, and disposal costs. This process seeks to make our water intensive industry more of a closed- loop and help as to achieve our long standing goal of \"near zero\" waste. There are many non- monetizable values from recovery of tannins including cleaner water being discharged from tanneries, the more efficient use of forest resources, and the preservation of an authentic American industry that uses exclusively renewable American agricultural resources as their primary raw material (cattle hides)",

The technical approach departs from the conventional \u00bfone-sensor, one-analyte\u00bf paradigm and will demonstrate the utility of an array of semi-selective optical transducers to detect classes of microorganisms. This approach is particularly useful when the specific nature of the biological contaminant may not be known in advance. The system operates as a continuous, in-line detector to ensure the proper functioning of water reclamation systems; to monitor biocide efficacy; and to provide an early warning of incipient filter breakthrough, catastrophic failure, or inadvertent contamination. Alternatively, the sensors can be configured as biofilm detectors to monitor in remote, hard to access locations. The sensors offer inherent simplicity, and unlike antibody or DNA probes, require no consumable reagents or sample preparation. The optoelectronic design is modular so that new sensing capability can be added easily and cost effectively. Also, the use of miniature, off-the-shelf integrated optical and electronic components ensures low power requirements and system reliability. These features will result in more effective use of disinfection and will minimize overall manning and expertise requirements.",

However, manufacturing-scale production using traditional recombinant DNA techniques is problematic due to the low yield ofactive protein and complex purification.

The approach is based on the complete chemicalsynthesis of large DNA molecules encoding fibrinogen a, b and g subunits and modified versions of these genes produced as an array of component oligonucleotides that are then assembled, ligated and expressed in E. coli. This approach is enabled byinexpensive high-throughput oligonucleotide array synthesis developed by Egea Biosciences that allows complete customization of the protein/vector/expression system. To maximize expression, synthetic genes have been designed using E. coli, yeast ormammalian preferred codons to increase protein expression as well as specific sequences to enable high efficiency protein purification.  In Phase I of this project, synthetic genes for recombinant fibrinogen subunits were designed, constructed andexpressed.  Phase II of this project will continue and expand this strategy to create over 1000 variant hemostatic proteins, screen these for stability and activity, and maximize expression in bacterial and mammalian hosts. The re-engineeredgene/vector/host combination will be a platform for further sequence alterations to maximize protein expression and enable large-scale manufacturing.

The permeability was correlated with aspects of the        \n acoustic signature radiated by the cavitation field in the cell suspension         \n during exposure. The aims of Phase II are to determine the effect of acoustic      \n parameters on molecular uptake and cell viability in simple cell suspensions       \n and more complex organized tissues and to develop a measure for the cavitation     \n mediated permeability based on acoustic signature analysis.

We propose to complete the development of new (Sm, Er, Gd, Ho) 2TMM17magnets that possess near zero temperature coefficients of magnetization over a broad range of temperature.  Our approaches to extend the compensation temperature and to significantly improve the energy product of temperature compensated permanent magnetsare (1) to us Ho and Er to extend the temperature of peak magnetization (Tp) since Ho and Er compounds have a much higher Tp than Gd compounds used in current temperature compensated magnets; (2) to use Ho and Er to improve magnetization at hightemperature; (3) to use Gd to maintain useful high coercivity; and (4) make new sintered temperature compensated permanent magnets with (Sm,Gd,Er,Ho) TM13 as the main phase since this 1:13 phase has high magnetization, high Curie temperature, and high Tp.The payoff for DoD and commercial systems includes temperature compensated high temperature permanent magnets that permit TWTs to operated at higher temperatures and minimize the system cooling requirements and weight.  The use of permanent magnets thatcan withstand the bakeout process will permit simplification of the permanent magnet designs, improve beam focusing, and reduce TWT manufacturing costs.  Using magnets that provide a near-constant focusing field over broad temperature range will improvesystem performance and tube life, and reduce the final focusing and test labor costs.",

Phase I demonstrated feasibility using readily vaporizable analogs of ERCs containing nitro functional groups common to most explosives.  Sensors responded immediately and continuously to the presence of these compounds.

In this project, new carbonate side chains will be introduced into the carbonate-siloxane polymer matrix to increase the ionic conductivity to 10-3S/cm.  New lithium salts and crosslinkers will also be evaluated to enhance the ionic conductivity.   During Phase I, synthetic methods were developed to incorporate the allyl carbonate side chains into the polysiloxane backbone.  This resulted in a thin, flexible polymer with an ionic conductivity of 2.75 x 10-4 S/cm.  Various ratios of carbonate to siloxane, siloxane to crosslinker, and carbonate to Li+ were evaluated to achieve the desired results.  Phase II will evaluate several more carbonate side chains using methods developed in Phase I.  New lithium salts and crosslinkers will be evaluated.

        "abstract": "A nearly universal trend in modern technology is the continued integration of systems, and their associated devices, on decreasingly smaller scales.  While this has led to personal computers that offer more functionality and faster computational speeds, ithas also spurred the development of hybrid optoelectronic systems on a chip (SOCs).  Currently, such SOCs are receiving significant interest from the booming telecommunications industry for applications such as all optical switching, wavelength divisionmultiplexing, and optical add-drop filters.  In each of these applications active and passive optical devices are being integrated with electronic devices on the chip scale.  Consequently, modern applications are forcing the development of passive opticalcomponents whose size is reduced to a scale that is comparable to their operational wavelength.  As a result the plethora of analysis and design methods that were once applicable to passive optical element design are no longer valid.  For this reason a newsuite of computer tools need to be developed and is therefore the focus of the proposed effort.For this reason, we were awarded a Phase I project to develop such a tool.  The tool we developed was based on the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method.  For the last several years, we have developed working versions of the FDTD method forapplication to two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and axially symmetric active and passive optical elements.  In the Phase I effort we refined these methods for their application to diffractive optical modeling and developed a GUI based CAD tool.  Inaddition we also conceived of a hardware assisted implementation of the FDTD that allows the DOE CAD tool to be applied to DOEs of realistic size in a reasonable amount of computation time.In the Phase II effort we will continue our development of the hardware implementation of the FDTD method and expand its application to two- and three-dimensions.  In addition, the CAD tool will be expanded to include the ability to analyze and designadditional photonic elements such as photonic bandgap devices and micro-cavity resonators.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atrial Fibrillation is an electrical          \n malfunction of the upper pumping chambers of the heart causing major medical       \n and lifestyle problems. The current treatments are pharmaceutical (side effects    \n and minimal effectiveness), pacemakers (after destroying the electrical system     \n of the heart, expensive and moderately effective), and electrically isolating      \n areas of the heart using the MAZE procedure - surgically cutting the heart and     \n sewing back together creating scar tissue to block malfunctioning electrical       \n pathways. This MAZE procedure has proven to be nearly 100 percent effective,       \n however it is long and extraordinarily difficult. Due to the promising concept,    \n this approach is aggressively being investigated using ablation catheters and      \n probes to create lesions. However, to isolate electrical pathways, a complete      \n electrical block in the tissue must be made and these technologies are limited     \n in their ability to create transmural lesions. With these technologies,            \n charring and extensive atrial damage occur, which can increase risk of stroke.     \n Our technology addresses these issues by incorporating RF Bipolar energy into a    \n device that will quickly and safely create a transmural linear lesion, from        \n endocardium to epicardium, in a single application while protecting the            \n surrounding tissue. In Phase I we will fabricate a prototype and evaluate our      \n lesions for transmurally and ability to electrically isolate tissue.  \nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nOur technclogy will overcome the limitations of the current methods of treating atrial fibrillation (AF) and can be used to treat AF during open-heart procedures and to reduce the occurrence of post-operative AF episodes. This market alone exceeds $1.2 BB/year. The devices that can be developed using this technology have a strong potential of being incorporated into minimally invasive procedures adding an additional $1.5 BB to the market potential.",

Most fuel cell performance losses occur at the cathode oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).  Improvements in cathode performance are needed in order to increase fuel cell efficiency and reduce stack cost.  This project will develop high performance PEM fuel cell cathode structures that will provide more than a three-fold increase in density (at 0.8V) compared to present state-of-the-art Pt-based cathodes.  In Phase I, the PEM fuel cell cathode was improved by enhancing proton conduction and adding oxygen flux agents to the catalyst layer.  A gain of approximately 15% in power density was obtained when the local environment around the Pt catalyst was modified.  Phase II will examine the fundamental activity of the catalyst using a new understanding of the oxygen reduction reaction and will incorporate the catalyst into an improved cathode structure.  Also, candidate proton and oxygen flux agents will be optimized, and a nano-scale platinum electrocatalyst will be developed.

RTP has become a key technology in the fabrication of advanced semiconductor devices. As wafers get larger and chip dimensions smaller, the understanding of the highly coupled physics such as radiative heat transfer, transient fluid flow and heat transfer as well as chemical reactions through numerical modeling using high-performance computing is the key to the design, optimization, and control of RTP reactors. In Phase II, A 3D surface radiation model based on the modified discrete transfer method (MDTM) will be developed to treat radiative transfer in the lamphouse and process chamber as a whole process. The detailed pattern effects will be taken into account by rigorously solving time-domain Maxwell's equations through a finite volume approach. The rarefied gas dynamics in low pressure RTP will be modeled by adding Burnett terms into the Navier-Stokes equations. The governing equations that contain various multi-disciplinary physical models will be solved by a 3D unstructured finite volume method. To address computationally intensive 3D simulation needs, an efficient parallel strategy will be implemented in the solution procedure. Data communication among parallel processors will be conducted by the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library. To accelerate the overall solution convergence and improve the parallel performance, the algebraic multi-grid (AMG) method will be used to solve the discretized equations in each processor. It is expected that the proposed simulation tool can be used to systematically investigate the underlying physics occurring in RTP systems, and to help in the design, optimization, and control of RTP reactors.\nThe proposed simulation tool will significantly benefit the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industries that require a detailed understanding of multimode and highly coupled transport phenomena.

Such device architectures require not only reliable extrinsic n- and p-type doping of HgCdTe but also the precise control of composition and doping profiles. This can be best achieved using Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) within a single growthrun for a specific architecture. Although n-type doping with indium is well under control in MBE-HgCdTe, the situation concerning p-type doping with arsenic, which is the most suitable acceptor, is not satisfactory. In current technology, a hightemperature anneal above 400\u00bfC is necessary to activate the arsenic species into acceptors. It is mandatory to develop a viable, reproducible and effective p-doping approach that does not involve thermal treatments above 250\u00bfC in order to preserve thecompositional and doping profile integrity of HgCdTe-based structures. In Phase I, we demonstrated that in-situ As-doped MWIR HgCdTe can be p-type activated after a thermal anneal at 250\u00bfC through a proprietary two-step process. In Phase II, we propose tooptimize this process by a precise control of arsenic incorporation and site transfer.

Sophisticated planners seek strategies robust across a wide range of plausible scenarios.

However, recent advances incomputer technology have made possible a revolutionary new generation of decision support tools.  In this project, Evolving Logic will use its experience with its Computer Assisted Reasoning r technology to build a prototype system for robust, adaptiveplanning under conditions of deep uncertainty.

Means for rapidly adapting this technology to a rangeof military and commercial applications will also be developed.  The result will be an unprecedentedly powerful yet intuitive way for decision-makers, even those with little experience or quantitative facility, to design and understand the strengths andweaknesses of various plans in full view of the inherent uncertainties and for groups of planners to draw inferences and gain insights from within existing planning and decision-making institutions.",

U.S. refineries are also the largest energy consumers in manufacturing and spend $4-$6 billion annually in pollution abatement costs.   Ultimately, such cleaner-by-design process technologies that use \u00bfengineered catalysts\u00bf could cut down significantly on energy usage and bring about a paradigm shift in the petroleum refining industry.  This project will develop a light naphtha isomerization technology using catalytic distillation, which will produce isomerate (iso-pentanes and iso-hexanes) having a higher octane rating than conventional fixed-bed technologies.   In Phase I, the hydrodynamic feasibility of using a multifunctional catalyst substrate in a multi-phase, counter-current, reactor operation was established.    Phase II will develop the multifunctional solid-acid that will be used in a catalytic distillation reactor to produce isomerate from normal paraffins.  Multifunctional catalysts will be designed, synthesized, and tested in both fixed-bed and catalytic distillation reactors.  Information from the performance tests will be used to optimize catalyst design, reactor configuration, and process parameters.                     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) has been banned as a gasoline additive in California, and groundwater contamination associated with MTBE has forced refiners all over the world to find a viable alternative.  An appropriate blend of C5-C6 isomerates with alkylates would match the volatility of gasoline and be a perfect replacement for MTBE.  The new isomerization technology would thus provide U.S. refiners with a viable alternative to MTBE.",

In this project, an innovative process modeling technique will be used to detect sensor and equipment failures with higher accuracy and faster response time than previously available methods, thereby improving efficiency, reducing downtime, and lowering operating and maintenance cost for power-generating facilities.  Phase I demonstrated the techniques and analytical metrics necessary to optimize a diagnostic model of a monitored process and quantify its expected performance.  The analytical metrics were shown to be effective measures of model quality.  Innovations included new techniques to select optimal model settings, predict in-service sensitivity and false alarm rate, and perform model self-checking.  The feasibility and benefit of optimizing the model for improved detection of signal faults and equipment failures in nuclear power plant applications was demonstrated.

However, the separation of catalyst fines from the Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) reactor product stream has been a major impediment to applying the technology for the conversion of hydrocarbon resources such as coal and petroleum coke to clean burning fuels.  This project will develop a novel magnetic method for the efficient separation of iron-based catalysts from F-T wax.  The method addresses problems associated with the high concentration and small particle size of catalysts used in F-T production of wax from synthesis gas, produced in gasification of coal and other hydrocarbon resources.  In Phase I, the concentration of wax in analog liquids was reduced from 20 Wt.% to 0.2 Wt.% in continuous operation over long time periods.  Catalyst was successfully separated from Fischer-Tropsch wax at elevated temperature, and the effects of major process parameters were determined.  High-gradient magnetic filtration of the output produced a clear wax with particle concentration less than 500 ppm.  Operating costs for a bare continuous separator were estimated between $2 and $3 per 1000 gallons.  Phase II will acquire and activate a significant amount of iron catalyst, build a test bed suitable for optimization of the technology, carry out extended runs at elevated temperature and pressure to confirm the robust nature of the technology,and perform a conceptual engineering evaluation of a 15gpm pilot unit.

A number of variables such as fuse initiation, explosive charge shape, charge burn rate, andambient conditions determine blast wave characteristics and complicate theoretical predictions. Experimental verification of theoretical models is difficult because current state-of-the-art pressure and acceleration sensors are not capable of accuratelymeasuring the blast pressure wave. Their main disadvantage is limited frequency response, but also suffer from triboelectric cable noise, pyroelectric errors, and electromagnetic interference. F&S Inc. proposes to design miniature, rugged, fiber opticpressure and acceleration sensors capable of accurate blast wave measurement. The sensors possess improved frequency response, ultra-small size, EMI immunity, multiplexing capabilities, wide operational temperature range, and remote sensor interrogation upto several kilometers away. This new class of sensors will enable researchers to achieve much greater spatial resolution while maintaining excellent measurement resolution for miniature-scale blast tests that save time and money over similar experimentsconducted at full scale. F&S has assembled an experienced research and development team to demonstrate the feasibility of the sensors during Phase I and continued work during Phase II to ensure successful commercialization of this technology. BENEFITS: F&Senvisions commercial applications for these devices in industrial explosive device testing found in the oil and mine industry and road construction.

Antenna measurement systems typically use a frequency domain Vector NetworkAnalyzer (VNA) and anechoic chamber or large outdoor range. The cost of such systems starts at around $300,000, which is more than most small companies can afford. When characterizing ultra-wideband (UWB) antennas, the cost of frequency domain measurementsis even greater, because the data must be taken at many frequencies, which requires additional time.To address these cost and time issues, a new technology is now available that allows one to measure the characteristics of antennas in the time domain. Such time domain antenna ranges will have one-quarter the cost of a conventional range. They willprovide meaningful measurements over two decades of bandwidth, in either the frequency or time domain. They will also be readily stowed and deployed as required.During Phase I we assembled a prototype automated antenna measurement system. The system features full computer control both of the orientation (azimuth and elevation) of the antenna under test, and of data acquisition by a digital sampling oscilloscope.During Phase II, we will refine the physical package to make it compact, rugged, and easy to set up, stow, and transport. We will also enhance the software to provide full system automation, including data acquisition sequencing, and complete signalprocessing, to provide online, near-real-time recovery of antenna response data in time and frequency domains. We will automatically deconvolve the system response from the measured response. At the end of Phase II, we will be able to sell commercially aturnkey, fully field-deployable system, covering a broad frequency range. The accuracy of the new time domain automated antenna range will be demonstrated to be comparable to that of conventional ranges.",

Aerodynamic and structural interactions can lead toviolent vibrations, reduced handling qualities, and reduction in fatigue life.  The principal mechanism of this behavior is dynamic stall, which involves a cyclic event of massive flow separation, the shedding and convection of a vortex over the bladesurface, and flow reattachment.Flow Analysis, Inc. (FAI) has developed a technique for predicting dynamic stall for airfoils, wings, and rotor blades that is based on the vorticity confinement method.  The method allows vortex-dominated flows to be computed on coarse grids without thedissipation normally associated with conventional CFD approaches, thereby resulting in significant computational savings.  Application to various airfoils and stall conditions has demonstrated the general applicability, accuracy, and robustness of themethod.We propose to combine in a parallel processing environment the FAI dynamic stall method (implemented in a compressible flow solver) with a comprehensive structural dynamics code.  The result will be a unique and powerful approach to dynamic stall modelingthat will be the basis for a new comprehensive rotorcraft modeling system.",

Hardfaced armor provides protection against (pointed) projectiles at very low arealdensities relative to other armor configurations.  The current transparent hardface materials are either unaffordably expensive (sapphire, ALON), or low performance (hard glass) leading to heavy armor.In the Phase I program, Foster-Miller proved the feasibility of an innovative transparent armor hardface material.  Sapphire nanocomposite specimens infiltrated with a model glass matrix with light transmission were produced.  The specimens showed goodhardness and modulus that was substantially higher than the base glass material.In Phase II, the materials and processes will be refined and scaled up to demonstrate repeatability in optical and mechanical properties.  Phase II will include design, fabrication and ballistic testing of specimens against selected threats.   Theperformance of the Phase II specimens will be compared against state-of-the-art transparent armor hardface materials.  A producibility and cost analysis will also be conducted.  Foster-Miller has assembled a strong team to develop the technology andcommercialize it in military applications. (P-01705)  The new sapphire nanocomposite material will provide a transparent armor hardface material with ballistic performance comparable to that of sapphire and ALON at a much lower cost.

However, existing designs are    \n handicapped by the rate at which the gas permeates through the chamber             \n diaphragm given that all polymeric membranes are subject to some degree of gas     \n permeation. Given this limitation, percutaneous gas refills would be required      \n at frequent intervals, measured at best in weeks. It is Foster-Miller's            \n hypothesis that this limitation can be remedied by the use of liquid crystal       \n polymers (LCPs), a material of remarkable mechanical performance and extremely     \n low permeability.                                                                  \n                                                                                    \n In the Phase I program, Foster-Miller demonstrated that LCPs have the              \n biocompatibility, low permeability, high fatigue resistance and sufficient         \n manufacturability to be ideal candidates for ventricular assist devices (VAD)      \n and total artificial heart (TAH) compliance chamber diaphragms.

        "abstract": "During the Phase I program, Foster-Miller developed techniques based on Ultrasonic Tape Lamination (UTL) for joining of plasticized PVC sewer pipe liner. This effort was undertaken in response to a need for environmentally sound and cost-effective methods for rehabilitation of aging water and sewerage pipe rehabilitation infrastructure. Ultrasonic lamination has several significant advantages over the hot air field welding process currently in use. These advantages include the highly focused nature of energy deposition during insonification, and the rapid generation of this localized heating through a combination of viscoelastic and frictional effects. Therefore, ultrasonic lamination allows rapid joining against the surface of a concrete sewer pipe that functions as a significant heat sink during conventional hot air welding. Foster-Miller is working with Ameron International, Branson, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDep) and the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) to demonstrate the use of ultrasonic lamination of liner materials. In Phase I, ultrasonic lamination of sewer liner material was demonstrated against a realistic substrate, and has been shown to provide welds that meet the strength goals established by Ameron with joining times more than an order of magnitude shorter than the current method. Based on these results, Foster-Miller, Branson, and Ameron propose to design and build a prototype field-deployable ultrasonic lamination system and demonstrate its use in the field for installation of PVC liner material. Many estimates put the required investment for sewer pipe replacement or rehabilitation in the hundreds of millions of dollars over the next decade. Beyond the pipe lining markets, Foster-Miller has identified a large number of potential ultrasonic lamination applications in both the aerospace and civil infrastructure industries.

The result of Phase I will be a software product design concept that can be coded and tested as a working prototype tool in Phase II.",

This capability would enable the lower weight space systems and allow feedback control and diagnostics for many currently open loop thruster and thermal management systems.Foster-Miller believes that two-phase flow measurement of cryogenics will be demonstrated in this Phase I using our proprietary Dynamical Instrument method with radio frequency sensors. Our method measures the several non-linear, or chaotic, features of the flow and correlates that to calibration runs. The unique work proposed here is to use small, 0.25cm, radio antennas on the inside wall of the pipe. Radio waves have been tried by others but the inherent chaotic nature of two-phase flows has foiled these linear correlation attempts. With the antennas inside of the pipe, signal communications can be done with a radio link with no penetration of the pipe and minimal or no penetration of the surrounding cryogenic insulation jacket . Phase II should be able to reduce this to a practical instrument for flight demonstration. Flight opportunities are being developed through the Center for Space Power and the Commercial Space Center for Engineering.",

Bonded joints require much less cost, decreased labor and lower joint profiles that canpermit increases in fuel and range.  The proposed program approaches this problem from application of new probabilistic design methodologies to development of new techniques to ensure optimum bond quality at low cost.  Foster-Miller will team with BoeingSt. Louis to bring bonded primary joints to the X45 UCAV.Foster-Miller will develop ultrasonic approaches to cleaning and bonding joints that ensure ultra-clean surfaces, enhanced surface wetting and rapid assembly of bonded joints.  Solid state cure techniques will be applied offer full cure with minimalpositional tooling, providing significant savings in tooling and assembly time.  These benefits will be quantified using probabilistic methods at Boeing and will be based on a large database developed during the program.

Several issues need to be addressed in orderto bring this technology to fruition, particularly  the ferromagnets used in these sources.  Following a successful Phase I and follow-on efforts using two separate approaches (i.e., surface modification of commercial ferrets and synthesis of ferritenanoparticles), we will develop in the proposed Phase II program materials based on these two approaches.  The goal is to satisfy certain requirements that have evolved as a result of the various developments in energy directed applications as well asother high frequency applications.  Namely, we plan to address the issue of faster magnetics that of high frequency filtering with enhanced performance.  Our efforts will focus on material optimization, characterization, core fabrication and testing indevices, as well as scale up and commercialization of the appropriate components, in collaboration with our partners.  This effort will establish a precedent for taking this technology further towards useful compact high power microwave devices.  Inaddition to directed energy weapons and magnetic switching, the novel ferromagnetic materials will prove useful in inductively coupled fuzing, permanent magnets in small motors, low-loss inductors for rechargeable consumer products, transformers, chokes,television e-beam deflection yokes in telecommunications, anechoic chambers, high density recording media and high frequency filters.",

Furthermore, theincreasing use of composites, which do not incorporate conductive elements, in electronic equipment, aerospace and other hardware requires radiation hardening.  In the absence of inadequate hardening, failure of commercial and military electronics couldresult due to, for example, changes in frequency characteristics of the various components such as capacitors, resistors and inductors.  Following a successful Phase I effort, we will develop in this Phase II program novel shielding materials thatencompass several materials with different electromagnetic properties at the particle level, which can be easily process in one layer into the desired shape.  The materials will be engineered for specific application in agreement with our industrial andmilitary partners, and will have the capability of absorption and dissipation of electromagnetic radiation throughout a wide frequency range.  Our efforts will be geared towards material  optimization through extensive testing so that it meets requirementsof potential end users.  Scale up efforts towards commercialization of the products will also be undertaken in this program in collaboration with our commercial partners.  Low cost, easily processable and multi-functional radiation hardening materials inone single layer, that are efficient in a wide range, will be beneficial to the shielding industry in a large number of military and commercial components.

        "abstract": "The effluents of many industrial processes, as well as surface water and groundwater from historically polluted sites, often contain unacceptably high levels of Hg and other toxic trace metals. Although inorganic Hg itself is not bioaccumulative, it is readily converted to methyl mercury in the ambient environment, and so should be removed before discharge. The U.S. EPA has identified mercury-contaminated groundwater and surface water as areas of particular concern, and has emphasized development of innovative, robust extraction technologies for the current round of SBIR funding. Frontier's SBIR technology involves co-precipitation of the trace metal with a thiol-containing organic complexing agent (MCX), which is soluble as an alkali salt but instantly forms extremely insoluble complexes with many transition metals, particularly Hg, Ag, Cu, Cd, Zn, Pb, Fe, As(III), Se(IV), Co, and Ni. Thus, the reagent can be added to the aqueous sample in soluble form, and the complexed trace metals can be quickly filtered or removed by flocculation and settling of the resulting precipitate. The mercury salt of MCX is so insoluble that Frontier has used it as an analytical \"carrier\" for the co-precipitation and extraction of other metals of analytical interest.Phase I results demonstrated that MCX not only exhaustively complexes and precipitates most dissolved toxic trace metals of concern, including Ag, Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb, Se(IV), As(III), Zn, and Tl, but in most cases it also has the ability to strip them from indigenous, competitive metal-binding ligands such as EDTA. The MCX/metal complex is insoluble in aqueous phase, and therefore precipitates efficiently in solution. MCX complexes Hg >99.9 percent over the entire range from pH 1 to 12, and >99.999 percent across the limited, but quite common, range of pH 3 to 6. Satisfactory complexation and precipitation of the target metals of interest occurred very rapidly, with >99 percent of metal removal occurring within the first minute.",

        "abstract": "This Phase II proposal and the recently completed Phase I project deal with a new process of production of glycerol from cornstarch by a yeast fermentation. There are two current industrial processes for glycerol. Chemical syntheses are no longer competitive. The second method involves recovering glycerol as a byproduct from soap and other fatty acid industries. It suffers from the decline of the main products and also the large and thus restrictive 7 to 1 main-products to byproduct ratio. The byproduct simply cannot grow much without upsetting the market supply-demand balance of the main-products. Phase I work has improved the glycerol fermentation to a peak productivity of 4-5 g/l/h and a high average productivity of 3 g/l/h. The work has also improved the final glycerol concentration in the fermented broth to over 330 g/l, reducing reactor volume and evaporation costs. The overall yield has reached a high value of 1g/2g of cornstarch. Another important character of the yeast is the fact that the cells are stable and active, leaving no residual glucose at the end of batch operations. This makes the downstream operation of vacuum distillation for purifying the final product easy to do, avoiding otherwise problems of charring of residual carbohydrates. These results have led to this proposed Phase II project which will evaluate various reactor systems, as well as high vacuum distillation for glycerol purification, employing industrial grade raw materials, over wide ranges of process variables and oxygen supply levels. This proposed Phase II study will obtain enough practical data to prepare for a future Phase III project.",

Three-dimensional (3D) modeling of physical objects and environment is an essential part of the challenges for many multimedia tasks. However, most physical objects self occlude, and no single view 3D image suffices to describe the entire surface of a 3D object. Multiple 3D images of the same object or scene from various viewpoints have to be taken and integrated in order to obtain a complete 3D model of the 3D object or scene. This process is called the \"3D mosaic\". The primary objective of this SBIR effort is to develop a fully automatic and intelligent software tool that is able to mosaic (i.e., align and merge) multiple 3D images of the same object taken from different viewpoints, without a priori knowledge of camera positions. The main innovations of this proposed effort are threefold: (1) an intelligent alignment method that is able to register multiple un-calibrated 3D images without needing any priori knowledge of camera location and orientation; (2) a seamless merge method to \"stitch\" together the aligned 3D images using the fuzzy logic principle; and (3) an intelligent 3D image compression algorithm that preserves 3D image geometric features while achieving high compression ratio.\nThe 3D Mosaic technique to be developed under this SBIR program has enormous commercial applications, including industrial design and prototyping, reverse engineering, manufacturing part inspection, part replacement and repair, animation, entertainment, 3D modeling for WWW documents, archiving, virtual reality environment, education, virtual museum, commercial on-line catalogues, etc. It will become an important part of future 3D TV technology",

        "abstract": "The proposed investigation focuses on the research and development of a fundamentally new, high-speed, radio-frequency (RF) switch. It is designed for frequencies in the range 1-100 GHz. The switch is predicted on thin-film microelectromechanical systems(MEMS) technology with piezoelectric actuation. In general, piezoelectric materials develop strain when an electric field is present, which allows mechanical expansion and contraction of the material to be controlled by an applied voltage. Unliketraditional electrostatic MEMS switches, the closing force between the metal-to-metal contacts can be significantly improved by increasing the bias voltage (electric field strength) across the piezoelectric material. Because the switch restoring force islarge, in-use stiction is greatly mitigated with this architecture. The piezoelectric material lead zirconate titanate (PZT) is used as an actuator in the current project. This makes new mechanical designs feasible. Three strategies are suggested forlowering the switch time constant into the tens of nanoseconds range while preserving other important characteristics of the switch (e.g. high isolation, low resistive losses). These include a bimorph design, piezoelectric extensional bars, andflextensional actuators. Combinations of these strategies are likely to yield a high-performance switch.",

The proposed sensor will be insensitive to membrane fouling and hydrodynamic effects, providing accurate measurements without recalibration. The oxygen detection method will use a novel mode of sensing that is insensitive to fluid flow and membrane fouling. By using a CO2 sensing scheme that involves chemisorbing a \u00bfreduced-CO2\u00bf species on a platinum electrode and then stripping by anodically ramping, we can measure CO2 using the same working electrode or a second working electrode within the same sensor. Signal will be linearly related to pCO2, rather than logarithmically related as in conventional (Severinghaus) CO2 detection, leading to greater accuracy. A periodic, steady-state oxygen measurement will indicate the extent of fouling and a correlation will be developed to correct the CO2 measurement. Giner, Inc. is uniquely suited to develop this advanced probe for NASA microgravity bioreactors based on our previous extensive experience with individual O2 and CO2 sensors for clinical applications.",

Phase I effort resulted in the development of prognostic algorithms with a dynamic wavelet neural network and a virtual sensor comprising the main modules of the prognosticator architecture.  Means to represent andmanage uncertainty in the prediction scheme and a techno-economic assessment methodology were conceptualized in Phase I.  Finally, an open system interface platform and a simple human interface were designed for the prognostic system.  The prognosticsystem was tested successfully under simulation conditions on pump and injector nozzle failures.  Phase II activities will focus on the optimization of the prognostic algorithms, design of interfacing requirements and test/evaluation of the prognosticarchitecture on two shipboard systems: a motor-pump combination and a gas turbine.  An integrated stand-alone diagnostic/prognostic system will be developed, tested and evaluated to function as an experimental prototype for productization andcommercialization purposes.Dual use applications of this novel health management technology are envisioned to maximize equipment uptime and improve the reliability and availability of critical military and industrial processes.The project team alsoincludes integrators, developers and users of this technology to transition this into many commercial and defense related Phase III applications.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves the development of a catalyst to control NOx emissions from combined cycle power plants using natural gas fired turbines (natural gas fired power plants). During the Phase I effort, Guild Associates developed an environmental catalyst for the control of NOx emissions using NH3. Operating in the presence of excess (about 20-33%) NH3, the catalyst was able to achieve greater than 95% NOx reduction without NH3 slip. NH3 slip is avoided because the catalyst is able to simultaneously reduce the excess NH3 to N2 and H2O. The objective of this project is to modify the catalyst developed during the Phase I effort in order to enhance its commercial viability. Enhancing the commercial viability will involve increasing the reactivity of the catalyst and eliminating platinum metals from the formulation. Enhancing the reactivity will allow the catalyst to operate at higher space velocities. Eliminating platinum metals from the formulation will greatly reduce the cost of the catalyst. Successful completion of this effort will result in a simple, low cost technology for control of NOx emissions from natural gas fired power plants without NH3 slip.\nPotential Commercial Applications include the control of NOx emissions from natural gas fired power plants. Other commercial applications include controlling NOx emissions from semiconductor manufacturing, fine and specialty chemical manufacturing and nitric acid manufacturing processes.",

In Phase II, we will produce the remaining information, tools and graphic elements to include:  1) expanding the scope of information for providers; 2) adding tools to help providers integrate sun protection policies and practices into their daily routine, and 3) teaching children age-appropriate sun protection behaviors through fun-filled activities.  A two-group randomized field test will assess the programs' effectiveness at changing providers' and children's knowledge and practices, as well as providers' self-efficacy regarding implementing sun protection policies and practices for their child-care business. \n\n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nNot Available",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer will strike approximately one in eight American women over their life span, with 178,700 new cases anticipated in 1999. This Phase II SBIR will result in a multimedia CD-ROM, Coming Out Ahead(Tm), that will help women make informed breast cancer treatment decisions. The product will focus on the personal aspects of the treatment, giving women an opportunity to consider non-medical needs during the treatment period, to learn how a suggested treatment will impact their lives, and to learn ways to manage these impacts. In Phase II, we will research and produce remaining informational content and graphic elements and concurrently identify and develop additional decision-support tools for the CD-ROM. The complete decision- support system will included information about breast cancer, its treatments, and the impact of those treatments, as well as tools for more effective information processing, patient-provider communication, treatment-related problem-solving, and clarification of treatment- related preferences and values. Product effectiveness in increasing women's confidence about their treatment decision will be field tested with recently diagnosed women with early-stage breast cancer. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: This product has commercial potential for use by a pharmaceutical company as value-added patient education, for managed care organizations for their members, and as a consumer product sold individually to patients.",

In addition, similar generators at lower and higher power output will be built and demonstrated.

At higher power (to 30 W), the generator can also serve as a battery charger power supply.

The initial proposed use of this innovation is for comet surface sampling but the system can be applied to asteroids and Mars too. This invention allows for direct sampling of a comet nucleus surface employing a touch and go spacecraft. By avoiding a landing, the in situ study of comets is greatly simplified. It is only necessary for the sampling craft to make momentary contact with the surface via the sampler. Cutting heads located on a flexible boom 1.5 meters below the lander, counter rotate at high speed. When these heads contact the surface, small fragments are thrown up to the lander and into the apertures of instrumentation such as those under development at NASA Ames, GSFC and LaRC. The goals of the effort are to design a first iteration of the proposed sampler in an actual comet sampling situation, to fabricate a breadboard of the cutting head assembly and test this assembly at different attack angles in comet simulants cooled to cryogenic temperatures.

Recent powder metallurgy work in Japan has shown very high Jc results at high fields.  This project will combine a Nb-Sn-Ta powder metallurgy approach (to achieve high current densities), with a continuous tube forming and filling process (to achieve a low manufacturing cost for the superconductor).  Phase I demonstrated Nb-Sn-Ta mechanical alloyed powders with satisfactory Jc levels.  The powder metallurgy wire was made in lengths of 50-100 meters.  Also, issues with making multifilamentary wire were explored.  Phase II will focus on increasing the Jc level and increasing the filament count for multifilamentary wires.  Three variations of making long length (300-1000 meters) Nb-Sn-Ta superconducting wires will be investigated.

Favorable physical validations, extensions to high density ratios, free surface-MHD interactions, and the use of adaptive gridding were demonstrated and critical numerical issues were identified.  In Phase II, accurate numerical models for incompressible free surface flows, with turbulence, scalar transport and MHD in 3-D, will be added and applied to issues in fusion systems.

        "abstract": "Carbon fiber reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC) composites produced by chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) are actively being developed for a variety of high-temperature aerospace applications. Although CVI-based C/SiC composites are a promising class of materials for structural applications demanding high strength and toughness at temperatures to 1650 C, these materials are vulnerable to severe strength degradation when exposed to oxidizing environments above 425 C for prolonged periods. This limitation is due to the inherent process-induced matrix microcracks resulting from the large thermal expansion mismatch between the fiber and the matrix. These matrix cracks enable rapid intrusion of the environment which accelerates the degradation of the compliant fiber coating and/or reinforcing fiber, thus limiting the useful life of the component. The objective of this Phase I program is to investigate the feasibility of an oxidation- resistant C/SiC utilizing both fiber-level and molecularly-integrated matrix-level oxidation inhibition technology. Laminated C/SiC plates will be fabricated incorporating a duplex fiber coating system consisting of a 0.4 \u00bfm pyrolytic carbon (PyC) layer to promote strength and toughness, followed by a boron carbide (B4C) oxidation-barrier layer, and densified with a 10 v/o boron-enriched silicon carbide inhibited matrix produced by CVI co- deposition.

This project will develop a novel ion sensor array for field deployment in monitoring important contaminants and also for use in concert with remediation efforts.  The sensor array will provide real-time levels of metals at DOE sites and other areas of environmental concern.  Phase I created ion selective electrodes for four contaminants of concern (uranium, strontium, thorium, lead, and cesium) and optimized them for maximal sensitivity to each ion.  Selectivity was determined by flow injection analysis and tested spiked samples of groundwater.  In Phase II, the array will be integrated with microfluidics, microprocessors, and microvolume ion chromatography to allow unattended, remote analysis at selected DOE sites.  Electrodes will be used as detectors following chromatographic separation, thereby allowing two-point verification of each metal ion.  A compact computer controlled fluidic and sample handling system will be built, and software will be developed for automatic sample collection, fluid handling, and metal ion concentration determination.   The instrument will be tested at a DOE site and its results compared with those obtained using conventional analytical techniques.                  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Initiatives by DOE, EPA, DoD and other federal and state agencies, along with the concerns of private industry and private citizens, require monitoring and remediation of hazardous contaminants.  The sensor technology should have commercial application in testing existing sites, monitoring remediation and testing industrial effluents.",

We have\ndiscovered in our Phase I work a number of compounds that work by a\nmechanism similar to that of thiostrepton. The related structural\nfeatures of these compounds suggest that a compelling structure--\n \nactivity relationship (SAR) pattern can be uncovered by a directed\nanalog synthesis effort. The Phase II grant proposes to prepare a large\nnumber of analogs of the previously discovered compounds for\nevaluation in a direct RNA binding assay, a cell-free translation assays,\nand MIC assays. The SAR of each series will then be analyzed using an\nautomated analysis method, and a pharmacophore model will be\nconstructed. This model will be used to predict a second generation\nseries of compounds to prepare in order to maximize antibacterial\nactivity. Compounds meeting the appropriate criteria for activity will be\nevaluated in animal models. This process will yield broad spectrum\nantibacterial agents unlikely to be affected by current drug resistance\nmechanisms, which will be exceedingly useful to the clinical market.\n \nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:\nThe development of disease-causing microorganisms resistant to many,\nif not all, of the currently available antimicrobial compounds has made\nit necessary to develop new classes of drugs.

        "abstract": "Fibre Channel(FC) is a high-bandwidth, high-performance network technology which is gaining market momentum in both commercial and military arenas.  For routing topology flexibility, today's system area networks require switches.  To date, however, the FCtechnology has not been developed to efficiently support real-time quality of service (i.e., guaranteed bandwidth and latency) in a switched environment.  Such real-time quality of service is needed to meet future commercial and military requirements.  InPhase 1, we determined that virtual circuits would meet our goal of developing a real-time FC switch.  We further specified the architecture and protocol necessary to implement switch FC virtual circuits.  For Phase 2, with a combination of FasTrack andSBIR funds, we propose to build a 4x4 prototype FC virtual circuitry real-time quality of service switch.  The tasks will be comprised of completing the engineering and protocol design specifications, keeping the FasTrack-funded and SBIR-funded taskssynchronized, developing the prototype switch hardware and firmware components, integrating the prototype switch components, testing and debugging the prototype switch, and conducting a final demonstration of the prototype switch.  The prototype will bedesigned such that it can be moved into an ASIC implementation during the post-Phase 2 activities.  Fibre Channel was a $1+ billion industry in 1999.  Estimates are that by 2010 Fibre Channel will be a $10-20 billion industry.  Applications that can makeuse of a real-time quality of service switch include system/storage area networks, tape/disk jukeboxes, video broadcasters, videoconferencing, real-time systems(avionics, data acquisitions, etc.), e-commerce transactions, and interactive databases(airline/hotel/car reservations,. credit card processing, banking, etc.).

        "abstract": "This proposal centers on developing an improved finite element analysis for composite structures that will allow Navy designers to more accurately predict structural failure than is currently possible.  Improved failure prediction capabilities will removea large part of the uncertainty associated with using advanced composite materials and hence facilitate more composite materials into Navy fleet use.  Benefits of increased use of composite structures include reduced costs, lower weights, and reducedelectromagnetic signatures.The analysis approach is a microstructural based theory and associated numerical algorithm for extracting, virtually without a time penalty, the continuum stress and strain fields for the constituents (matrix and reinforcement) of a composite in the courseof a routine structural finite element analysis.  Failure criteria are then applied at the constituent level.  Critical components of the analysis include the ability to handle woven fabric composites exhibiting rate and temperature dependent materialbehavior.The finite element implementation of this theory is referred to as Multicontinuum Theory (MCT) which reflects the coexisting continua within a typical composite material.  MCT is an enabling technology that provides the designer with a window into thestress/strain behavior of a composite structure at its most basic level, i.e., the individual constituents.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project proposes the construction of a miniature object recognition and color segmentation system on a chip. This chip will be tuned to recognize various predefined targets in natural environments. The chip will use an object recognition model, color histogramming, originally derived from research in cognitive neuroscience. Taking advantage of recent advances in Neuromorphic Engineering, the company will implement the basic sensing and computational elements directly in silicon using mixed analog/digital processing. In contrast, implementing the same model or algorithm with conventional microprocessor technology would require that the basic computations be simulated as an intermediate step. The removal of this intermediate step will result in an intelligent sensor with dramatically lower cost, smaller volume, and reduced power usage-achievements not possible using competing microprocessor-based technology.\nThe applications for this technology include intelligent toys and prosthetic devices. A toy might be made to recognize, and therefore be able to respond to, the presence of another toy or specially designed environment. More advanced and elaborated versions of the chip might be used as an aid to the blind by assisting them in finding standardized (i.e. specially colored) objects. For example, a blind person might be assisted in localizing a coffee mug, distinguishing between two similar items of clothing differing only in color, or finding a standardized 'EXIT' sign in a building. The broader impact of this technology is that it will help bridge the gap between the natural, unstructured environment and computing technology.",

The FESS system for the prototype will be a commercial unit provided by the commercialization partner, and modified to accommodate the new technology. The partner currently manufactures FESS for commercial power quality and uninterruptible power supplies applications. Follow-on funding commitments and other agreements have been secured from the Alaska Science and Technology Foundation and from the commercialization partner to pursue additional technical work and for Phase III commercialization.\nIn addition to providing storage for alternative energy systems, there are numerous commercial applications for FESS incorporating the PMSD technology including utility load leveling and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS). The commercialization partner expects that the combination of technical and cost advantages demonstrated in Phase I would enable rapid market acceptance and encourage application of FESS in new markets. The PMSD technology is also applicable to turbo-molecular pumps (TMPs). These are used in the manufacture of silicon chips and in scientific instrumentation requiring high vacuums.

Immunicon has developed a sensitive test for            \n detecting tumor cells in peripheral blood.  This test uses ferrofluids and         \n magnetic separation technology for tumor cell enrichment and multidimensional      \n flow cytometry for cell analysis.  Clinical data show that tumor cells exist       \n in the blood of breast cancer patients.  One limitation of  this test is that      \n flow cytometry does not confirm the identity of the events that are detected.      \n Morphologic features of cells of immunophenotypically identified events can        \n improve the specificity of the test.  These features can be obtained using         \n multicolor fluorescent microscopy.   The quantity of ferrofluid used to            \n capture tumor cells from  blood, however, can obscure the cell.  Phase I           \n feasibility data show that proposed new  methods helped to decrease ferrofluid     \n without sacrificing the sensitivity of the test and the proposed objectives        \n were achieved.  Feasibility data also shows that incorporating these methods       \n into new assay procedures permits microscopy analysis - a significant              \n breakthrough.

The causative      \n agents are the parasites Leishmania chagasi, donovani and infantum depending on    \n geographic location. In Mediterranean countries, co-infection with HIV has         \n become problematic and asymptomatic individuals have been shown to transmit the    \n parasite through transfusion, in both France and Brazil. The reservoir for VL      \n is dogs and recently U.S. foxhounds have succumbed to VL raising veterinary        \n concerns. Tests available for early diagnosis have benefited by using the          \n recombinant K39 antigen that is specific for active disease, but does not          \n adequately detect asymptomatic infections. In Phase I improved diagnosis (dogs/    \n humans) was obtained by using K39 in combination with another recombinant          \n antigen K26.                                                                       \n                                                                                    \n The studies proposed here are to take advantage of this enhanced detection in a    \n combination test for VL that would have human and veterinary applications.         \n These studies will exploit the expertise of InBios to develop FDA approved         \n rapid tests using a combination of Corixa Corp's K39 and K26 antigens.

        "abstract": "The problems in sleep disorder medicine caused by the cost, access and variety of sleep laboratory testing have led to increasing use of home testing with oximeters for screening and triage of patients with suspected sleep apnea. Current oximeters are designed for hospital use and not for sleep medicine. They are complex and difficult to use for unattended recordings. They process the signal to reduce movement artifacts thereby reducing accuracy for apneas. This project will develop a new fully ambulatory oximeter (OxiTrac) designed for unattended recording in the home for two or more consecutive nights. OxiTrac will be worn like a wristwatch with a short cable connecting to a finger probe. Activity monitoring will be fully integrated into the unit for direct artifact detection reducing errors introduced by the amount of signal processing in current oximeters. Heart rate, SaO2, and activity will be stored in the unit and later downloaded to a computer for display and automatic analyses. In phase I the OxiTrac prototype was developed and successfully used, establishing feasibility. In phase II the unit will be improved, automatic artifact detection and data analyses developed and clinical evaluation completed. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The prevalence of the sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) is estimated at between 4 to 8% of the population. The high consequences of this disease and the cost of polysomnography make simplified recording techniques for screening and diagnosing imperative. Pulse oximetry has become a primary measure of choice in the evaluation of SAS and other sleep-related breathing disorders. The OxiTrac unit if established as a standard, would be suitable for use by the specialist, family doctor, nurse and most clinical staff and sold to virtually all sleep disorder centers, researchers, physicians, home testing agencies and similar clinical environments.",

The program is designed to be offered as a tobacco risk assessment and educational tool for middle and junior high school students to increase knowledge about the effects of tobacco and personal risks for tobacco use, intention not to use tobacco, and self efficacy for avoiding tobacco use.  Designed to be offered in a single 50 minute session, Special Report will consist of:  1) a basic tobacco knowledge test and interactive risk assessment; 2) media literacy awareness exercises; 3) education about the short- and long-term physiological and psychological effects of tobacco use, including the progression to addiction; and 4) skill building activities to prevent the use of tobacco.  Phase I addressed development of a structure and prototype for this program using the input of early adolescents, parents, physicians and other experts in the area of tobacco education and prevention. All specific aims were accomplished, producing a technical design, working demo CD-ROM, and an outline of a supplemental facilitator manual, Phase II will involve production of a fully operational Special Report CD-ROM, usability testing, a field test of the effectiveness of the program, and satisfaction testing.  Based on our own knowledge and extensive discussions with educators and researchers, Special Report will be pioneering in its use of state-of-the-art technology for enhancing tobacco education.  If such a program demonstrated effectiveness in reducing risk behaviors and intent to use tobacco over traditional education approaches, school administrators and health educators would likely view it as a desirable and cost-effective way to offer education and prevention information to middle and junior high school students. \nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nThe commercial impact of this project is very promising.  There are currently 12 million students\nin the target age range (middle and junior high school) for Special Report [NCES, 1999].\nSimultaneously, the issue of tobacco prevention in this age group has become a focus of\nintense national concern, since youth are most vulnerable to initiating tobacco use during these\nearly adolescent years.  With funds from the recent tobacco settlement, more states are\nattempting to implement programs in this area.  Yet, few empirically-based, effective programs\ngeared toward early adolescents are available.

The program is intended to:  1) reduce anticipatory distress; 2) help patients participate actively in their care; 3) facilitate adaptive coping via behavioral self-management; and 4) promote empowerment and enhance the capacity for self-advocacy.  The program seeks to limit users exposure to and facilitate resistance against the potential negative psychosocial consequences of illness and treatment.  The empowerment of people with cancer can facilitate better medical outcomes and the provision of higher quality care.  The interactive CD-ROM format seeks to reduce barriers of limited literacy, the need for flexibility in delivery (to account for the complex time demands of people newly diagnosed with cancer), and limitations imposed by physical illness that are common for those beginning treatment.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Phase II SBIR project is     \n to develop a clinically useful potentiator of the most widely used antifungal      \n drugs, azoles. The major shortcoming of azole drugs is that they do not kill       \n fungi but merely inhibit their growth. In fact, for the most medically             \n important fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, this growth inhibition is only        \n partial. The survival of the pathogen in the presence of the drug is the likely    \n cause of the recurrence of fungal infections and emergence of azole resistance.    \n Our Phase I studies identified two compounds in whose presence azoles become       \n strongly fungicidal. These compounds show no antifungal activity on their own      \n and no toxicity to human cells in culture. Structural derivatives of these two     \n leads, displaying improved activity and pharmacological properties, will be        \n obtained through intensive synthetic efforts. The biological activity of these     \n derivatives will be thoroughly characterized in vitro. Their ability to improve    \n antifungal activity of fluconazole will be tested in a murine model of systemic    \n candidiasis. Finally, the molecular mechanism of action of the potentiators        \n will be investigated in biochemical and genetic experiments. It is expected        \n that the compounds developed in this project will significantly improve the        \n improve the effectiveness of antifungal therapy.\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nThe commercial product envisioned is a fungicidal combination of fluconazole with an adjuvant that potentiates antifungal activity. Such a product would have a major impact on the therapeutic and prophylactic treatment options for systemic Candida infections",

The improved properties will include a combination of higher magnetic permeability, higher electrical resistivity, and lower magnetic loss compared with conventional NiFe2O4 and Co2Z ferrites. Over the past half century, conventional ferrites have been the only type of magnetic materials for high frequency applications, and the performance of ferrites is relatively poor. In the proposed work, magnetic/ceramic nanocomposite materials with various magnetic particle volume fractions will be manufactured using a wet-chemical synthesis technique. The magnetic performance of the as-fabricated end product will be tested and compared with conventional ferrites. The proposed magnetic nanocomposite technology is expected to have a major impact on NASA\u00bf\u00bfs power management and distribution applications. Inframat has aggressively sought to identify commercialization opportunities in the field of magnetic nanocomposite materials and has teamed with an experimental physicist from the Univ. of Delaware to develop commercial opportunities.

Of special interest is the effect of weakly ionized plasmas on theflow of regions with intense dissipation such as shock waves and boundary layers. In a Phase I program we have explored the effect of low-pressure nonequilibrium plasmas on low- Mach-number shock waves. Methods were developed for accurately measuring boththe shock-wave flow field and the electrical characteristics of shock waves propagating in these types of discharges. Large dispersion of the shock waves and increases in speed were observed, while thermal effects were minimized. The plasma-generationtechniques developed in the Phase I program will be modified in Phase II to work at higher pressure and in larger gas volumes. Plasma-generation methods such as DC discharges, different types of rf excitation, externally ionized plasmas, and dielectricbarrier discharges will be considered. Analytical and diagnostic methods will be refined, especially using optical methods to obtain more detailed measurements of the resulting shock structure and to improve the understanding of physics of the shockwave-plasma interaction. Based on the results of Phase II, this technology can be extended to establish design parameters that are scalable to actual flight test vehicles.

        "abstract": "Sustained hypersonic flights offer potentially revolutionary improvements in space access for military applications. Limiting factors in hypersonic vehicle performance include aerodynamic drag and heating rates. Recent research has indicated thathypersonic flow fields may be modified significantly by magnetic Lorentz forces through the creation and manipulation of plasma near the vehicles. Such concepts can be used to control hypersonic flows by suppressing or enhancing boundary-layer transitionin order to significantly reduce both drag and heating rates. On the other hand, MHD control of hypersonic flows presents a challenge which requires not only an understanding of the complex hypersonic MHD flow physics but also the creation of large volumesof plasma and strong magnetic fields. We propose to carry out Phase II numerical and experimental studies with the objective of developing plasma flow control technology focused on the suppression or enhancement of hypersonic boundary layer transition. Wewill design optimal plasma control strategies and study their effectiveness for the MHD control of stability and transition of hypersonic boundary layer flows over a flat plate and a blunt wedge. The effects and efficiency of various potential controlstrategies will be investigated by normal-mode linear stability analyses, direct numerical simulations, and experimental studies.",

        "abstract": "Optical emissions sensors have the potential to be used in gauging combustion activity and quantifying heat release, fuel-air mixture, and combustor efficiency within a wide variety of combustor devices (both stationary and mobile).  We propose to developboth chemiluminescence sensors-to derive equivalence ratio within the cavity pilot flame from the measured quantities, OH*, CH* and/or C2*-and infrared emissions sensors-to derive combustor efficiency from measured quantities, H2O, CO2, CO andtemperature-for supersonic combusting ramjet (scramjet) engines.  The principal advantage of this approach over other optical-sensors-based approaches (e.g., absorption) is greater simplicity, since only a suitable photodetector is needed.  In addition,solid-state optical emissions sensors are rugged, possess a wide field of view, require minimal optical access, and can be configured for species selectivity.  During the Phase II program, we will develop combustor optical emission sensor hardware andsoftware for implementation in a scramjet combustor.  Additional tasks involve designing rugged coupling optics/electronics and testing these designs in a direct-connect scramjet test facility.",

To systematically analyze these data,one must be able to denoise, segment, annotate, store, transmit, index, screen, and retrieveimages in a consistent and easy-to-use environment.  All these tasks rely on image processingtechniques to extract information from raw imagery.Traditional image enhancement and segmentation techniques take a global view of image,processing the entire image without considering local variations.  Multiscale image processingtechniques based on curvature-driven flows overcome many of the problems of traditionalprocessing methods since mutliscale techniques focus on features of data that are found atdifferent scales and resolutions.We propose to develop image enhancement and segmentation, algorithms using curvature-based flow-driven nonlinear partial differential equation imaging models and algorithms,including total variation, level-set, active contour techniques.  We propose to integrate thesetechniques into Java GUI that interfaces with a database and scripting language to provideman-in-the-loop processing, feature extraction, and analysis of image data.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract verbatim): Identification and segmentation of    \n the constituent parts of a human brain in three-dimensional (3-D) magnetic         \n resonance imaging (MRI) studies is a starting point for much of the current        \n research into human brain structure and function. Accurate segmentation and        \n registration allows clinicians and researchers to track and measure changes in     \n the brain over time. Manual brain morphometry is a laborious and time consuming    \n task. The voluminous amount of data and the specialized knowledge required to      \n manually analyze a human brain image preclude clinical studies from rapidly        \n moving forward. In order to address this problem, we propose the creation of a     \n commercial software package that would register and normalize a subject's brain    \n image to a digital atlas of neuroanatomy as well as rigidly align two brain        \n images. Anatomic labels identified on the atlas can then be automatically          \n mapped to segment the corresponding structures in the registered subject image.    \n Normalizing to an atlas allows measurements of brain structure and function        \n from a group of subjects to be compared with respect to the reference space        \n established by the atlas. Rigid alignment of two brain images allows the           \n detection of changes in longitudinal studies. Our software will also provide       \n tools for region-of-interest analysis. We believe that the ability to              \n automatically make structural and functional measurements and to detect changes    \n in the brain is a major advantage of our approach.                                 \n PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\n There is no commercial software available that allows 3-D MR brain images to be\n automatically registered to an atlas, along with performing atlas-derived measurements.\n Our software would fill a niche in the conduct of brain imaging studies in the pharmaceutical\n industry and address the needs of academic researchers.  Part of our commercialization\n plan will be to provide a brain mapping service for customers who require standardized\n protocols or who cannot afford to access the necessary resources in terms of personnel,\n software, hardware, and training.  These customers would securely transmit their MRI brain\n data to MathSoft over the Internet for processing and receive the output electronically.  This\n technology can be extended to the segmentation of other parts of the body.  Another\n commercially attractive direction for future application of this software is screening and\n characterization for animal imaging studies.",

        "abstract": "IAI is working with a partner company, Time Domain,  Incorporated to develop and apply a new type of radio called Time-Modulated Ultra-Wideband radio. When two TM-UWB radios communicate, each immediately knows the range to the other to within approximately.1 inch. TM-UWB radios do not transmit continuous radio waves like conventional radio.  Only pulses are transmitted, and power is used only during the short duration of those pulses.  A typical duty cycle is 1/000, with pulse widths of approximately 1nanosecond. Pulses in the time domain result in very wideband signals in the frequency domain, which make them very difficult to intercept and jam resistant. The lower frequency component of the signal allows the signals to penetrate foliage, walls, andother obstacles.  TM-UWB is much simpler than conventional radio because what is output is a pulse which is generated by a single transistor which is ON or OFF.  Since there is no intermediate frequency, there is no up-conversion and no down-conversion.TM-UWB is almost totally unaffected by multipath interference, and requires no specific spectrum allocation from the FCC.  This proposal details the development of a system called Urban Location TRAcking (ULTRA) which uses TM-UWB as the kernel forcommunication and tracking.",

        "abstract": "Eliminating noise from communication channels is important for both military and commercial applications. Conventional approaches to noise elimination use only one sensor, i.e. the ordinary microphone. Although noise can be eliminated, the distortion ofthe speech signal due to signal processing actually reduces speech recognition rates even compared to the original noisy speech signal.In this Phase II proposal, Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI) will develop hardware that fuses information from different forms of speech sensors. In particular, we will fuse information from a new type of microphone called a Glottal ElectromagneticMicropower Sensor (GEMS) microphone developed by LLNL, camera images quantifying lip motion, bone conduction microphones, and ordinary microphones.  The work will require refinement of our Phase 1 camera sensor for quantifying lip motion, and refinement ofthe GEMS sensor developed by LLNL, as well as further development of our signal fusion methodology.  Our Phase I results have clearly demonstrated the feasibility of our proposed approach, however substantial additional algorithmic and hardware developmentwork is still needed.",

It is not possible for ground personnel to anticipate all scenarios in which robot assistants in space will be involved and pre-program their response. It will also be increasingly incumbent on the robot to ascertain the intent of the user and be able to learn from user actions to improve its performance. During Phase I, we will implement an unsupervised learning method for selected portions of a manipulator controller. During Phase II we will integrate both supervised and unsupervised learning into an integrated demonstration in which the robot serves as a cooperative assistant. The supervised learning would take place using instrumented gloves or conventional teleoperator controls. The user would bootstrap the robot into operation by demonstrating some portion of a task, after which the robot would improve its performance as it goes. Of course, the operator could intervene at any time to re-program the robot if it becomes stuck.

This radio has several characteristics which make it  ideal for tracking multiple individuals without line-of-sight. During  Phase I we have performed many tests, including basic ranging, 3-D  position determination, communication through fire, smoke, steam, and  different kinds of walls. We have developed a new system architecture to  track the location of a fire fighter, which is more scalable, less  sensitive to errors due to multipath and wall penetration than the  multilateration based scheme, and does not require clock synchronization.  This scheme uses a two-antenna array which transmits two consecutive  TM-UWB pulses. The fire fighter carries a receive-only TM-UWB tag which  will receive these pulses. By measuring the Time Difference of Arrival  (TDOA) of these pulses, the mobile unit can calculate the Angle of Arrival  (AOA), which in turn gives the 3-D location. During Phase II, we will  conduct more extensive tests to characterize the multipath effects, noise  problem, material penetration, etc. We will implement the AOA architecture  and construct prototype tags and a base unit.",

Our innovation will also provide a real-time reading of the position of the astronaut, and with two small conformal antennas on the astronaut, it will provide the astronaut orientation and position in real-time. Within the last few years low cost ultra-high precision oscillators have become available, and these now make it possible to build TM-UWB communication systems which have no base band frequency. The only signals transmitted are pulses which can be generated by a single transistor which is either on or off. Impulses in the time domain generate very wide bandwidth signals in the frequency domain, and the signals generated by our current hardware have bandwidths in the several gigahertz range. With TM-UWB transmission, there is little chance of multipath interference, and the transmission is inherently secure since if you don't know the specific pseudo-random pulse pattern being used, the transmission is well below the noise in any detectable frequency range. Since the duty cycle of pulse transmission is small (.001), average power consumption is very small compared to radios which transmit continuously at some baseband frequency.",

This prognostic technique, or health monitoring (HM) tool, can be combined with IAI's internetworking software to provide remote monitoring capability. The innovation will also allow us to detect new fault conditions that have not occurred before. This may include sensor failures and hence, the capability of validity self-checks. Our algorithm uses one major tool: Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a powerful technique for extracting the features inside the sensor signals. A major advantage of PCA is that supervised learning is unnecessary. Another advantage of PCA is that we can use it for degradation monitoring or reliability assessment. It can also be used for early detection of cracks, fatigue, and corrosion signatures buried in sensor signals. General sensor fusion architecture will be used for fusing different decisions. The proposed method is relevant to the subtopic because our innovation can provide a trend analysis that detects structural degradation due to cracks, corrosion, and fatigue. The purpose is to reduce the likelihood of structural or other failures in ground systems such as engines and gearboxes.Key Words:Non-intrusive health monitoring sensor fusion PCA",

Future networks must be reconfigurable, highly secure and easily upgraded in both bit rate and number of nodes. The company will apply its extensive fiber optic expertise and its proprietary wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) technology to the development of a reconfigurable high-speed fiber-optic backbone structure that supports the transmission of multiple data protocols between multiple network stations. The approach is based on the company's all-fiber, static and dynamic WDM network access designs which offer high efficiency, compactness and low cost. In Phase I a three-node, two-wavelength system was constructed with static access modules to demonstrate the feasibility of simultaneously transmitting different protocols such as ATM and Ethernet. Phase I formed a basis for Phase II engineering development where the reseacher will employ dynamic access modules and expand the network to 8 nodes and 4 wavelengths to demonstrate network reconfigurability and scalability.\nThe market for fiber-optic networks is growing at a rate of over 20% per year and is expected to exceed $18 billion in 2001. Multi-protocol fiber backbones have applications in commercial platforms, such as enterprise networks, ships, airliners, automobiles, and integrated manufacturing equipment. Each optical fiber can replace hundreds of wires resulting in substantial drop in costs, component weight, and an increase in performance. The project will integrate well with the Internet-II, and SuperNet programs for the government-wide Next Generation Internet (NGI).",

This project will develop a smart, cost-effective system for autonomous, real-time characterization and quantitative analysis of hazardous chemicals in a variety of matrices.  Because of its built-in smart spectral interpretation capabilities and self-diagnostic functions, the device will report continuously without the need for experts or on-site technicians.  In Phase I, a test demonstration proved the ability of the smart spectral analysis approach to detect the target contaminants (PCE and TCE) in isolation and in real-world spectra taken from a mixture of materials from a typical remediation target site.  Phase II will create a prototype instrument and field test it.

A Matlaba-based toolbox was developed, consisting of linear and neural network approximators that were capable of learning and predicting with high accuracy the behavior of plasma parameters.  The development of a control algorithm capable of using the model of the plasma obtained by the neural network approximator was begun.  In Phase II, the development of the neural-network-based control algorithm will be completed.  The algorithm will be integrated into currently used control software for real-time control of a tokamak.

The end result of this project will be a functioning prototype screen reader (based on Henter-Joyce's JAWS (Job Access With Speech) screen reader) with the ability to observe the user's actions, identify the user's goal based on those actions (referred to as plan recognition), and then either create a script that automates the task of achieving that same goal in the future or remind the user that such a script already exists.

For a cluster of collaborating satellites, the operations complexity is significantlyincreased. Distributed, virtual, cluster commanding is transparently commanding an entire satellite cluster via any one satellite in the cluster. The development of architectures and algorithms for facilitating distributed, virtual, cluster commanding andautonomous operation provides many benefits. These benefits include reducing the size of the ground crew, the required bandwidth of the satellite-to-ground link, and decreasing the need for scheduled or dedicated ground assets (antennas, control stations,etc.).Additionally, two major areas of concern have been identified for the support of large constellations of satellites: fault management and planning and scheduling.In the past, fault detection, isolation and recovery (FDIR) were the sole responsibility of the Ground system. As more complex formations are developed, the need for FDIR to be addressed on-board at the cluster level is becoming critical to reducing thecost and complexity of cluster operations.Similarly, in order to relieve the ground from individually tasking each element of the constellation, the resolution of goals must be resolved on-board in a distributed manner. To do this, planning and scheduling has to be tightly integrated within theSpace-Ground Architecture.ICS is proposing, in this Phase-II, the further development of an agent-based architecture for real-time autonomous Command & Telemetry systems.

This project will extend the useful sensitive depth of individual and segmented oxide passivated Si detectors to the 1-3 mm range and incorporate high value monolithic resistors on the same substrate.  Phase I extended a previously developed technique for neutron transmutation doping to make very high resistivity  Si.  It was also demonstrated that the flat band voltage is lower for  than for  for the same resistivity.  Finally the proposed technique for improved surface passivation was shown to be feasible.  In Phase II, the  neutron transmutation doping will be combined with two new techniques for reducing the flat band voltage of the oxide passivation and for reducing channel conductance and surface recombination currents.  Very high sheet resistivities on Si surfaces will be produced for the fabrication of monolithic high value resistors.             Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The availability to oxide passivated deep Si detectors will make an important contribution to radiation detection and spectroscopy application in many diverse areas ranging from particle physics research to industrial x-ray spectroscopy.

We propose, in Phase II, to focus on the materials unique optical properties, that is, not only a brad range of asdeposited index of refraction but the ability to be processed to given specific values in plane with refraction but the ability to be processed to given specific values in plane with photoexposure.  In Phase I we were able to produce materials which hadindex changes of over 1.0 after exposure.  In Phase I we were able to produce materials which had index changes of over 1.0 after exposure. In Phase II we will attempt to double this range.  We will complete material characterization, including long termstability, and process optimization begun in  Phase I.  We will combine our material/process with innovative lithographic techniques to economically produce structures with design specific index of refraction.  We will produce prototype phased arraydevices for high density wavelength division multiplexing.  In addition to optimizing conventional designs, we will investigate embedding micro-optical components which would, for example, provide compensation for polarization mode losses.  Phase II willconclude with the development of high volume production capable material and process as well as the prototyping and testing of initial devices.  The success of the Phase II program will result in commercialization of photonic devices that capitalize on thesmaller device size, a 20X advantage, to either produce devices of equal area with 20X more functionality (20X the number of channels in a demultiplexer for example) or produce equivalent devices with 1/20 the capital expenditure and at least 80% less thancurrent prices.  Additional competitive advantages results from the elimination of propagation losses with etch free produced waveguides and, reduction of polarization dependent loss in planar waveguide devices by at least an order of magnitude (providinga 10X increase in performance).  We will use these advantages to secure at least 10% of the projected multi-billion dollar planar waveguide device market.",

Reliable, stable optical routing devices will bring the high speed optical network backbone closer to the end user and increase total network speed dramatically.  This project will develop devices for optical switching and modulating using an innovative non linear polymer.  The electro-optic property of the polymer enables its use for optical switching.  The innovative method of forming the polymer provides not only superior electro-optic performance but long term stability as well.  Phase I selected appropriate reactants, modified equipment as necessary for the polymerization process, synthesized the polymers, and measured both their non linear optical properties and their stability versus time and temperature.  The electro-optic properties exceeded published literature values and confirmed excellent stability of both optical and mechanical properties.  Phase II will optimize reactant selection and refine the deposition apparatus for high volume production capability.  Prototype devices will be fabricated, and their performance will be characterized before and after life testing.                  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The technology should provide a significant advantage to the production of optical switches (a projected seven billion dollar market worldwide by 2004) and high speed optical modulators (a projected eight billion dollar market worldwide by 2004).

Current technology allows fabrication of compactand light-weight modulators, but these interferometric devices are still not truly deployable, because they require control and feedback electronics for balancing and stabilization.  EO polymer technology  capable of producing 100GHz, sub-one-voltmodulators will be combined with MEMS technology that provides high Q resonators and filters that operate in the KHz-MHz frequencies.   The approach is to mechanically balance an EO modulator using a MEMS resonant structure, and integrate balancingcircuitry (which includes high Q MEMS band-pass filters) by either integrating on the same substrate or via flip-chip bonding, contained in the same modulator package.  DC biasing and RF modulation are separated, eliminating the need for wide-band biasingcomponents, and avoiding bias drift problems that are common in electrical biasing.  This work builds on the success of the Phase I effort, where mechanical biasing and heterogeneous integration are experimentally demonstrated.  Successful completion ofthis work will allow 2 to 3 orders of magnitude reduction in size, mass and power consumption over current methods, and will enable low cost fabrication of high-frequency modulators.",

The purpose of this project is to deliver innovative content on the concepts and practices of promoting self-determination in a video- based training package for direct support workers. As institutional residential settings are being phased out in favor of community placements, and states across the country scramble to meet the needs of thousands on waiting lists for community services, support agencies are pressured to continually recruit and train new staff.

Smart editors using active template technology will be used to narrow the selection of defaults based on user context of problem defined by initial entries and commands.  Plan library functions will allow selectionof partial plans and strategy models from libraries of previous plans, and rapidly compose new plans. The EFFECTOR system will be architected as an E-Commerce solution using light weight web-server technologies, exploiting Java applets/servelets and DHTMLto provide dynamic information presentations. The user will load and exchange data by exchanging documents, where the human-readable information presentation is augmented with XML-based markup to transmit the needed machine-readable symbolic content. Userswill be able to selectively share data to collaborate in building strategy models and plans.These technologies achieve dynamic DoD military planning goals and is directly extended to organization strategic planning, such as 5-year strategic plans developed by Federal Government Offices.

A second related application can be used to identify tissue type       \n with remarkable specificity. Further, such identification is independent of the    \n x-ray geometric path length through the tissue, and is done by measuring and       \n imaging the tissue-specific ratio of the total attenuation to the coherent         \n small-angle deBye scattering production, that, in turn, sensitively depends on     \n the average atomic number (relative compositions of carbon, oxygen, and higher     \n Z atoms), and also on the average protein-folding length. Both schemes are         \n non-invasive, in-vivo, require no contrast agent, have low dosage, and require     \n only short duration exposures. Both are accomplished using polychromatic x-rays    \n from a conventional medium power x-ray tube, and lead to low-cost                  \n clinically-practical devices.

        "abstract": "Dynamically certified seats (16g seats) are being fielded in all jet transports certified since 1988. In addition, the airlines are steadily replacing their older seats with 16g compatible seats in the older aircraft certified prior to that date. The implementation of the dynamic seat requirements has encountered one unanticipated problem. Under normal use, seat cushions must be replaced with identical cushions every 3-5 years, and sometimes sooner. To maintain an aircraft's type certificate, the replacement seat cushions must be identical those installed for the original certification tests. Airlines are frequently unable to obtain identical replacement cushions. The airlines' only option, in this case, is to recertify the entire seat with a replacement cushion by conducting a full-scale 16g dynamic seat test. This is expensive since it not only requires the use of expensive laboratory equipment, but also because it destroys a seat frame. The best solution for this problem is the development of an inexpensive component test that can be used to certify replacement cushions. Such a test will provide a needed tool for the development of aircraft seats using a systems approach to crashworthiness and thus contribute to both safety and lower costs for the entire industry.",

The opportunity presented in this Phase I proposal is to demonstrate a space radiator that will have high conductivity (>1800 W/mK) in the temperature region of interest (40K to 150K) and low density (< 2.0 g/cm3). Immediate payoffs include significant weight reductions and greater efficiency.

First, we designed and implemented a unique tooling system that eliminates the minimum size constraint of conventional fabrication technologyassociated with increasingly small structural component size.  Second, we demonstrated a method that uses new tooling technology to produce very small, very detailed hybrid material structural elements that promise to significantly increase the performanceof composite elements used to make high performance carbon/phenolic precursor structure for carbon/carbon heat pipe tubing.  KCI has secured commitments for two aerospace firms to supply matching funds to make comparative parts using more conventionalfabrication technology and KCI's new process, then to test the candidate parts made with new and old technology to verify the suitability of the new process for the fabrication of spaceflight-acceptable composites.  KCI's new composite fabricationtechnology directly supports current aerospace coilable boom manufacturers by allowing them to meet projected needs for smaller masts that will be used in lighter, less expensive, future spacescraft systems.

The low-strength/highstrain dissipating element in this unbonded brace concept may be extruded at low cost per foot, and then combined with a continuously wound or pultruded stiffening sleeve of composite materials to suppress low energy buckling failure modes.  While theconstruction materials embodied in this damper concept are more expensive than those in competing devices, there is very little touch labor in the fabrication and assembly of the KCI brace, making the installed cost competitive with existing products.  Thehigher weight-specific energy dissipation enabled by using advanced materials is therefore a bonus that may be especially useful in retrofit applications, where installation is more constrained by accessibility than new-build applications.The principal activities proposed for the Phase II project include scaling up the prototype brace designs of Phase I to full size, and testing representative examples both singly and in realistic steel-frame building configurations.

We also will establish an energy expenditure budget for hybrid striped bass to determine the required dietary energy necessary for growth, metabolism, and excretion. This integrated approach should lead to feed management strategies that result in significantly better and more cost-effective production strategies that can result from typical nutritional studies which emphasize growth rates alone. With a better understanding of these factors, we will be able to develop diets and feeding regimes which will increase production yield, improve water quality and decrease the cost of commercially-raised hybrid striped bass.

The proposed technique was conceptually demonstrated during Phase I laboratory experiments where the sensor reconstructed phase maps under highly scintillated conditions that could not accurately be reconstructed usingconventional wavefront sensors.  The Phase II testing will be done at the Lincoln Laboratory Advanced Concepts Laboratory in parallel with a conventional wavefront sensor to allow direct comparison between the two technologies and where the  sensor can becoupled to a deformable mirror.  The distorted grating wavefront sensing technique has the potential of overcoming existing shortfalls in wavefront sensing by providing increased accuracy, improved optical efficiency, and relaxed alignment requirements.",

        "abstract": "The Electronic Systems Command (ESC) of the U. S. Air Force has funded the development of a variety of C3I systems, raising concerns about excess cost and effort due to overlapping components and functionality. This concern motivated ESC to developschedulers by the product line approach. Our Planware project addresses the fact that the core functionality of scheduling is diverse, and that no small set of library components can hope to cover the range of Air Force scheduling needs and handle themwith acceptable performance and schedule quality.  Systems that solve complex problems will require more specialization than is possible from a library of source-code-level components.  Code components have many design decisions built-in, such as datastructure representations, algorithms, and interface communication mechanisms.  All too often these design decisions aren't optimal for a required usage context.  Our Planware project is based in the following insight: the essence of a code component liesin its abstract functionality, together with the abstract design knowledge that it embodies.  If abstract functionality can be formally specified, and abstract design knowledge can be formalized, then it is possible to generate components that fit a givenusage context by composing functionality and abstract design knowledge.",

        "abstract": "60679       The DOE Fuel Cells for Buildings program is developing Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell system components for building cogeneration applications.  The system uses natural gas to produce a reformate, which is the feed gas to the fuel cell.  This reformate contains carbon monoxide (CO), which must be removed to prevent poisoning the fuel cell elements and the subsequent degradation of its performance.  This project will develop technology to remove the carbon monoxide and thus improve fuel cell performance.  Carbon monoxide will be reacted with hydrogen in the reformate to produce water-soluble products that can be scrubbed from the reformate by water and discarded without recycle.  This purification system would operate at mild conditions and consume minimal amounts of hydrogen.  Phase I established the technical feasibility of a novel catalytic technology for fuel cell reformate purification, achieving CO purification at temperatures from about 80 to 130\u00bfC, and at pressures less than two atmospheres.  It was shown that CO concentrations could be reduced to 10 ppm at steady operating conditions and under 100 ppm at transient conditions.  The cost of the purification system appears compatible with the overall cost goal of $1500/kW for an installed PEM fuel cell system.  Phase II will optimize the catalysts for peak system performance, evaluate the catalysts under realistic reactive conditions, construct and test a larger prototype for design and demonstration, and conduct an economic evaluation of the technology.                         Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The technology should solve an important problem that currently restricts the application of fuel cells for building and transportation systems.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to expose experimental rodents    \n to alcohol over periods of hours to days is crucial to research. At present,       \n the methods used to do so include repeated injections, feeding the animals a       \n liquid diet containing alcohol, or group-housing them in large chambers through    \n which alcohol vapors are circulated. The disadvantages of these methods include    \n the presence of a stressful procedure, an inadequate diet and/or the inability     \n to access individual animals while they are in the vapor environment. Under        \n Phase I, we developed a prototype that showed the feasibility of building          \n individual rat cages through which we could circulate known amount of alcohol      \n vapors. This system allowed us to develop charts which correlated blood alcohol    \n levels (BALs) to pre-determined parameters of alcohol delivery. Phase II will      \n expand the scientific ideas successfully explored under Phase I. As                \n investigators use different rat strains, both males and females, and want to       \n treat their animals for several days, we will develop charts for male and          \n female (both virgin and pregnant) Sprague-Dawley, Wistar and Long-Evans rats.      \n This is necessary because alcohol metabolism varies between strains and            \n genders, and changes during pregnancy. Consequently we cannot assume that the      \n charts developed under Phase I are applicable to other models. We will also        \n modify the existing rat prototype so that the chambers can accommodate food        \n holders and water bottles, as well as outlets for cannulae, while the integrity    \n of the system is maintained during long-term housing. A stand holding syringes     \n and/or the recording instruments will be built, that fits over the chambers.       \n Finally, we found that mice housed in rat chambers had very heterogeneous BALs.    \n Therefore an important aspect of our work will consist in building chambers for    \n mice, a species that is increasingly used in alcohol research, but which will      \n require a redesign of the system to accommodate their smaller size. Once this      \n new design has been determined, we will develop charts correlating parameters      \n of alcohol delivery to target BALs in mice of three commonly used strains,         \n BALB/c, C57BL/6 and DBA/2. The finished rat and mouse products will represent a    \n very significant improvement over presently available systems. It will be          \n versatile, user-friendly and affordable. While originally designed for alcohol     \n work, we anticipate that it will be easily modifiable for other volatile,          \n non-corrosive substances, including those that are presently difficult to study    \n because they are highly toxic.\n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nNot available",

        "abstract": "The monitoring and analysis of the structural integrity of buildings, bridges and machines is increasingly important as the average age of these structures increases and as buildings are built in more locations which are prone to natural disasters.Structural monitoring can be accomplished through the addition of a magnetostrictive material to structural members, either directly or through a composite.  Changes in the structure are reflected in stress-induced changes in the magnetic signature fromthe magnetostrictive material.  Microfluxgate sensors were demonstrated in Phase I to be capable of detecting such changes and to be suitable for integration with application specific integrated circuits (ASIC's) for inexpensive mass production.  In PhaseII, the ASIC will be produced and the microfluxgate integrated with it, resulting in a commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) product.  An array of such integrated sensors will be fabricated and tested, and a hand-held reading instrument and a transducer will bedesigned and prototyped.  The transducer will be designed to be used with commercially available data transmission and collection instrumentation systems.  In Phase III, final structural monitoring equipment will be designed and deployed.  Commercialproducts will also be designed for non-structural markets.",

In the case of TV-guided munitions, the difficulty stems from the need to preserve dynamicimage fidelity with respect to a weapon's seeker; a task which is very different from creating imagery which appears realistic to the human eye, and which cannot be performed by conventional video display devices. Our novel FEISTI technology, however,provides artifact-free imagery with negligible flicker at any frequency. From a seeker's perspective, each pixel of a FEISTI-based image fades smoothly from one brightness level to the next; the result being analogous to natural light illuminating areal-world scene. Using this technology, we propose to develop a visible-spectrum scene projector which can be mounted upon a flight motion simulator and which can supply high-resolution imagery that is both flickerless and highly uniform. The Phase IIprogram will result in the development of a dual-use projector which satisfies the simulation requirements of the Air Force while, at the same time, providing the prototype of a common test set which can support the field testing of several weaponssystems.",

        "abstract": "Power and brightness scaling of single-fiber lasers is limited by intrafiber damage intensity.  Hence, scaling to kW levels requires designs which coherently integrate the output of multiple fibers while, at the same time, avoiding nonlinear effects (suchas SBS) which limit the output power from a single fiber.  We have devised a technique whereby multiple fiber sources can be combined coherently to produce an output with an N-fold increase in power and with an N2-fold increase in brightness.  The specifictechnique involves a spectrally-tailored seed signal which feeds an array of equi-length fiber amplifiers.  By feeding all amplifiers from a common master, both synchronism in operating frequency and temporal coherence is achieved.  Each fiber amplifierincorporates a control element for precise control of the phase at its output; thereby allowing for synthesis of the required spatial phase front and, hence, the desired far-field beam profile.  Our approach toward achieving multi-kilowatt powers islargely insensitive to variation in fiber parameters, eliminates the need for precise control of multiple oscillators, suppresses parasitic nonlinear effects, and is infinitely scalable by virtue of its modularity.",

        "abstract": "Neural stem cells (NSCs) show a remarkable ability to migrate throughout the CNS, intermingle with host cells, and express foreign transgenes following transplantation. Intriguingly, this inherent migratory property of NSCs emulates the migratory pattern of some brain tumors, such as gliomas, characterized by invasive single cell migration. Potentially, the migratory properties of NSCs can be harnessed to disseminate therapeutic genes products to invading brain tumor cells. As the first step toward this goal, results from phase I studies demonstrated that human NSCs displayed significant tumor targeting migratory behavior toward gliomas while stable expressing a reporter gene. Phase II entails genetically modifying NSCs to express an array of therapeutic genes, and then assessing their potential to target tumor cells and elicit an anti-tumor response. It is anticipated that genetically modified NSCs will infiltrate the tumor mass, track individual tumor cells, and stably express oncolytic proteins that can destroy the cancerous cells in rodent models. These studies will advance the development of a potentially revolutionary treatment strategy using human NSCs as a novel, efficient delivery vehicle to target therapeutic genes to refractory brain tumors. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Neural stem cells represent a compelling new technology platform for the treatment of neurological diseases.

        "abstract": "A space-qualifiable laser with extraordinary frequency stability, small size, and high efficiency is required for proposed metrology systems. Nonplanar ring oscillators (NPROs) are the baseline technology for these systems. NPROs can reach the 1-Watt power required for proposed systems. However, we believe that a system built around a single, high-power NPRO is not the best design. An approach which will have lower linewidth, and lower power consumption, is a low-power NPRO amplified to a power of 1-Watt and greater by an Ytterbium-doped fiber amplifier (YDFA.) The advantages of an oscillator / amplifier configuration, compared to the conceptually simpler high-power oscillator, are that the frequency stability of lower-power oscillators is better than that of higher-power oscillators, and that Ytterbium fiber amplifiers are about twice as efficient as Neodymium oscillators, primarily because they do not require active cooling of pump diodes. An amplified system would have the good linewidth of the low-power NPRO, but with the low power consumption of the Ytterbium fiber amplifier. The goal of the proposed research program would be to experimentally demonstrate a laser source with the power, frequency stability and efficiency needed for use in a space-borne interferometer.",

Multilayer films consist of hundreds or thousands of alternating layers, and can be considerably stronger than the component materials. To use this technique for building optical filter foils, the polyimide fabrication process must be changed from a solution-cast method to vapor deposition. Vapor depositing polyimide could have several advantages in x-ray filter fabrication. It would permit the ultrathin layering required for multilayer film construction and would reduce film contamination resulting from vacuum cycling. The use of vapor deposition to produce freestanding polyimide/metal multilayer films may result in even stronger and thinner soft x-ray filters, which would allow larger and higher-performance instruments to be realized.",

        "abstract": "Cryptosporidium, originating from contamination of public drinking water supplies, ponds, rivers, or swimming pools, have cause large-scale and deadly outbreaks, which became a major cause of waterborne infectious diseases. Since 1991, the percent of outbreaks attributable to Cryptosporidium has doubled, and in the 1993-1994 period, 17 percent of all outbreaks were caused by Cryptosporidium. In 1996, 42 states reported 2,426 cases to the Centers for Disease Control. Such outbreaks prompted EPA to establish new regulations for monitoring raw and finished water systems. For instance, EPA's Information Collection Rule and Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule require that all large public water systems routinely conduct microbiological monitoring of raw and finished waters. Smaller utilities are likely to face compliance deadlines before 2004. Even though EPA's current recommended detection limit is 10 oocysts/L, the Agency likely will impose stricter requirements in the future. The currently available method for detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts, Method 1622, is very laborious, yields poor oocysts recovery, cannot be performed in the field, and needs highly trained professionals to accurately perform the analysis. This fluorescent microscopy-based method is strongly affected by nonspecific fluorescence by other organisms and chlorine compounds present in the sample. The proposed new method is based on two innovations, one which utilizes (di)electrophoretic separation, concentration, and focusing of Cryptosporidium oocysts in a microfluidic sensor, and the other using on-chip polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and electrochemical detection of DNA amplicons. The Phase I results clearly demonstrated the feasibility of electrical separation of Cryptosporidium oocysts as well as an enhanced and highly sensitive method for electrochemical detection of Cryptosporidium DNA amplicons. The results indicated that the full system development would provide competitive detection limits for in-field testing of oocysts and cysts. The Phase II project will further optimize the design parameters for separation and detection systems. A prototype microfluidic analyzer with on-chip PCR detection will be designed, built, and thoroughly tested. It is planned to perform an interlaboratory comparison of results obtained using the proposed method and the current EPA Method 1622/1623. Because of the simplicity of the design of new PCR primers and selective recognition of characteristic DNA templates, the proposed microfluidic analyzer will find a large number of applications in detection of other microorganisms in the field or on production lines, e.g., in food, chemical, environmental, or biotechnological industries. The same principles could be used for detection of cells in biological fluids; thus, the analyzer offers numerous biomedical and pharmaceutical applications.",

        "abstract": "It is estimated that there are approximately 300 million tires discarded each year in the United States and this is in addition to the 800 million scrap tires that reside in landfills and tire dumps throughout the country. About 180 million are recycled, and the remaining 120 million scrap tires are discarded (legally or illegally) in landfills or tire dumps. Current tire reuse technologies offer a considerable opportunity to generate valuable materials from what is essentially worthless scrap. There are significant market barriers preventing these technologies from reaching their economic potential. Considering all of the potential markets for crumb rubber as a polymer filler, the one with the greatest potential is the production of rubber pavements. However, inconsistencies in the quality of the final pavement have resulted in a decrease in popularity. During the Phase I effort, Lynntech successfully demonstrated a low-temperature process to generate surface modified crumb rubber. Addition of the chemically activated crumb rubber was shown to solve many of the problems associated with rubber pavement production. This new asphalt has improved settling characteristics, resistance to fatigue, and resistance to thermal cracking. The asphalt also had better high-temperature viscosity and the curing time was reduced by half compared to traditional crumb rubber blends. During the Phase II effort, Lynntech will expand on the scope of Phase I by building and testing a field deployable crumb rubber treatment system and, for proof of concept, Lynntech will use the treated crumb rubber to lay a test section of highway. The potential for success is high. Lynntech will be working with the Center for Asphalt and Materials Chemistry at Texas A&M University. The Center is recognized world wide for its advances in asphalt chemistry and has developed several formulations that have been used on several sections of highway in Texas.The commercial potential for this technology is enormous. Foresight Science and Technology performed an independent economic evaluation on the use of ozone-treated crumb rubber for pavement construction. The domestic market alone was estimated at $15 million for the first year of operation, increasing to $120 million after 5 years. During the course of the evaluation, Lynntech and Foresight have identified several other lucrative markets including automotive rubber products (tire retreads, hoses, belts, etc.), protective matting, and soil amendments. Lynntech has already identified several potential commercial partners who have invested resources into commercialization of this technology.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project describes an innovative combinatorial approach to the discovery of new electrocatalysts for electrochemical ozone generation. Ozone is increasingly being used in water treatment, as a sanitizing agent in the food industry and is preferred over chlorine and its derivatives. Electrochemical ozone generation, where ozone is generated by electrolysis of water, can potentially offer several cost and process advantages over the conventional electrical discharge methods of ozone generation. However, existing methods for generating ozone electrochemically use electrodes, which offer low Faradaic (i.e., current) efficiencies and have limited materials stability. In Phase I, ozone electrocatalysts were screened using a combinatorial approach, and two novel electrocatalysts for ozone formation were identified. A new rapid screening approach was also devised and will be used to evaluate focussed combinatorial arrays in Phase II. Phase II will identify the precise stoichiometries of the new ozone electrocatalysts using the techniques pioneered in Phase I. The catalysts will then be synthesized on a macro scale and evaluated in ozone cells using existing ozone electrocatalysts as a benchmark.\nThe catalysts identified during this project will enable a more cost-effective generation of ozone with applications in municipal water treatment, point-of-entry and point-of-use water treatment, food sanitation, medical waste treatment and medical sterilization. Ozone could also be utilized in the chemical industry as a replacement for chlorine in a variety of processes, e.g. paper and pulp bleaching.",

        "abstract": "60924       The development of affinity membranes has the potential to offer a quantum leap in membrane-based separation technology.  Current polymeric membrane researchers modify surface functionality to offer a specific affinity; however, in the area of inorganic membranes, few similar activities exist.  This project will develop an affinity inorganic membrane that can demonstrate separations based upon affinity while still maintaining its material stability under harsh environments.  The membrane will be formed with a unique type of inorganic material (with a specific affinity to CO2) that will be supported on porous ceramic substrates.  In addition to CO2 affinity, the membrane will not exhibit the hydrothermal stability deficiencies of existing microporous inorganic membranes, seen in many industrial applications.  In Phase I, several membranes were prepared and enhanced CO2 transport was demonstrated.  Preliminary surface characterization results indicated that the intrinsic hydrothermal stability of this inorganic material was excellent.  Phase II will optimize the membrane synthesis technique in order to develop an optimized affinity membrane.  A comprehensive functional performance evaluation to demonstrate active transport and excellent hydrothermal stability will be conducted.                 Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: Many existing and emerging applications should benefit from the use of a CO2 affinity inorganic membrane, including CO2 removal in natural gas processing, landfill gas recovery, power generation, and hydrogen production.",

        "abstract": "The capability to precisely locate and identify radio frequency (RF) threats in real time is critical for warfighter system of systems environments that utilize multiple sensors. Developmental radar warning sensors such as the Precision Location andIdentification (PLAID) and special receiver collection systems determine precise threat location or identify by making extremely accurate parameter measurements of Doppler/phase shifts, angle-of-arrival (AOA), and time difference of arrival (TDOA).Open-air ranges cannot provide dense emitter environments, nor the controlled, repeatable conditions essential for valid and affordable testing. Current DOD laboratory testing facilities and commercial simulations cannot simulate all the detailed, finegrain signal characteristics required to effectively test PLAID technologies. Innovative simulation concepts are required that can generate appropriate RF signal modulations with an accuracy/resolution exceeding the measurement capability of PLAID sensors.This Phase II SBIR will develop and build a creative design concept called the Advanced TDOA, AOA, and Phase (ATAP) threat simulation that addresses the critical technology challenges of testing PLAID sensors. A prototype ATAP system, as designed in thePhase I will be fabricated and demonstrated in the AFRL/SN Integrated Demonstrations and Applications Laboratory (IDAL). Phase II will result in a simulator prototype single channel design, that is readily expandable into a multi-channel system withpotential applications as a commercial product. ATAP will have a high payoff by reducing development risk and testing cost by enabling rapdi prototyping of hardware design and softeware algorithms in a controlled environment.  ATAP is adaptable tocommercial Automated Test Equipment (ATE) applications to test Air Traffic Control Systems, Microwave Landing Systems (MLS), cellulat telephones, Global Position (GPS), and VHF/UHF communications. It is also useful as a commercial tool for testing ECM/ESMsystems in aircraft (B-2, F-15, F-22, etc.) integration laboratories. With high gain amplifiers and antennas, ATAP has applications in open air range testing, and EW combat simulation and training.",

Unlike any other process currently available      \n for mRNA purification, this instrument uses a derivative of the electrophoretic    \n separation technology that was previously developed by our company for DNA         \n purification in conjunction with a novel mRNA separation method and collection     \n process. The separation technique is powerful in that can be performed with the    \n combination of a multi-channel, disposable sample cassette and an inexpensive      \n processing instrument. The availability of this instrument and its supplies        \n will save countless hours of medical and biological research in labs that          \n currently perform manual mRNA isolation. In Phase I, we tested this automated      \n method and showed that it satisfactorily purified multiple samples of mRNA in      \n less than 30 minutes. We showed that the purification method could be used on a    \n wide range of starting cell numbers or tissue weights and still yield highly       \n pure, biologically active mRNA.                                                    \n                                                                                    \n The instrument that we will research and develop in Phase II will purify mRNA      \n directly from the cell or tissue lysate by a fully automated, two step             \n procedure that can process up to 96 samples in parallel. The instrument is         \n projected to cost less than $10,000 to the end user, with disposable costs of      \n $1.5 per sample. These features will make the instrument at least two times        \n faster and half the cost per sample of any automated product currently             \n available. The instrument will be several times less expensive than competitor     \n products, and thus affordable to smaller labs.                                     \n PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\n The methods and products developed in this work will be commericalized by MacConnell\n Research Corp. in the form of instruments and disposable cassettes that can be marketed\n to the 50,000 molecular biology laboratories worldwide.  These products will greatly \n enhance the capability of researchers studying genetic disease, viral infection and \n cellular mechanisms at the molecular level.",

        "abstract": "To overcome the problems and performance limitations of traditional electronic compass designs and to achieve better performance at a lower cost, an innovative, simpler, more robust magnetic heading sensor is being developed.  The approach is based on thethesis that heading sensor accuracy can be made better (and the heading sensor less complex and expensive) than traditional electronic compass designs. The approach employs the scanning magnetic angle comparator (SMAC) technique, which offers distinctadvantages over conventional electronic compasses, because there are additional degrees of freedom to optimize performance by using feedback via a microprocessor to minimize error. During Phase I, an extensive error model analysis was performed.  Theanalysis predicted an achievable accuracy of 0.1-degrees at 30-degrees latitude. The design study demonstrated the feasibility of implementing a precision, solid-state, non-inertial, self-calibrating heading sensor at a production cost of under $1,000using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) magnetic sensors and electronic components. During Phase II, a prototype -- 0.875-incles diameter and approximately 4.0-inches long -- will be developed.

        "abstract": "The goal of the proposed SBIR Phase 2 program is to demonstrate a new magnetic detection platform technology in a next generation instrument that is capable of performing ultra-sensitive homogeneous assays for a wide range of analytes. The novel magnetic detection system will take advantage of major advances in high-temperature (high-Tc) SQUID sensors that enables the quantitative measurements of a small number of magnetic labels. We will develop a prototype instrument that is targeted at detection in the sub-attomolar range. While the sensitivity is a major strength, we will also focus on demonstrating a homogeneous format capability and an ability to work with small volumes of analyte, both of which are important for high throughput screening. We will perform head-to-head comparisons of magnetic immunoassays on cytokines with established detection techniques. We will additionally investigate the suitability of the instrumentation to the very important area of DNA probes. In theory, the sensitivity is so great that the potential exists to provide a simple and efficient alternative to PCR or other target amplifications systems. The commercial impact of this detection technology platform is enormous and ranges from high throughput screening for drug discovery to the clinical diagnostic DNA probe market. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Our goal is to develop a bench-top magnetic immunoassay detector to meet the needs of research and clinical laboratories where high sensitivity is required and existing techniques are limited by cost, throughput, sensitivity, or toxicity. While the initial instrument to be developed is targeted at a sizable research market, this new immunoassay system has potential to compete in many segments of the much larger ($5 billion/year world-wide) commercial clinical market. In addition the sensitivity of this technology may ultimately allow us to perform DNA analysis without performing a PCR amplification step and would find significant commercial and research application.",

The electronics incorporate a novel architecture based on a digital signal processor, facilitating powerful data processing and sensor network applications. The reference laser is an inexpensive,highly efficient semiconductor, stabilized for part-per-million wavenumber calibration by an inexpensive quartz etalon.This instrument is particularly suitable for field applications, including standoff and point detection of chemical and biological contamination, as well as remote sensing from aircraft. Special versions will be capable of 1000 scans per second withresolution-limited throughput. Commercial applications include a wide range of process and quality control, laboratory research, field measurements and remote sensing. The modularity makes it readily configurable for a variety of applications. The highperformance characteristics and inherent low cost ensure a significant market share.",

        "abstract": "Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) has become a very popular tool in many  areas of inquiry including surface science, semiconductor electronic  devices and integrated circuit design and testing, biology and chip-tissue  interface, to name a few. Here we propose to develop and commercialize a  relatively new family of local probes capable of performing  electromagnetic measurements with nearly atomic resolution over a wide  frequency range covering up to 100 GHz. Potential applications of these so  called near-field or evanescent probes (EMP) are in surface science,  chemical sensing, molecular electronics and molecular spectroscopy,  biological studies, quantum computing, IC industry and manufacturing  quality control to name a few. Composed of a co-planar wave-guide  terminated by an AFM compatible cantilever beam with a co-axial tip, these  EMP's were designed and tested during a Phase I SBIR and the current  proposal is to optimize the performance and fabrication technology. To  facilitate their wide spread use by the SPM community, we will also  develop a microwave instrumentation unit (MIU) that can be used to  retrofit commercial SPM units and enable them to use our EMP's for  microwave imaging of various specimens. We will also develop, design and  fabricate a variety of calibration samples as standards for EMP  calibration and quantification of its output signal. We have estimated  that about 100 laboratories around the world would be interested in an  add-on package and would be valued at $20000 for a total of $2,000,000.  The market for replacement tips would be about 5000 tips at $100 per tip  for a total market of $500,000 per year.",

This project will develop a continuous reactor to economically produce high-yield SWNT using coal-based materials.   The proposed reactor will utilize a flow-through design and allow control of production parameters, including catalyst composition and particle size, catalyst/coal ratio, temperature of reaction and annealing zones, and reaction time.  The use of low cost coal-based materials as source of carbon, catalyst, and promoter will assure the low cost of the product.  Phase I demonstrated that SWNT in good yield can be produced from coal based material.  A plasma system, based on inductive coupling plasma, was developed and tested.  Although the SWNT products were produced at moderate yield, the approach was shown to have potential for large-scale production and to be synergetic with the coal powder form.  In Phase II, a flexible reactor design will be developed to introduce coal-based materials in powder form.  A mathematical model that takes reaction parameters into account will be used to simulate the SWNT production process.  The approaches will be scaled-up to produce commercial quantities of this novel and versatile material.                    Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: High-yield, low cost SWNT should find a significant market in such applications as field emission devices, memory devices (high density memory arrays, memory logic switching arrays), Nano-MEMs, AFM imaging probes, distributed diagnostics sensors, and strain sensors.

Non-oxide ceramics such as AlN present a significant challenge for traditional metallization approaches used for conventional oxides.  State-of-the-art commercial metallizing techniques for non-oxide ceramics have poor adhesion, are often cracked at the interface, and are rough and unreliable.  This project will examine metal ion implantation into the AlN substrate with a transition to a controlled microstructure metal coating as a low cost reliable process to apply highly adherent metal coatings to AlN when substituting for beryllia.  Phase I demonstrated that pulsed ion beam processing can be used to implant metals into the AlN surface with a transition to a controlled microstructure.  The ion beam implanted metallized coatings on AlN had adhesive strengths greater than 80 MPa, the limit of the tester, whereas commercial metallized AlN strengths were under 50 MPa.  A thermal resistance test showed that the metallized AlN was at least 20% better than commercial metallized beryllia despite beryllia\u00bfs higher thermal conductivity.  Phase II will address low cost optimization and process development, leading to the commercial demonstration of several applications of beryllia substitution.

However, it is difficult to join the alloys because the dispersed oxides agglomerate, thus compromising the mechanical properties of the base material.  Diffusion bonding, in which two clean surfaces are joined by diffusion under high temperature and pressure, would be a candidate solution, but residual surface oxide contamination can cause lower fracture toughness and ductility of the joint.   This project will utilize a pulsed electric field during diffusion bonding to join ODS intermetallic materials at lower pressures and shorter times.  In this processing technique, no alloying elements are used in the joined interface, leading to joint strengths near those of the base material at high temperature.   In Phase I, MA956 rods that were diffusion-bonded for only 30 minutes at low pressure, using pulsed-electric field conditions, showed substantially higher strength than specimens fabricated without the pulsed electric field.  Ultrasonic and x-ray analysis suggested that the pulsed electric field enhanced metal diffusion across the interface.   In Phase II, the pulse-bonding technology will be statistically tested using a wider range of experimental conditions, including pressure, variation of temperature, and pulsing conditions.  High-temperature tensile testing will be conducted on MA956 and Fe3Al rods and tubes.

A number of these advanced materials have potential applications both in the military and commercial sector.  The applications of PIM have been limited due to the inability of the process to produce small number of largecomplex shaped components of advanced materials, in an economical manner (using low cost tooling and powders) using an environmental friendly process.  Phase I studies have investigated and proven that large PIM components can be molded and processed fromadvanced materials, using a combination of innovative low/medium pressure injection molding and inexpensive tooling.  Phase II will build on the concept of fabricating large, near-net shaped PIM components made from advanced materials in an economical andenvironmentally friendly way.  This will be achieved through the innovative combination of new low viscosity feedstock that lends itself to a novel environmentally friendly organic binder extraction process, use of low/medium pressure injection molding,use of low cost soft tooling and powder, and exploration of both conventional and microwave assisted sintering.",

The proposed Phase II will build on the success of the Phase I feasibilitystudies that showed the active solder joined Gr-foam core heat exchangers to have over 15 x the heat transfer capacity as aluminum finned heat exchangers.  Phase I developments resulted in the development of Gr-foams bonded to aluminum, copper and Al:SiCthermal base planes with heat transfer coefficients of over 15,000 W/m2K.  This major advance in heat transfer capacity promises to revolutionize heat exchanger designs.  The proposed Phase II research aims complete the developments on Phase I and toadvance the fabrication technology sufficiently to prove its capability to produce cost effective thermal management devices in emerging, fast growing market applications.  Proposed Phase II research emphasizes demonstrators with applications in 1)directly cooled silicon devices, II) IC packaging cooling devices, iii) IGBT cooling modules, and iv) cross flow fluid cooling radiators for engine cooling.  MRi proposes to team with technology sources, suppliers and end users to advance the design,fabrication and test of such demonstration devices.  MRi is proposing to join with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), POCO Graphite, Thermacore and Performance Research to complete the critical developments and analyses of the proposed Gr-foam corethermal management devices.  Phase II research will focus on proving the bonded Gr-foams' effectiveness in such high value added applications and contribute to the validation of this technology.  The market potential for Gr-foam core heat exchangers has apotential by 2010 of over $500 Million, based on wide spread use in cooling high end servers, telecommunications, avionics, phased array radar, high power electronics and in high performance automotive and industrial heat exchangers, as well as in similarDoD applications.  This market potential will be realized as the costs of the Gr-foams are lowered with an increase of market penetration, starting with successful high value applications where the increased performance capacity of the bonded Gr-foamsexceeds the increased costs.",

The current proposal seeks to develop a new form of immunotherapy usingdendritic cell (DC) based DNA vaccines to combat this serious disease.  During Phase I, DC were isolated and transfected with 3 genes believed important in cytotoxic T cell (TC) killing of prostate cancer cells.  The transfected DC remained functional andfurther enhanced TC proliferation rates by 40-50% versus controls.  In addition, initial results showed that TC which had been cultured with the transfected DC caused 16-40% cytotoxicity in target prostate tumor cells.

        "abstract": "Chemical warfare agents such as bis-(b-chloroethyl) sulfide (HD) pose a significant threat to U.S. military and civilian populations. Exposure of skin to HD causes burn-like symptoms such as erythema, edema and severe incapacitating vesication(blistering).  To combat this threat, prophylactic and/or therapeutic interventions to HD exposure are needed. Development of such interventions requires an understanding of the mechanism of action of HD. However, a major impediment to understanding ofHD-induced pathogenesis is lack of an adequate experimental model system of human skin.  Since current models do not possess the appropriate attributes for HD research such as a complete basement membrane with dermal/epidermal adhesion structures, an invitro human skin model for HD-related studies is needed.  The purpose of the current proposal is to develop an in vitro human skin model suitable for HD research.  The model will contain human keratinocytes and/or fibroblasts and will possess allmorphological and ultrastructural features required for HD research. The model's response to HD or HD analogues will be investigated in terms of biochemical effects leading to blister formation.  The model will also be utilized to gain a mechanisticunderstanding of HD-induced vesication and to investigate prophylactic and/or therapeutic interventions to HD exposure.  In addition to providing a model which will greatly facilitate sulfur mustard vesication studies, this work will lead to a fullthickness skin model which will allow the study of numerous dermis-based skin phenomena such as photoaging, photodamage, wound healing and cancer progression.  This improved tissue model will be useful to the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry inirritancy and efficacy testing of their new products.",

The best cell lines were transformed        \n with a well-known viral oncogene and could be expanded by 1000 fold in culture.    \n A supplemental experiment showed that the cells could be cloned; in this           \n non-optimized experiment, the most successful clone maintained on LC phenotype,    \n exhibited log phase growth with a doubling time of 2.75 days, and had expanded     \n 40,000 fold as of the date of submission of this proposal. Cryopreservation did    \n not affect the ability of the cells to proliferate and the phenotype of the        \n cells could be modulated with cytokines. The morphology of the cells remained      \n dendritice and ultrastructural analysis confirmed that the cells contained         \n Birbeck granules, the key ultrastructural feature of Langerhans cells (LC).        \n Phenotypic characterization of cells showed that the cells could be matured        \n into LC, as evidenced by high levels of CD1 a expression. In addition, in a        \n functional assay, the cell lines retained their ability to stimulate T-cells in    \n a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Phase II research will expand on the Phase I    \n results. Initial studies will focus on the ability to further enhance the          \n proliferate capacity and lifespan of the cells. The cells lines produced will      \n be cloned and the phenotype, chemokine receptors, ultrastructure , gene            \n expression and karotype of the resultant clones will be characterized.             \n Chemotactic and phagocytic properties of the cells will be evaluated and the       \n utility of the cell lines will be demonstrated in HIV infection and cancer         \n immuno-therapy studies.

Phase 2 Focus. Phase 2 is focused on implementing adaptive technology andsupplemental curriculum for Anatomy and Physiology. Although commercialization issues are important, most of these issues will be deferred to the Commercialization Phase post Phase 2. Only relevant aspects will be included into Phase 2 planning andimplementation and these will be noted when applicable.  The content and technology Medsn would produce for Phase II would be commercialized in the Pharmaceutical/Medical Device Industry and other markets. It will open a new market for an additionalrevenue stream. Medsn is currently focused on offering products and services to the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device industry. Some of the company's current customer list includes AstraZeneca, Roche, Johnson & Johnson (various divisions), Eli Lilly,Medtronic and Guidant. There is an established need in these industries for training their Sales Representatives in Anatomy and Physiology related topics. Furthermore, the technology developed for Phase II would be adopted to enhance the instructionaldesign and delivery of instruction to our current customers. We will able to re-use and re-deploy the content that we are building for Phase II for current and future clients. The pharmaceutical and medical device companies which have over 85,000 salespeople in the U.S. can utilize various modules from Anatomy and Physiology curriculum that we will build in Phase II. Pharmaceutical and Medical Device companies will able to utilize the modules being created as foundation level educational programs.Another potential new market would be the EMT Training market. The curriculum being developed for Phase II can be readily applied to educating Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT), spanning the civilian and military markets. on key characteristics of thecivilian EMT market. We have to have a final product that we will able to test market with potential customers. During Phase 2 we will continue to develop the commercialization plan and conducting test marketing to validate the need for the learningmodules that will develop during Phase 2. Fully commercialization roll-out will occur after a full set of modules as outlined in this document are built and tested on our e-learning platform.",

While, untapped sources exist, including off-gas and fuel gas streams generated on-site, hydrogen recovery has been problematic.  Membranes have been used for this application but membrane failure caused by plasticization and condensation of heavy hydrocarbons has led to a shutdown of a number of plants.  In this project a new class of membrane material that is completely inert to hydrocarbons will be developed.  These membranes do not fail after exposure to hydrogen vapors or condensed liquids.  In Phase I, membrane performance was evaluated in bench-scale membrane stamp and membrane module tests.  Experiments showed that the membranes were able to withstand exposure to high hydrocarbon partial pressures up to saturation without being damaged, and that they retained their useful properties.  A technical and economic analysis was performed.   In Phase II, the membranes will be optimized and produced on industrial-scale membrane casting and coating equipment.  The best membranes will be incorporated into modules.  The process will be scaled up and evaluated in the laboratory and in field tests at cooperating refineries.

Phase I research has clearly shown that        \n daily supplementation with HMB/Arg/Gln was effective in preventing and             \n reversing the weight and muscle mass losses in stage IV cancer patients who        \n were undergoing various regimens of chemotherapy.

Light scattered by reflection and refraction from droplets immersedin a laser sheet is recorded holographically to yield the smallest possibleprobe volume and correspondingly largest number density. Phase I analyses andexperiments demonstrated that the 3-D capability of holography makes globalspray measurements in dense sprays possible with the proposed technique. Datafrom Phase I confirms the high accuracy of the interferometric technique andsuggests the path to develop a prototype system. We propose to develop a systemcapable of searching and finding scattered light features as a function ofposition (3-D), filtering the signals, and performing automatic image analysisthat correlate frequency information to particle size. The proposed system willbe based on digital holography, which is capable of recording the scatteredlight wavefront from a population of droplets illuminated by a pulsed lasersheet and of subsequently producing the droplet size distribution as a functionof position anywhere and everywhere on the sheet.",

Computer simulations,analytical calculations and laboratory experiments were performed to arrive at a systemarchitecture that would satisfy the high-speed measurement requirements associatedwith landmine detection. The most promising of these methods is the basis for theinstrument to be developed and fielded during Phase II. This innovative LDV instrumentwill enable the measurement of small ground velocities at rates that are two orders ofmagnitude faster than is presently possible. The instrument would initially measure aone-meter span from a standoff distance of two to six meters but it would be expandableto larger spans in the future.

These games have no minimax solution.  Instead, Nash showed that every finite multi-person, general sumgame has at least one equilibrium outcome in mixed strategies.  A set of pure or mixed strategies, one for each player, is said to be in equilibrium if no one player can change his strategy unilaterally and gain a higher payoff.

Some Noise Abatement procedures are difficult to implement for the controller, pilot, or both. In such cases, automated assistance for the controller may improve the effectiveness of the Noise Abatement procedure, by allowing aircraft to be vectored to follow the procedure more accurately.Metron has advanced the state of the art in aircraft noise modeling to the point that it is now possible to conduct noise modeling in real-time with sufficient accuracy to support controller decisions. This proposed effort will investigate the feasibility of a system which will predict noise footprints for individual flights based on current atmospheric conditions. These flight-by-flight analyses will then be used to generate alternative routes if the noise footprint is found to impact areas of significant population density. The generation of departure routes to decrease the impact of noise will then result in departure vector advisories to be displayed to the controller.",

The existing TSPs provide an effective physical barrier to CWAs butpossess no destructive capacity toward the CWAs, thus limiting their long-term effectiveness and posing an unnecessary hazard to personnel. The incorporation of catalytically reactive materials capable of neutralizing chemical warfare agents, nerve agentsand/or vesicants, would markedly enhance the efficacy of TSPs and reduce risk to personnel.  Under the Phase I SBIR program METSS was able to identify and synthesize several catalytically reactive chemical enzymes capable of neutralizing common CWAsimulants in an extremely time effective manner.  Furthermore, METSS was able to incorporate these chemistries into a representative TSP cream formulation and verify enhanced barrier performance through the destruction of test simulants.  The results ofthe Phase I program efforts clearly demonstrate the technical feasibility of developing reactive TSPs using chemistries that are commerciality available and readily incorporated into existing TSP formulations.  The resultant creams are stable and highlyreactive.

The formulations developed by METSS were subjected to tests derived from SAE AMS 1424 for aircraft.  BOD and CODtests were performed to assess environmental impact. Additional tests, developed by METSS, were carried out to evaluate specific materials compatibility issues originating from the application of these fluids onto helicopter components.  The results of thePhase I program clearly indicate the technical feasibility of developing effective deicing/anti-icing fluids based on carbohydrate and lactate systems that address environmental impact issues without compromising performance.  Near term commercializationof the proposed systems will be supported by commercial development efforts already initiated by METSS for other deicing/anti-icing technologies targeted for aircraft, runway and other transportation and facility applications.

The instruments used for in vitro embryo production (IVP) have not changed dramatically over several decades. This research is aimed at development, testing and optimization of microfluidic devices and associated procedures for in vitromaturation (IVM), in vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo culture (EC) of bovine embryos. The three specific aims of this proposal are: 1) to develop Polydimeythlsiloxane (PDMS-based) devices for dynamic IVP studies, 2) to study the effect of dynamic flow conditions on IVM, IVF and EC separately and in combination, and 3) to explore the use of microfluidic, tectonic-based microsystems for IVP. Currently, static culture is the standard practice for IVP of mammalian embryos. The dynamic systems that are being used currently use flow rates several orders of magnitude higher than the proposed system. The proposed system will allow precise control of fresh medium past the oocytes/embryos, and allow the composition of the medium to be gradually changed over a period of time. These microfluidic systems will provide embryos with dramatically improved microenvironments that more closely mimic in vitro conditions and lead to improved embryonic development.",

Splitless injection, purification of the air supply, decreased data     \n rate collection and concentration of the sample provide an increase in             \n sensitivity of more than 1,600,000X. Lysis of blood cells by saponin or            \n detergents coupled with filtration greatly reduces contamination of the            \n bacterial fatty acids by blood components. New algorithms show promise for         \n reducing the impact of blood components and for naming the components of           \n polymicrobic cultures. A novel technique for rapid derivatization of fatty         \n acids shows promise of very rapid identification of the pathogens. As patient      \n care costs exceed $1,000 per day, the new technique could produce great health     \n care cost savings. Additionally, by allowing targeted treatment and decreased      \n recovery times, the technique should reduce patient suffering and aid in           \n reducing the number of nosocomial infections.  \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nNot Available",

Phase I has demonstrated a novel, low-cost method able to produce a variety ofnanopowders of tailored size and composition.  The results from Phase I have established a solid ground for this Phase II plan, which will focus on producing yttria stabilized zirconia nanopowders that have dual applications in both the military andcivilian sectors.  We will work on: (1) optimizing our process to control nanopower properties, (2) developing an efficient collection and dispersion system, and (3) scaling the process to commercial production levels.MircoCoating Technologies has developed its proprietary device-the Naomiser.  This innovative atomizer is capable of producing uniform, submicron aerosol, and order of magnitude smaller than those achieved by currently available state-of-the-art atomizersusing ultrasonics and electrostatic processes.  Processing of these aerosols directly leads to the formation of desired nanopowders.  This process provides three major advantages: (1) low cost, (2) high quality nanopowders, and (3) continuous operation.Successes in this Phase II research will lead to a commercially viable technology in the production of nanopowders.

        "abstract": "60370          Internal tin Nb3Sn superconducting strands and Rutherford cables are the focus of superconducting magnet fabrications for high field physics applications.  During magnet processing and operation, the strands and cables are subjected to large stresses and it is essential that these cables and their insulation perform under these conditions.  In addition, the insulation for the superconducting wires and cables should be capable of withstanding temperatures over 600-800\u00bfC, the reaction temperature of Nb and Sn filaments when forming superconductor.  This project seeks to produce high dielectric strength, high modulus, and ultra-thin ceramic insulator for internal tin Nb3Sn superconducting strands and Rutherford cables.  The insulation would not only substantially improve magnet performance, eliminating complex coil fabrication steps and lowering production cost, but also enable new designs that would allow superconducting magnets to achieve maximum field strength and system lifetime.  In Phase I, a patented Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition (CCVD) technique was used to deposit silica, boron-doped silica, and silica/alumina coatings onto unreacted, internal tin Nb3Sn wire as electrical insulation.  These coatings were found to insulate over 200 V under face-to-face contact breakdown voltage tests.  In Phase II, experiments will focus on optimizing the CCVD process parameters to deposit insulating coatings onto the internal tin multifilament single strands and Rutherford cables.  Mechanical properties of the coatings and the resultant coated wires will be investigated.  The reel-to-reel system will be fully automated and capable of coating practical lengths of wire for magnet fabrication.                      Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awaredee: The use CCVD to deposit thin, high modulus, high dielectric strength, and thermal\u00bfmechanically compatible insulation to internal tin Nb3Sn superconducting strands and Rutherford cables should enable novel designs in superconducting magnet for the application of high field physics.  The CCVD process also could be used to produce multi-component ceramics because of its flexibly in doping and composing elements in the coating.  The CCVD process can be used to manufacture long-length wire because of its scalability.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's abstract) Poisoning from ethylene glycol is a            \n potentially lethal medical emergency but can be treated effectively when           \n recognized early. Conversely, when diagnosis is late, the outcome is usually       \n poor. The major pathogenic factor is metabolic acidosis from glycolic acid         \n (glycolate). Because laboratory testing for ethylene glycol and glycolate is       \n severely restricted, timely diagnosis depends on comparatively nonspecific         \n physical signs and laboratory tests.                                               \n                                                                                    \n Lack of access to specific testing and need for differentiation from conditions    \n featuring similar symptoms constitute a unique medical dilemma. Recognizing        \n these deficiencies we propose to develop novel, specific enzymic assays for        \n ethylene glycol and glycolate. Two product configurations are perceived: 1)        \n aqueous reagents for existing clinical analyzers (serum, quantitative); 2) a       \n dry-chemistry, dual-analyte point-of-care testrip method (whole blood,             \n semi-quantitative).The POC method is a dual-analyte test tab device for the        \n simultaneous estimation of ethylene glycol and glycolate from approximately two    \n (2) microliters of whole blood without centrifugation or any other form of         \n sample or reagent handling. To make such a level of miniaturization and            \n simplicity feasible, we have developed a capillary fill sampling technique         \n permitting specimen dosing, plasma separation, and red cell removal in one         \n wholly integrated step. Because of rapid metabolism of (flontoxic) ethylene        \n glycol and the longer half life of (toxic) glycolate, the latter provides          \n better prognostic information and improved clinical sensitivity, especially        \n late post-ingestion. Thus, rapid and simultaneous availability of test results     \n for both analytes expands the window of diagnostic/therapeutic opportunity.        \n Socioeconomic benefits are: 1) reducing expensive gas chromatographic              \n screening, confirmatory and other testing; 2) averting late or unnecessary         \n treatment; 3) cutting intensive care and hospital stay; 4) abating long term       \n morbidity (renal dialysis).                                                        \n PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\n Most current gas chromatographic screening and confirmatory methods for ethylene glycol \n require derivatization, sample pretreatment and special columns.  Direct methods are fraught\n with analytical problems such as peak overlap and trailing.  Cases have been reported where\n other compounds were identified as ethylene glycol with serious consequences.  All methods\n require specialized equipment unavailable in most laboratories, are technically demanding, \n time consuming, and relatively insensitive.   For these reasons access to timely and reliable\n testing for ethylene glycol is extremely limited.  Testing for the clinically more sensitive and\n relevant toxic metabolite glycolic acid is essentially non-existant.  Not a single routine clinical\n analyzer currently exists offering either an ethylene glycol or glycolate method.  The \n proposed products would solve these problems.",

        "abstract": "Mide is proposing to develop actuators based on Ferromagnetic Shape Memory Alloy(FSMA).  FSMA's are a new class of actuator materials showing the large strains of shape memory alloys with faster response.  This is due to their magnetic, rather than thermalenergy input.  Phase I experiments concluded that Ni-Mn-Ga FSMA had the potential to achieve strains up to 6% under the influence of a magnetic field.  Further developments in the field have included successful modeling of the material's response toapplied fields and development of a prototype linear actuator.  Phase II will address the further application of this technology and the development of material production methods suitable for larger volume.In Phase II Mide will take the technology out of the laboratory and into application.  Mide has partnered with Sturman Industries in developing applications for this material.  Mide has also partnered with ETREMA to develop single crystal processingmethods suitable for high volume production.  The Phase II research will develop FSMA from an exciting new material into a viable actuator technology.  This technology will bridge some of the gap in active materials between slow, high strain shape memoryalloys and fast, low strain piezoelectric and magnetostrictive.  The new material will open new markets such as pumping to active materials where presently piezoelectrics and magnetostrictives have strain insufficient to overcome the copressibility ofdissolved gassed, and shape memory alloys are too slow.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on developing nanotechnology reagents and tools for the emerging field of proteomics. The technology is modular. This means that universal reagents are produced to which an end-user can, in a simple step, attach any protein or antibody for a variety of biological assays. The detection technology under development is electronic. Electronic detection can be readily multiplexed for high throughput assays. Large numbers of experiments can be simultaneously analyzed, over short periods of time, using state of the art electronics techniques like time-division multiplexing. Since the output of the technology is electronic, massive data sets can be directly transferred to bioinformatics systems for automated analysis and storage. The technology uses cheap off the shelf components coupled with proprietary state of the art, nanotechnology reagents. The speed and multiplexing capabilities of the technology make it orders of magnitude less expensive than existing or competing technologies. The technology will be tailored to the special needs of proteomics: the study of the function of the gene products, proteins. With the sequencing of the human genome nearing completion, the need for tools to facilitate the study of proteomics is a high priority near-term application.\nPharmaceutical companies would use this technology to identify families of proteins that are implicated in disease and construct databases that define networks of interacting proteins to determine points of intervention and potential drug targets. End-users will prefer to use the proposed technology because it will be more cost effective, sensitive, faster and flexible enough to adapted to many user applications.",

These technologies will, for the first time, enable       \n effective, high throughput drug screening that will identify novel compounds       \n that block ligand-receptor interactions on the surface of live cells. We will      \n target specific cell surface receptors that have been implicated in                \n tumorigenesis, metastasis and angiogenesis. A second in vitro nano-based           \n technology will be extended to screen for synthetic mimics of protein-based        \n drugs, such as antibodies and natural products.

The other\n technology offers a direct approach to identifying synthetic mimics of drugs that are too\n costly to produce in mass quantities.

        "abstract": "We have developed the first practical assay that directly measures the incorporation of beta-amyloid peptides into aggregates. We have multiplexed the technology to enable the screening of hundreds of thousands of drug candidates for their ability to directly inhibit beta- amyloid aggregation. Because the assay is rapid and does not use toxic substances, it can readily be extended to a whole cell assay. Cells that secrete beta-amyloid can be treated with drug candidates that might inhibit upstream elements such as beta- or gamma-secretase. The amount of secreted beta-amyloid would then be quantitated by our proprietary methods. Preliminary experiments performed on CSF from Alzheimer's patients show that the extent of beta-amyloid aggregation, detected by our technology, scaled with the measured degree of dementia and duration of disease, indicating that a clinical diagnostic assay based on this technology is feasible. The ability to quantitatively assess a patient's response to therapy would expedite clinical trials and FDA approval. Although we have optimized our technology for Alzheimer's disease, the assay is modular and is readily adapted to the specific detection of any neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by abnormal protein aggregation. These include, Alzheimer's. Parkinson's, Huntington's, Creutzfeldt Jakob, Lou Gehrig's and Mad Cow disease. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: We have developed the first specific and sensitive high throughput assay that detects abnormal-protein aggregation characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases. The assay is orders of magnitude more sensitive and specific than the state of the art and has been used to identify a new class of structurally related drugs that inhibit early stage beta-amyloid aggregation, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. These structural determinants can be used by pharmaceutical companies to generate new combinatorial drug libraries focused on early stage AD. The assay is modular so it can be readily adapted for use in assays that target other neurodegenerative diseases. We will use our technology to develop a more sensitive diagnostic for AD.",

Under Phase I, the theoretical foundation for the new hardening technique was thoroughly developed.

A complete design methodology was developed and documented.  This design methodology will be utilized in thePhase II demonstration effort where full scale imbedded protection devices will be produced and tested.  A prototype enhanced wave guide below cut-off penetration protection device designed in Phase I and potential antenna port applications will beperformed under Phase II.

One of the major limitations in developing rad hard NV memory has been the cost involved bringing up the NV technology in adedicated rad hard process facility, especially when weighed against the limited market size.  One way to bring radiation hardening to an advanced electronic product on a cost-effective basis is to leverage the built-in radiation hardness of a commercialprocess technology.  NV flash EEPROM memory technology is popular in the commercial marketplace, with densities up to 256 Mbit in production.  Unfortunately, flash EEPROM memory is not available, at any density, in total dose rad hard versions.  And, mostcommercial flash EEPROM memories are so soft that impractical amounts of shielding are required to survive even moderate radiation environments.  This effort will be an important step in developing rad hard flash EEPROM technology at a commercial fab.  Radhard flash EEPROM technology will be a near-term solution to the problem of high density NV memory for space application.  It will enable the development of rad hard flash EEPROM memories and embedded NV memory for rad hard ASICs.",

We show that tactical Army infrared sensing systems are not affected byturbulence in the same way as astronomical imaging systems, but the influence ofturbulence can still be quite strong.  Rather, the shape of the point spread functionassociated with the scene varies significantly across the image field-of-view.  Thiscondition is referred to as anisoplanatic imaging.  Fortunately, the overall effectof turbulence within a given isoplanatic patch is not as strong as in theastronomical imaging case due to shorter optical paths and longer wavelengths.  Tiltand low order turbulence modes will dominate the aberration experienced withinindividual isoplanatic patches, greatly simplifying the image reconstruction problem.In Phase I we demonstrated an approach for mitigating the type of aberrationsdescribed above.  The results of the Phase I show that an approach based on blockmatching techniques is capable of significantly enhancing the resolution and removingthe distortions caused by the non-isoplanatic turbulence conditions.  Thesedistortions and blurring are time varying and our demonstrated algorithm is effectivein removing these temporal effects.

The use of Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) technology in the military materiel acquisition process and increasing complexity of DISwill make it harder to plan valid tests..  A FMS literature review and, interviews with FMS experts made it clear that a planning tool will add to FMS efficiency and reduce the risk of invalid data and wasted time and money.  MTI will build aknowledge-based FMS planning, development and analysis tool (FMS-PDAT) that will organize system test design data, highlight inter-system differences, select appropriate levels of realism, support scenario development and generate suggested performancemeasures.  MTI will conduct knowledge acquisition and participatory design sessions with expert FMS planners to specify detailed system functionality.  To ensure system developmental flexibility, the Use Case Driven approach to Object-Oriented SoftwareEngineering (OOSE) will be used for the system software development architecture.  A prototype FMS-PDAT will be applied in an Army FMS, and the design iterated based on feedback.  The PC based FMS-PDAT will be useful in all technology test venues that usevirtual simulation.  Users include the Army Battle Laboratories, the National Training Center, and emergency preparedness exercises.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project continues research and development aimed at demonstrating the feasibility for automatic video tracking of the motion of animals and humans in unconstrained environments. The Phase I study succeeded by designing low-level intelligence into predictive search algorithms that were able to confine their search for the correct position in a succeeding image to specific, small regions predicted by the system. The objective is to create a software system, easily operable by an unsophisticated user that can quickly and accurately track multiple points or regions of a moving animal or human through a sequence of video images. This tracking can be done despite background clutter and intermittent occlusion, and without attaching any distinguishing markers to the subject. In Phase I, a user interface was designed that allowed the user to choose a 'skeletal template' to be tracked with a pointing device (a mouse) by selecting vertices of closed polygons and connected rotation points. By sensing the direction and speed of motion of the system, the model-based tracking algorithm told the search mechanism where it should look in the next image to match a 'trailing template' derived from previous locations and orientations of the template. In Phase II, more sophisticated modeling and prediction algorithms, including supervised learning of constructed models, and a pyramided coarse-to-fine scale-space, constructed at video load time, will be brought to bear that will increase speed and efficiency of the tracking algorithm and improve the robustness of the model-based approach. At the same time, the user interface will be redefined to improve the 'look and feel' and give it a more intuitive structure.\nApplications for this software have a ready market demand. Present commercial tracking technology of biological motion requires the placement of intrusive control targets at critical positions on the subject. The commercial need for tracking and characterizing general biological motion will be exploited, including tools for animal behavior analysis, and predicting and improving motion efficiency in athletes. In addition, this technology has applications in diagnostics and medicine/health applications, surveillance, and other uses ranging from NASA's space research, to ergonomic design, to the fingering of musical instruments",

This highly efficient chemical power generation approach allowsfor deployment of clusters of satellites, thus increasing the survivability and operability of the defense system.  The proposed PDRE-MHD can also be used for efficient space propulsion, allowing the satellite to perform orbital change maneuvers.  Theconcept is low-cost, extremely robust, and (through a multiple-tube design) highly tolerant to component failure.  The Phase I studies demonstrated its viability and indicated the generator performance can be significantly higher than that of aconventional rocket-MHD system when accounting for all system operations.  The unique operating characteristics of the PDRE may also provide ways for even greater performance increase.  This Phase II effort proposed to experimentally demonstrate thetechnology and optimize and individual PDRE-MHD device.  A system engineering study will lead to final design of the complete orbital platform.  Besides low-cost, efficient space power generation, other applications include advanced space propulsionconcepts, which have a significant commercial potential.  The proposed research and development will be leveraged with a complementary National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-funded project.  The PDRE-MHD concept is a revolutionary approach tochemical-MHD power generation.

In Phase I a system design was developed for the Advanced GPS Hybrid Simulator(AGHS) which incorporated the capability to test new GPS technologies including (but not limited to) the new civilian and military signal structures, Controlled Reception Pattern Antennas (CRPA), the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), the Local AreaAugmentation System (LAAS), and the Joint Precision Approach Landing System (JPALS), all in compliance with the new SAASM security requirements.The AGHS simulator is a hybrid software, digital and radio frequency (RF) GPS simulator design.  Our design heavily leverages existing software and digital signal simulation components previously developed by NAVSYS which were used to prototype an AGHSsystem under the Phase I effort.  In addition to providing digital and RF signal simulation capability, the AGHS can also be used to record and play-back real-world GPS signals from field tests.Under Phase II, an AGHS will be built and delivered for test and evaluation by the 746th Test Squadron",

        "abstract": "Post-consumer plastics have become a tremendous burden upon our waste disposal system. Although plastics constitute only about 9 percent by weight of municipal solid waste, they occupy approximately one-fourth the volume of the waste stream. The U.S. EPA recommends recycling of plastics as the best solution to the problem. However, contamination of plastics within the recycle stream by foreign materials is a major impediment to widespread plastics recycling. Post-consumer recyclables are of inherently low value in the marketplace and have to compete with low-cost mass- produced virgin materials. Consequently, for recycling of plastics to be economically viable, it is necessary that processing systems for recycled plastics be highly efficient and low cost. Efficient, high-speed sorting technology has been developed recently by National Recovery Technologies (NRT) to remove troublesome contaminant polymers from plastics during processing for recycling. A remaining significant problem is the presence of small metallic contaminants in the plastics stream, which cause considerable problems to the processor during the extrusion of recycled plastics in making new products. Removal of these metallic contaminants using existing technology has proven to be difficult and expensive. The Phase II research is directed toward development of an efficient, cost-effective technology for small metals detection and removal from the recycled plastics stream and for integrating this technology into a shared resources environment with NRT's FlakeSort - high speed polymer sorting technology based on the information obtained during Phase I.",

The planned experiments    \n will provide a cell therapy delivery vehicle for implantation into a large         \n vessel of an animal. and eventually, a patient suffering from this genetic         \n defect. Specific Aim 1 plans to test two IVD prototype fabrications for the        \n ability to support adequate myoblast cell number and FIX secretion rates to        \n achieve clinically significant FIX levels. Specific Aim 2 plans to optimize the    \n in vitro cFIX production rates of the selected D/D prototype. Specific Aim 3       \n plans to introduce this IVD prototype with autologous canine myocytes              \n transduced with hFIX gene into a normal dog where it will be secured in the        \n vena cava by a Greenfield filter anchor (GFA). The hemocompatibility of this       \n device within the vena cava, and myocytes viability will be assessed over          \n various periods of time (up to 6 weeks). Specific Aim 4 plans to test the cFIX     \n production rates and biological activity of cFIX transduced autologous canine      \n myoblasts in the cell IVD prototype in a Hemophilia B dog model. The successful    \n completion of these studies will provide 'proof of concept' for utilization of     \n the IVD as a gene therapy' treatment of hemophilia B. The ultimate goal is to      \n develop a novel cell and gene therapy delivery system (comprised of a              \n cell-filled IVD anchored by means of a Greenfield filter) that is introducable     \n and retractable via a percutaneous catheter insertion through the femoral vein     \n into the inferior vena cava.

Their etiology is not fully understood, but all can be treated      \n by removal of endogenous gonadal steroid hormones, testosterone and estrogen.      \n This has led to the discovery of several successful pharmaceutical products        \n based on blocking the actions of the hypothalamic peptide,                         \n gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Down-regulation of the GnRH receptor by     \n peptide superagonists, or blockade by peptide antagonists, prevents pituitary      \n gonadotropin secretion and leads to dramatic reductions in gonadal steroid         \n production. GnRH-based drugs are now used extensively in these patients, as        \n well as for hormonal manipulation as part of assisted reproductive therapy or      \n for treatment of precocious puberty. Here we propose to develop orally active      \n small molecule antagonists of the GnRH receptor, in order to overcome many of      \n the limitations of these injectable peptide drugs and expand the clinical          \n utility of GnRH-based strategies. In Phase I we have used high-throughput          \n parallel organic synthesis to design multiple chemical series of highly potent,    \n nonpeptide GnRH antagonists.

In Phase II we propose a combination of parallel synthetic chemistry    \n and assay strategies to optimize pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties    \n of compounds from three of these series in order to produce compounds suitable     \n for clinical development.                                                          \n PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: NOT AVAILABLE",

N.BstNBI is a natural occurring nicking endonuclease which only breaks one strand of double-stranded DNA, and it is the only nicking enzyme that is commercially available. The proposed research is about engineering Type IIs endonucleases into nicking enzymes. In Phase I research, we have cloned and characterized the nicking endonuclease N.BstNBI and two related type IIs endonucleases, PleI and MlyI. Our results showed that type IIs endonucleases PleI and MlyI carry out double-stranded cleavage in a two-step process, in which the DNA is first nicked and then further cleaved on second strand by another enzyme molecule via dimerization. In the case of N.BstNBI, it is the dimerization function that was probably affected by mutation, resulting in a unique endonuclease which nicks DNA. We have successfully converted MlyI into a nicking endonuclease by disrupting its dimerization function. Thus, we have demonstrated that it is possible to convert Type IIs endonucleases into nicking enzymes by mutations. We will apply the techniques used in Phase I as well as additional strategies to convert more Type IIs endonucleases into new nicking enzymes.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project studies holographic data storage in a new ion-exchanged photochromic glass disk. It is well known that holographic data storage can significantly increase data storage capacity and reduce access time. However, the technology maturity of holographic data storage is believed to be impeded by: the lack of good holographic material that can be erased and recorded optically with almost unlimited rewriting cycles, with large index modulation for large capacity multiplexed data recording, and with long lifetime and immunity to destructive readout for archival applications. As demonstrated in Phase I the new ion-exchanged photochromic glass can satisfy all above requirements. In addition, it does not require developing or fixing after hologram recording making it an attractive candidate to replace other holographic materials in holographic storage applications. The Phase II research will first explore techniques to increase the recording volume thickness. The holographic performance parameters will again be determined after the thickness improvement. A compact holographic storage system will then be designed and constructed to show the effectiveness of disk type storage application. High capacity storage will be demonstrated. Commercial development will be explored with some major storage companies.\nUsing the new ion-exchanged glass can significantly improve the holographic data storage technology for commercial and military applications such as computer data storage, on-line storage, library archival applications, image storage and processing for medical applications and military target identification, and fast access to large intelligent databases.",

        "abstract": "There is a need in both commercial and military applications for digital transmission methods that can operate at high data rates (several megabits per second end-user rate) in multi-user environments. Existing communication methods will be severelystressed by the difficulties of such an environment: Propagation anomalies such as multipath fading and various types of interference will require intensive digital processing to mitigate their effects. As data rates and environmental problems increase,the use of digital signal processing and error correction becomes costly and complex. Eventually, it will become impossible to degradation. Furthermore, existing multiple access techniques lack flexibility, and as users are added, the difficultiesincrease. By developing a digital signaling approach based on the control of the natural complexity of the chaotic behavior of rf devices, alternative solutions to these fundamental problems emerge.As a limited Phase II effort appropriate to the available funding level, we will develop a chaotic oscillator prototype that has improved behavior over the Colpitts circuit used in Phase I. The purpose of Phase I was to demonstrate the feasibility of suchchaos-based signal encoding (via control of an analog oscillator), and we demonstrated not only this, but also a new principle for amplifying communication signals with tremendous signal gain. In Phase II we will improve upon the oscillator design used inour Phase I effort. We will address such fundamental issues as signal performance in noise, signal predictability, oscillator efficiency, and spectral characteristics. We will also investigate frequency scaling, and the advantages of this approach overtraditional methods for digital communication.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NimbleGen will refine its proprietary         \n technology and manufacturing system into the Maskless Array Synthesizer System     \n (MAS Systems). The MAS System will permit owners to rapidly produce inexpensive    \n High Density Custom DNA Arrays (CDAs) in their own facilities to their own         \n specifications.                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n NimbleGen builds its arrays using photo deposition chemistry with its              \n proprietary Maskless UV Light Projector. Texas Instruments Digital Light           \n Processor (DLP) is at the heart of the NimbleGen Projector. The DLP employs a      \n solid-state array of miniaturized aluminum mirrors to pattern up to 780,000        \n individual pixels of light. Next generation systems will produce up to 1.3         \n million pixels of light. The computer controlled fabricatoin process requires      \n no human interaction once the glass substrate is placed into NimbleGen's           \n proprietary reaction chamber. Fabrication occurs base-by-base inside the           \n reaction chamber, eliminating the need for the clean rooms common to other         \n array production processes. By using the Maskless UV Projector to control the      \n patterning of UV light on the glass in the reaction chamber, NimbleGen achieves    \n unparalleled precision and control over CDA fabrication. The MAS technology        \n also permits unsurpassed speed - a cycle time of less than four hours - in the     \n production of CDAs, thereby substantially reducing development time and costs.     \n PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\n There is a clear need for an inexpensive, rapid, and reliable method of generating and\n analyzing custom DNA arrays.  There are strong indiciations of the proposed project's\n potential for commercialization, as follows:  The market for DNA arrays and DNA array\n fabrication equipment is projected to be $318 million in 2001, growing to $1.7 billion in\n 2005, a CAGR of 49%.",

The shipbuilding industry presently does not have an established approach to acoustical design.  Phase 1 identified algorithms and methods that can remedythis situation.  Creating a modern program addressing the unique features presented in the marine environment solves these problems.The Phase 1 report identified the vessel's structural features that are considered as input data for the prediction process.  NCE's approach is to account for the universal and unique acoustic features of marine vessels.  The prototype program iscombination of Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) modeling approach, an acoustic architectural engineering model and empirical formulas and databases that have been verified and utilized over many years.  The algorithms consider the acoustic impact of manyfactors that are specific to marine vessels, including water loading of surfaces, finite size and orientation of mechanical sources in small compartments, hydrodynamic sources like propellers, thrusters, and splash noise.  The Phase 1 effort and theexisting prototype software showed applicability to all types and sizes of vessels - monohulls, SWATHs, hydrofoils, catamarans - constructed of various materials.These methods, documented in the Phase 1 effort and contained in the prototype program have proven to be very accurate in the prediction of machinery induced noise [3,4].  The Phase 1 effort identified modifications to improve and extend the program tocover HVAC induced noise.

The visualization of turbulent processes is an important tool in understanding the phenomenon.  In this project, a high repetition rate MegaHertz tunable Alexandrite laser will be used to excite an ion emission line in a plasma.  The resulting laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) will be imaged onto an ultra-fast imaging detector to reveal the temporal evolution of turbulent structures in the plasma with high spatial resolution.  In Phase I, several ions were investigated to determine the optimal species for laser-induced fluorescence visualization.  The MegaHertz Alexandrite laser was designed, based on the laser energy required for the selected ion species.  The expected signal and signal-to-noise were estimated based on a proposed experimental setup.  In Phase II, after delivery of the ultra-fast CCD camera and MegaHertz burst Alexandrite laser, a proof of principle experiment will be implemented.  This will be done on the Magnetic Reconnection Experiment (MRX) at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.

        "abstract": "60513      Breast cancer is one of the major public health concerns today in the United States.  However, the detection of breast cancer through mammographic screening is complicated by various anatomic factors that can hide or simulate tumors, leading to reduced sensitivity and specificity of mammography.  Consequently, the rate of false negatives is 5%-6%, which results in loss of lives.  The accuracy of mammography can be improved by complementing it with functional imaging techniques such as PET imaging.  This will require dedicated breast imaging PET scanners.  A high-resolution breast imaging PET scanner, consisting of LSO (lutetium silicate) scintillator crystals read out by avalanche photodiode (APD) arrays, is currently under development.  This project will develop a fast, low-noise integrated front-end chip (ASIC) for this scanner, specifically designed to read out the APD signals with high accuracy and low random background.  During Phase I, the feasibility of the proposed readout chip was demonstrated by designing, simulating, building, and testing discrete prototypes of the critical parts of the proposed chip (ASIC).  A preliminary design for the core parts of the readout chip was developed.  Phase II will finalize the chip design, create its silicon layout, and fabricate prototype chips.  Using these chips, prototype multi-channel LSO/APD/ASIC detector modules will be designed and built, and their performance will be evaluated for PET applications.                      Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: In addition to breast imaging, the proposed chip (ASIC) should be useful for any applications that require reading out APDs or multianode photomultipliertubes with fast and highly accurate timing.  This includes other PET imaging applications, such as animal PET.  Other applications include astrophysics, nuclear physics, and high-energy physics research, such as Compton scatter imaging detectors.",

To effectively utilize neutron scattering instrumentation, highly efficient, high-count rate detectors are needed that exhibit good resolution over very large areas.  Furthermore, advanced neutron detectors will be critical components needed to fully make use of new intense neutron sources.  This project will develop new neutron detector technology based upon a electron multiplication technique, which can be exploited for next-generation epithermal neutron detection.   Ultimately, a large area, curved neutron detector, capable of microsecond pulse counting, parallax free, and with submillimeter position resolution will be developed.    Phase I fabricated and demonstrated an neutron-to-electron multiplier using a proprietary glass.  This was successfully coupled to fast pulse counting electronics to produce the first neutron images.   Manufacturing techniques were demonstrated that would allow large areas to be produced with curvatures to remove parallax distortion.   In Phase II, a large area neutron-to-electron multiplier, with enriched boron-10 composition for optimal gain in epithermal neutron detection, will be manufactured.  The detector will be coupled to position sensitive, pulse counting electronics and a computer readout.  The resulting prototype detector will be tested and characterized on a neutron beam used for neutron scattering instrumentation.

However, the peak output power in the ABC was limited to about 100 MW due to spontaneous breakdown of the switch.  This project will develop a modified plasma switch to produce 500-700 NW output pulses, based on switch configurations for ABC that utilize resonators containing one or more discharge tubes, which alter the resonator transmission coefficient upon firing.  This allows the discharge tubes to reside, during the filling time of the compressor storage cavity, in an rf electric field that is less than one-third that of the initial ABC.  In Phase I, several designs for resonance plasma switches with self-breakdown characteristics superior to earlier models have been developed.  Numerical analysis was applied to each design to simulate operation.  Non-high-vacuum prototypes were fabricated, and measurements were made of their characteristics at low power level.  The measurements showed compression ratios in the range 10-15, stability of +0.3\u00c2\u00bf in relative input-to-output phase variations, three-fold reduction in electric field at the switch, and energy efficiency in the range of 60-65%.

Recently, it was pointed out that a train of short moderate charge bunches can be arranged to induce cumulative buildup of wake fields.  However, a long dielectric-lined waveguide, is required for a long bunch train, leaves the bunches susceptible to serious instability.  This project will develop a short dielectric resonator that would allow cumulative buildup of the wake fields, if the wake field reflections from both resonator faces could be synchronized with the period of the bunch train.  A short dielectric resonator could allow easier control of transverse beam instabilities than a long dielectric waveguide.  In Phase I, transverse instability was investigated for a bunch injected slightly off-axis in a dielectric-line waveguide, and a fair degree of stabilization was exhibited.  A simulation of longitudinal wake fields in a dielectric resonator exhibited zones adjacent to each face of the resonator where the wake fields did not resemble those calculated, unless axial boundaries were taken into account.  An experimental dielectric wake field resonator was designed and built, and a design for a beamline upgrade was developed, so as to increase the charge/bunch for future experiments.   Phase II will upgrade the beamline, including the installation of an alpha magnet to provide higher charge, tighter bunches, along with improved beam focusing into the dielectric resonator.  A beam chopper will be constructed to enable an adjustable short train of bunches to pass into the dielectric resonator.  Experiments will be performed to observe the cumulative build-up of wake fields from the bunch train.                     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: High-gradient wake fields, induced by the passage of a train of moderate charge bunches, could be an alternative to large, expensive rf-driven systems for acceleration of electrons and positrons to high energy.  Significant acceleration in a dielectric resonator could open up sizable markets for future accelerator modules.",

Our recall enhancing algorithms use more linguistic and world knowledge than mostcurrent systems. Four crucial avenues of work that will lead to the improvement of recall are: disambiguation of input text terms through ontological semantic processing; processing reference; processing non-literal language; and assigning semanticfeatures to new, unattested word and phrase occurrences. All the above activities rely on a unique battery of resources and processes developed by or available to Onyx. These include an ontological world model, a fact database, a comprehensive NLP lexiconof English and an onomasticon, or lexicon of proper names. In addition, we use special routines for resolving reference, processing non-literal language through controlled constraint relaxation and treating unattested inputs using expectations recorded inthe ontology, the fact database and in special orthographic, morphological and syntactic rules. Architecturally, we will combine in a single system a variety of approaches and processes as above. Unlike most current systems, ours will be geared not only atinformation extraction for a given set of templates (and, therefore, typically, working in a single domain) but will also include facilities for modifying templates and defining new templates for new types of questions and, orthogonally, new domains. Thus,our product will be the first general-purpose, configurable information extraction system, which will in multiple domains and with multiple text genres.

        "abstract": "This proposal outlines a program to develop a complete Stokes polarization imaging system.  Although conventional imaging techniques have undergone fairly advanced levels of development, enabling low-level light detection, IR imaging, and high-resolutionimaging all at rapid frame rates, the techniques nevertheless are fundamentally constrained to detection of only the intensity and color of light.  Polarization imaging would allow additional information to be accessed, which is not possible byconventional imaging. Through the detection of polarization properties of light, in addition to the conventional intensity based information, polarization imaging would add a new dimension to imaging.The proposed polarization based imaging system is expected to significantly enhance the capabilities of object identification and differentiation, which will be very useful in target acquisition and identification particularly in difficult environments.For example, certain polarization states of light have been shown to be impervious to the effects of scattering by aerosols (smoke, fog, etc.). Polarization imaging can take advantage of this effect to enhance imaging through obscuring media. In addition,the light transmitted or reflected from an object has a polarization signature that offers means for identification of the material characteristics of the target object (e.g., ice on a wing surface).",

        "abstract": "The objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate regenerable plant supports from inedible plant fiber for use in Advanced Life Support (ALS) System plant growing units. Plant supports of interest include seed plugs, seeding mats, root/shoot barriers, and plant fences. The innovation is to develop totally regenerable plant structures that retain sufficient structural integrity for plant support over one crop cycle, that can be fabricated on-site, are non-toxic to plants, and which do not require separation from the inedible plant waste stream. By forming expendable components from inedible plant material already in the ALS system, resupply mass can be significantly reduced (an annual supply of non-regenerable seed plugs is about 124 to 3000 kg depending on the type). Harvesting procedures would be simplified since support structures would be processed directly as part of the inedible waste stream. The use of regenerable seed plugs would also reduce crew time, and simplify the mechanization of seeding and harvesting processes. Proposal tasks involve processing plant fibers, fabrication of prototypes, and mechanical and biocompatibility testing of the prototype regenerable seed plugs. The anticipated result of this project is a process and associated technology to produce regenerable plant supports meeting ALS operational requirements.",

        "abstract": "ORBITEC proposes to conduct innovative research and development that would culminate in an Aerodynamic Fluid Physics Research Facility (AFPRF) technology demonstration on the International Space Station serving one or more critical experimental needs of the NASA mg Program. The AFPRF would serve as an innovative microgravity apparatus that would virtually eliminate g-jitter and provide a gently controlled acceleration environment. The innovation is based on: the use of a new type of gas-flow generator, an expert system software architecture concept, a non-contact approach for on-orbit position control of spherical liquid samples, and a non-contact fluid motion exciter. Prescribed acceleration levels can be accurately introduced through controlled pulses/oscillations or spin/rotation/vibration of the large and small floating fluid samples. We propose to develop a prototype flight unit to be tested on a reduced-gravity parabolic aircraft in Phase I. In Phase II, we will develop a space-qualifiable AFPRF system that can be used on the International Space Station to satisfy current and future fluid physics flight experiments. The AFPRF would become a powerful research tool with a very low-g, vibrationally isolated, float zone capability combined with a controllable acceleration and disturbance levels that would enhance future fluid physics experiments.",

In order to match an individual who has a disability      \n with the appropriate assistive technology, it is necessary that all individuals    \n involved have knowledge and skills related to characteristics and operation of     \n the technology. This program will allow the user to obtain information and         \n training on: 1) defining features and technical characteristics of a selection     \n of categories of assistive technology; 2) basic principles of operation of         \n these devices and systems; 3) technical requirements and compatibility             \n information needed to interface/integrate the devices and systems; and, 4)         \n potential applications and typical uses of these devices and systems. The          \n program will use a metaphor of a community-based Assistive Technology (AT)         \n Center. Within the AT Center will be four rooms each dedicated to a specific       \n area of assistive technology: Adaptive Computer Technology Room, Communication     \n Technology Room, Environmental Adaptations Room, and Mobility and Seating Room.    \n Within each room, the user will be presented with a selection of 3D images         \n depicting a representative set of assistive technology devices and systems.        \n Interactive multimedia will provide an opportunity to learn about this             \n assistive technology, using a unique set of presentation technologies which        \n will enhance the learning experience through: interactive user control of the      \n program content and sequence of presentation; viewing high-resolution              \n photographic images and 3D objects; viewing 3D animations of device                \n configuration and functioning; user manipulation and three-dimensional viewing     \n of both modeled representations and photographs of real devices using QuickTime    \n VR technology (Apple Computer); digital video presentation of device               \n configuration and potential uses; access to the Internet for more information      \n about specific products and program updates; summaries of information that can     \n be sent to a printer; user-controlled, operational simulations of a selection      \n of assistive devices and systems; and embedded competency assessment. The          \n program will provide a low-cost, convenient and effective alternative for the      \n many individuals who need information and training on the operation and uses of    \n assistive technology devices and systems but do not have access to the required    \n assistive technology expertise or equipment.                                       \n   \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nThe commercial potential for this program is indicated by: (1) large numbers of individuals with disabilities; (2) many organizations and agencies who are mandated to provide assistive technology services; 3) many university training programs in special  education, allied health sciences, engineering, rehabilitation counseling, medicine and nursing; (4) the growing need for inservice training and information; (5) many facilities such as assistive technology centers, libraries, and public computer access laboratories.

However, despite the improved success in stopping smoking associated with using such products, many people either do not use them or do not use them properly.  The primary aims of this project are to develop and test a tailored multimedia intervention designed to improve smoking cessation success by:  a) motivating cigarette smokers to use pharmacological aids such as NR products and Zyban, b) assisting them in choosing the type of pharmacological aid best suited to them, and c) ensuring that they employ optimal technique for the use of the chosen pharmacological aid.  In Phase I, a complete NR/Zyban intervention segment tailored for the older, Caucasian, female subpopulation was produced for use with our previously developed interactive multimedia smoking cessation programs.  The efficacy of the segment was demonstrated in a randomized-control trial.  In Phase II, we will develop pharmacological intervention materials explicitly tailored to the characteristics and needs of eleven other sub-populations (using three dimensions:  age, race/ethnicity, and gender).

Factors impacting this include rising lumber costs, the unavailability of skilled labor, limited access and the need for improved building technologies. The Interlocking Construction System (ICS) offers an innovative approach to improving rural housing. The ICS is a panelized construction system using standard interchangeable panels, whose design integrates panel and wood connections. ICS panels contain the structural framework that is formed when the panels interlock into a completely finished structure. The ICS panels can be easily transported, handled and quickly installed by a few unskilled laborers using only a few hand tools. Phase I research has proven the full-scale feasibility of the Interlocking Construction System. Initial testing of the ICS wall panels in Phase I indicates a significant ease of construction and an increase in strength over conventional building methods. Phase II research will include field-testing a full-scale test home and additional tests on the three-dimensional structure to determine how the full-scale components interact with and relate to the overall structural performance of the ICS test-home. Phase II testing should be useful in obtaining building code approval and quicker entrance into the housing market",

        "abstract": "A surveillance system needs to accurately locate and identify not only single targets, but also groups of targets engaged in a common activity. Existing tracking systems are capable of tracking individual targets quite accurately; however, they fail to useinformation related to group behavior in order to improve these estimates. As part of our Phase I work, ORINCON developedAlgorithms those are able to exploit group motion information in order to improve the estimate of the individual targets that are contained within the group. During Phase II, we propose to extend our group tracking capabilities to handle scenarios that arerepresentative of wide-area surveillance. Key to these scenarios is the large number of targets (100-1000) and the relatively slow revisit rates (45-60 seconds). These characteristics are in contrast to precision engagement scenarios that consider tens oftargets with revisit rates of 1-5 seconds. Also, as part of our proposed Phase II work, we will develop a robust tracking system simultaneously in surveillance and precision mode. Furthermore, we propose to integrate this tracking system into an automaticcontext alert system to provide input to military operators of groups and individual targets that are of high priority to the warfighter. We propose to demonstrate this notional system concept using government-provided data from data collections oroperational scenarios.c",

These methods are established for use in telescopes, spectrometers, microscopes, and other optical instruments.Effort proposed: 1) breadboard a Phase I SCM that can be configured in multiple test geometries; 2) implement several prototype SCM systems and test their performance on model PVT crystals; 3) establish and document the best-performing system(s); and 4) verify that critical SCM components can be flight-qualified.Results anticipated: Phase I determines SCM feasibility by establishing that a flight system can achieve the ultra-high resolution needed to successful monitor PVT crystals during growth. Phase II centers on the design, development, construction, and delivery of a near flight-qualified SCM.Expected NASA applications: Compound semiconductors grown by PVT processes have critical features as small as several nm. The SCM supports understanding sample health and status for these and other interesting materials grown in microgravity furnaces.",

The basis for the analyzer is an innovative oxygen sensor technology that sensitively measures respiratory activity of microorganisms.The research focus is to incorporate the sensor into microbial-filter membranes that will enable waterborne bacteria to be isolated from relatively large volume water samples by filtration. The captured organisms will be cultured briefly in selective-mediato enable proper identification of the target bacteria.  The subsequent sensor measures of oxygen consumption will semi-quantitatively resolve the number of microbes that were found in the water.The research efforts include: development of the novel sensor-filter element capable of filtering a large sample of water; development of special assay-vessels for the culture and simultaneous monitoring of the sensor; and instrumentation for conductingthe incubation and reading of the sensor-filter's signal output.

        "abstract": "The emergence of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has\ncreated an urgent need for new therapeutic approaches to treat the\nvariety of diseases caused by this common pathogen. S. aureus damages\nhost tissues by the secretion of a variety of toxic exomolecules known\nas virulence factors. The expression of these factors is controlled by an\nautocrine regulatory system whereby bacteria secrete autoinducing\npheromone peptides that act on the cell to upregulate expression of the\nset of genes encoding virulence factors. This proposal is based on the\nserendipitous discovery of a modified peptide contaminating a batch of\nsynthetic pheromone peptide based on the sequence of a non-\npathogenic strain of Staphylococcus. This peptide, called virulence\ninhibitory factor (VIF), inhibited synthesis of alpha toxin and toxic\nshock syndrome toxin in all Staphylococcal strains tested. Further\nstudies revealed that small molecule analogs of VIF inhibited virulence\nfactor production in vitro and protected mice from a lethal systemic S.\naureus infection. The goal of this proposal is to evaluate a large panel\nof small VIF analogs in vitro and select the best drug candidate for\nfurther studies in vivo. Proposed studies include pharmacology,\ntoxicology, and various animal models of S. aureus infection in\npreparation of an IND. This novel therapeutic approach has promise in\nthe treatment of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococci.\n \nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:\nDue to the emergence of drug-resistant strains of Staphylococci, many\ninfections are not treatable with conventional antibiotics. The\npathogenesis of Staph. infections depend on the production of virulence\nfactors that promote bacterial colonization and are toxic to the host\ntissues. The present application proposes to develop a novel drug that\ninhibits production of virulence factors and should be therapeutic to\nantibiotic resistant Staph.",

        "abstract": "The common cold is generally not life threatening to most people, but does cause significant morbidity and loss of productivity. For some, particularly those with asthma or who are immunocompromised, it can be quite serious. Prospects are in hand for development of a new therapeutic that could have a major impact on the spread and pathogenesis of cold viruses, in particular human rhinorivus (HRV). The objective of this proposal is to develop an ICAM1/IgA fusion protein produced in plants into an effective therapy and preventive agent against HRV. The extracellular domains of human ICAM-1, a protein found on the surface of many cell types, is used by HRV as a receptor. Genetic fusion of these ICAM-1 domains to the constant region of human IgA2m(2) creates a protein that is very effective at blocking HRV infection of cells. This protein has now been expressed in plants, where it can be produced very economically. Plants producing high levels of ICAM-1/IgA2 will be propagated, and efficient methods will be developed for purification of clinical-grade protein. The protein will be characterized in vitro, then tested in animals for safety and finally in human volunteers for effectiveness in preventing infection by HRV or development of cold symptoms. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The goal of this project is to develop a practical and affordable way of preventing infection by human rhinovirus, or drastically reducing its symptoms. Transgenic plants offer the only practical way to produce a therapeutic protein on the scale needed to treat the common cold. An effective product will have significant commercial potential.",

        "abstract": "One hurdle to improving the efficiency of commercial aquaculture is the lack of methods for reliably counting and sizing the stock. Conventional hydroacoustical methods exist for determining fish populations in natural waters, but these methods have not been successfully adapted to commercial fish farming, where population densities are orders of magnitude higher and where wall and boundary effects on the acoustics are significant. A new technique was proposed in Phase I that relied on changes in the low frequency modes of the waveguide formed by ponds/tanks. The results of the Phase I feasibility study show an extremely high correlation between the fish density and the shift in the cut-off frequency of the enclosure with fish indicating the validity of the method proposed. The size distribution of the fish may be estimated using the resonance frequency of the fishes swim bladders. The results clearly indicate a method that may result in a viable system to detect fish biomass economically in cultured tanks, ponds, and net pens. The proposed research combines a team of experts in a focused effort to develop a robust pre-production device. The conceptual design of the system developed in Phase I will be translated and implemented into five preproduction units in Phase II and then field tested at several commercial farms.",

In Phase I, we will prove the feasibility of the superconducting RF        \n coil by: (1) fabricating a prototypical coil element, and (2) demonstrating the    \n element's performance under prototypical, cryogenic conditions. \n PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\n The key application for the RF probe is MR histology of small animal specimens. MR histology\n (MRH) promises enormous benefits because it is extremely fast, allows use of unique \n \"proton stains,\" produces three-dimensional images of tissues, and produces digital images\n that are easily shared.  MRH has enormous screening potential because tissues can be\n excised and scanned immediately.  As a result, the RF probe developed in this program\n will enable tremendous cost savings in the fields of drug discovery, toxicology, and the\n study of fundamental physiology and disease mechanisms.  Customers for the probe will\n include pharmaceutical companies, research laboratories, and MR pathology service\n providers.",

        "abstract": "Future DoD cryogenic cooling applications include space missions with relatively large cooling demands.  These include space-based lasers, orbital transfer vehicles requiring cooling of stored fuels, and space-based platforms using large arrays of infrareddetectors.  Loads for these applications will range from several watts to tens of watts.  Temperatures of interest are between 10 and 100 K.  Current reverse turbo-Brayton cryocoolers are optimized for a limited range of loads and temperatures,significantly below those of future high-capacity applications.  In order to meet future needs for high-capacity cooling, additional research and development must be performed on the turboalternator, a key component in the system.  This proposal addressesthe development of a high-capacity turboalternator.  In Phase I, key turboalternator performance parameters and loss mechanisms were quantified.  During Phase II, we propose to develop and test an advanced turboalternator optimized for a particularhigh-capacity, low-temperature application.  The turboalternator will be installed in an existing Engineering Design Model cryocooler and the performance of the cryocooler will be quantified over a wide range of temperatures.  The cryocooler test resultswill be used to set a baseline for scaling the system to other applications and to identify design features that require modification for other loads and temperatures.",

        "abstract": "60578        Variation in system dynamics and modeling uncertainty (due to unmodeled system behavior and/or presence of disturbances), have posed significant challenges to the effective luminosity and orbit control in accelerators used in nuclear physics research.  Adaptive control has long been pursued as a possible solution, but difficulties with online model identification, and robust implementation of the adaptive control algorithms has prevented their widespread application.  In addition, the performance of the control system is contingent on the responsiveness of the control algorithm to the inevitable deviations of the model from the actual system.  This project will use neural networks to detect significant changes in system behavior and develop the methodology for online identification of new empirical models.  Furthermore, an optimal model-predictive-based adaptive control algorithm will be developed, which enables the robust implementation of an effective control strategy.  In Phase I, simulations were conducted to clearly demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of implementing model predictive control technology in accelerator control problems.  In addition, a prototype for the optimal model-predictive-based adaptive control algorithm was developed for a well-known nonlinear temperature control problem for gas-phase reactors.  In Phase II, a classification algorithm for dynamic data will be developed to enable the detection of significant changes in system behavior.  Algorithms for efficient handling of variable dynamics in the nonlinear model predictive control system will be developed, and the machinery that allows the implementation of the optimal adaptive schemes will be put in place.  Prototypes to implement the above-mentioned features in commercially available software will be developed.               Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The online system identification and optimal model-predictive-based adaptive control software should have applicability in process industries, power systems, and financial systems.  In particular, the day-to-day operation of accelerators should immediately benefit from the findings in this project.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed at achieving the first ever 350W (cw) output power in a high brightness and diffraction-limited laser beam from a multicore phase-locked fiber laser array. Under Phase I, the feasibility of the unique power combining concept has been demonstrated by phase-locking a group of 7 Yb-doped single mode fiber lasers, embedded in a common cladding. In addition, a theoretical model has been developed, providing a deeper understanding of physical mechanisms responsible for phase-locking of a multicore fiber laser array. These results clearly indicate that this extremely challenging goal for Phase II can be accomplished. Nevertheless, there remain several obstacles that need to be removed before embarking on commercialization. First, a significant improvement of the laser performance must be made. This can be accomplished by exploring various parameters, which include fiber length, cavity finesse, gain saturation, temperature and stress distributions, as well as fiber structural parameters, such as core separation and the V-value. In addition, an order of magnitude improvement for efficient coupling of pump power into the clad must be made. To advance this technology, various pumping techniques will be explored, in particular the side-pumping of the fiber laser from the cladding walls, instead of the fiber end facets. If successfully developed, this could be the most viable way to obtain the maximum output power without causing catastrophic damage. Finally, the reliability of the device when operating at very high power level must be established by raising the power damaging threshold. \nHigh power diode-pumped multicore fiber lasers can be very competitive in the market place as compared to high power diode-pumped solid-state lasers and C02 lasers presently employed by automotive, aerospace and ship-building industries for precision drilling, high-speed cutting and welding of metals and composition materials.",

In Phase I, we have demonstated that phase-locking occurs spontaneously among a group of closely packed single mode fiber lasers configured isometrically ina common cladding.  This result suggests that, by using our unique power combining technique developed at PC Photonics Corporation, high power output exceeding 1KW in a high-brightness beam is possible and could potentially reach the 10KW range.  ThisPhase II proposal presents a detailed description of the 1KW class laser structure consisting of two isometric rings.  The design considerations include the total number of single-mode Yb-doped cores, core index, core spacing, clad dimension, fiber length,pumping configuration, gain distribution, cavity finesse and spectral width of in-fiber Bragg gratings.  Although the feasibility of this coherent power-combining concept has been demonstrated, there remain several critical technologies that need to bedeveloped for operating fiber lasers at high power level.  Specifically, crucial issues are related to (1) the modal discrimination of various supermodes naturally existing in a phase-locked laser system,(2)power damage threshold of rare-earth doped glass,(3) optical pumping at KW levels without causing catastrophic failure, and (4) thermal fracture and non-linear effects.  This Phase II proposal presents our technical approaches to resolve these critical issues, and provides a detailed description of ourwork plan, which contains 11 tasks designed specifically for achieving the objectives of this SBIR.

The development of a reliable, high yield, and economical method for the cyclotron-produced radioisotope fluorine-18 in the form of [18F] fluoride ion would be beneficial for the growth and increased utilization of PET.  This project will develop a practical and reliable method for the use of gaseous [18O] oxygen gas as the target material for aqueous [18F] fluoride ion production.  This target offers two important advantages over the current liquid target method: (1) gas targets are able to withstand relatively higher beam currents than liquid targets giving higher yields, and (2) the expensive enriched oxygen-18 gas target material can be more efficiently recovered after the bombardment and received for subsequent runs.  In Phase I, a prototype [18O]oxygen gas target was designed, constructed, and tested with a manually-operated target support unit (TSU) and was shown to produce aqueous [18F] fluoride ion in good yield.  The TSU allows the cryogenic recovery and recycling of the enriched [18O]oxygen gas.  The problem of combining elements of both a high-pressure gas target for the bombardment and a liquid target for the product delivery was solved.  Phase II will design and construct a fully functional prototype high-current target and TSU that will be used for automated operations on the current generation of biomedical cyclotrons.

The most important features of the proposed approach are: 1) The implementation of the best commercially available power production components with emphasis onsimplicity, robustness, and low cost. The baseload and intermediate power (15 W to 50 W) will be provided by a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) commercially available from H-power and the peak power will be provided by a proven, high performanceNickel-Metal-Hydride battery available from Energizer. In phase I bottled hydrogen will be used to fuel a brass board demonstrator and in phase II one of two candidate hydrogen storage technologies will be integrated. 2) A robust and simple overallconfiguration which places the fuel cell and battery directly in parallel. Careful selection of cell counts in both the fuel cell and battery will lead to a system that does not draw from the battery until the power level reaches ~ 50 W but still providesenough overvoltage at baseload power (15 W) to trickle charge the battery. This simple approach is made practical by the implementation of a battery management strategy based on slight variations in fuel cell air stoichiometry (i.e. slight changes in airsupply). 3) An efficient, robust, and low cost control strategy that employs the SmartGuardTM battery management technology developed at AeroVironment. The SmartGuard is a commercially available battery management system that can be slightly adapted toprovide the control requirements of this system. SmartGuardTM will cost only $50 per unit.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION: The distinctive arginine requirement of hepatocellular carcinomas     \n and malignant melanomas provides the basis for a new potential chemotherapy.       \n Just as acute lymphocytic leukemia cells require asparagine and E. coli            \n asparaginase enzyme can be used to effect a cure for this disease, we propose      \n using a mycoplasma derived arginine deiminase (ADI) to treat hepatocellular        \n carcinoma and malignant melanomas. As a result of Phase I funding we have          \n discovered a method where by ADI can be formulated with polyethylene glycol        \n (PEG) such that it has a much longer circulating half-life in mice and is less     \n immunogenic. When ADI formulated with PEG is injected into mice it selectively     \n reduces the plasma levels of arginine and starves human melanomas and              \n hepatocellular carcinomas implanted into these animals. This treatment is also     \n being tested in dogs with spontaneous melanoma (under an INAD received from the    \n FDA) and is quickly being proven to be an effective means of treating              \n spontaneous melanoma with very few, if any, side effects. We have requested and    \n received an Orphan Drug Designation for this project and in a Pre-IND meeting      \n with the FDA and the Orphan drug Office, delineated the experiments needed to      \n file a Phase I IND to permit human testing of this drug. The studies proposed      \n in this grant reflect the FDA requirements and when completed will allow for       \n the testing of ADI formulated with PEG in humans. The studies proposed include     \n the validation of the process used to make (under GMP conditions) 3 lots of        \n ADI-PEG, characterize these lots with validated procedures, obtain                 \n pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data that will allow allometric modeling of    \n the predicted human dosing and perform the necessary immunological and             \n toxicological testing needed for this project to progress into human clinical      \n testing.                                                                           \n PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: NOT AVAILABLE",

        "abstract": "New regulations for drinking water treatment are leading to alternatives to chlorine disinfection. As a result, the use of ultraviolet (UV) light for disinfection is growing rapidly. The disinfection capability of commercial UV systems is limited by available mercury lamp technology. Phoenix Science & Technology's innovative Surface Discharge (SD) UV lamp is a promising candidate to both improve the effectiveness and decrease the cost of UV disinfection. Phase I demonstrated the effectiveness of SD lamps at inactivating microorganisms, using three to five times less electricity than the mercury-based UV lamps. Because electricity is the largest operational cost of disinfection, use of the SD lamp can reduce cost. The SD lamp's high intensity and UV spectrum proved more effective at deactivating microorganisms than would be expected based on efficiency alone. The advantages demonstrated in Phase I may be even more important in deactivating viruses that require very high UV doses from mercury lamps. Furthermore, unlike mercury lamps, the SD lamp has no mercury or other toxic materials with environmental disposal issues. The goal of this Phase II program is to conduct research to pursue the advantages of SD lamps for UV disinfection, develop an SD UV reactor, conduct comparative UV disinfection tests with a commercial mercury lamp UV system, and establish the practicality of commercializing SD lamp UV disinfection systems. Disinfection testing will be conducted in collaboration with researchers at Duke University and with a major manufacturer of UV disinfection equipment. This Phase II will incorporate validation testing protocols outlined in the U.S. EPA guidance document on using UV for disinfection, scheduled for release late in 2002. A successful Phase II will lead to commercialization of SD UV disinfection systems.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this proposal is to develop a new detector technology for digital x-ray imaging based on HgI2 polycrystalline films coupled to large area flat panel amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin-film transistor (TFT)-addressed readout arrays. This novel imaging detector when optimized will provide order of magnitude improvements in sensitivity to x-rays and superior spatial resolution compared to detectors utilizing scintillating phosphors coupled to a-Si:H readout arrays. The increased sensitivity of the detector will allow for a ten-fold reduction in radiation dose to a patient for an equivalent quality image. The enhancement of the spatial resolution will have a direct impact on the quality of the image, which has paramount importance in many medical diagnostic procedures such as mammography. In addition, digital capabilities will allow for convenient film-less image acquisition, retrieval, and storage. Digital image processing, computer-assisted diagnosis, and the ability to provide real time images have distinct advantages in many medical diagnostics. During Phase I of this proposal we developed techniques for highly controlled growth of polycrystalline HgI2 films in terms of their thickness, sizes of the polycrystalline grains, uniformity of layers and good electrical properties. In the Phase II effort we will finalize the HgI2 film development and construct x-ray imaging detectors using initially small commercial flat panel a-Si:H readouts (approximately 2\"x2\"). Then we will scale up the film growth equipment and construct large area (approximately 14\" x 17\") x-ray imaging detector. The film growth process will be optimized for low production cost. This new x- ray imager will be characterized and compared with current commercial detectors in terms of spatial resolution, gain, linearity, noise, uniformity, and detective quantum efficiency. The imaging capabilities will be tested in our laboratory and at UCLA School of Medicine with the use of slits and phantoms. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: There is a strong interest in application of digital radiographic detectors for medical diagnostic applications, nondestructive evaluation of materials, x-ray diffraction of biological and other material samples, and astronomical observations. Conservative estimates are that in the medical area alone there are over 600 x-ray images produced per 1000 population per year. The proposed detectors will be highly attractive to this enormous commercial market segment due to the order of magnitude performance improvements that they will offer.",

Theproposed physics-based approach employs material and featuretyping at the individual pixel level to produce RCS maps, whichcan be used in both monostatic and bistatic applications. Thesoon-to-be commercially available EarthScape3D, an automated geo-specific scene database generator developed jointly by PRA andEvans and Sutherland(E&S), is proposed to be the backbone of theautomated system. The scenes are deterministic and geo-specific,enabling radar sensor simulations in real-world conditions to beconducted. The major benefit of the underlying physics-basedapproach is that the common scene databases support multiplesensors operating at different frequencies, and that reflectivitycharacteristics from the scene can be rapidly recomputed as eachsensor platform moves relative to the scene.  The proposed effortencompasses wide area scene generation, high-resolution scenemodeling, and synthetic target seeding.  Sensor/scene interfacescan provide inputs to radar sensor models with modeling in thefrequency domain (spectral representation) and in the time domain(coherent I, Q pulse generation). The scene generation softwarewill be based on a CORBA-component model (CCM) to facilitateupgrades,integration with EarthScape3D, and interoperability withvarious mission models to support U.S. Navy operational andinvestment strategies.",

        "abstract": "The sensing element is the heart of a sensor.  A generic requirement for any sensor is that it only responds to the particular stimulus since all other stimuli are considered noise.  The basic physics of the operation of a sensor thus determines the limitof its sensitivity.  Here we build upon a family of proposed light sensors in which sensor noise is substantially reduced by altering the nature of current transport.  This is done by 1) confining the electrons in a reduced dimensional regime such as aquantum well or wire, and 2) producing a contact of a different dimension to this electron cloud.  These hetero-dimensional devices substantially affect current transport.  We will fabricate and test detectors for operation in the near infrared (NIR)regime that will surpass present technology in terms of dark current, responsitivity, and speed.  We will fabricate and test Photodiodes, Photoconductors, Schottky diodes, and HEMTs on the same monolithic substrate demonstrating the feasibility of thefabrication of all the elements necessary for a photoreceiver, or an imaging array.  We then apply this design strategy to a different material system that is especially suitable for operation in 1300 and 1550 nm windows for use in long haul fiber opticcommunication networks.  As result of this work, devices that exceed present technology in terms of noise performance, sensitivity, and speed will be fabricated and tested.  Initial concentration is on 700-900nm ranged followed by work in 1300-1550nmrange.  Applications of these devices are in a variety of areas, but the most promising are the following:1. Receivers for Fast Ethernet 2. Receivers for Long Haul Communication 3. Wavelength Division Multiplexing receivers.  4. Near Infrared MedicalImaging",

This project will develop the Spatial Diversity Encryption Chaffing Interface system, which splits a secure communication into a stream of packets and distributes transmission across all cells within range of the mobile unit.  The spatial distribution of the cell sites then implicitly encodes the identity of each packet by direction of propagation, time of flight, and spatial modulation.   In Phase I, a prototype wireless cellular packet network implementing spatial diversity as an entirely novel security feature was successfully implemented, incorporating both spatially diverse transceiver hardware and complementary sequenced chaffing and winnowing software within a small wireless local area network.  Operation of larger cellular networks with multiple mobile units and a large number of cell site concentrators was verified via simulation.  In Phase II, a comprehensive system for secure communications and continuous mutual authentication of identity and position of mobile units on a cellular packet network will be developed.

A scalable coder will compress the data and arrange them from more important to less important bits. The bit stream can be truncated at any point and still retain a perceptible reconstructed image. After the coder, the video data will be further modulated with the quotient coding to increase its bit-error-rate performance.

        "abstract": "The project goal is to develop an alternative infrasound monitoring system with piezoelectric sensors for use under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  These sensors will have several advantages over the microbarograph system that forms the baseline forthe IMS.  As an all-electronic system, the novel sensor would be far simpler than the baseline, with no moving parts or piping.  It will be more robust and durable, less expensive, and more flexible in its design and capabilities.  For example, electronicsignals do not experience delay so that subelements can be at any distance from processing unit.  In Phase I, it was demonstrated that off-the-shelf PVDF piezocable could be used as an infrasound sensor but conformity with the Treaty noise specificationcould not be demonstrated.  The potential reasons for this are understood.  In Phase II, a revised system meeting the specifications will be developed through a combination of lower electronic amplifier noise and higher acoustic sensitivity with highsensor capacitance.  This may require a change of sensors to a modified piezocable, series combinations of multiple cables or the use of PVDF cylinders.  A prototype, optimizing signal and noise, suitable for the IMS application will be developed anddemonstrated in a field test.  An all-electronic piezoelectric infrasound ISM array alternative would be less complex than the present design and will provide many advantages.  The simpler array would likely be less susceptible to environmental factors,lower in cost both to purchase and maintain, more reliable, easier to replace, and possibly less visible and thereby less susceptible to vandalism.  It also offers the prospect of novel electronic processing.  If individual subelements are monitored,arrays can beamformed to provide directionality.  Similarly array sections that are noisy for any reason (e.g., due to animals or other highly local phenomena) can be identified and temporarily ignored in order to maintain the signal to noise ratio for theentire array.  Beyond the CTBT applications, due to their simplicity, light weight, flexibility, and low cost, piezoelectric infrasound sensors become attractive for a number of military and civilian applications.",

This project will develop data processing methods (identification algorithms) for use with these instruments, which make spectrally resolved optical reflectance measurements.  The new algorithms will enhance the speed and accuracy of identification and provide the ability to sort between plastics with small variations in composition.  Phase I obtained a spectral database of commonly used plastic containers and determined the optimal number and location of spectral bands necessary for the identification of each type of plastic.  In a comparison with a commercial instrument, the new algorithm had an accuracy of 100% versus 83% for the commercial instrument.

(PSI) proposes to develop and demonstrate a novel approach for the sensing of chemically contaminated material using recently emergent Quantum Cascade (QC) laser technology.  The focus of the Phase I effort was the detection ofpersistent (non-volatile) chemical agents such as HD and VX on man-made surfaces.  In this effort PSI implemented a prototype system and successfully demonstrated the feasibility of detecting thin films of the agent simulant SF96 at thicknesses of 0.5 \u00c2\u00bfm(50 \u00c2\u00bfg/cm2).  The extinction of the laser light was found to exhibit Beer's law type attenuation in this coverage range, which is well below actionable levels.  In Phase II we propose the development of a three laser system capable of detecting nerve andvesicant chemical agent films on natural and man-made surfaces at ranges up to 1 km.  This system will be constructed for implementation on a ground-based vehicle.  Construction of the system will be followed by a series of laboratory and field tests toevaluated the effectiveness of the method under a broad range of conditions.  The system will be delivered to AFRL following the completion of the effort.",

        "abstract": "The success of numerous weapons systems, now under active development, depends upon electronics capable of withstanding very high acceleration and mechanical shock. Most will use crystal oscillators.  Applications include guided munitions, smartand penetrating weapons.  For this program we are interested in the applications which incorporate on-board GPS receivers as part of the guidance system.  The receiver requires a frequency source whose accuracy determines the time to acquire the firstsatellite.  To meet the allowable thermally induced frequency shift this will be a TCXO - - a temperature-compensated crystal oscillator. Although the circuitry of a crystal oscillator is relatively shock inert, the conventional crystal resonators used areinherently susceptible to shock. To manufacture crystal oscillators shock-hardened up to 50,000 G there is a corresponding need for hardened resonators. PTI has been intimately involved over the past decade in the development of resonator shock-hardeningtechnology.  Each technique developed to date has certain limitations, different for each. By combining techniques and adding new novel techniques we felt that inherent failure mechanisms could be eliminated. This first phase of this program demonstratedthat we can produce a much more rugged but still economical resonator to use in a high shock TCXO.",

        "abstract": "The astronomical community recognizes the Pixon(TM) method as the highest performance image reconstruction method ever developed. In addition to tremendous performance gains relative to competing methods (factors of several in resolution, orders of magnitude in sensitivity and robust artifact rejection), the Pixon method is much faster than standard non-linear methods (orders of magnitude). By nature, the Pixon method is highly parallelizable, suggesting that hardware implementation should achieve video rates (30 Hz) for 512x512 pixel images. We propose to design such hardware, as a prelude to construction in Phase-II. Such hardware would have tremendous commercial applications (medical imaging, radar, commercial satellite and aircraft imaging, surveillance, military intelligence), and be directly relevant to the goals of NASA's Data Understanding and Adaptive Methods (SBIR 99-1, Topic 21.03) program. The Pixon method directly provides the ability to deal quantitatively with uncertainty present in data by building flexible models through which observables are linked to quantities of scientific or engineering interest. A Pixon hardware implementation would be of immediate benefit to NASA, dramatically improving the quality of NASA's imaging data. Furthermore it will provide a natural front-end processor for future robotic vision or image classification/segmentation engines.",

Traditional ampoule/cartridge assemblies lack the ability to provide sufficient quench rates due to gaps between the cartridge and the ampoule. An innovative quench crucible comprised of an internal ceramic liner in direct contact with a reinforcing metal overlay is the needed solution. With proper selection, the ceramic liner will provide the chemical compatibility for processing the PI's sample, and the reinforcement metal overlay in direct contact with the liner will enable rapid quench rates and prevent cracking. During Phase I, two novel fabrication methods will be investigated which will allow the fabrication of reliable quench crucibles. The first technique will use preformed ceramic ampoules reinforced with a deposited metal overlay. The second technique will involve the spray forming of both a ceramic liner and metal reinforcement on a removable mandrel. With the development of these two crucible fabrication methods, essentially any principle investigators' sample containment requirements can be satisfied.",

Later the biocatalyst can be dissolved again in a        \n suspension of the starting materials at the initial conditions. Therefore,         \n these biocatalysts acquire the advantages of free enzymes (high activity in        \n heterogeneous systems) and of immobilized enzymes (the possibility of a reuse).    \n Biocatalysis is underutilized in industry due to the industry requirement that     \n the biocatalyst should be reusable and the reaction has a high throughput.         \n Solubility of the compounds in limited and this necessitates running the           \n reaction in heterogeneous suspension of the starting materials and the             \n products.

        "abstract": "The Montreal Protocol eliminated the manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons that cause chemical depletion of the ozone layer calling for replacement for the gaseous fire-extinguishing agents, halons. Replacement gases proved to have problems from generation of toxic byproducts to poor fire suppression capability. Powsus, Inc., developed and patented an environmentally friendly powder enhancement to these replacement gases, Envirogel, that demonstrates fire suppression levels equal to or better than the halons without the toxic byproducts. The application of this EPA SNAP approved extinguishant has been evaluated in Phase I in a novel patented distribution system that stores the agent in a tough, light-weight pressure vessel plastic tube that bursts when exposed to increased temperature and increased pressures, releasing the agent for fire suppression. Phase I provided evaluation of at least two types of plastic tubes that can be successfully utilized for inexpensive, automatic extinguishment of fires in contained areas such as engine compartments and cargo containers when designed for their specific operating conditions. This technology applies globally to high fire risk conditions of all kinds, fuel fire hazards (engines), or material storage. The fire protection industry is a controlled industry. For commercialization to occur, the application of this new technology must be demonstrated and verified in Phase II with the recognized regulatory fire agencies, UL, FM, EN3 (Europe), and USCG. The basic Phase II development effort would be to confirm the Phase I success with long-term aging of product configurations: plastics and agents for permeability, high- and low- temperature operation, accelerated aging, fire suppression minimums, fire type capability, corrosion, and any other criteria for commercial acceptance that the testing agencies desire. Because there are no existing standards for this unique product, new standards will have to be established with the approval agencies.",

The product addresses    \n a pivotal skill --generalized identity matching to sample -- which is a target     \n of many current programs for teaching this population (and also for teaching       \n young typically developing children). In identity matching, students are           \n presented with an array of two- or three-dimensional stimuli and required to       \n select the item that physically matches (i.e., is identical to) a sample; hence    \n the name \"matching to sample.\" The project has two major objectives. First,        \n based on a successful prototype developed in Phase I, we will develop a            \n full-feature version of the StartMatching! product, in anticipation of             \n commercialization. Second, we will verify that the product (1) can be              \n implemented effectively by its intended users and (2) teaches matching skills      \n reliably in settings in which it will be routinely used.  \nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nThe product being developed and evaluated may have a significant impact on special education practice for a variety of student populations. As such, the product is potentially marketable to educators, psychologists, other professionals, and parents.",

Our rate offalse positives and false negatives were less than 0.4% when attempting to detectthe attack using a 4-second window. The rates of false positives and false negativesdrop even lower when we increased that window to 16 seconds. Our success can beattributed to the use of probability density functions (PDFs) (versus averages,variances, etc.), the compression of PDFs, and the efficient use of innovative typeof NNs. This tool, if deployed in the Army's Tactical Internet, can remove therequirement of having high personnel expertise needed to examine the data (e.g.,System logs) to detect intrusions.

Unlike standard electrical testing, the           \n machine will be able to separately identify pinhole, thin region, and embedded     \n particle defects. It will offer quantitative measurements (rather than simply      \n accept/reject decisions) and will lend itself to precisely marking the             \n locations of defects. The latter capability, together with the non-destructive     \n nature of the test itself, will be of very high value in Quality Assurance         \n efforts to understand the nature and causes of defects, and in defect              \n prevention generally.                                                              \n                                                                                    \n As was demonstrated in Phase I, the new machine will be able to test not only      \n latex, but also polyurethane condoms. (The two have different optical              \n properties.) Currently, pinhole testing of polyurethane condoms is done by a       \n pneumatic differential pressure technique that is cumbersome and expensive to      \n use. Optical testing would offer the advantage of common, convenient               \n application to both latex and polyurethane products. Further, the unique           \n ability of the optical test techniques to detect thin regions and embedded         \n particles, and to localize defects, will have strong appeal to the industry.\n PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\n The proposed system will be immediately useful in the Quality Assurance laboratories of\n all manufacturers of condoms.  It will be especially appealing to manufacturers of non-\n latex condoms.  It will be useful in central R & D  and product development facilities, and in\n compliance labs.  Once the new techniques are accepted, it is expected that the optical\n testing could be adapted to high rate screening testing in the factories.

Because the absorption of light by molecules is the basis for such measurements, there is a need to improve the sensitivity of differential absorption lidar (DIAL) instruments, which are used to make these atmospheric absorption measurements.   This project will significantly advance this measurement technology by employing IR detectors that can be rapidly shuttered, so that the detector\u00c2\u00bfs exposure to optical background is limited to the exposure time set by the returning laser pulse.  A focal plane array will be developed having a LWIR detector array and companion CMOS amplifier array that can be programmed to readout selected pixels at ~100 ns sampling intervals.   In Phase I, a readout integrated circuit (RIOC) was designed for low noise readout of a HgCdTe array of 256 detectors at 100 ns intervals.  This RIOC was laid out in CMOS, and the feasibility of building this high gain, low noise circuit on 100 micron centers was shown.   Phase II will complete the design, and the RIOC will be fabricated, evaluated, and integrated with an array of 256 detectors sensitive in the 8.5 to 11.5 micron region.  The focal plane array will be delivered to Los Alamos National Laboratory for integration and test with a multi-wavelength laser DIAL system.

Edge parameters also strongly influence the global plasma confinement and the pattern of power and particle flux to the chamber wall.  Although edge plasma turbulence has been studied for many years, the high speed dynamics of its two-dimensional structure is still highly uncertain due to a lack of appropriate diagnostics.  This project will develop new ultra-high frame imaging to make two-dimensional images of edge turbulence with a high enough framing rate to resolve the time evolution of the turbulence within one autocorrelation time (i.e. one \u00c2\u00bfeddy turnover\u00c2\u00bf time, on the order of microseconds).  In Phase I, a prototype camera with 64 x 64 pixels, operating at 100,000 frames/sec, was optically interfaced to NSTX to capture images of plasma edge turbulence.  Initial measurements indicated a need for improved shuttering and increased sensitivity, such as could be obtained using an image intensifier preceding ultra-high speed imager.

It is the first intervention for depression that is appropriate for individuals in all stages of change-not merely the minority who are prepared to take action. In Phase I of this Fast Track Initiative, the aims are to norm TTM measures, develop the TTM interventions, and determine the feasibility of this approach by assessing study recruitment rates and reactions to the intervention materials. Primary care patients who screen positive for mild to moderate depression and are not involved in treatment will complete surveys for measurement norming (n=100) or participate in a pilot-test of the intervention materials (n=50). If feasibility conditions are met, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial in Phase II to assess the efficacy of the expert system intervention for depression.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION: Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) has become      \n the predominant treatment for symptomatic coronary atherosclerotic lesions.        \n Despite its prevalent use, this technique continues to be plagued by restenosis    \n rate of 40% with resultant enormous added health care costs and patient            \n morbidity. Radiation therapy applied locally at the site of coronary balloon       \n injury holds great promise to reduce this restenosis rate. All current and         \n proposed techniques of radiation delivery carry significant drawbacks of safety    \n and effectiveness of uniform dose application. This project proposes a unique,     \n novel approach to radiation delivery through utilization of short-lived            \n positron emitting isotope, Cu-62, produced by a generator system. This isotope     \n is delivered into the angioplasty balloon and provides the required radiation      \n with a brief and safe inflation time. Safety issues are addressed through use      \n of a Cu-62 chemical form assuring blood binding in the event of balloon rupture    \n combined with the short 9.7 minute half-life of Cu-62. Use of a balloon            \n provides significant advantages of uniformity of dose delivery and with Cu-62      \n is completely safe. In Phase I, an automated concentration system was developed    \n which coupled to the Zn-62/Cu-62 generator produced the highly concentrated        \n solution of Cu-62. This concentrator was employed in porcine overstretch injury    \n model of restenosis, which demonstrated the feasibility of safe use of             \n generator produced Cu-62 and also achieved a substantial reduction of              \n neointimal hyperplasia using a delivered dose of 25 Gy.                            \n                                                                                    \nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nNot Available",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disorder characterized clinically by progressive loss of memory, cognition, reasoning, judgement and emotional stability that gradually leads to profound mental deterioration and ultimately death. AD is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly, today affecting 4-5 million Americans, which is expected to double in incidence in the next 25 years. AD is characterized by the brain accumulation of insoluble fibrillar amyloid deposits containing the beta-amyloid protein (Abeta), either as extracellular amyloid plaques in the brain parenchyma or in blood vessel walls. Abeta amyloid formation, deposition and persistence in brain is believed to play a central role in AD pathogenesis by contributing to neuronal loss and memory dysfunction, and therefore has become a central target for the development of new drugs for the treatment of AD and related disorders. In AD, there is currently no cure or substantially effective treatment, and the patient usually dies within 3-10 years from disease onset. Our previous studies has led to the identification of a natural substance derived from the amazon rain forest woody vine, Uncaria tomentosa (i.e. Cat's claw), referred to as PTI-00703, which acts a potent inhibitor of Abeta fibril formation/growth, and causes disruption/disassembly of pre-formed Abeta fibrils. In Phase I of our studies, we used assay guided fractionation and HPLC to isolate, test and characterize active ingredients within PTI-00703 that possess potent AB fibrillogenesis inhibitory activity. A number of major ingredients (collectively known as PTI-777) were purified and tested in relevant in vitro and animal model assays, and found to possess extremely potent Abeta fibrillogenesis inhibitory activity. In Phase II proposed studies, we will complete structural identification of each of the PTI-777 active components, and pre-clinical studies including in vitro and in vivo blood-brain-barrier penetration studies, use of relevant rat and plaque- producing transgenic mouse models to determine potential inhibitory effects on prevention and clearance of brain amyloid plaques, behavioral studies in rodents, and safety/toxicology, and biodistribution studies for the ultimate identification of a clinical drug candidate. These studies are anticipated to lead to the identification of a new drug candidate for the treatment of Abeta amyloidosis in AD and related disorders which involves use of a naturally-derived compound. Knowledge gained from these studies will also identify structural parameters necessary for the design of new anti-amyloid therapeutics for the treatment of AD and other amyloidoses. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) currently affects 4-5 million Americans, at an estimated cost of $80-$100 billion.

        "abstract": "This proposal seeks to improve the performance of density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the commercial quantum chemistry software package Q-Chem. DFT strikes the right balance between accuracy and computational cost, and is used to model molecular processes in a wide variety of disciplines, including biology, chemistry, and materials science. In the work of our Phase I SBIR, we developed a novel method, called IncDFT, short for incremental DFT, that reduced the computational cost of the most time consuming step in DFT energy calculations by a factor of two. IncDFT, takes advantage of the iterative nature of DFT calculations by reusing, rather than recomputing, computationally expensive quantities that differ insignificantly between iteration cycles. In this Phase II proposal, IncDFT will be developed for all major aspects of DFT calculations in Q-Chem, including computation of the energy with gradient corrected functionals, the evaluation of critical points on the potential energy surface, the computation of the analytical Hessian, and calculation of excited electronic states. Care will also be taken to maintain Q-Chem's excellent parallel efficiency. The successful completion of this project will allow Q-Chem to provide its end-users with a software package that will significantly reduce the execution time for calculations employing DFT, thereby greatly increasing their productivity accordingly. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: DFT is the preferred computational model in many areas of chemical and biological research due to its accuracy. Still, its application can be time-consuming. The research in the Phase II proposal will produce a faster version of Q-Chem for DFT calculations, which will enable users to finish their calculations in less time, or run calculations on larger molecular systems with the same cost.

        "abstract": "Innovative approaches are required to make the interferometric testing of large aspheric, and/or non-axisymmetric surfaces both flexible and cost effective.  QED proposes to develop a scanning, off-axis, subaperture system aimed at extending thecapabilities of interferometric testing to cover larger clear apertures (200mm), larger numerical apertures (0.5), and larger aspheric departures (>200 waves), with increased accuracy through calibration.  This system represents a significant advance that,with further development, could offer general test capabilities for a wider range of conformal optics.  Our system's success relies on the proposed innovations for efficient subaperture stitching, automatic system calibration, absolute measurements, andextended dynamic range through high-density interference fringe analysis.  Fundamentally limiting challenges to aspheric metrology are addressed principally by automatic calibration to remove the errors associated with aberrations in both the imagingoptics and in the reference wave, as well as corrections for positioning errors and image distortion.  Success in Phase I has provided the foundation for the Phase II tasks of developing a fully automated metrology system for more strongly aspheric optics.Our prospects for success in both developing and commercializing the final product are greatly enhanced by the fact that QED has entered into a co-development collaboration with a leading interferometer supplier.",

To minimize adverse effects of turbulence at high air speeds, the sensing cavity will beenclosed in a flow controlling aerodynamic housing.  Comparative evaluation of the instrument will be done using critical components from a Thompson-Vetter laboratory standard refractometer.

Quantum Magnetics proposes a revolutionary enhancement to conventional metal detectors.  Using a multi-component magnetic gradiometer as the receiver enables not only detection, but also localization, of an object.Wideband, multi-frequency excitation and advanced signal processing (collaborating with Duke University) can characterize metallic targets, discriminating mines and UXO from clutter.  The system is a single tool to detect, locate and characterize bothlandmines and UXO.  It lends itself to integration with other sensor technologies, such as ground-penetrating radar, soil conductivity anomaly sensors, and Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR).  QM is the world leader in NQR for detection of bulk explosivecharges in landmines.  In Phase I, we will collect passive (magnetic) and active (electromagnetic) signatures of various types of simulant mines (SIMs) and clutter; we will then use these signatures to demonstrate the enhanced discrimination afforded bywideband excitation and signal processing.

        "abstract": "In this proposed Phase II program we will develop board-level optical waveguides to alleviate the ever-tightening electrical interconnection bottleneck.  VLSI provides fast intrinsic signal speeds but these speeds cannot be supported by electricalinterconnects between other chips on the same board.   Conversion to optical interconnects at the intra-board level can overcome these limits.  The practical limits of optical interconnects arises from the optoelectronic transmitters and receivers, whichcurrently have bandwidths up to 10GHZ.  The emerging 40-GHz OC-768 telecommunications standard is a strong indication that optical interconnects will keep pace with VLSI for many years.  However, their cost-effective assimilation into conventionaltechnologies remains the major unresolved issue.  Therefore, we propose an optoelectronic board-level bus employing a fully imbedded optical interconnection layer based on polymeric waveguides, thin-film vertical-cavity-surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) andthin-film metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetectors, integrated onto a PCB structure and planarized to allow conventional integration of noncritical electrical interconnects.  Optical couplers will couple light between the transceivers and the chipsmounted on the boards's surface.  By demonstrating these integrations we will prove the practicality of high speed board-level optical interconnects, which should lead to Phase III commercialization.  The proposed technology to be developed replacesboard-level electrical interconnects with optical interconnects for critical high-speed signals.  Because the optical interconnectivity layer is embedded in an otherwise conventional printed circuit board (PCB), this technology supports conventional PCBdesign and fabrication practices.  Electronics engineers can design systems utilizing both electrical and high-speed optical interconnects without concerning themselves with the unfamiliar optical technologies.  This should result in broad marketacceptance.  Once accepted the technology should continue to be useful for many years as advancements in telecommunications optoelectronic devices are readily incorporated into the board level optical interconnects.",

Radiometrics Corporation conceived the new method and is applying for patent. Based on preliminary simple modeling, the capability of the new method appears fairly certain. We propose to confirm our preliminary results with more rigorous modeling. We also have conceived of three concepts to obtain range information on icing conditions. The capabilities of the concepts are uncertain and we propose modeling and testing.

Improved incineration analysis and designtools can greatly assist the Army in accomplishing this task safely,efficiently and economically, while ensuring protection of public healthand the environment.In Phase I we have:  obtained and used a full chemical mechanism for theGB simulant DMMP and showed by two methods the destruction of DMMP wascomplete and extremely rapid in a liquid incinerator and a metals partsfurnace; constructed and exercised four CFD models of incineratorcomponents; and demonstrated these models are useful for exploringscenarios relevant to chemical demilitarization incinerator operation.In Phase II we will: identify chemical mechanisms for GB & VX nerveagents and mustard that allow the identification of PICs; extend thecapability of existing CFD modules for transient operation and developother modules; benchmark the incinerator models; and demonstratethe utility of an engineering design workbench to improveincinerator performance.",

Inclusion of detailed chemistry into 3D simulations with turbulence-chemistry interaction will be computationally intractable for the foreseeable future. Practical simulation of reacting flows requires reduced mechanisms tailored to the application and conditions of interest. The PSE created in Phase I allows the user to rapidly create reduced mechanisms, set up multi-parameter test problems for comparison to detailed chemistry, and interrogate and visualize the results more thoroughly than was previously possible. Human effort for reduced mechanism validation is reduced from days to hours. Rigorous testing is necessary to make reduced mechanisms a reliable commercial product. In Phase II the PSE will be extended to automatically optimize reduced mechanisms to the users' specification, and produce reduced mechanism modules for a variety of applications that seamlessly integrate into a variety of Computational Fluid Dynamics codes.\nThese technologies will have commercial value due to the ever-increasing need to include more detailed chemistry into the design and analysis software used by scientists and engineers. The problem solving environment provides the engineer with the ability to rapidly create reduced mechanisms, set up multiple test problems covering a multidimensional parameter space for comparison to detailed chemistry, and efficiently interrogate and visualize the results.",

To date, CFD codes have incorporated only very simplified descriptions of thechemistry.  In many cases, this is not sufficient, and more detailed representations of the chemistry must be used.  Within the proposed Phase II program, we will be integrating technology in several key areas to develop a capability for CFD modeling ofscramjet combustion that has not, as yet, been fully realized for practical application.  The key technologies include state-of-the-art detailed mechanisms for aviation fuels, an automated procedure for detailed mechanism reduction, a 3-D turbulentreactive flow code for simulation of high-speed combusting flows, novel tabulation procedures to improve the computational efficiency of CFD simulations, and PDF techniques to account for turbulence-chemistry interactions.",

Our novel discovery has lead us to proposed that the          \n increased plasma level of iNOS can serve as a valid biochemical marker to          \n prognosticate the onset of SIRS and/or sepsis and to monitor a patient's           \n condition as it improves or deteriorates. Our goal is to develop an innovative     \n new clinical diagnostic that can rapidly detect, quantitate and monitor this       \n increase in iNOS prior to the onset of severe sepsis and septic shock, and thus    \n provide an early warning signal for future deleterious events. An early            \n diagnosis will provide a basis for the earlier initiation of therapies than is     \n currently practiced. The results from two prior studies indicate that an           \n increased plasma level of iNOS can be detected and measured in patients with       \n SIRS and/or sepsis, occurs early in an episode of SIRS and/or sepsis, and          \n forecasts future problems. The aims of this phase 2 project are (1) to extend      \n the study to 400 patients in order to assess if the observations made on two       \n smaller cohorts of patients are generally applicable and (2) to determine if       \n the increased plasma level of iNOS in SIRS and sepsis is unique to this            \n pathology and does not occur in other diseases associated with an over             \n expression of iNOS. Once completed, this project will bring a unique and much      \n needed new clinical diagnostic onto the market, and this, in turn, will lead to    \n improved health care for critically ill patients.   \nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:\nOver 1,200,000 cases/yr of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis occur in the\nUSA; these lead to over 500,000 cases/yr of severe sepsis and septic shock and 100,000 - 250,000 deaths/yr. A rapid test to assess a patient's entry into and progress down the sepsis pathway to severe sepsis and septic shock is needed. Our EIA is designed to meet this clinical need, to lower patient cost by reducing the length of ICU stays. and to improve patient outcome.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is designed to develop and commercialize high-durability UV polarizer optics with unprecedented performance. The breakthrough polarizers are made from stacks of oriented, birefringent thin film layers, which are obtained by vacuum deposition at an oblique angle. The film material itself is optically isotropic, but the birefringence arises from the nanostructure of the layers in the film stack. Films can be constructed from a single material, relieving the conventional constraints on material transparency and enabling a wider operating wavelength range. Using LiF as the film material, for example, could extend the operating range down to 110 nm. Extension to the far UV and extreme UV appears possible with materials such as silicon carbide or boron carbide. The deposition technique thus offers an exciting opportunity to engineer unique film properties. In Phase II, the investigator proposes to enlarge the database of film materials for UV chiral film polarizers and design, fabricate (using a customized deposition system), and characterize UV chiral film polarizers for practical applications. The investigator will then develop high-speed deposition techniques to ensure the polarizers are low-cost. Commercialization activities will accelerate in Phase III.\nThe inorganic UV polarizer films may have several advantages over conventional polarizer components, and become key devices in many important industrial manufacturing processes, including systems for chemical synthesis, drug development, and liquid crystal alignment for LCDs",

        "abstract": "Through the Phase I SBIR process, Rini Technologies Inc. has demonstrated the feasibility of using evaporative spray cooling to reduce the temperature of high power laser diode stacks below the temperature at which they currently operate.  This reductionin temperature, while operating at high power, results in increased laser efficiency, extended lifetime and reliability, as well as the ability to overdrive the output power above the rated power limit.  The Phase II effort will focus on the development ofa prototype system that will cool a 1.4Kw diode laser source.  The size of the stack will be 1cm x 7cm.  During the development of the prototype, the following issues will be addressed; 1) scaling the spray technique from cooling 1cm2 to 7cm2, 2) designingand fabricating a compact nozzle array to spray the larger surface, 3) designing and fabricating a compact and efficient condenser unit to reduce the overall size of the system, and 4) selecting the optimum liquid pump to reduce cavitations, vibration andpower consumption.  The prototype system will use a diode laser source provided by Decade Optical Systems, Inc. (DOS) DOS is a commercial and military solid state and diode laser manufacturer.  They have partnered with RTI, and are providing matching funds($200k) for the Phase II development, and intend to purchase a spray-cooled system from RTI once the prototype development is complete.  The first application of the spray cooled laser system is a 100kW solid-state laser (the Heat Capacity Laser) beingbuilt by the Army Space and Missile Defense Command (ASMDC).  The Army intends to use RTI's evaporative spray cooling technology as the cooling source for the high power diode lasers that are the light source for the solid-state laser.  ASMDC is likely toprovide matching funds to RTI as a level of $1.3M over the duration of the SBIR contract if this funding becomes available from the Joint Technology Office.  The prototype cooling system will be developed at RTI's facility in Orlando, Fl, primarily by RTIpersonal.  RTI will work with engineers from DOS to aid the design of the laser-to-cooler interface.  The benefit of this prototype to high power diode lasers is a reduced operating temperature without increasing cooling costs.  This is accomplished byimplementing a more efficient cooling mechanism.  With reduced diode temperature, efficiency, lifetime and reliability are all increased.  Potential markets include any high power diode application, such as, military weapons and countermeasures;industrial metal processing (welding, cutting, drilling); printing and surface marking.",

        "abstract": "Before communication can take place between a transmitter and its intended receiver in a frequency hopping communication system, the hopping pattern of the receiver must be in synchronism with the hoppping pattern of the transmitter. The development oftechniques for the rapid achievment of this synchronization is one of the most important and challenging tasks in the design of frequency hopping systems.Current solutions to this problem involve sending synchronization or timing information to thereceiver by means of an auxilary channel or by sending the information necessary to synchronize in some non frequency-hopping format. These attempts to address the synchronization problem tend to degrade system performance. The objective of the proposedPhase II program is the design, development and fabrication of a self- synchronizing spread spectrum communication systems. These systems will exploit newly developed analytical techniques that can enable a monitor to synchronize to a frequency hoppingradio by making relatively brief observtions of its frequency- hopping pattern. More specifically, these algorithms enable a frequency-hopping receiver to synchronize to a hopping transmitter by observing the relative times-of-arrival of a singlefrequency.",

Phase I examined the feasibility of conducting human performance-based fitness-for-duty (FFD) testing as an alternative to chemically-based testing. The testing method was brief and inexpensive, and the tests were stable and reliable. Using a multiple cut-off analysis varying proportion of tests passed, they yielded 98+% specificity (minimal false positives) with 80% sensitivity for high dosages of alcohol (and 60% for low). The new battery tightens security, running within self-contained kiosks and providing data encryption and access via smart card usage. Improved managerial control will be implemented within the test system, including test control and scheduling, data analysis methods, and reporting. Additional means of quantifying behavioral decrements will be obtained from sleep deprivation research, analyses of past alcohol research, and an \"alpha\" test site. Data from these sources will yield a better assessment model and refine calculations for tradeoff between test length, specificity, and sensitivity.\nRSK Assessments proffers a tool for testing human performance that could facilitate higher productivity in industrial plants, a means of testing employees while in the field, and reduction in worker on-the-job injuries.",

It will lead to a clean-room compatible, lightweight, compact, inexpensive structure that can meet demanding dynamic performance requirements in next-generation precision microelectronics manufacturing.\nMagnetic levitation has many potential applications in microelectronics manufacturing equipment that require precise planar position control, such as wafer steppers, wafer handlers, wire bonders, surface profilometers, scanned probe microscopes, and precision inspection machines. This technology is expected to figure prominently in the highly competitive microelectronics manufacturing capital equipment industry.",

QoS support for internet multimedia applications is necessary to meet stringent end-to-end requirements such as bandwidth, delay and priorities, scheduling, traffic classification. To scale the solution to largenetworks, we used MPLS (Multiprotocol label Switching) and Class aggregation using the Diff Serv model. To support path protection and fast recovery, the notion of spare resource pre-allocation on MPLS paths was introduced. In Phase I many of the precedingbuilding blocks were evaluated via simulation. In Phase II we will implement the proposed QoS framework on a small test-bed to demonstrate its effectiveness in a physical network. A hybrid simulation that supports physical deployments linked withsimulation models of larger networks will be used to demonstrate scalable to a heterogeneous network with a backbone as well as local (wired and wireless) subnets.",

The key to the innovation of this UAV DIAL is in a small, high performance, diode pumped Cr:LiSAF laser tunable in 830nm range. In a compact and low power consumption configuration, this laser will provide a narrow linewidth and stable 20mJ laser pulses at a high PRF up to 100Hz. These laser characteristics: moderate energy and high PRF are very well suited for high altitude (20km) UAV flights. The novel digital lidar design approach using a moderate laser pulse energy with high PRF allows the laser system to be very compact and robust for ease of deployment on the UAV, while maintaining a lidar performance equal to that of the conventional DIAL system. In Phase I, a breadboard laser with all proposed attributes will be developed and the performance will be demonstrated in the laboratory. A comprehensive design of the lidar system integrated with the laser, will also be performed to meet the UAV operational requirements.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): High dose chemotherapy is now a commonly      \n used approach for treatment of hematologic and other cancers, but causes severe    \n myelosuppression requiring progenitor cell infusions. Purging cancer cells from    \n infusions, while maintaining progenitor cells, is an important goal in             \n optimizing the curative potential of this technology. Current purging              \n techniques have limited efficiency and demand intensive time, technology and       \n cost. We have demonstrated a new technology that selectively kills larger cells    \n (including tumor cells) while preserving or enriching hematopoietic progenitor     \n cells, and does so rapidly, profoundly and inexpensively. In phase II, we will     \n apply this technology to a relevant hematologic cancer model (multiple             \n myeloma). Process parameters will be refined to achieve complete tumor purging     \n and progenitor cell preservation/enrichment from tumor-seeded blood or cord        \n blood cells. Sensitive and accurate cell enumeration will be achieved through      \n flow cytometry, tumor regrowth assays, real-time PCR, progenitor cell              \n quieseence/pluripotency assays, and in vivo hematopoietic reconstitution and       \n malignancy assessment in NOD/SCIDt,B2m about mice. We will then apply refined      \n parameters and assessment techniques to clinical volumes of bone marrow cells      \n from myeloma patients, utilizing an optimized, clinical-scale flowing process      \n apparatus. We anticipate the Phase III effort will involve Phase II clinical       \n trials supported by a major biomedical partner.     \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nWe expect PEF cell-size specific inactivation technology to be an effective transplant tissue purging strategy for post-intensive-therapy patient support. With the propose refinements and assessments, it should provide an approach for rapid, cost-effective, high purity isolation of stem cells from progenitor cell preparations, which will open research, clinical, gene therapy and stem cell banking markets. Our market analysis indicates that the total revenues for this technology may eventually reach $100 million per year.",

During Phase I, SARA applied a powerful combination of analytical, numerical, and experimental tools to simulate and/or measure the electromagnetic behavior of all the key components of ourproposed approach. We performed in-depth assessments of gain, power-handling, steerability, bandwidth, polarization, and more.  This work led to improvements in our initial parameter choices, resulting in higher gain, greater compactness, and greaterefficiency.  Our conclusion is clear: we can definitely meet the Army's requirements for a practical, deployable, compact, lightweight, rapidly-steerable, high-gain, L-band HPM antenna.  In Phase II, SARA will construct two prototype antennas forexperimental pattern characterizations and high-power tests, the latter to be performed with an ARL-supplied HPM source.

        "abstract": "Despite years of R&D, most methods of ocean wave energyconversion (OWEC) are still indirect, bulky, expensive, andmechanically-inefficient. This is not due to bad engineering.The problem is mechanical impedance matching; ocean waves offerup their power as very strong forces (10's of tons) acting atvery low velocities (< 1 m/s). To couple this power toconventional high-speed rotary electric generators, inefficientmechanisms such as spin-up gearboxes or airpressurization/turbine systems are needed. In contrast, SARA'sapproach replaces those elements with a direct-conversionmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator.  The impedance-matchingburden is shifted from the mechanical to the electrical domain,where the high currents and low voltages generated via MHD mustbe converted to practical levels.  Fortunately, this can be donewith modern electronic switches and transformers. The result isefficient, compact, economical, and deployable.  During Phase I,we designed, built, and tested a small-scale liquid-metal MHDgenerator and solid-state power converter, generating 100's ofwatts at 115V AC and solidly validating the principles ofoperation.

At the same time, NLO materials limit the longevity and efficiency of these laser systems due to low damage thresholds, poor optical quality and small nonlinearities. As a result, new NLO materials are required to improve the performance of existing systems and to provide new combinations of optical and mechanical properties that yield new wavelengths. Specifically, there is a need for new/better NLO materials for use in high efficiency all solid-state lasers operating in the UV. Borate crystals, including BBO and LBO, are currently two of the industry standards for this application. A new material, lithium borogermanate (LBG), has the potential to replace these materials with increased transmission in the UV combined with larger nonlinearities. Based on preliminary characterization results, crystalline structure, and composition, LBG has the potential to enable new devices that require operation deeper in the UV.

The unmanned vehicle, whether operating on air, land,or sea provides force multiplication, lower costs, and reduced risk of casualties.  As they exist today, the miniature autonomous munitions act independently to locate and attack the target.  Their performance could be greatly enhanced by allowing groupsof munitions to share information and coordinate activities.  Scientific Research Corporation (SRC) proposes to build and test a communication architecture for the Submunition vehicles that is based on the industry standard Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum(DSSS) chip-sets that re used heavily in unlicensed ISM band applications.  Implementing a network radio using the DSSS approach is low-cost and rugged due to the commercial chip-set implementation and is relatively compact.  However, the performance levelrequired for this application is not available with any commercial WLAN product.  In contrast to commercial WLAN products, SRC is proposing to surround the core DSSS chip-set with numerous enhancements to the design to dramatically improve range andperformance.  Rather than a maximum open-air range of 1000 feet, SRC's design will have a range of 4-6 miles.  The network will use novel routing protocols that accommodate rapidly changing multi-hop path, and self-forming network as opposed to the typicalWLAN implementation where nodes are attached to a given access point and specific server found in the office network scenario.",

        "abstract": "Not Available This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the traditional size limit of the Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) input aperture. This limit (approximately 8-inches) is imposed by (1) practical fabrication limits to the size of glass flats that can be polished to a surface figure of lambda/100 and (2) by cost limitations. Although an array of smaller glass plates might be used to expand the collecting area of the FPI, coordination of spectral scans over the array elements requires unwieldy control systems or else is not possible with conventional barometric or piezo-electric FRI systems. This research establishes arrays of innovative FPI etalons that use liquid crystal (LC) in the FPI resonant cavity. Spectral scanning of these devices is accomplished by application of a low current to conducting layers applied to the glass substrates. The electric field imposed upon liquid crystal in the resonant cavity alters the orientation of the LC, and thus the index of refraction of the material in the resonant cavity. The ease of electronic control over the refractive index in the FPI cavity permits simple, low weight, low power coordination of multiple LC filled cells and thus makes possible a large array of FPI cells, scanning a spectrum in unison. Phase II will design and fabricate two 10-inch diameter arrays of LC FPI (LCFP) filters. One array will be configured for Doppler measurements of atmospheric emissions and the other for 0.16-nanometer spectral resolution.\nPotential commercial applications are expected in (1) atmospheric lidar, (2) space-based environmental sensing, (3) passive airglow sensing, (4) clear-air turbulence detection, and (5) target detection",

        "abstract": "Reliable Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) techniques exist for many different sensors. The effectiveness of each technique is limited due to restrictions placed on the target characteristics.  We propose algorithms that fuse target ID informationfrom different NCTR sources in order to improve the overall NCTR performance regardless of the target  characteristics. During the Phase I effort,  we developed and tested several fusion approaches on simulated data.  Without utilizing informationregarding the quality of the individual NCTR technique,  the results indicated that the superiority of the FUSION technique (e.g., Bayes) is prominent for data of good quality, whereas for  data of poor quality,  training or pre-processing (e.g., confusionmatrix, correlation) is more important. Incorporating training, estimation, and information regarding the quality of the individual NCTR technique renders the Correlation and Confusion Matrix methods the best, followed by the Dempster's Rule Fuser. Theprimary focus of the Phase II will be to design and develop a prototype software system consisting of robust multisource data fusion and NCTR algorithms.  The emphasis will be on further  prototype development and demonstration of  the data fusiontechniques implemented in  Phase I. Additional fusion approaches including the Fuzzy Modified Dempster's approach  will also be developed under this effort. This Phase II development will be based on testing against REAL DATA with target identificationinformation from multiple NCTR techniques.  The project team includes Dr. Ronald Mahler of Lockheed Martin, who will provide both technical and commercialization support.",

Air Force missions that are relevant tothis effort include Airborne Laser (ABL) main and adjunct missions, Tactical HEL Fighter (THELF) missions, applications of the Space Based Laser (SBL) and Relay Missions against ground and airborne targets, Airborne Tactical Laser (ATL) and Laser Gunshipmissions. During the course of this project, Scientific Systems Company Inc. (SSCI) and its partner Lockheed Martin-Eagan (LM-E), will address three objectives in support of these critical technologies. They are: 1) Fine Tracking in High ScintillationEnvironments (atmosphere distortion compensation), 2) Detection and Tracking of Ground Targets in Heavy Clutter Environments (track-before-detect techniques), 3) Test and Evaluation at AFRL/DEBA sites, the Advanced Concept Lab, MIT/LL, or other sponsoredsites and the transition of these technologies into AF missions. Scientific Systems has teamed up with Lockheed-Martin, Eagan for this project, and they will provide both technical and  commercialization support. SSCI and LM-E have a strong background inthe areas of image analysis, pattern recognition and target tracking with applications to areas such as detection, tracking, and estimation in high clutter environments.

Unfortunately, long-standing problems associated with wide field-of-view visual displays forground-based simulator-training applications--to include poor resolution, poor intensity (i.e., luminosity), and high costs-have significantly affected the fielding of DMT training capabilities to date. Display resolution problems are being addressedthrough current Air Force efforts to develop color imaging systems with greater than 5120 x 4096, non-interlaced pixel resolutions at reasonable prices. The proposed Phase II AAcuity20/20-HD (Hyper-Drive) PC-IG Array efforts focus on developing theinterface module for driving such displays. Phase II concentrates on interfacing high-resolution projectors that present out-the-window imagery in high-performance flight trainers for DMT and other display applications. The AAcuity20/20-HD design supportsthe Air Force's capitalization of the rapidly developing PC-based graphics market to provide imagery for these systems. These innovations, founded on PC-based technology, will be capable of presenting 5120 x 4096, 60 HZ, non-interlaced video providing alarge, scalable virtual-screen Hyper-buffer that can be read and written to simultaneously by multiple parallel devices.

SAASY will enable significant increases in runway and airspace safety, and in the pilot\u00c2\u00bfs perception of safety. SAASY is an automated airport-based decision support tool that uses aircraft position and velocity to deduce pilot intent, determines safe separation minimums and landing / takeoff sequences, and communicates this information to pilots via data link. Pilots will use the information to set up and control their landing and takeoff paths so that they are both safe and expeditious. SAASY technology may also provide improved capacity at the smaller airports, both for those with and without ATC towers. This technology could also be used to support air carrier operations, ground defense operations in regions without towered runways, commercial rotorcraft operations at vertiports (e.g., at off-shore oil rigs), and special landing strip operations by commercial and government entities such as overnight express package delivery, fire fighting, and drug interdiction.

        "abstract": "Stress monitoring in composite materials is a difficult but necessary endeavor.  It is required for testing to compare measurements with modeling predictions as well as to monitor flexing and vibration under load.  Presently, there are only a limitednumber f methods to measure strains that are suitable for embedding in a composite material and all are either expensive or complex.  This proposal is for development and application of a new and novel strain sensor consisting of a small diameter wirecoated with a magnetic film.  The magnetic film dominated the impedance of the overall system cost is low with a potential cost advantage over fiber optic sensors or a factor of 100.  The technology of the magnetic sensor make it suitable to obtain curinginformation of a composite.  Additionally, it can be used to obtain information on external strain throughout the life of the material.  Since the system can be used in a modified array structure, the stain at different points can be measured versus time,giving information on the vibration of the structure, including modal analysis.  This proposal addresses one specific application of a new technology, a magnetic sensor for embedding in composites to monitor internal strain, booth during manufacture andthroughout the composite life cycle.  Such sensors can be used to monitor the health of advanced composites used for airframes and space applications, as well as more conventional structures such as buildings, bridges, etc.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (Unedited Applicant's Abstract): The development of an                 \n ultra-miniature optical pressure sensor is proposed for NHLBI's research           \n topics: Heart and Vascular Diseases, Biosensors. Intended for intravascular        \n use, the sensor must be disposable and, therefore, will be designed to be          \n available at a reasonable cost for clinical use. The small size of the sensor      \n and the flexibility of the optical fibers will result in a pressure transducer,    \n which can be inserted into blood vessels (arteries, veins, or heart chamber)       \n with an angioplasty guide wire with a diameter of only 0.3 mm. The sensor can      \n measure blood pressures in the range of 0 to 300 mmHg with both diastolic and      \n systolic blood pressures. The sensor will operate over time periods of up to a     \n few days without periodic re-calibration. Its pressure readings will be            \n independent of temperature changes in the range of 20 degreesC - 50 degreesC.      \n                                                                                    \n The primary commercial application of this device will be for angioplasty          \n treatment. Because of its small size, the sensor can be used for infants and       \n also to monitor fluid pressures in the human brain after surgery. The low cost     \n will allow it to be used for small animal research. The Phase I effort             \n demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed approach. Prototype development       \n will be carried out in Phase II. \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nNot Available",

VEGF interacts with the endothelial cell           \n specific KDR/flk-1 receptor that is overexpressed in endothelial cells at the      \n sites of angiogenesis relative to its expression on quiescent endothelium.         \n                                                                                    \n In Phase I of this project we have constructed, expressed and purified two         \n novel fusion proteins, SLT-VEGF/L and SLT-VEGF/S which contain, respectively,      \n The A subunit of Shiga-like toxin I (SLT) and a functionally active fragment       \n of the A subunit.  SLT causes hemorrhagic                                          \n colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome by damaging endothelial cells suggesting     \n that endothelial cells are particularly sensitive to SLT .                         \n                                                                                    \n SLT-VEGF/L and SLT-VEGF/S proteins selectively inhibit growth of endothelial       \n cells overexpressing KDR/flk-1 receptors with IC-50 of 0.15 nM.  At low            \n nanomolar concentrations SLT-VEGF/L is cytotoxic for endothelial cells             \n overexpressing KDR/flk-l receptors.  However, these proteins do not affect         \n growing endothelial cells with low numbers of KDR/flk-l receptors, quiescent       \n endothelial cells, and growing non-endothelial cells.  These results provide a     \n rationale for Phase II in vivo testing of SLT-VEGF fusion proteins as highly       \n selective inhibitors of angiogenesis.  We will also test whether SLT-VEGF          \n proteins may synergize with other antitumor drugs by enhancing delivery            \n through damaged tumor endothelium or by creating hypoxic conditions for            \n bioreductive therapeutics.  Finally, we will optimize SLT-VEGF fusion proteins     \n to achieve high levels of expression, activity, and stability that are             \n necessary for preclinical and clinical trials.     \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nA brief summary of the potential commercial applications of the research: VEGF-toxin fusion proteins that inhibit angiogenesis but do not affect normal endothelium or normal cells will be commercial products for therapy of angioaenesis-dependent pathologies.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): This research plan is to develop a            \n Microcarrier-Bioreactor Cell Culture System for the growth and efficient           \n recovery of infected, whole cells from microcarriers in controlled, bioreactor     \n cultures. Primary chick embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells are widely used in viral     \n vaccine production (for both avian and human vaccines), but there are no known     \n licensed-manufacturing protocols which utilize a Microcarrier-Bioreactor System    \n for this purpose. Focus will be on the production of a whole cell Marek's          \n Disease vaccine for avian applications. The System technology developed in the     \n course of these studies could replace large-scale industrial processes in which    \n (1) primary CEF cells are utilized in roller bottles, (2) embryonated, fertile     \n eggs function as tiny bioreactors, such as in the manufacturing of human           \n influenza vaccine or (3) whole cell vaccines and/or immunotherapies.               \n                                                                                    \n Specific Aims I, II and VI. To optimize cell culture conditions for a one to       \n two day HVT-production run using primary CEF cells, secondary CEF cells and        \n immortalized CEF-like cells at high density, in a one-liter bioreactor culture.    \n                                                                                    \n Specific Aim III. To optimize culture conditions for a three-day HVT-production    \n run using secondary CEF cells at the one-liter scale in bioreactor culture.        \n                                                                                    \n Specific Aim IV & V. To develop protocols for rapid harvesting of HVT-infected     \n cells, and separation of those cells from microcarriers, and to achieve            \n high-titer Marek's vaccine production.  \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nMany animal vital vaccines (e.g. Marek's) and human viral vaccines are produced \nusing chick embryo cells, either in roller bottle systems or in embryonated chicken \neggs. Neither process uses microcarrier - bioreactor systems. Large scale\n production of Marek's vaccine in a Miaocarrier-Bioreactor System, will lead to \nsubstantial economic advantages when bioreactors are compared to old technology. \nProduct quality and consistency should also be improved. and manufacturing costs \nreduced. The System herein proposed will utilize (1) primary or secondary CEF \ncells, or immortalized cell lines. (2) special media formulations, (3) bovine sera \nand will evolve the (4) protocols to produce vaccines in this System. The\n technology should extrapolate to other whole-cell human vaccines.   \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nThe current short supply of human influenza vaccine serves to underline the \nimportance for developing technology that is an alternative to embryonated egg \nproduction methods. The lead time from (1) a CDC estimate of the specific influenza \nvirus variant likely to strike the USA, to (2) the availability of the vaccine on a large \nscale is exceedingly long, many months. In the event of an influenza pandemic \nthis many-month lead-time could result in a high fatality rate reminiscent of the \n1917-18 pandemic. If influenza virus vaccine can be produced in very large-scale \nbioreactors, with a fast turn around time (a couple months), the high fatality rate of \na pandemic might be averted. The research proposed has the potential to address \nthis issue.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA-based technologies have become            \n increasingly prominent in research and biotechnology since the discovery of        \n catalytic RNA (ribozymes), techniques for selection of novel functions from        \n random libraries of RNA, and the widespread use of microarrays. However, the       \n cost of producing RNA by synthetic or enzymatic means remains high-at least ten    \n times the cost of DNA, and synthetic methods are limited to short RNAs. This       \n proposal describes a novel method for the low-cost, largescale production of       \n custom RNA products of any length based on amplification in plants using viral     \n vectors, an approach that has been successfully used for the production of         \n protein products. After infection with recombinant virus, the plants are           \n harvested, virions are isolated using an established, single-step procedure,       \n RNA is extracted, and the desired fragment is excised and purified in a simple     \n procedure. Yields of viral RNA are approximately 0.5 percent of total dry plant    \n mass. In Phase I of this project we established proof of principle by              \n demonstrating the insertion of a custom RNA fragment into the viral RNA vector,    \n which remained completely stable and intact under normal storage and in vivo       \n conditions. Upon addition of a new solution component, the insert was              \n efficiently excised from the vector. In Phase II, we will develop this approach    \n into a practical method ready for commercialization. This will involve a series    \n of optimizations to make the system robust enough to overcome any obstacles        \n that may emerge for certain custom RNAs. Our first demonstration of large-scale    \n RNA production from plants will be to several hundred milligrams of a candidate    \n therapeutic ribozyme and a key element of the hepatitis C virus. \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nRNA is an important target for structural biology and biomedical studied including HIV \nand influenza viruses. It also has potential in antisense and ribozyme therapeutics, \nbiotechnology products and molecular biology tools: Our technology would provide \nlarge amounts of custom RNAs less expensively and more efficiently than alternative\n methods. Our current business strategy is to sell custom RNA in partnership with \nLarge Scale Biology Corp. and license the technology to certain other manufacturers.",

        "abstract": "The results of the Phase I project increase the likelihood that the project's new technology will make a major contribution to a healthier world environment. First, the U.S. EPA is introducing mercury-control standards on power plants requiring significant emission reductions from over 1,000 utility coal-fired boilers. A regulatory timetable has now been set, which will lead to the installation of mercury control technologies on these units. Second, an analysis of the measurements supplied in response to EPA's mercury Information Collection Request reveals that the biggest part of the U.S. utility problem is the emission of the elemental form of mercury, which current controls do not capture. During the Phase I project, two discoveries were made that help demonstrate the feasibility of Sorbent Technologies' new duct-injection sorbent approach. First, the new elemental-mercury sorbents were found to work through a chemisorption process. Project experiments showed this to be responsible for high sorbent stability and surprisingly good high-temperature performance. Powdered activated carbons (PACs), the best sorbents currently available, capture mercury primarily through a weak physical adsorption. In fixed-bed experiments at representative utility flue-gas temperatures, the new sorbents demonstrated elemental-mercury capacities ten (10) times higher than typical PACs. With the new technology, it may be possible to achieve net mercury-removal costs that are one-tenth that of current technologies. The second discovery was that the sorbents can be made from commercially available substrate many times smaller than PACs. This would relieve the bulk-gas mass-transfer limitations that many believe inherently constrain PACs from achieving high performance under economical conditions.",

        "abstract": "This project proposes the development of industrial agri-based oil monomers for the preparation of low odor, low VOC architectural latex coatings. The process for preparing acrylate and/or methacrylate monomers derived from castor oil and other industrial oils, such as soybean and linseed oils, involves an acrylate derivatization step. Monomers based on castor oil have been incorporated into latex polymers by emulsion polymerization to form latex polymers suitable for use in self-coalescing and self- crosslinking architectural latex paints. One interior, low VOC latex paint containing biobased monomers has been submitted to the Pentagon for qualification testing.Successful completion of the Phase II project would provide a source of non-toxic, bio-renewable monomers from a variety of oils, soybeans, linseed, dehydrated castor, etc., for markets previously dominated by unsaturated polyesters and alkyds that are now dominated by petroleum based latex products. Even more desirable, the industrial oil monomers have the potential of providing environmentally friendly paints for consumers and homeowners by utilizing the inherent ambient crosslinking attributes of naturally occurring unsaturated oils",

Conventional smoke and gas detectors have a tendency for high false alarm rates, and worse, some gas detectors have a tendency not to alarm at dangerously high gas concentrations. Thus, Southwest Sciences proposes a novel, low-weight, and low-cost fire detection technology based on optical spectroscopy using Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). Rapid, quantitative detection of part per million concentrations of multiple gases including carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen cyanide, and acetylene, and others are possible. In the proposed device, gas concentrations are measured separately, which greatly reduces the chances of a false alarm. The proposed instrument is self-calibrating and self-checking to reduce long term maintenance costs. The technology uses miniature LEDs and detectors that are rugged, low-weight, low-cost, and require little power.

Many laboratory-based combustion diagnostics are not suited to use on microgravity platforms due to unique space and power constraints. We propose developing a new UV diode laser-based microgravity combustion diagnostic for quantitative detection of key combustion species. The instrument will allow absolute concentration measurement of key combustion species including trace radicals using a wide variety of microgravity combustion platforms including the Space Station. Our approach uses room temperature UV diode laser output directly, thereby keeping the instrument compact, rugged and energy efficient.

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): This project proposes the development of a    \n new technique for improving the performance of medical ultrasound systems using    \n microbubble-based contrast agents. The ultimate goal is the creation of an         \n \"excitation enhanced\" imaging system that will have a higher sensitivity than      \n current ultrasound scanners. Vascular contrast agents are capable of enhancing     \n the visibility of blood flow by several orders of magnitude. However their         \n performance is still not sufficient to reliably image perfusion and diagnose       \n conditions such as myocardial ischemia or infarction. The excitation enhanced      \n ultrasound modality utilizes two acoustic fields: onefor contrast agent            \n excitation and one for imaging. The excitation field temporarily increases the     \n number of contrast agent bubbles with a size close to resonance at the             \n frequency of the imaging field. If the imaging field is applied immediately        \n after the excitation burst, acoustic scattering from the excited bubbles is        \n markedly stronger than without the application of the excitation field. An in      \n vitro system was constructed as part of the Phase I effort and experiments         \n conducted using this system have demonstrated enhancements of up to 12dB. The      \n next step is to modify an ultrasound scanner to include the modality and to        \n validate the clinical potential of the technique with a series of in vivo          \n experiments.                                                                       \n  \n\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nUltrasonic Imaging is now the second most widely used imaging modality after x-ray. It's usage has increased in recent years due to the development of ultrasonic specific contrast agents. The proposed research will accelerate the usefulness of contrast aganets for many significant clinical applications.",

The SQUIDs in the output array are damped to avoid resonances or distortions in the transfer characteristics, which improves the stability of the amplifier and simplifies operation, and enhances the large-signal bandwidth.

This requirement is warranted, as a very stiff, dimensionally stablestructure simplifies system control complexity and improves system reliability.  To create a rigid structure, the components must be fixed in the deployed configuration with ultra-stiff latches (stiffness>1X106 lbf/inch).  The proposed innovation willvalidate self-rigidizing, ultra-high stiffness capture latch (HSL) technology for deployable structures. Ultra-high stiffness is obtained through solidification of low melting point metal alloy within the latch joint. This unique, innovative approach isfundamentally different from other latching concepts. It has the potential to provide extremely high stiffness from a compact, lightweight package, enabling the development of highly stiff deployable structures.The proposed innovation can also be applied to deployable or separable space structures requiring zero dead band and high strength.  Generally, in large structures with articulated joints, current joining methods (elements pre-loaded together by springs,motor torque or cam lock devices) require high pre-load, resulting in mass-prohibitive and high release shock systems.  Such system-level issues are easily resolved using the proposed innovation.

This intelligent identification software module (IISM) will perform as well as or better than human watch standers. We will knowledge engineer currentCDC identification experts, since it is not anticipated that identification will occur much differently than in current carriers. Based on that elicited knowledge, we will design the CDC Knowledge Representation and Execution System (CKRES). This will beused to develop the IISM in three versions. The IISM will be interfaced to the Advanced Battle Station (ABS) and other systems for demonstration of capabilities and testing. The IISM will be thoroughly validated, verified, and tested in a wide range ofsituations.To develop IISM, we will first develop CKRES which facilitates the development of any automated watchstation software module. AI and Expert System technology offer the capability of capturing human decision processes. By developing a general schema forcapturing the knowledge required for each TFCC/CDC position, the development of these TFCC/CDC automation software modules is greatly facilitated. What is needed is an integrated approach using a broad range of technologies.

Ontologies are commitments to formal declarative multi-purpose  representations with clear semantics that can serve as a solid foundation  for such models. While there has been much work on representation  languages, and on tools for creating, browsing, editing, and translating  expressions in such languages, there has been relatively little attention  to supporting the larger process of figuring out what ought to be encoded  in an ontology. Some existing tools support collaborative teams, but by  and large they seem to assume that all team members will be AI experts and  that the work will focus on generation and manipulation of formal  expressions. In this project, we propose to develop a complete prototype  of a Domain Expert Collaborative Ontology Development environment (DECODE)  that ensures those who best understand the domain, but least understand  the technology of ontology, can make necessary contributions to the  development process.

        "abstract": "Description: (Applicant's abstract) The present application is to fully develop    \n a new strategy (called \"tethering\") to discover low molecular weight ligands       \n (about 250 Da) that bind weakly to targeted sites on proteins through an           \n intermediary disulfide tether. A native or engineered cysteine in a protein is     \n allowed to react reversibly with a library of disulfide-containing molecules at    \n concentrations typically used in drug screening. The cysteine-captured ligands,    \n which are readily identified by mass spectroscopy, are among the most stable       \n complexes even though in the absence of the covalent tether the ligands may        \n bind very weakly. This method was applied to generate a potent and novel           \n inhibitor for thymidylate synthase, an essential enzyme in pyrimidine              \n metabolism with therapeutic applications in cancer and infectious diseases. The    \n affinity of the untethered ligand (Ki about 1 mM) was improved 3000-fold by        \n synthesis of a small set of analogs with the aid of crystallographic structures    \n of the tethered complex.

This development enables us to produce free radicals such as OH, and O that attack hazardous or TIMparticles and kill micro-organisms very efficiently.  Bacterium Bacillus cereus will be used as an indicator of the plasma efficacy in destroying airborne pathogens.  Efficacy of killing E-coli bacteria will be used for the sterilization simulation testsof surfaces in food processing or medical facilities.  The proposed method is both highly electrically efficient and highly effective at destroying airborne TIMs and anthropogenic particles suspended in air or on surface.  Since it is also cost effectiveand practically maintenance free, it is clearly superior to other non-thermal plasma methods.

This project will develop cost reduction techniques for the production of PIT Nb3Sn superconductors.  This includes reducing the cost of the NbSn2 powder by new manufacturing techniques, producing Nb tubes by hot extrusion resulting in uniform composite tubes, and using hydrostatic extrusion for multifilamentary billets.  In Phase I, a single step reaction heat treatment was developed to produce uniform, homogenous NbSn2 powder (",

In this project, an innovative route will be used to fabricate flexible Nb3Sn cables that in turn could be used to fabricate Nb3Sn magnets by the more reliable and economical react-then-wind approach.  In Phase I, a gas mixing setup, using an oxygen analysis unit in conjunction with a programmable furnace, was designed and commissioned.  The system uses a computer data acquisition unit to continuously monitor the oxygen level during the heat treatment of Nb3Sn cables. The feasibility of producing flexible Nb3Sn cables by controlling oxide layer thickness was demonstrated, and between-wire bonding within sample cables was studied.  Phase II will continue to exploit the advantages of oxide-control in fabricating flexible Nb3Sn cables, scale-up for intermediate scale productions, adapt the approach to use high performance internal tin Nb3Sn wires, conduct transconductance and stability measurements, and fabricate and characterize high current flexible Nb3Sn cables.

A projected efficiency of 38% would be obtained from this tandem cell. The key innovation of this device is the deposition of the InGaAsN material. This will be done using an atomic nitrogen source and an unique surfactant to enhance the growth process. We will team up for this program with Prof. W. I.

This III-V compound offers advantages over current HgCdTe technology in both anticipated performance level and ancillary support system(e.g. cryogenic cooling) costs.  Due to its piezoelectric characteristic, (111)-oriented superlattice lowers the effective bandgap energy when compared to the same structure on (100), thereby more easily extending the operating wavelength into the VLWIRregime.  However, growth on (111) substrates is known to be very challenging.  During Phase I, we have demonstrated the growth of (111) superlattices, and identified problems associated with growth difficulties.  We believe the material problems could besolved by employing the Engineered Substrate concept proposed for Phase II investigation.  The compliant nature of such substrates will be able to accommodate the strain in the superlattice structure, and promote smooth 2-D epitaxy and sharp interfaces.Therefore we will be able to address the fundamental material issues and the work should lead to high performance VLWIR materials and devices.",

The files were generally developed on VAX or Sun computer based tools and have become obsolete and unusablewithout conversion tools to update them to newer versions of LASAR or preferably the IEEE 1445 standard for digital test interchange format (DTIF).

When corrosion is preenet under the coating the dielectric signature changesbecuase corrosion products are dielectrics.  It is this change caused by the presence of cororsion that is exploited in development of microwave corrosion detectors (MCDs).  In Phase I a successful MCD pre-prototype was built that detected corrosion underaircraft paints and appliques in a repeatable and reliable fashion.  The Phase II proposal seeks to optimize for aircraft corrosion detection under coatings in three ways - (1) by improving the microwave assembly through componenet selection and designmodification, (2) by developing electronic threshold circuits and displays, and (3) by developing a scanning truck and housing system that make the sensor easy to use on aircraft surfaces.  After an alpha prototype that integrates and tests theoptimization efforts, 20 beta level prototypes will be manufactured.  These will be distributed to NAVAIR and Delta Airlines for evaluation.  Also at this time the beta level MCDs will undergo Navy NDE qualification testing.  After theevalaution/qualification period, Phase II Option proposes to refine the design once more before producing 50 units for Fleet demos and use.

The reducedmuzzle motion  provided substantial improvements in the accuracy of the 30-mm gun and reduced recoil load transmission to the airframe during high rates of fire.In Phase II, existing MR fluid damper analysis and design methodology will be refined to incorporate micro-mechanical fluid effects to develop full-scale, retrofit MR dampers.  Active control strategies investigated in Phase I will be refined and evaluatedin Phase II using an experimentally-validated multi-body gun dynamics analysis.  During the 2-year Phase II effort, full-scale MR dampers will be built and systematically live fire tested on a M230 chain gun at a research grade ballistic range incollaboration with the Apache chain gun systems integrator, the Boeing Company.

Each of these paths can be characterized by a loss of phase margin. It is not possible to predict or compensate for all possible sources of additional phase lag in the design process, and so there is a need for on-line health monitoring of the flight control system. The challenge then is to detect the erosion of phase margin in a timely manner and either warn the pilot or automatically take corrective action. In the Phase I effort we intend to use an innovative Time Varying Transfer Function technique to track the phase margin of a time-varying system. These special transfer functions are based on Wavelet Transforms. In contrast to windowed Fourier transforms, these transforms have the ability to analyze a signal at multiple scales, thus allowing for quick response to high frequency changes in the system, without sacrificing low frequency resolution. In Phase I we will develop the methodology and an associated on-line health monitoring toolbox to implement our approach. Example scenarios and available flight test data will be used to demonstrate feasibility.",

Conversion of analog signals to digital signals with sufficientlyhigh resolution and sampling rates is often a limiting factor in the performance of these systems.  Recent technological advances have accelerated the demand for high resolution/high bandwidth ADCs with low power consumption.Given the limitations of current technologies, these harsh requirements are difficult to meet using normal approaches.  Oversampling ADCs based on Delta-Sigma modulators have become prominent in meeting these more stringent demands, because this approachpermits high resolution without the need for analog components with extremely tight tolerances.  However, improved accuracy with relaxed component requirements comes with the price of oversampling and the associated limited conversion rate.During the course of the Phase I program, Systran Federal Corporation (SFC) investigated several approaches to the ADC problem and has introduced an innovative architecture called Parallel Time Interleaved Multi-bit Feedback (PTIMF).

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): Existing high school drug abuse prevention    \n programs primarily target youths who already have defined drug use problems.       \n Effective research-based prevention programs that target a universal audience      \n are not yet widely available. This Phase II project will continue the              \n development of All Stars, Sr., a program to improve mediating processes            \n important to late onset prevention and self-initiated cessation. Mediators         \n targeted include: lifestyle incongruence, normative beliefs about the              \n prevalence and acceptability of drugs, commitment to avoid high-risk behaviors,    \n resistance skills, beliefs about social and psychological consequences, goal       \n setting, decision making, and stress management skills. The program is designed    \n to augment (rather than replace) existing high school health textbooks.            \n Materials consist of a teacherts guide containing detailed lessons and a           \n student wellness journal. Results from Phase I support the approach taken and      \n provide a guide for program modification and improvement. During Phase II,         \n additional written activities and new online teacher and student materials will    \n be developed. A randomized field trial will be conducted. Health teachers in       \n twenty schools will be assigned to either treatment or control conditions.         \n Students will be measured at four points in time over a two-year period to         \n assess changes in mediators and the prevalence and frequency of substance use.     \n PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:\nDrug use continues to be a serious problem in the country. The US Department of Education is expected to increase funding for effective prevention programs during the coming years. We are increasingly being asked to provide follow-up sessions for the middle school All Stars programs. There is a relative lack of universal prevention programming available for high schools. The increasing need and lack of viable alternatives suggests this project will result in a product that will have excellent market potential.",

        "abstract": "A revolutionary approach is proposed to obtain in real time, aerodynamic loads and moments in terms of the instantaneous locations of principal aerodynamic flow phenomena such as the stagnation, flow separation, reattachment, boundary-layer transition, etc. The stability, control, safety, ride quality, and performance of flight vehicles depends upon the instantaneous values of aerodynamic loads and moments, as well as on their derivatives. In recent years successful attempts have been made to introduce flow separation or vortex breakdown point as an inner variable in the state-space representation to mathematically model unsteady aerodynamic loads and moments. Tao Systems has developed techniques to obtain these aerodynamic flow phenomena in real time using hot-film sensors, constant voltage anemometer system, and associated flow diagnostics software. However, there are no techniques currently available to directly obtain aerodynamic loads and moments in terms of these inner variables. The proposed innovation will provide direct input in terms of aerodynamic flow features for the determination of loads and moments, as well as the dynamic stability and control derivatives for flight vehicles under real time flight conditions.",

        "abstract": "This proposal identifies a flight test program on the F-15B at NASA Dryden to obtain off-design performance of high-speed inlets that incorporate a unique variable geometry system. The proposed effort accomplishes two objectives; validation of engine face distortion prediction by complex CFD codes and validation of a unique new approach to variable geometry for high-speed inlets. For supersonic cruise, this variable geometry concept allows the consideration of very high performance axisymmetric inlet designs that normally have required complex, heavy variable geometry concepts to effect the necessary throat area variation. The proposed concept also provides increased design options for hypersonic inlets. Aerodynamic design, model fabrication and flight testing of two inlets, one with the unique variable geometry and a baseline configuration, will be completed. This proposal responds to the SBIR subtopic by proposing a study in which prediction of inlet distortion by using complex CFD codes can be validated by comparison with data from a flight program. It is expected that this effort will also verify acceptable lower speed performance for an inlet designed to utilize the concept of this proposal. This advance in inlet technology will enable development of efficient and safe propulsion systems for supersonic or hypersonic vehicles.",

This is because componentsfabricated from plate steel are inherently more precise and lowerweight than those produced form traditional rolled steel. A majorrequirement is the need for automatic categorization, nesting,and handling of steel plate used in fabricating structural shapes(i.e. I-beams, T-beams).  The key issue underlying thiscapability is that the flow of raw materials through the cuttingand welding process requires management of many components tocreate an optimized delivery of end product (fabricated parts)with minimal material waste of labor expense.  Development of anOptimized Structural Component Assembly Manager (OSCAM) isproposed.  This proposed approach will create a module systemcompatible with emerging CAD standards, commercial cutting andwelding systems and suitable for adaptation to variousmanufacturing requirements, with emphasis on shipbuilding.

An oboard programmable fuse typically controls the round detonation. The current systems under consideration by the U.S. Army possess significant drawbacks in that theyeither require costly fuse designs or additional heavy structure to be attached to the barrel muzzle, which is detrimental to pointing accuracy. In this proposal we present a novel fiber optic based system to measure round exit velocity (REV) that can beintegrated to an inductive fuse setting system for real time programming of a standard air burst munition fuse. The proposed barrel mounted system is small, lightweight, and low cost. The main objectives of this effort are to optimize the phase I system,fabricate a prototype, and conduct live-fire testing on an M242 to demonstrate performance.

This project will develop a set of tools to allow 4GLs to interoperate with CORBA.   Software will be developed that would take as its input the Interface Definition Language (CORBA-IDL) files and result in the wrapper functions that are needed to import CORBA objects in 4GLs as well as use the CORBA objects within the 4GLs.  The software would also allow 4GLs to be used as CORBA servers.  In Phase I, existing tools (SWIG, e.g.) for wrapping C and C++ code for use in scripting languages were analyzed.  To prove feasibility, examples of bringing CORBA into PV-WAVE and RSI-IDL were developed.   Prototypes of automatic tools for wrapping C++ stubs generated by the CORBA translator for use in these languages were implemented.   Phase II will develop a parser/code-generator application, idl4gl, which will allow CORBA applications to be built for RSI-IDL and PV-WAVE.  The application, idl4gl, will (1) parse CORBA-IDL files, (2) generate C wrapping code for CORBA stubs, (3) generate 4GL to call out C wrapped CORBA stubs, (4) create a C++ CORBA servant implementation, and (5) create empty 4GL functions to be filled in by the 4GL programmer.

MAD-9, the latest version, has powerful new features needed for the design of the Large Hadron Collider and the proposed muon collider/neutrino factory, but the differential algebra engine needs work.  This project will develop a comprehensive GUI for MAD-9, using the cross-platform windowing toolkit Qt.  Significant effort will also be devoted to improving the differential algebra engine of MAD-9, and to ensuring that the code compiles and runs on all relevant desktop and workstation computers.  In Phase I, a prototype GUI was developed and integrated with MAD-9, enabling the interactive selection of input files, the generation of Twiss and beamline layout plots, and the modification of element and beamline parameters.  The GUI/physics linkage is clean and efficient, requiring no GUI references within the physics code.  In Phase II, the prototype GUI for MAD-9 will be completed, with emphasis on support for design and optimization features.  Relevant portions of this GUI will be integrated with a general purpose optimization library.  In collaboration with Brookhaven National Laboratory, the differential algebra engine of MAD-9 will be significantly improved and then used to support design studies of the high-energy muon storage ring for the proposed neutrino factory.

Seismic-while-drilling techniques can detect pore pressure ramps and range to pressurized formation tops, but, in most cases, the drill bit source is inadequate.  There is a need for a source of broadband, high-frequency seismic energy at the bit to allow accurate seismic-while-drilling with all bit types.  This project will develop a mud-powered hydraulic tool that generates intense narrow-band, high frequency seismic signals from tricone and PDC drill bits.  The tool cycle rate can be swept to generate broadband seismic energy for vertical seismic profiling and reflection imaging while drilling.  The objective is a real-time display of the formation 1000 ft ahead of the bit with a resolution of 50 ft.  This display would indicate the range to reflection horizons, formation velocity gradients and predicted pore pressure.  In Phase I, geophones placed on the surface were used to monitor the seismic signal transmitted to the surface from the suction pulse tool while drilling in a 2700 ft deep well.  These experiments showed that the tool generates high levels of seismic energy at frequencies of up to 200 Hz while drilling with tricone and PDC bits.  In Phase II, the hydraulic tool will be modified to continuously vary the pulse cycle rate through a full octave for broadband signal generation.  Performance will be demonstrated during normal drilling operations, and the data recording, processing, and display techniques will be evaluated.

        "abstract": "Conventional flange-type pipe couplings used aboard U.S. Navy surface ships and submarines typically have a large number of axially oriented bolts located around the circumference of the flange.  The installation of conventional pipe couplings requiresequal access to all of the bolts to ensure evenly torqued joints.  The large number of bolts and accessibility difficulties with conventional pipe couplings results in a labor-intensive process for the removal and installation of these couplings.  Nearbystructures and equipment often have to be removed and reinstalled to gain access to the hidden bolts, or joints are inadequately tightened in cases where removal of nearby strucutres is not feasible.  Texas Research Institute Austin, Inc. proposes todevelop a low cost, lightweight, fire-resistant, easily accessible composite pipe coupling that meets the requirements of MIL-STD-777E.  The use of composite materials will reduce the cost and weight of the coupling while providing a reliable,fire-resistant, corrosion-free service life in excess of 15 years.",

These barriers are (1) unreliable composite flange joints, and (2) heavy, expensive metal alloy bellows.The objectives are to cut both launch weight and cost by half.  Dynamic Polymer Composite (DPC) connectors clamp fixed pipe joints with a large prestress when heated.  They eliminate flanged joints adn join dissimilar materials with a smooth stress flowthat is stronger than the pipe itself. DPC expansion joints replace alloy bellows.  In Phase I both were validated by actual cryogenic pressure tests using prototypes not optimize for low temperature.  Prestress was found to eliminate cryo delamination.Fixed joints were tested to 4,500 psi.  Expansion joints demonstrated an axial travel of three inches (75mm).  Using existing space quailified materials, Phase II will develop and cryo test a series of DPC connections designed and scaled for one of theseven current rocket engines in a cyclical, cryogenic enviroment.  Test and modeling data will be integrated for transfer of the technology to contractors in preparation for PhaseIII flight-testing.

The concept has several innovative features to enhance the thermal control of the antenna structure including: high thermalconductivity Gr/epoxy face sheets (for improved thermal spreading); high latent heat capacity phase change material (contained integrally within the antenna structure); and an ultra-low density/high thermal conductivity carbon foam core (for enhancedthermal transport between the PCM and antenna structure).

        "abstract": "Modern vulnerability and survivability codes simulate the path of threat projectiles through a target using a technique known as \u00c2\u00bfray tracing.\u00c2\u00bf Rays representing the threat are \u00c2\u00bftraced\u00c2\u00bf by finding intersections between the ray and the target geometry. Theroutines that find these intersections and the representation used to model the target geometry are central to any ray-tracing code. Standard vulnerability tools, such as the Modular Unix- Based Vulnerability Estimation Suite (MUVES), depend on a singleray tracer that requires that the geometry be in BRL-CAD constructive solid geometry (CSG) format. In general, designers and analysts employ commercial Computer Aided Design (CAD) packages such as Pro/ENGINEER that typically use a boundary representation(BREP) to represent solid geometry. For this reason a serious disconnect exists between vehicle design software and vulnerability assessment tools. The solution is the development of a new ray-tracing tool for vulnerability codes that could directlyinterrogate 3D-geometry models described by STEP (Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data) files, an international standard for transferring CAD designs. The proposed modular ray-tracing tool will employ a standard and open interface, allowing itsuse with a variety of commercial CAD systems and vulnerability, signature, and reparability codes. Since most vehicle designers use Pro/ENGINEER or a commercial CAD package which supports STEP export, there will be an immediate application for this toolwithin the defense industry for anyone doing vulnerability assessment. MUVES, COVART, SAFE, MAVEN, and AJEM will all immediately benefit from a ray-tracer built around an industry-standard file format such as STEP. This ray-tracing tool can further enhancethe accuracy of IR signature predictions. While faceted geometry definitions do not adversely affect the calculation of temperatures and diffuse radiosity, signature management techniques often include the use of coatings for which the assumption ofdiffuse surfaces is invalid. When this is the case, the calculation must utilize the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) of the coating, and a technique such as Phong shading must be used to attempt to approximate the true surfacecurvature. The ray-tracing tool could improve on this process in two ways. First, it could map physical temperatures from a faceted model onto a solids model for the final BRDF ray-tracing. Second, if the components in the CAD model were selected so thatthey could be assumed isothermal, a direct-from-CAD-to-BRDF tool could predict temperatures and BRDF radiosity from a single CAD source. Additionally, the creation of a cross platform, object-oriented, multiple CAD ray-tracing module will have broadcommercial applicability. Examples include calculating the solar loading in automotive passenger compartment for simulating climate control and calculating the heat transferred between isothermal components in aerospace applications.",

The primary focus of this SBDD     \n effort will be based on engineered, soluble, N-terminal extracellular domain       \n analogs of GPCRs. Many GPCRs use a large N-terminal domain as an essential         \n ligand-binding component. Use of these analogs in drug discovery will eliminate    \n the need for detergents and lipids that often complicate HTS and SBDD efforts      \n for GPCRs.In Phase I we constructed a novel, soluble, N-terminal domain analog     \n of the glucagon receptor (N-GGR). Characterization of N-GGR revealed that          \n about80 percent of the binding free energy for glucagon resides within this        \n domain. Importantly, N-GGR discriminates against the related peptide, GLP- 1,      \n and competes with full-length GGR in functional assays. During the Phase II we     \n will determine the X-ray crystal structure of N-GGR and use it as an HTS target    \n for drug discovery. We will also validate N-GGR as a protein therapeutic.

In our system, this range data is used by the micro air vehicles for self organization and self healing of the communications network.TM-UWB radios do not transmit continuous radio waves like conventional radio.  Only pulses are transmitted, and power is used only during the short duration of those pulses. Pulses in the time domain result in very wideband signals in the frequency domain,which make them almost impossible to intercept and difficult to jam. The lower frequency component of the signal allows the signals to penetrate foliage, walls, and other obstacles, and TM-UWB is almost totally unaffected by multipath interference.  TheTM-UWB output stage is a single transistor which is ON or OFF, there is no intermediate frequency, and no up-conversion and no down-conversion.

Tissue-Grown scientists are working on a new variety development technology, based on the creation of interspecific chimeras, that may have immediate application for creation of elite disease resistant Cucurbit, Brassica and Solanum crops. With this Phase II proposal, Tissue-Grown outlines a project which combines large scale micropropagation with novel variety technologies to demonstrate that vegetatively propagated watermelon and tomato transplants with genetic-based resistance to Fusarium can be delivered on a commercial scale to the U.S. market. A key element for meeting the economic feasibility criteria for U.S. markets will be the delivery of high value germplasm that can compete with traditional seed based transplants. Tissue-Grown proposes that the combination of mass propagation with disease resistant transplants can provide a significant economic opportunity for vegetable production in the U.S.",

        "abstract": "The next generation of reusable launch vehicle and satellite structures require new materials to meet aggressive program objectives such as decreasing vehicle weight in order to increase payload, and reducing cost per launch in order to decrease cost per pound of payload. Materials which have improved specific strength and specific stiffness, especially at cryogenic and elevated temperatures, will enable NASA to meet these aggressive program goals by supporting the development of stronger, lighter and more thermally stable launch vehicle and spacecraft components. Touchstone's Brazed AMC material demonstrates all of these desired properties. This material has close to double the specific strength and specific stiffness of structural aluminum alloys. It also maintains these properties at higher temperatures than current aerospace alloys. As such, Touchstone's material can serve as an enabling technology for many launch vehicle and spacecraft applications, including engine and thrust structures, lines and ducts, cryogenic tanks, and satellite structures. This proposal discusses a new material system which can be an enabling technology in the development of these new launch vehicle and spacecraft components. The new material system consists of a continuously-reinforced aluminum matrix composite (AMC) material manufactured using techniques commonly used to produce polymer matrix composites (PMCs).",

Several engineering materials offer very attractive specific mechanical properties (the ratio of properties to the density of the material). But a material being developed by Touchstone Research Laboratory, Ltd. of Triadelphia, WV, is unique in its combination of these properties with fire resistance, impact resistance/energy absorption, and the potential for large-scale, low-cost manufacture with relatively simple processing equipment.

For example, a common requirement of fuel cells and high-performance batteries is efficient, consistent performance from the electrode over its life.  This project will demonstrate the viability of transforming inexpensive coal derivatives into a tailorable porous electrode.  Such a component would reduce cost and weight and increase the performance and service life of fuel cells and batteries.

In Phase II, practical fuel cell and battery systems will be selected and coal-based foams will be designed to meet their requirements.  The design includes tailoring the foam cell size, connectivity, surface area, and surface chemistry.  Fuel cell and battery manufacturers will be recruited to produce and test prototypes fabricated from coal-based porous electrodes, analyze performance benefits, and guide further refinement of  the electrode specifications.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build on results of Phase I research to fully demonstrate an early warning system for potential failure of ceramic matrix composite (CMC) materials. In Phase I, a novel detection technique called Composite Failure Onset Response Test (ComFORT (TM)) was demonstrated for use with high temperature CMCs. ComFORT (TM) is a composite failure detection technique whereby proprietary thermally stable electrically conductive ceramic fibers are selectively placed, together with regular reinforcing fibers, and are then processed into a dense ceramic composite. Once in place, existing hardware is used to monitor the condition and the health of the electrical signal, while an especially designed algorithm minimizes false negatives during use. As the ceramic composite begins to fail, the failure of the fiber reinforcement is preceded by the failure of the conductive coating, which is recognized through a weakening or loss of electrical conductivity. This novel technique lends itself to a powerful early warning system, whereby the conductive fiber can be designed to fail before catastrophic failure of the composite itself. Proper placement of these conductive fibers enables tracking of even minute levels of breach within the composite. Moreover, through a novel design, it may be possible to extend the performance to detect matrix cracking. The lack of reliability and little to no warning before catastrophic failure has prevented a more widespread use of CMC's. The smart fiber system to be developed in this project will allow the use of CMC's in more demanding applications with greater certainty of success. The successful commercialization of the proposed technology will lead to the insertion of continuous fiber reinforced composites into power generation, energy, air, space and missile applications, where high temperature, lightweight, and mechanically reliable materials are needed, and the cost of part failures is high. Ceramic composites can be used in a larger number of these applications, if part reliability can be assured. Substantial benefits in operating efficiency of gas turbine, automotive and rocket systems can be realized with increased operating temperatures",

With our end-user team members, we will utilize the Triton CMC technologiesfor three component development thrusts, adaptive mirrors for high energy laser (HEL) systems, rocket propulsion compents for kill vehicles, and large, complex CMC structures with sophisticated fiber architectures for the next generation of high speedmissiles and space vehicles.  As a result of the Phase II program, we will have achieved the necessary innovations to produce cost-effective CMC products for use in a wide variety of military and commercial applications.  The additional developments anduse-environment specific material improvements will be the critical steps needed to insert Tritons' CMC technology into the US and world marketplace.  The components we initially develop will enable revolutionary advances in future generations of adaptivemirror, rocket propulsion, and missile or space vehicle TPS components in terms of reduced acquisition and lifetime maintenance costs, decreased system weights, and increased performance, impacting a number of BMD and other defense systems.  As we maturethe technology base, our development efforts will expand to focus on products which will penetrate the more lucrative commercial ceramic markets.  We will leverage our successes in optimizing compositions, processes, and product/materials designmethodologies, to insert both commodity and unique products into the $8 Billion per annum market for advanced ceramic components",

The second innovation is based on Triton's patented SmartBondT induction bonding technique to weld the seams of the collapsible tanks.The third contribution is the use of Triton's patented nano-barrier material in a film that protects the seam against ultraviolet radiation, hydrolytic degradation, and chemical attacks.The proposed effort will leverage these three enabling technologies to develop failure-free dual-use collapsible tanks.  We have teamed with Seaman Corporation, a leading manufacturer of coated fabric materials for tanks; Lepel Corporation, a manufacturerof induction sealing equipment, and GTA Containers who manufactures both water and fuel collapsible tanks.During Phase II, we will design a dual-use tank with a built-in leak alarm.

Each has its own operational advantages and disadvantages. LHPs have tremendous pumping pressures due to the use of metal wicks. They can start up at any time under almost any condition. CPLs, on the other hand, require a lengthy pre-conditioning period before they commence the loop operation. However, CPLs provide tight temperature control for the heat source which is a desirable characteristic of a spacecraft thermal control system (TCS). In addition, the ability of the CPLs to acquire heat from multiple heat sources and share the heat among them allows the design of the spacecraft TCS to be simpler and lightweight. An advanced concept of LHP (A-LHP) combines a LHP and CPL into one loop. The LHP/CPL hybrid loop inherits all operational attributes of the LHP and yet does not show any disadvantages associated with either a LHP or CPL.

        "abstract": "The ever-growing concern over air quality has led to considerable legislation to control atmospheric concentrations of ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  However, much work remains before an acceptable measure ofindoor air quality is adopted.  This is due in part to the lack of universal standards for indoor air quality.  Over the past three decades, the low temperature catalytic oxidation of VOCs has been improved considerably as part of efforts by thetransportation and energy production industries to control emissions produced by combustion of fossil fuels.  However, no existing catalyst technology is known to exhibit a sufficiently high catalytic activity in the critical 0-200 degrees C temperaturerange to accomplish the emission reduction goals of these or other industries.  In Phase I, Ultramet demonstrated the feasibility of a catalytic filtration element comprising low-cost reticulated vitreous carbon or silicon carbide open-cell foam catalystsupports coated with a metal catalyst/mixed metal oxide solid electrolyte, and operating based on the principle of non-Faradaic electrochemical modification of catalytic activity (NEMCA).  In laboratory-scale testing, these filter elements exhibited highcatalytic activity near room temperature and under high face velocity conditions.  In bench-scale testing, these filter elements exhibited long life and compatibility with current heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems.  In Phase II, Ultrametwill scale up and optimize the fabrication of catalytic filtration system, optimize the catalytic efficiency of the system with respect to the selected contaminant(s), and validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the system in pilot-scale applications.This technology offers a significant advance in the state-of-the-art of catalytic control of air- and water-borne contaminants.",

        "abstract": "Both failure analysis and reconditioning of nickel superalloy gas turbine and rocket engine components are plagued by a major problem: the thin oxide films that form on unprotected fracture surfaces during field operation obscure the surfaces intended foranalysis and interfere with repair procedures.  Such oxide films mask the fracture surfaces and make them very difficult, if not impossible, to analyze and/or repair.  Inhibited chemical etchants have been developed to remove oxide films from steels topreserve the base metal during pickling in the manufacturing processes.  No similar process is required during nickel superalloy production, and no such inhibitor has been developed to date.

In Phase II, Ultramet will work with Williams International, a well-known small turbine manufacturer, to optimize and scale up the oxide removal technology and define specific brazingapproaches for nickel-based superalloys, specifically including MAR-M-247 and Waspaloy superalloys.

Acoustic Coaxing Induced Microcavitation (ACIM) is a novel, chemical-free, and energy-efficient process which uses only \"Silent Sound and Clean Water.\" Underlying ACIM's energy efficiency is microcavitation's ability to concentrate an enormous amount of energy on an extremely small (i.e. sub-microscopic) point. These controlled concentrations of energy result in nearly spontaneous cleaning which does not hurt the substrate. ACIM is the ideal technology for deploying energy exactly at the point of use.\nUNCOPIER technology will revolutionize the paper recycling industry in a number of ways, as well as innovation in the recycling process itself. Since the UNCOPIER leaves the deInked paper immaculately white and undamaged, it will save environmental resources by making it possible to manufacture new print grade paper from the recycled laser-xerographic prints. The UNCOPIER is being developed as an office machine to advocate a pioneer method for recycling paper-at-source deinking, \"one sheet at a time.\" DeInking paper prior to recycling protects confidentiality. This novel approach will appeal to banks, hospitals, law firms, government agencies, and other institutions interested in recycling, but also concerned with safeguarding confidentiality.

The benefits of hybrid technology are extremely valuable to the military, where vehicle rangeand fuel logistics have become of the utmost importance.  Perhaps the main drawback to hybrid electric vehicles lies in their high levels of electromagnetic radiation.  UQM Technologies, Inc. has years of experience in the development of hybrid and pureelectric vehicles.  Our focus in on high efficiency, brushless, permanent magnet drive trains specifically designed for these vehicles.  In recent years UQM has begun a program to evaluate the EMI problems in our oun drive systems.  We have acquired thetest equipment needed for EMI diagnostics and identified the source(s) of EMI in some of our own drive train products.  Phase I endeavors gave us the opportunity to research and develop new technologies that serve to decrease EMI without sacrificingefficiency.  Some of those EMI reductions parameters included Space-Vector Modulation (effectively produces waveforms closer to Sinusoidal, without compromising efficiency), Concentric Motor Lead Cable (cancels fields around the outside of the cable),Enclosures with Positive Permeability, EMI gaskets and EMI Filters.  All of these parameters have been proved to reduce EMI in our system to varying degrees, resulting in a system that has much reduced radiated emissions from the baseline system.  Phase IIwill refine those parameters into a commercially viable, EMI reduced drive system, allowing the parent vehicle to pass all applicable standards relating to electromagnetic radiated emissions.",

This indicates that immune tolerance to        \n overexpressed C35 will probably not be an obstacle to vaccination for cancer       \n therapy. A C35-specific monoclonal antibody has been generated and used to         \n determine that C35 is a surface membrane protein that appears to transduce a       \n negative growth signal to the tumor following crosslinking by purified             \n monoclonal antibody. Pre-clinical evaluation of therapeutic applications of C35    \n vaccines and specific antibody are facilitated by the identification of a          \n murine homologue of C35 that is also overexpressed in some murine tumors. The      \n human C35 specific 2C3 monoclonal antibody is also crossreactive with murine       \n C35 and can, therefore, be tested for clinical benefit alone or in conjunction     \n with vaccination or chemotherapy in this animal model.\n PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:\nThis research is directed at developing diagnostics and vaccines specific for bladder \nand breast cancer.",

Only 1% of the nation's children meet all the Food Guide Pyramid nutritional recommendations. Fifty-one percent of the nation's children meet all the Food Guide Pyramid nutritional recommendations. Fifty-one percent of children and adolescents eat less than one serving of fruit a day, and 29% eat less than one serving a day of vegetables that are not fried. Diet is a known risk factor for the three leading causes of death -- heart disease, cancer, and stroke -- as well as for diabetes, high blood pressure, and osteoporosis. The objective of this study is to develop and field test a full-scale interactive, multimedia nutrition education resource that combines CD-ROM and Internet technologies to provide teachers lessons in four subjects -- science, math, language arts and social studies -- that can be integrated into existing fourth grade curriculum. The project will develop 50 lessons and related instructional resources and field test them with a sample of 480 students in 24 classrooms in ten different schools. The study employs a pre-test/post-test experimental research design to determine the extent to which the nutrition education CD-ROM increases students nutritional knowledge and improves the food choices of students toward a healthier diet.",

The smart cartridge concept contains a dense consolidated propellant charge and an electronicallycontrolled smart primer to govern the ignition of various portions of the propellant bed.  Phase I interior ballistic simulations have shown that performance improvements well over 20% are possible with this propulsion concept.This effort will experimentally evaluate the technical feasibility of the Phase I concept that was demonstrated using computer simulations.  The proposed Basic Phase II Work Plan contains experimental tasks to confirm SCC concept viability at the 40mmscale.  This caliber was selected because it is large enough to contain all of the features of a full scale charge and small enough to realize significant cost and time savings per test.  These cost savings can be translated into a more comprehensive testplan to thoroughly investigate and understand SCC design issues and lead to efficient Phase III full scale development.In addition to experimental development, the Basic Phase II effort will expand the simulation work begun during Phase I.  The NGEN code will be included with the IBHVG2 and XKTC codes to add a two-dimensional simulation capability for increased realism.Analyses will be performed to support the 40mm experimental work and the experimental results will be used to upgrade the predictive capability of the codes.

During our phase I effort we successfully applied polarimetric interferometry techniques to FOPEN SAR imagery to estimate the tree heights and bald earth topography over forestedareas. During phase II, these algorithms will be extended to allow for estimation of the canopy density as well as a more reliable estimate of the current parameters. This will be accomplished through the development of improved vegetation models, the useof multifrequency information present in the UWB UHF data, and the use of multiple repeat pass baselines.

Previous research has shown that GaAs diode technology can be used for terahertz Transmit/Receive (T/R) modules, but the cost is prohibitive, the reliability ispoor and the frequency agility is limited.

This Phase I research is expected to result in technology advances that will successfully demonstrate the feasibility of VLS's innovative machine-learning system for automated feature classification from diverse high-resolution multispectral, hyperspectral, and radar image data sets from leading satellite and airborne sensors. These results will establish a solid foundation for further research during Phase II that will lead to a fully operational automated feature classification system ready for subsequent commercial development.",

The software will enable the user to set individual parameter values using interactive controls that will update the plot of the associated data values 'on the fly'. This technology will allow scientists who perform parametric design analysis to quickly understand the impact that each parameter has on the overall performance of the design. It will replace the current tedious method for studying parametric changes which consists of trying to visually compare a series of several individual plots.The software will be designed to facilitate rapid continued development, cross-platform consistency and compatibility with larger, more comprehensive software systems such as a collaborative, web-based engineering environment. This flexible design approach will lead to the development a state-of-the-art visualization system which will maintain steady growth to serve increasing numbers of applications areas and to take full advantage of rapidly-changing computing environments.",

        "abstract": "The need exists to generate high fidelity electromagnetic planewave environments over large assets for the purpose of testing avionics systems on full-size aircraft in anechoic chambers.  In the Phase I effort, we conducted simulations of a PlanewaveGenerator (PWG) architecture that used a genetic algorithm to determine an excitation vector for a phased array that in turn creates an incident field that is planewave in nature only over local points in space.  The simulations showed that the PWG couldproduce planewave-like fields with exceptionally high fidelity over multiple wavelength-sized aperatures.  We further demonstrated that the PWG produces high fidelity fields in the presence of distance measurement error and electrical noise.   The PWGsystem was shown capable of simulating the arrival of planewaves over a cone exceeding +/-10 degrees, as well as being capable of projecting multiple planewave-like regions.  In addition to the simulations, we presented a comprehensive hardware design forthe PWG system.  In the proposed Phase II effort, we will develop the software and hardware components of the PWG and demonstrate its operation and capability.  The system software will provide an extensive graphical interface that will permit the user toeasily specify the test configuration, compute the phased array excitation vector, simulate the display the resulting radiating field, control the hardware components, and aid in the calibration and operation of the PWG.  The hardware will consist of onePWG substation array.  It will be capable of operating independently, or together with additional substation arrays, according to the problem specification and setup.  The goals are to realize a system that will create planewave simulation over 10 lambda x10 lambda regions with angle of arrival simulation capability of +/- 5 degrees (or greater).",

Complex source and propagation modeling efforts are needed to explain observational datasets of short-period surface wave generation from different types of mining and chemical explosions.  This project will develop a modeling package that considers complex source models for different types of explosions and propagates explosion generated surface waves through realistic three-dimensional (3D) structures.  In Phase I, a database was assembled that is unique in its content of local and regional recordings of various classifications of explosions.  Source information, and in some cases videographic data from mining and chemical explosions, was obtained to help ascertain the physical processes at work during the explosions.  Velocity models and attenuation values for the upper crust in the study regions were determined and will be used during the Phase II modeling study.  The evidence suggests that blast discriminants can be developed from a combination of empirical and modeling efforts.  Phase II will collect local and close-in data from fragmentation explosions for which a gap exists in the current database, develop a modeling package that ports different explosion source models with complicated 3D full waveform synthesis at regional distances, and compare model generated results with empirical data to develop mine blast discriminants.                  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The modeling package should be useful in the synthesis of surface waves from explosions by seismological organizations.  In particular, the discriminants developed would provide a tool for separating commercial mining explosions from nuclear explosions and natural seismicity.

Hostility and anger expression style have been demonstrated as risk factors for hypertension, itself a risk factor for CHD. Recent research suggests that anger management training reduces blood pressure, and leads to improvement in psychosocial risk factors, e.g., depression. The Williams LifeSkills workshop, based on the book \"Anger Kills\", and its successor, \"Lifeskills\", has shown in pilot studies to improve psychosocial risk factors, and is currently marketed in a limited manner to corporations and government agencies. The marketability of this product, however, would be far greater if supported by extended research demonstrating its effects on blood pressure reduction, as well as showing, in a corporate setting, decreased hostility and depressive symptoms, as well as strong cost-effectiveness, compared with standard care procedures recommended by JNC-VI guidelines. We propose a randomized controlled trial test of the Williams LifeSkills workshop in a hospital setting. We hypothesize that employees who undertake the LifeSkills workshop will show improved blood pressure, psychosocial risk factors, and decreased costs associated with treatment. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Psychosocial risk factors have been strongly related to many health problems, notably CVD. Research has shown that behavioral interventions have great promise to ameliorate the distress, the health- damaging effects and the costs associated with these risk factors; but few such programs have been implemented in a large-scale way. Corporations are increasingly interested in providing such services, but they have had difficulties in knowing which programs are most effective. Until these programs are developed as commercially viable products, dissemination of these programs will be hindered. In sum; these findings make a strong case that the development of a protocol- driven behavioral intervention package that can be delivered in a wide range of corporate settings presents a remarkable commercial opportunity.",

A methodology and service, ATTAIN(TM), has been conceived to accelerate the integration of technology by rapidly and aggressively identifying critical processes and practices in the organization and shifting them in value-added ways at the level of worker cognition and operational specifics. This method has been shown to be highly successful, but is labor intensive, expensive, and requires highly skilled practitioners. Furthermore, the method upon which ATTAIN is based is not sufficiently targeted. That is, more often than not, businesses have only 3-4 workplace processes or practices that need to be changed in order to increase the company's competitiveness. The original method does not single these out as more important than other elements of the workplace. To date, increasing the effective incorporation of new technology by changing workplace practice and worker cognition through specialized simulation training, but not at identifying the most appropriate target for the technology implementation or change has been very successful. The work of Phase II will involve integrating the current methods with those of another company. Their method has been shown to identify the \"vital few\" practices that mitigate a company's overall competitive survival and which are the most appropriate targets for change. Phase II has two goals. First, a hybrid method that is quicker and more targeted will be developed. Second, a practitioner training approach and supporting materials that make it possible for professionals without extensive experience to deliver the method in a high quality manner will be developed.\nTraining and licensing practitioners in a hybrid method of workplace learning will contribute significantly to the problem of efficient and successful technology integration and implementation of new technologies",

Xencor's Protein Design Automation (PDA) predicts all the possible amino acid sequences that will fold into the three-dimensional structure of a protein. There should be molecules among those sequences that have the structure and function of the \"parent \"protein, together with additional novel properties such as increased thermo-stability or alkaline pH optima. In Phase I the company addressed this possibility using xylanase as a model protein. After targeting the active site of the enzyme for PDA re-design, the company found sequences that were more active than the wild-type protein and one that had a different pH profile. These results were achieved by testing only 260 of a possible 110,592 sequences. In Phase II the company will develop a high-throughput assay system that will allow testing the majority of the predicted sequences. The research will also improve electrostatic functions of the PDA algorithm, and then use this version of the program to re-design the entire xylanase molecule instead of just the active site, thereby finding mutations located away from the active site that effect the protein's characteristics.\nThe PDA technology improves enzyme efficiency and expands the reactions and process conditions where they can be applied.

The microsphere production process     \n will be optimized with regard to minimized personnel radiation exposure,           \n maximized use of source radioisotopes, much shortened overall process time to      \n preserve radioactivity, and above all, much reduced cost.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will meet the demand from the microelectronics industry for an improved micro x-ray fluorescence instrument for thin film measurements. A new technique, monochromatic micro x-ray fluorescence (MMXRF) analysis using doubly curved crystal optics can meet this significant market need. A toroidal crystal can focus characteristic x-rays from a microfocus x-ray source based upon diffraction. The focused beam is monochromatic and the beam size is expected to be significantly smaller than that of current MXRF systems. This technique will provide high sensitivity and enhance excitation of low Z elements with the selection of beam energy. In addition, this technique will significantly increase the speed of high-energy x-ray measurements. A prototype MMXRF system will be developed that incorporates a modular dual beam system to probe samples with two energies simultaneously.\nThe initial application of the technology is in the area of semiconductor manufacturing. As semiconductor manufacturing moves to larger wafers and higher levels of integration, a single wafer may require hundreds of steps. These wafers are expensive to produce and very difficult to repair. The instrument under development would provide elemental and thickness analysis to identify defective thin film deposition at the earliest opportunity, avoiding the considerable loss associated with rejections at the end of the production line",

In-situ applications are difficult because such systems are bulky, heavy-weight, power-consuming, and difficult to maintain.  This project will develop a prototype polycapillary-based microbeam XRF (MXRF) sensor system for the remote monitoring of hazardous materials at DOE sites.  The use of a polycapillary focusing optic will significantly increase the X-ray beam intensity and therefore the detection sensitivity of the system.  In Phase I, a polycapillary focusing optic was coupled with a low-powered microfocus x-ray source to generate an x-ray beam of 30 \u00c2\u00bfm, yielding a flux density more than three orders of magnitude higher than that obtained with a pinhole collimator.  Various types of samples were analyzed using a polycapillary-based MXRF setup.  Significant improvement in detection sensitivity was achieved on air particulate and water samples.  In Phase II, a prototype polycapillary-based MXRF system will be designed and built.  System performance will be evaluated by examining various samples.  The MXRF sensor will be combined with a dedicated sample handling system to build a compact remote air monitoring system.

LV-SEMS and ESEMs are designed to work at  elevated sample chamber pressures to allow analysis of nonconductive or  moist specimens. An undesirable consequence results from the broadening  electron beam due to the presence of the gas.

This task is particularly challenging as the structural response exhibits both randomness and strong nonlinear features. To achieve the objective, ZONA proposes four major tasks.  The ZONA team will (1)Extend the capabilities of nonlinear MSC/NASTRAN to include two new elements specifically designed for this application and exhibiting improved shear and temperature distribution modeling; (2) Develop reduced order modeling approaches and equivalentlinearization schemes to reduce the computational cost associated with the prediction of the random structural response using the full nonlinear MSC/NASTRAN; (3) Extend the fatigue life prediction technique with the reduced order models; and (4) Establishexpedient design guidelines that can be used in the preliminary design phase. This effort is endorsed by Boeing, Lockheed-Martin and Pratt-Whitney whose support will ensure the success of the proposed project.",

After successfully finishingthe phase-I project, in this phase-II effort, we will concentrate on the whole assault zone marking/lighting system design, calculation/simulation, prototyping, measurement, lab/field test, modification, retest, and give a complete specification for futuremanufacturing and field deploying of the system. Following innovative research will be deeply addressed:  1. Two lighting systems-ground lighting system (GLS) and air lighting system (ALS) will be designed, manufactured and tested. The GLS will usevisible/invisible parabolic/high intensity LED or eye-safe LD with single or double-filament (VIS & INV) to make the active ground marks. The ALS will use above LED/LD to make a common-aperture, variable-focus projector equipped on the Aircraft toilluminate the passive ground marks having LIF, retroreflective paint, tape, or corner cube. Since this kind active/passive lighting/marking system has lightweight, long lifetime and low power consumption, one soldier can deploy and remove the whole systemin a short time.  2. Uncooled LLL CCD, NIR and LIR cameras, wireless communication systems, polarisation filters will be designed, manufactured and tested for the detection of above lighting/marking systems to accurately facilitate the instrument approachunder bad weather condition for safe landing.   Benefits:  The proposed lighting and detecting systems will be useful for lighting, security, IFF, advertisement, surveillance, law enforcement, and non-lethal illumination for crowd control. Boating,automotive, aircraft, and fire fighting industries would utilize high performance and high efficiency situational awareness systems for operating in poor visibility conditions.",

Current methodologies\nare cumbersome, expensive and often fail to produce interpretable results. A\nminor groove binder (MGB) has been developed that greatly enhances the ability\nof oligonucleotide probes to discriminate single nucleotide polymorphisms\n(SNPs) in the 5' nuclease (Taqman (registered), real time PCR, fluorescence\nquench release) assay. The goal is to develop a kit for rapid high throughput\nDNA fingerprinting using probes that contain MGB's and other proprietary\nmodifications. The fingerprint is derived from a panel of 23 diallelic\npolymorphisms. The probability that two unrelated individuals would have\nmatching fingerprints is approximately 1 in 10 (exp) 8. In the Phase I effort,\nPCR primers and probes for the 23 loci were optimized and their function was\ndemonstrated in 5' nuclease assays using a set of known DNA samples. The goal\nof phase II is to develop a commercial prototype with increased throughput and\nreduced cost. Application of four spectrally separated reporter fluorophores\nand a novel quencher will enable multiplexed assays. Standard affordable\ninstruments will replace expensive instruments specialized for 5' nuclease\nassays. The technologies developed herein can be readily applied to assays of\nany SNP's. Huge potential markets exist for these technologies in clinical\ndiagnostics and pharmacogenomics.\nPROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:\nThe commercial prototype presented here is a kit for human identification in paternity testing.\nThe technologies developed herein for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) screening could\nhave wide market potentials in a variety of applications including clinical diagnostics and\npharmacogenomics.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this Phase II SBIR is to develop a portable and completely wireless system that detects, processes, and analyzes muscle activity for remotely monitoring the functional status of an individual. The Personal Status Monitor (PSM) will remotely monitor the use of muscles during the exertion of motor tasks in a continuous and unobstructed fashion. Through pattern recognition of surface electromyographic (EMG) signals, the PSM will provide the caregiver with an objective parametric measure of how physically active their patient has been, such as walling, sitting, personal care, and feeding. The PSM will consist of three components: 1) four wireless EMG sensors, 2) a body worn transceiver (Repeater), and 3) the Base Station, which processes the signals for pattern recognition and feature extraction. The information can be sent to a remote location via telephone lines or the Internet. The specific aims of this program for Phase II are: Aim 1: To continue with Phase I development of the pattern recognition algorithms in patients with stroke; Aim 2: Design and build a working prototype of the hardware and software for the PSM; and Aim 3: Field test the prototype wireless system among stroke patients in the home environment. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The MA will primarily augment clinical service by making the line an effective place for rehabilitation. In addition, the PSM will have direct applicability to the field of ergonomics for work-site assessment, or in sports or recreational activities as a feedback device to facilitate training of skilled movements. Numerous other applications in the field of rehabilitation could include monitoring of drug therapies for tremor or other neuromuscular conditions, or home-exercise compliance. The knowledge base and prototypes developed in this project are directly transferable to other acquisition systems for biological signals recorded from the skin, such as EEGs and EKGs.",

It will have an intensity higher than 90% of the sum of the input intensities,  and a brightness that is 0.9N timeshigher than that of the individual input beams. The HBC is based on the storage of multiple holographic gratings in the same spatial location. Using a new material called PDA up to 20 holograms each with a diffraction efficiency greater than 90% can storedin a single location.  The combination process can be cascaded to increase much further the number of beams to be combined.Under the main task proposed here, we will concentrate on using this technology for combining high-power (4W) multimode diode lasers centered around 978 nm, for pumping dual-clad Yb-doped fiber lasers and amplifiers.  Typically, this laser is pumped withlasers at around 915 nm.  However, the pumping efficiency is about a factor of 3 higher at 978.  The constraint at 978 nm is that the pumping bandwidth is only about 6 nm.  If one were to use the blazed grating blazed beam combining, the number of laserscombined would be less than 10, because the wavelength separation between two constituent beams is typically 1 nm.   The key advantage of our approach is that because of sharp Bragg selectivity of thick (few mm) holograms, the wavelength separation caneasily be as small as 0.03 nm.  As such,  up to 200 beams can be combined within the 6 nm bandwidth, using a two stage cascading of HBC's, using a relatively thinner hologram in the second stage.  The result would be a nearly 700 W pump at the highlyefficient band around 978 nm, with a brightness of about 180 times that of each input laser.  Furthermore, we will investigate the use of this approach for combining incoherently the output of many high-power fiber lasers.",

        "abstract": "Parallax Research, Inc. proposes to develop an elemental analysis technique we call Confocal X-ray Micro-Spectroscopy for the purpose of identifying potential biological micro-objects during space missions or in returned samples. This new method utilizes Parallax's ability to make unusual grazing incidence x-ray collection optics, Parallax's background in designing x-ray elemental analysis instrumentation, and optical aberattions which have previously been considered dis-advantageous in grazing incidence x-ray optics. With this technique, we expect to be able to use an extended x-ray source with a concentrating optic to produce a high x-ray flux region on the sample and a collection optic to collect a large solid angle of x-rays emitted from the sample. By using an aberattion of the grazing incidence optic, we will be able to limit the area seen by the detector to a tiny micro-structure. With this device, NASA will have the ability to sort samples into those containing small amounts of C,N,O,S,P, and other light elements found in life forms and reject those not likely to contain life. In addition to space applications, Parallax will have several commercial applications for the technology developed in this program",

        "abstract": "In Phase I, Microcosm demonstrated an all-composite cryogenic propellant tank fabricated out-of-autoclave.  This revolutionary 42-inch LOX tank, tested with liquid nitrogen at 1.2 times maximum operating pressure, weighs 43% of one made of 2219 aluminum,and was produced for 15% of the cost.  The design was scaled-up from our 10-inch IR&D tanks, one of which was the world's first all-composite LOX tank to be flown.  Phase II refines the tank design and production process to achieve flight-quality for thelarger tanks.  We first evaluate the Phase I tank, other SR-XM program tanks, and various material coupons.  A more robust design will be developed, replacing the aluminum boss and fiberglass core with carbon-composite components.  Carbon fabric coresdemonstrated at the 10-inch scale, were not used in Phase I due to thermal stresses between a scaled-up core and aluminum boss.  Use of carbon-composite in both the boss and core material will essentially eliminate these thermal stresses and enable furtherscale-up.  A Resin Transfer Molded (RTM) or Compression-Molded carbon-composite boss will be developed.  The manufacturing process will be refined to improve consistency and repeatability.  Three 42-inch tanks will be built and tested, including aflight-quality LOX tank to be delivered to AFRL.",

Hyper-ASIC penetrates to the heart of the commercial semiconductor market with a unique product strategically placed among the field programmable gate array (FPGA), digital signal processor (DSP), and traditional singleapplication, non-adaptive ASIC chipsets. The innovation of the research is the uniquely adaptive architecture featuring a Mathematical Matrix Algorithm Processor (MMAP) consisting of Dynamically Configurable (Mathematical) Macros (DCM) pipelined inhardware to support high speed parallel processing of data under software control.  Hyper-ASIC is optimized for 16 bit performance and can be expanded as requirements dictate.  Detailed analysis of the system reveals that 16 bit (and future expansion)performance is supported without truncation of data during internal computations. Hyper-ASIC has exceptional system performance metrics - frame dimensions of 1024 pixels for both X & Y dimensions, spatial pixel resolution of 16 bits, data rate of 32 Gbpssupporting 5 channels parallel processing, algorithms include",

The visualization aids will operate on a Windows NT platform, and will be installed in the Technology Integration Center (TIC) or at anotherDARPA-selected facility.  The designs of the visualization scenes will be based on those developed and prototyped in Phase I.  Enhancements and extensions to those designs will be made based on feedback received from potential users of the displays.  Tosupport the implementation of mission impact displays, AVI will coordinate its work with those cognizant researchers who are developing mission models and mission dependency databases for DARPA and DISA.  AVI will recommend data fields to be added to themission model databases for use with the visualizations as well as other data mining tasks.

        "abstract": "The primary objective of CU Aerospace's Phase II work will be to experimentally characterize the ElectriCOIL flow using advanced diagnostics and to demonstrate lasing of this electrically assisted chemical iodine laser. CU Aerospace (CUA) and theUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) believe that it is possible to construct a highly efficient electric generation scheme to provide the precursor energy donor species O2(1D) with a combination of direct current and RF discharge techniques.The CUA/UIUC team has set up a flow tube experiment that combines a pulse direct current pre-ionization coupled with a more conventional cw RF discharge. The innovative combination of these techniques will provide a steady state source of O2(1D).  Anadditional advantage to the discharge technique is the creation of significant quantities of the O2(1S) state that can assist in the process of dissociating molecular iodine.  Such an electronically produced O2(1D) generator will be even more effective ifimplemented simultaneously with an atomic iodine augmentation technique; this implementation will also be performed in Phase II.",
