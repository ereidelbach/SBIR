THE HEART OF THIS INSTRUMENT IS A LARGE ARRAY OF NUCLEAR DETECTORS WHICH IN MOST INSTANCES CONSISTS OF BISMUTH GERMANATE (BGO) SCINTILLATOR CRYSTALS AND PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBES. IN PRACTICE, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBES MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN BOTH THE REQUIRED SPATIAL RESOLUTION AND DESIRED ENERGY RESOLUTION. A NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS TO THIS PROBLEM HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATEDBUT MOST RESULT IN SERIOUS COMPROMISES IN COMPLEXITY, RESOLUTION OR COST. A NEW IDEA WHICH OFFERS A PRACTICAL SOLUTION IS TO USE GROUPS OF SEVERAL BGO SCINTILLATOR ELEMENTS COUPLED TO LARGE PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBES WHICH PROVIDE THE NEEDED TIMING AND ENERGY RESOLUTION INFORMATION.IN ADDITION SEPARATE SOLID STATE PHOTODETECTORS WOULD BE ATTACHED TO EACH OF THE BGO CRYSTALS TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF THE EMITTED LIGHT. BY THIS MEANS THE SENSITIVITY OF THE PHOTOTUBES COMBINES WITH THE COMPACTNESS OF THE SOLID STATE SENSOR TO ACHIEVE A VERY DENSE HIGH PERFORMANCE ARRAY.THE KEY PROBLEM IN IMPLEMENTING THIS CONCEPT IS THE LACK OF A SOLID STATE IDENTIFICATION SENSOR WITH ENOUGH SENSITIVITY TO DETECT THE LIGHT EMITTED BY THE SCINTILLATOR. IT NOW APPEARS LIKELY THAT SILICON AVALANCHE PHOTODIODES OFFER THE IDEAL SOLUTION. THESE PHOTOSENSORS OPERATE WITH SIGNIFICANTINTERNAL SIGNAL GAIN WHICH RESULTS IN A BETTER SIGNAL-TO- NOISE RATIO THAN NONAVALANCHING SENSORS. OUR PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON A SILICON AVALANCHE PHOTODIODE HAS SHOWN THAT EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE CAN BE OBTAINED WHEN THEY ARE COUPLED TO NAI(T1) SCINTILLATOR CRYSTALS.

THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE TESTS WOULD BE CONTROLLED BY PROGRAMS STORED ON THE VIDEO DISK. ALGORITHMS AND DATA FOR SCORING THE TESTS WOULD BE STORED IN THE SAME WAY. THIS SYSTEM WOULD ALLOW A CLINICIAN TO INITIATE A SESSION OF SELECTED TESTS VIA A MENU AND HAVE THE SYSTEM ADMINISTER AND SCORE THE TESTS.

THE INSTRUMENT IS BASED ON ULTRASONICS AND WOULD SPECIFICALLY BE DESIGNED FOR LOW COST, DIRECT DIGITAL READOUT, AND EASE OF USE BY RELATIVELY UNTRAINED PERSONNEL. THE PRIMARY VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENT IS IN REDUCING THE NEED FOR CATHETERIZATION, THUS SAVING PATIENTS FROM THE ASSOCIATED DISCOMFORTS AND RISKS OF TRAUMA AND INFECTION. PRIMARY APPLICATIONS ARE: (1) DIAGNOSIS OF DISEASES WHICH INVOLVE RESIDUAL URINE PROBLEMS IN THE UROLOGICAL OFFICE, OUTPATIENT CLINIC, OR EMERGENCY ROOM; (2) MANAGEMENT OF THE BLADDER IN SPINAL CORD INJURY AND OTHER NEUROGENIC PROBLEMS;DETERMINING THE NEED TO CATHETERIZE PATIENTS RECOVERING FROMANESTHESIA. THE PRODUCT POTENTIAL FOR WIDESPREAD USE BY UROLOGISTS, CLINICS, AND SPINAL CORD CARE CENTERS. THE PROJECT INCLUDES BOTH THE DEMONSTRATION OF TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY, AND CLINICAL CALIBRATION AND EVALUATION OF AN EXPERIMENTAL INSTRUMENT. THE CLINICAL EVALUATION PHASE HAS SEVERAL OBJECTIVES: (1) TEST THE INSTRUMENT AND PROCESSING ALGORITHMS FOR ACCURACY AGAINST CATHETERIZATION DERIVED RESULTS. DETERMINE ACCURACY OVER ENOUGH DATA POINTS TO BE SIGNIFICANT. PROVIDE DATA TO BE USED FOR OFF-LINE REFINEMENT OF THE PROCESSING. (2) DETERMINE HOW RELIABLY THE INSTRUMENT CAN BE APPLIED OVER THE REANGE OF POTENTIAL PATIENTS, INCLUDING SEX, AGE, EXTENT OF BLADDER FILLING, OBESITY AND EXTRAVESICAL PATHOLOGY. (3) INVESTIGATE CLINICALVALUE IN THE FOLLOWING APPLICATIONS: (A) AMBULATORY OFFICE OR CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS, (B) SPINAL CORD INJURY PATIENT MANAGEMENT, (C) POST-ANESTHETIC PATIENT CARE. BECAUSE OF THE PATIENT BENEFITS AND THE EXCELLENT POTENTIAL FOR WIDESPREAD USE, WE THINK THE PROJECT WILL BE OF INTEREST TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARTHRITIS, DIABETES AND KIDNEY DISEASES.",

THE PRESENT PHASEWILL DEFINE BEST POSITIONING SITE FOR CATHETER TO VESSEL, DEVELOP APPROPRIATE SENSING AND DATA ANALYSIS ELECTRONICS, AND INVESTIGATIVE QUANTITATION METHODS FOR MAKING MEASURE- MENTS OF STENOSIS IN MONITORING VESSELS. EXIT THE INVESTIGATORS HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH THE USE OF 2MM DIAMETER CATHETERS WHICH CONTAIN AS MANY AS SEVEN TRANSDUCING ELEMENTS. BLOOD VESSEL CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA IS TO BE MEASURED WITH SIX OF THESE ELEMENTS AND THE SEVENTH WILL MEASURE BLOOD VELOCITY. TOTAL BLOOD FLOW IS DETERMINEDBY MULTIPLYING THE CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA OF THE VESSEL BY THEBLOOD VELOCITY. TOTAL BLOOD FLOW IS DETERMINED BY MULTI- PLYING THE CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA OF THE VESSEL BY BLOOD VELOCITY. SUCH CATHETERS WILL BE UTILIZED TO MEASURE BLOOD FLOW IN FREE FLAP TRANSPLANTS AND REPLANTED DIGITS (VESSELS 1-2 MM IN DIAMETER). THREE TYPES OF CRYSTAL GEOMETRIES WILLBE STUDIED -- THIN SECTOR, WIDE SECTOR, AND A DUAL TRANS- DUCER WITH TWO ELEMENTS IN OPPOSITION (APPROXIMATELY 120 DEGREES). CRYSTAL LENGTH WILL ALSO BE SUCH AS TO GUARANTEE COMPLETE ISONIFICATION OF THE VESSEL (1-2 MM LONG). USING THESE APPROACHES, IT SHOULD BE POSIBLE TO DETERMINE FACTORS WHICH MAY ACCOUNT FOR TISSUE ATTENUATION DUE TO THE DISTANCEOF PROBE TO VESSEL WALL, ALLOW FOR CALCULATION OF VESSEL CROOS-SECTIONAL AREA AND APPROXIMATE ROTATIONAL ANGLE BETWEEN VESSEL AND TRANSDUCER. SIGNALS WILL BE OBTAINED FROM A TRANSDUCER INPULSED DOPPLER MODE AND PROCESSED TO DETECT POWER OF SIDEBANDS, POWER OF CARRIER AND FOR ARC IMPLEMENTATION OF RANGE GATED SIGNALS. STENOSIS QUANTITATION WILL BE DERIVED FROM ANALYSIS OF PEAK FREQUENCY AND SPECTRAL BROADENING OF RECEIVED SIGNALS. USE OF DUAL ELEMENT CATHETER CONFIGURATIONS ARE CONSIDERED MOST PROMISING FOR PROVIDING QUANTATIVE INFORMATION. WHEN USED IN HUMAN SUBJECTS, THE CATHETER WILL BE IMPLANTED WITH DISSOLVABLE SUTURES AT THE TIME OF SURGERY AND CATHETER ATTACHED TO THE BODY WITH TAPE.

THE PRIMARY SENSOR IS AN ELASTIC METAL MEMBRANCE WHICH FORMS ONE PLATE OF A CAPCITOR. AN ELECTRONIC CIRCUIT CONVERTS THE MEMBANE DEFLECTIONS INTO VOLTAGE VARIATIONS WHICH ARE SAMPLED BY A MICROPROCESSOR. DUE TO THE SMALL OSCILLATING MAS OF THE MEMBRANE, THE TRANSDUCER HAS A HIGH NATURAL FREQUENCY AND IS LARGELY INSENSITIVE TO EXTERNALLY INDUCED VIBRATIONS. THE CAPACITIVE TRANSDUCER CONCEPT OFFERS AN UNUSUAL AMOUNT OF DESIGN FLEXIBILITY AND CAN WITHSTAND LARGE OVERLOADS.",

UNTIL RECENTLY, THE ONLY AVAILABLE ANALYSIS OF INTERFERENCE WAS A CLASSICAL LINEAR THEORY WHICH DOES NOT PRODUCE SUFFICIENTLY ACCURATE FORMULAE FOR PRACTICAL USE IN THE TRASONIC REGIME. WORK ON WALL INTERFERENCE CORRECTION PROCEDURES FOR TRASONIC TESTS IS IN THE RESEARCH STAGE: A RECENTLY COMPLETED TRASONIC, THREE-DIMENSIONAL PROCEDURE INVOLVES SMALL DISTURBANCE APPROXIMATIONS AND IRROTATIONAL FLOW ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAKE THIS METHOD GENERALLY INADEQUATE FOR PREDICTING WALL INTERFERENCE EFFECTS FOR REAL TEST MODELS. IT IS, THEREFORE, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK TO DEVELOP AN ACCURATE CORRECTION WHICH DOES NOT NEGLECT ROTATIONAL EFFECTS AND MAKES NO SMALL DISTURBANCE ASSUMPTIONS. IN PHASE I, A PROCEDURE APPLICABLE TO THREE- DIMENSIONAL CONFIGURATIONS IS DEVELOPED. THE PROCEDURE IS TESTED USING A COMPUTER CODE DEVELOPED IN PILOT FORM AND IS LIMITED TO TWO-DIMENSIONAL CONFIGURATIONS.

THE FIRST STEP, PHASE I, WILL BE THE SPECIFICATION DESIGN AND DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROTOTYPE OF AN INSTRUMENT MAKING THESE IMPROVEMENTS POSSIBLE. THE INSTRUMENT ENVISIONED WILL PROVIDE A MORE ACCURATE AND REPEATABLE THERMAL STIMULUS TO THE INNER EAR THAN PRESENTLY AVAILABLE DEVICES. MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE NOVEL ASPECT OF THIS INSTRUMENT WILL BE ITS ABILITY TO DELIVER PROGRAMMED CONTROL OF IRRIGANT TEMPERATURE SUCH AS STEPPED, RAMPED OR OTHER PATTERNED CHANGES. THIS WILL IMPROVE THE QUANTITATIONOF RESULTS, REDUCE AMOUNT OF STIMULUS THE PATIENT WILL BE REQUIRED TO ACCEPT AND POSSIBLY MAKE THE CHANGES LESS UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THE SUBJECTS BY MAKING CHANGES LESS ABRUPTLY.

THESE AIMS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE COMBINED EFFORTS OF ICS MEDICAL CORPORATION AND THE RESOURCES OF THE VESTIBULAR TESTING LABORATORY OF THE JOHNS HOPKINS HOSPITAL. BY PROVIDING THIS INSTRUMENT AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME PRICE AS COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS PRESENTLYAVAILABLE, IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT RESEARCHERS WILL DEVELOP IMPROVED TEST PROCEDURES.

MICROCARRIER SYSTEMS SHOW GREAT POTENTIAL FOR THE LARGE SCALE GROWTH OF CELLS AND THE PRODUCTION OF THEIR METABOLIC PRODUCTS. THE AIM OF PHASE I IS TO PRODUCE MICROCARRIERS OF NEAR IDEAL SIZE AND DENSITY FROM SEVERAL INORGANIC MATERIALS AND THEN TO EVALUATE THEIR ABILITY TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF HUMAN DIPLOID FIBROBLASTS IN SMALL SCALE STATIONARY AND SUSPENSION CULTURES. INORGANIC MATERIALS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE COST EFFECTIVE IN INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS BECAUSE OF THEIR EXPECTED DURABILITY AND THUS THEIR POTENTIAL FOR REUSE. CURRENT POLYMER BASED MICROCARRIERS HAVE LITTLE POTENTIAL FOR OR ARE INTRINSICALLYNOT REUSABLE. THE MATERIAL SELECTED FOR THIS STUDY (SI, SIO(2) ONE TYPE OF GLASS) HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO SUPPORT GROWTH IN A CONVENTIONAL MONOLAYER CULTURE. IN ADDITION A LARGE AMOUNT OF RECENT DATA FROM THE FIELD OF CELL BIOLOGY SHOWS THE TREMENDOUS INFLUENCE THE SUBSTRATE HAS ON THE BIOLOGICALBEHAVIOR OF CELLS. THUS THE INORGANIC MATERIALS CHOSEN MAY ALSO HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR SUPPORTING IMPROVED CELL GROWTH AND/OR MORE FAVORABLE METABOLIC ACTIVITY. PRELIMINARY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT A VARIETY OF CELLS GROWN ON ONE TYPEOF GLASS MICROCARRIER WERE INDEED BIOLOGICALLY DIFFERENT FROM CELLS GROWN ON DEXTRAN BASED MICROCARRIERS. THE MICROCARRIERS WILL BE PRODUCED BY PHYSICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION SPECIFICALLY SPUTTERING.

IN ORDER TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT STRENGTH AT THESE TEMPERATURES, THE REFRACTORY METALS SUCH AS MOLYBDENUM, TUNGSTEN, TANTALUM, NIOBIUM, AND RHENIUM MUST BE USED TO FABRICATE THE PARTS WHICH WILL BE EXPOSED TO THESE TEMPERATURES. THESE METALS AND THEIR STRUCTURALLY IMPORTANT ALLOYS HAVE NOTORIOUSLY POOR RESISTANCE TO OXIDATION IN THE TEMPERATURE RANGE WHERE THEIR STRENGTH CHARACTERISTICS ARE VITALLY NEEDED. PROTECTION, IN THE FORM OF COATINGS, FROM THE OXIDIZING ENVIRONMENT IS CRUCIAL FOR SUCCESSFUL OPERATION. CURRENT COATING TECHNOLOGY IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ACHIEVE SATISFACTORYOPERATION. NEW OXIDATION RESISTANT COATING MATERIALS AND PROCESSES MUST BE DEVELOPED WHICH WILL PERMIT OPERATION IN THE 500C TO 2000C TEMPERATURE RANGE. HAFNIUM OXIDE AMD ZIRCONIUM OXIDE OFFER TWO POTENTIAL CANDIDATES FOR OXIDATION RESISTANT COATING MATERIALS.
