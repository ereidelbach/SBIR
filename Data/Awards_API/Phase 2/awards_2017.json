        "abstract": "Over 820 million Indians, about 65% of its population, cook on polluting open fires, causing ~1 million premature deaths annually. Fifty million households have no electricity. The Power Stove is a household energy solution combining clean cooking and reliable, ondemand power. Clean combustion and thermoelectric power technology, make it a high performance, user desirable solution based on low cost thermoelectric modules generating electricity from the stove during cooking.  It supports a family of eight delivering 65% fuel savings and 70% smoke reduction while generating eight watts of power. One day of cooking will charge two cell phones and provide light for four hours. Hi-Z, a thermoelectric company and Greenway, an established Indian cookstove manufacturer, plan to introduce a power stove to rural Indian families.  Phase 1 demonstrated a 35% efficient \u201cpower\u201d stove that produced 8 watts of net electrical power and reduced emissions and cost. Phase II R&D will ensure the cost will not exceed an affordable $25. Further R&D and field trials will be conducted during Phase II to obtain and implement market feedback. The Power Stove will revolutionize the lives of rural Indian families by improving their health, lighting their homes and connecting them to the modern world.",

        "abstract": "The Phase I project showed that novel urethane-functional (NUF) resins could be produced that were free of isocyanates and very useful for one-component, ambient-cured (OCAC) coatings.  Resins for OCAC coatings, which are expected to be valued at $5.7 billion by 2019, are used to produce a variety of coatings including oil-based paints, wood stains, varnishes, and aerosol paints._x000D_ Phase I results showed that NUF resins could be used to overcome a major limitation associated with the current state-of-the-art for OCAC coating resins. This limitation is the ability to significantly reduce the level of solvent in the coating without sacrificing coating performance characteristics, such as drying/curing time, durability/hardness, and chemical resistance. Thus, NUF resins provide high performance OCAC coatings with substantially lower levels of air pollutants (i.e. solvents). An added environmental benefit associated with NUF resins are their_x000D_ ultra-high biobased content. Coatings with a high biobased content are better for the environment and reduce our Nation's dependence on fossil resources.

During Phase I XploSafe successfully confirmed the technical feasibility of using its proprietary low-cost biodegradable sorbents to passively adsorb target nutrient ions (ammonium, nitrate, urea, and phosphate) from primary and secondary wastewater. The treated sorbents were ubsequently applied as a slow-release fertilizer to effectively grow rhizomes thus demonstrating the recovery and reuse of essential plant nutrients. Phase II efforts will be focused on technology scale up and operational demonstration of the technology with a municipal wastewater treatment facility. Wastewater treatment  plants (14,780 in the U.S.), animal farming operations (257,201) and organic farms (18,153) represent some customers and users of the developed technology. The technology will prevent eutrophication of natural waters and lower dependence on manufactured fertilizer through recycling. It also has a sustainable cost and utility advantage over industry standard biological and chemical treatment solutions that cannot offer nutrient reuse. In addition to helping wastewater treatment plants reach compliance, the technology also represents a strong value proposition for wastewater plant operators by generation of revenue from the sale of nutrient rich fertilizer.",

It provides simultaneous encapsulation and killing of biological contaminants with the added capability for decontamination of chemical and radiological hazards. Current technologies are labor-intensive involving separate steps for site preparation, decontamination, wash-down, and waste disposal. TIAX\u2019s technology combines tasks, reduces labor, and requires a smaller logistical response. The remediation process provides protection against worker exposure and environmental cross-contamination; and reduces hazardous waste disposal volumes versus typical liquid wash-down. TIAX\u2019s past research shows essentially complete removal of hazards with a demonstrated 7-log kill of Bacillus atrophaeus. The technology may be used in response to hazardous material releases in buildings and transportation systems, including trains, buses and aircraft. According to an independent technology commercialization assessment, the technology is transferable to the Environmental Services Market (e.g., mold remediation and asbestos abatement) with a reported 2013 market approaching of $2.1B and the hazardous waste market of $25.9B in 2014.

Existing radioisotope identification devices (RIIDs) are typically biased toward gamma spectroscopy; some instruments may use an additional inefficient neutron counter in form of a He-3 tube.  The recent development of materials such as Cs2LiYCl6:Ce (CLYC) and Cs2LiLa(CL,Br)6:Ce (CLLBC) has enabled gamma spectroscopy and neutron detection using a single detector, reducing the cost and footprint of the device.  The proposed Trimode (TM) RIID will be based on a large CLYC crystal for gamma and fast-neutron spectroscopy, and thermal-neutron detection.  The system will include state-of-the-art electronics for pulse-shape discrimination, sophisticated radionuclide-identification and neutron-spectroscopy analysis, and an intuitive user interface that includes wireless data transfer.  The system will meet relevant ANSI standards.  A CLLBC version, with small footprint and better energy resolution, will also be constructed utilizing the majority of the base components.  During Phase II, an advanced prototype will be demonstrated, which will to lead to a commercial product.

For U.S. Government personnel, the risks are even greater, particularly for special operators at USSOCOM and other agencies.  Without a reliable way to rapidly identify, assess the severity of, and respond to potential leaks, the safety of special operations forces is at risk.   In the Cloud-based SOCOM Scalable Man-Machine Identity Learning Environment (C-SMILE) project, DECISIVE ANALYTICS Corporation (DAC) provides a next generation identity management system to manage these risks.  The prototype developed in Phase I enables early detection of data leaks posted online and produces a quantified assessment of leak severity to help analysts understand and mitigate personal identity exposure damage that has already occurred.  The Phase II system builds upon that work by transforming it from a reactive system to a proactive system that also explores social media data and other open source data to help analysts discover, understand and mitigate potential risks before they can cause damage.",

Additional cockpit speech corpus and noise recording will be derived from a variety of sources to enhance previous datasets. A database will be assembled to accumulate additional training data collected during operations to enable continuous improvements to the speech understanding agent. The performance of the system will be evaluated under realistic cockpit noise conditions involving multiple pilots and controllers. The speech agent will then be integrated with the human-machine interface system being developed under the ALIAS Phase III program.  In addition to its application in the ALIAS program, the speech understanding agent developed under the proposed research can play a significant role in NASA Reduced Crew Operations program, and in enhancing the cockpit automation systems in present day aircraft.

This can be achieved in part by providing capable and functional diagnostic and treatment methods for use at the point of injury.  The research described in this proposal addresses the urgent need for an improved blood analysis system for casualty monitoring in far forward field care situations, motivated by the fact that real time blood analysis is central to the effective diagnosis and treatment of the most common combat injuries.  In Phase I, Lynntech performed a thorough feasibility study and developed a suite of electronic and optical measures for blood analytes relevant to trauma, transfusion, and other traditionally Role 3 functions, towards a simple device for use in Role 1 or 2.  The components of the blood analyzer are unaffected by harsh environmental conditions, addressing a debilitating limitation of the current technology.  The Phase II effort aims to integrate the various innovations from Phase I, followed by prototype development and extensive testing and evaluation, towards a comprehensive blood analysis suite that meets or exceeds the requirements set forth by the US SOCOM.",

        "abstract": "Numerous closed-loop neural prosthetic devices are currently undergoing pre-clinical testing, but existing neural recording and stimulation devices are too cumbersome for use outside the clinic. For successful clinical implementation, miniaturized wireless neural recording and stimulation devices are essential. The focus of this Phase II SBIR proposal is to design, build, and commercialize compact, flexible, and robust implantable neural recording and stimulation devices. These remotely-powered programmable capsules will be necessary for control of state-of-the-art neural prosthetic systems, empowering the study and deployment of bioelectronic therapies. The implantable devices will meet the technological demand required for Haptix, Electrix and TNT and other high bandwith neural prosthetic systems and interface with a range of electrodes. We propose to develop devices with up to 128 channels of recording and up to 16 channels of electrical or optical stimulation in individual or paired devices with full hermetic encapsulation stable for at least 2 years. These devices will accelerate neuroprosthetic experiments in rodent and NHP models of disease. Design, engineering and fabrication will be assessed and tailored specifically towards translational specifications, which will be reviewed and proposed at the end of the Phase II once the animal testing and data analysis is complete.",

The overall objective of m-DART Phase II/Option is to develop and demonstrate a transmit distributed coherent data communication systems between platforms moving on fast flyers (> 400 kph) using MIL radios for the local node data distribution.  Challenges include: solving Doppler issues both on time transfer and retrodirective beamforming as well as autonomous operation transmissions with third party waveforms. DART enables an order of magnitude increase in reach-back distances with just 4 nodes, or enhanced data rates by coherently combining radio frequency (RF) energy from many small unmanned aerial systems (UAS).  The distributed nature of DART increases system portability and survivability, while imposing a large mitigation cost to an adversary.  DART significantly expands the operational space (by a factor of N^1.5) of platforms operating in an anti-access/area-denial theater and in the grey zone.",

        "abstract": "Existing visual screening devices consist of illuminated test cards. By rotating the knob, images may be changed; however, once the system is loaded with cards it cannot be easily reconfigured. There are a limited number of cards that a unit can hold at one time, and it is impossible to change cards on the fly if a patients vision needs further investigation or if the clinician wants to do variable threshold testing.  Computerized and/or automated vision testing has been described in the literature; however, implementation was limited by the available display and computer technology. With high- resolution optics and microdisplaysa cost-effective automated system is very achievable.  SA Photonics proposed solution is an electronic AVT that uses COTS displays with standard electrical interfaces that can be plugged directly into a desktop computer running test software. This system will be low cost and will dramatically improve vision testing both within the USAF and for commercial use.   An electronic Automated Visual Test (AVT) system would allow clinicians to tailor the images presented to each client as necessary, even providing the opportunity to change them mid-test if needed. Efficient threshold testing is easily accomplished via a simple input device under patient control.",

Left untreated, iron stores continue to deplete, resulting in iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Women undergoing basic military training are particularly susceptible to reduced and depleted iron stores. To-date, there are no point-of-care (POC) instruments for comprehensive, accurate determination of iron status. We propose to develop a novel POC iron screening system, which utilizes affinity-based sensors to rapidly and selectively measure serum markers and perform blood analysis on an integrated cartridge. The cartridge will be integrated into a complete system with user-friendly software, and capabilities of accessing Electronic Health Records (HER). In Phase I, we successfully demonstrated proof-of-concept of key technology elements including plasma separation and ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) detection at physiological levels. In Phase II, the sensor platform will be extended to include a comprehensive set of biomarkers for iron deficiency. The sensor elements will be optimized and integrated into a single cartridge for multiplex detection. At the conclusion of Phase II, a complete, validated, portable iron screening system will be ready for commercialization and transition, which will be actively pursued beyond Phase II.",

        "abstract": "Despite recent tremendous leaps in the development of new technologies for image recording, presentation, manipulation, 3D capabilities, and analysis, many vision exams are still performed using paper Snellen charts, paper color charts and Amsler grids. Current procedures are time consuming, labor intensive, potentially subject to transcription errors and test preparation, which may compromise the test integrity. Therefore, DHP seeks the development of threshold-based tests supporting vision screening relevant to most current military aircrew standards. This includes, at minimum, acuity, color, ocular motility (hyper/hypo/eso/exo phoria/tropia), and stereo. To address this DHP need, Hedgefog Research Inc. (HFR) proposes to continue the development of the Automated Vision Tester (AVT) system with adaptive threshold based testing. We envision that the development of this technology will result in a whole family of products that may be used in various vision testing scenarios and applications. In Phase I, we identified most challenging technical requirements of the AVT and demonstrated feasibility of HFR's AVT technology meeting these requirements. We also selected and evaluated major components for the Phase II development. In Phase II, we intend to integrate the selected components into a fully functional TRL-6 prototype that will be delivered to OBVA Laboratory at WPAFB for evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Few-MeV linac-based X-ray machines are widely used for radiotherapy, cargo inspection, and industrial radiography. These machines are large, weighing several tons. Several years ago truck mounted systems extended the reach of this technology into field applications like bridge inspection. Recently man-portable systems were introduced, which typically are comprised of three modules that can be independently moved without heavy machinery and set up at the application location. Currently, there is no linac-based x-ray machine that can be carried around in a single compact piece to fit in tight spaces that can replace radioactive isotope - based devices in industrial radiography and well-logging. Euclid Beamlabs proposes an inexpensive, ultra-compact linac-based x-ray source that can fit in a suitcase as a possible replacement for radionuclides. This novel design is based on a dielectric accelerator. The use of ceramics makes the transverse size of the accelerating waveguide comparable to that of a pencil. Because of this size reduction, additional weight reduction of shielding becomes possible. In Phase I, based on this technology we have built and tested a 500 keV dielectric accelerator and additionally developed an engineering design of 1 MeV x-ray system ready for manufacturing in Phase II. This device will provide a novel functionality for the x-ray market. It will be compact and similar to the low-energy x-ray systems (e.g. dental x-ray). However, it will have higher energy x-rays due to a use of linac-based few-MeV electrons. Potential applications are radioactive isotopes replacement in radiography systems,  active interrogation systems, and well logging.",

        "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in multi-domain ISR is associating observations across domains. Despite recent advances in network-based association, the amount of human analytical effort currently required to associate information between virtual domains (e.g. the same event being described in different publicly available sources of information) with sensor information from the physical domain (e.g. EO/IR images) makes it infeasible to perform large-scale cross-domain associations of observations. In this effort, we will develop new inferential methods for aggregate data association across virtual and physical domains and prediction of network structure and correlated activities and events across these domains. The research will also address challenges inherent in gathering information in virtual vice physical domains, including balancing additional network exploration in the virtual domain with tasking of sensors to obtain new observations in the physical domain.",

        "abstract": "Radiation Monitoring Devices (RMD) has proposed a composite detector technology for multi-mode detection, based on incorporation of the inorganic scintillation material into an organic host such as the plastic scintillator, suitable for handheld and backpack applications. Plastic scintillator serves as an optical light guide, and can additionally provide gamma and fast neutron detection and pulse shape discrimination (PSD) in the case of the use of advanced plastic scintillators (developed at RMD). Since the composite detector with multiple small elements of inorganic scintillator behaves as a large volume single crystal, the primary advantage of this technology is that for building highly efficient, large volume detectors, only small size inorganic crystals are needed. The yield of small crystals produced from large boules is close to 100% which significantly reduces the cost. Therefore, most importantly, the cost of a composite detector can be significantly lower compared to high quality large single crystals of inorganic scintillators. CLYC is one of the very promising inorganic materials, given its capabilities to provide good gamma energy resolution over a large range of energies, thermal neutron detection, and PSD.  Also, due to significant difference between the light decay of the gamma and neutron events in the plastic scintillator matrix and in the CLYC scintillator, events can be easily attributed to each material and excitation type using PSD.  Depending upon the application, where superior energy resolution or higher specific efficiency is desired, other high performance scintillators such as CLLBC and TLYC are also viable options as a CLYC alternatives.",

Numerous technical challenges associated with bi-phasic pulse generator electronics and ultra-soft materials fabrication must be solved to deliver precision dosing parameters to 100 to 3000 micron diameter visceral nerves.

TDA Research, Inc (TDA), in collaboration with University of Alabama, Birmingham (UAB), is developing a compact, single-person portable, ruggedized, battery-operated, advanced filtration system for serum potassium to serve as a bridge dialysis system in the post traumatic care of combat casualties suffering from hyperkalemia. The system is designed to run for a minimum of 6 hours to stabilize the patient until appropriate renal replacement therapy (RRT) begins.     In Phase I we developed an adsorbent with high uptake capacity and excellent selectivity for K+ over other cations. Based on these results, we fabricated a breadboard prototype bridge dialysis unit and demonstrated its ability to continually remove potassium from blood.

        "abstract": "Hyperkalemia will clearly continue to be a concern in the treatment of combat casualties. The risk of death from hyperkalemia-induced cardiac arrhythmias is significant in the absence of renal replacement therapy (RRT). Rapid evacuation out of Iraq and Afghanistan ensured that most hyperkalemia occurred further up the evacuation chain, thereby limiting the need for non-RRT hyperkalemia treatment options in austere medicine. In future theaters of operation, the military research community must prepare for prolonged field care and extended evacuation times. One implication of the delay is that complications of combat injury, including life-threatening hyperkalemia, will be more frequently managed in the far forward deployed setting. To address this unmet medical need for the military, we plan to develop a forward care medical devices to treat hyperkalemia. In this study two medical devices will be developed, intra-peritoneal dialysis and intra-abdominal mesh packing devices, to reduce systemic potassium levels in austere medical treatment environments. The benefits of our forward care medical device are three-fold: 1) stabilizes hyperkalemia patients to endure prolonged field care and delayed evacuation, 2) is logistically feasible to implement for field use, and 3) expands hyperkalemia treatment options to include transport on aircraft with limited medical capability.",

        "abstract": "Blood in the chest cavity (hemothorax) as a result of injury remains a common and serious challenge in military and civilian trauma management. The primary treatment of hemothorax requires a tube to be inserted into the pleural space around the lung. Unfortunately, in about 20% of the cases, significant amounts of blood, clot, and fibrin remain after initial drainage. Left untreated, this can lead to a permanent reduction in lung function, infection, or scarring. Current management of this \"retained hemothorax\" demands additional surgical procedures resulting in morbidity and excess cost. To address this problem, we propose a \"prevention strategy\". Overcoming outdated simple, straight chest tube technology, we have developed a steerable chest tube that can be directed by the provider to the dependent pleural space where hemothorax usually accumulates, thus providing better drainage. Extendable cannulas traverse separate channels down the chest tube and will be advanced directly into the blood pool for early instillation of dilute anticoagulant . A newly designed portable suction/infusion pump will connect to the system. A novel bedside endoscopic approach for pleural drainage  is also being developed. Testing in manikins, animals, and cadavers will document effectiveness. Marketing and regulatory compliance strategies should promote preferential clinical use.",

In Phase II, ISL will optimize the fabrication steps with scale-up in focus, build a prototype and perform rigorous testing with saliva samples of diverse origin. ISL will formalize FDA approval steps toward market entry. Nano-Mos is ideal for detecting target molecules that are often present in low concentration in saliva compared to serum.

However, preservation technology is aged, toxic and less effective than desired with typical cell survival post-thaw below 50% and unreliable potency. Current technology greatly hinders efforts to repair traumatic injury and chronic disease using new cell and tissue-based therapies. This proposed technology supports the critical preservation infrastructure needed to enable post-delivery assurance of therapy viability, function, and efficacy. The super-cooled storage formula and protocol developed during Phase I using commonly available freezers (-20C) will be broadly applied to preserve genitourinary cell types and then focused for the preservation of penile tissue at sub-zero temperatures (-20C for 1 week storage, -80C for 1 month storage). Tissue preservation and corresponding tissue transplants will be studied in collaboration using a murine model system developed at an esteemed USA medical school. The novel preservation formulas are made possible by negligibly toxic, hyper-effective anti-ice nanomaterials developed via biomimetic nanotechnology that can dramatically reduce the concentration of cytotoxic CPAs required to prevent tissue damaging ice formation by 50-90%, depending on temperature regime.",

The increased survivability, however, has resulted in an increase of wounded warriors being sent home with severe injuries that ultimately reduce their quality of life post-treatment, especially those with severe damage to genitourinary tissues and organs. The catastrophic damage caused to the genitourinary (GU) system by these injuries extends well beyond physical impairment, drastically affecting the quality of life for wounded warriors. Often times, side effects include incontinence, sexual side effects, fertility, loss of reproductive capabilities, and hormonal problems, all of which can lead to psychological disorders that effect not only the wounded warrior, but also their families. New treatment methods are needed to preserve the function of the genitourinary system whenever possible. Towards these ends, TDA Research, Inc. has developed a novel perfusion system for the salvage and repair of trauma injured genitourinary tissue. It combines a novel perfusate which can oxygenate tissue without having to use blood (which has supply and type matching problems) and a portable, ruggedized perfusion machine.

        "abstract": "There is a great need to establish an integrated framework for comprehensive analysis of blast injury events, evaluation of protective equipment and assessment of injury probabilities. Presently, such tool does not exist. The initial Phase II project has developed, partially validated and demonstrated a multiscale simulation framework integrating several blast injury biomechanics modeling components. The goal of the Second Phase II project is to finalize the development of the Blast Injury Simulation (BISim) framework in the professional product form that can be used by DoD Labs, contractors and academia involved in warfighter injury and protection. The framework will provide interfaces to other government sponsored or commercial blast injury and protection modeling tools. Main components of the framework will be improved, validated and delivered as turn-key products. These specialized products include: a human body/PPE model generator, articulated human body model for biodynamics simulations, wearable sensor based blast event reconstruction tools, high-fidelity human head/brain model for brain injury diagnostics, biomechanical assessment of military PPE, and tools for model- and sensor-based calculation of injury scores. We will establish these professional tools, at the TRL 6 level, for user friendly testing and evaluation in military relevant and simulated operational environments such as DoD Labs.",

        "abstract": "Trauma is the most common cause of death in ages 1-48. Uncontrolled hemorrhage in the torso is the leading cause of preventable death in military combatants and civilian trauma patients with otherwise survivable injuries. The prospects for survival from hemorrhage-induced traumatic cardiac arrest (HiTCA) are dismal with only about a 1% survival rate.  Advances in endovascular technologies have led to the development of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) but is not very effective once cardiac arrest has occurred.    Selective Aortic Arch Perfusion (SAAP) is an endovascular-extracorporeal perfusion technique created specifically for resuscitation from cardiac arrest (both traumatic and medical/non-traumatic/medical). Dr. Manning has been developing SAAP in laboratory models of both HiTCA and ventricular fibrillation/medical cardiac arrest since 1989. SAAP involves the femoral artery insertion of a large-lumen balloon occlusion catheter that is advanced to the descending thoracic aortic arch. Inflation of the balloon isolates the aortic arch vessels, including the coronary arteries as well as carotid and vertebral arteries supplying the brain, for resuscitative perfusion during cardiac arrest to achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).    In Phase I, we successfully developed a high-flow low-profile SAAP catheter and a coupling mechanism for use of SAAP with ECMO.",

        "abstract": "Promoting the sharing of technical data between researchers is one of the most effective ways to advance technology development. As a result, there is a growing trend for research communities to develop websites with curated catalogs of data sets and tools. However, once a large number of resources have been collected, it can become challenging to maintain a centralized site so that potential users can easily find resources that are useful to them.\n\nWe propose to address this problem by extending InferLink's ActiveSearch technology. ActiveSearch is a novel semantic search framework that combines natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a massive ontology so that users can search through document repositories in an intuitive fashion. In this project, we will extend this core technology to support search through collections of resources, such as data sets, software tools and analytics. This \"catalog search\" problem typically differs from document-centric search in some respects. For instance, there may be relatively little meta information associated with a resource. In addition, the search system must support expert researchers and contributors who are intimately familiar with the site's resources, as well as less sophisticated users who are unfamiliar with the resources.\n\nOur primary application focus will be the IMPACT portal (Impactcybertrust.org) but the work will be generally applicable to other resource information sites. Due to the growing number of such sites, there are numerous commercial opportunities for a semantic search solution that can be easily customized for an application domain.",

This Spectral Labs Incorporated (SLI) proposal, 'RAD/NUC Smart-device User Interface & Training Environment' (RN-SUITE), is a comprehensive research and product development program that continues our successful proof-of-concept work in Phase I to make the essential paradigm shift. \nRN-SUITE is a Toolkit that combines a RAD/NUC Smart-device User Interface with a simulated RAD/NUC Training Environment. The Smart-device UI, an Android/iOS application, supports the Training Environment while also serving as a universal UI for existing RAD/NUC detectors in use across the country. The RN-SUITE Training Environment allows for the simulation of radiation detection concepts within a real space without the use of any actual radiation sources. RF beacons are used to track the trainees movement within a physical environment and the intelligent UI provides realistic radiation readings based on a previously defined virtual source. Setup tools will be developed to allow agencies to configure training exercises in indoor or outdoor spaces in as little as 30 minutes. RN-SUITE will be deployed as a cost-effective kit with all the components necessary to setup a medium scale exercise.",

The toolkit will be able to simulate the response of a handheld radiation detector to a virtual source using a COTS smart device and Bluetooth beacon network.  The toolkit will include easy-to-use interfaces to guide the training supervisor in instrumenting the exercise area and reviewing source detection and localization results to demonstrate best practices.  Localization of the virtual detector is performed using a data fusion algorithm to fuse beacon range estimates and smart phone IMU and magnetometer measurements.  A radiation propagation algorithm is used to simulate the absorption and scattering of radiation through building materials between the virtual source and detector.  The smart device can be configured to emulate a specific radiation detector model including detector response function, emulated embedded analysis algorithms, and emulated user interface displays.  When actual radiation detectors are available, the toolkit will be able to receive spectra over a Bluetooth connection using an open architecture for the purpose of injecting the virtual source into real background measurements.

These multichannel recordings will also enable users to generate simultaneous multi-axis movements with a more natural feel of control than existing myocontrollers.

We demonstrated  that our sorbent works well with eight different classes of contaminants specified by the DoD, five of which were previously not analyzable. Novel TDA sorbents were exposed to known concentrations of  toxic substances, the amounts that could be extracted from each sorbent were quantified chromatographically, and we compared the performance of our sorbents with commercially available carbons (in most cases our carbons performed better). We also tested our sorbents in an environmental chamber to replicate a field environment.  In Phase II, we will start with a proven badge and set of sorbents used for the past 15 years by the Navy, and augment them with additional sorbents to capture gases not currently monitored. Thus, we can rapidly and cost-effectively develop and produce an ultimate passive dosimeter that is light-weight, compact, stable and storable before and after use, and which can quantify the wearers time weighted exposure.  At the end of the Phase II project, our technology will have reached a TRL of 7 field demonstration, and we will supply the DOD with 50 badges for testing.",

A SCYPE radio and packaging design, including novel antenna designs, was developed to demonstrate viability of operating on a wide range of maritime platforms, including small unmanned underwater vehicles. Technology risk reducing experiments and component-level prototyping demonstrated the feasibility of novel features of the SCYPE radio design. A prototype SCYPE software tool was developed with capability to predict availability, persistence, and speed of point-to-point maritime RF link range and tradeoff studies conducted with this tool showed that datarates >100 kbps can be achieved with SCYPE. The Phase II base period will focus on development of a size, weight, and power-optimized SCYPE prototype, development of a SCYPE waveform that integrates radio parameters and environmental monitoring with a real-time predictive link model.

        "abstract": "Project Summary\nThe high failure rate of drugs late in clinical development is an indication that nonclinical in vitro models and\nanimal models are not accurately predicting compound performance in humans  Only   out of        molecules\nidentified by pharmaceutical companies as a potential drug candidate is successfully advanced through FDA\napproval  Drug toxicity in general and drug induced liver injury  DILI  in particular  represent the major cause of\ndrug attrition or removal from the marketplace  There is a critical gap between the need for predictive in vitro\nplatforms to evaluate the effects of compounds on human health and the availability of solutions which meet the\nthroughput and accuracy required  To meet this need for increased biological relevance  the next generation of\ntoxicity testing is beginning to incorporate fluidics and more complex cellular models into in vitro compound safety\nand efficacy testing \nNon fluidic  static  tissue culture plates have been a staple of the in vitro pharmaceutical testing market for\ndecades and are the major model system used for liver safety testing  However  static cell culture systems fail\nto generate biologically relevant gradient drug exposures and may lack the viability and metabolic competency\nessential for safety testing  Additionally  these static systems do not allow for discrimination between primary\ndrug effects and those mediated by metabolic breakdown products or cellular responses  While these static\nsystems afford a picture of the acute toxicity of the compound itself  this picture is incomplete  at best  and\npotentially leads to the progression of compounds with serious safety issues into animal studies and clinical\ntrials  These late stage failures come at huge financial costs to pharmaceutical companies  creating a significant\nneed in the marketplace\nWe have developed the SciFlowTM      Fluidic Culture System to address existing shortcomings in drug\nsafety testing  SciFlow      is an innovative  gravity driven  fluidic tissue culture system providing highly\nbiologically relevant compound exposures  and an innate ability to distinguish between parent drug and\nmetabolite effects  The SciFlow System is based on a standard  SBS compliant     well plate format with the\naddition of fluidic pathways connecting the wells along each row of the plate  This enables the evaluation of\ngradient compound concentrations on cells  under dynamic one way fluidic conditions that are more\nrepresentative of the in vivo environment \nSciFlow is designed as an open platform  supporting the culture of many cell types  in both two dimensional   D \nand three dimensional   D  formats  and in a more biologically relevant fashion  To validate its diverse culture\ncapabilities  SciFlow s compartments have been populated with cells representing a wide variety of phenotypes\nincluding primary liver cells  hepatocytes  human  dog  rat  mouse  etc   and many diverse cell lines  HepG  \nHepaRG  Caco   etc    Preliminary compound toxicity studies have been completed  utilizing many biochemical\nand high content imaging assays to assess cellular outcomes \nThis proposal describes the development of an SOP to leverage the benefits of the SciFlow      to provide\nimproved drug induced liver injury prediction  The aims of this project are to \n    Optimize existing exposure and assay protocols in the SciFlow      \n    Use optimized assays to test a library of    compounds of known and varying DILI on   liver cell models\n  primary human hepatocytes  co cultures of primary human hepatocytes and non parenchymal cells  and\n HepaRG cells   Utilize that dataset to drive selection of a panel assays to include in a final SciFlow DILI\n predictive SOP \n    Demonstrate the capabilities of the SciFlow DILI predictive SOP in two blinded studies \nThis work will be completed in collaboration with the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy Institute for Drug Safety\nSciences  The outcomes of this study will be a complete solution for conducting predictive toxicology analyses\non new drug candidates with previously unattainable levels of sensitivity and specificity  These accurate in vitro\nto in vivo extrapolations  IVIVE  will decrease the number of compounds with serious toxicity liabilities proceeding\ninto the later pre clinical and early clinical drug development  saving pharmaceutical companies both time and\nmoney while enabling the ultimate goal of more rapidly providing safe and effective therapeutics Narrative\nStandardization of a Fluidic In vitro Exposure System for IVIVE Predictive Toxicity Data\nThe high failure rate of drugs in late stage clinical development is an indication that nonclinical in vitro and pre \nclinical animal models consistently fail to accurately predict compound efficacy and toxicity in the human body \nThis is because currently available static tissue culture systems and animal testing often fail to adequately\nreproduce human physiology and to identify dangerous compounds  resulting in expensive late stage compound\nfailures  We have developed the SciFlow       a    well microfluidic tissue culture system that incorporates fluid\nmovement with compound and metabolite exposure gradients into a benchtop model that when combined with\nliver cells  produces a superior model of human physiology and mimics compound exposure in the human\nliver  This Phase II application outlines the optimization of compound dosing and assays  with the goal of\ndeveloping a well validated method for predicting drug induced liver injury that leverages the unique benefits of\nthe SciFlow",

NRU is commercializing a technology to recover phosphorus from municipal wastewater in the form of an agriculturally valuable mineral called brushite. This technology addresses the need to recycle phosphorus from the waste stream in order to prevent technical problems at wastewater treatment plants and water pollution. The ultimate goal of our process is to produce a high-grade source of phosphorus that has been \"upcycled\" (i.e., has higher value at the end of the process than at the beginning), and brought to a point where it can be used in either agriculture or industry. At present, brushite is not a recognized phosphorus fertilizer, neither in the US nor globally, although it contains 18% phosphorus. Relatively little scientific literature is currently available to make a clear assessment of its value as a phosphorus source for plants. Despite the dominance of DAP, MAP, TSP and APP fertilizers in the market, we believe that brushite is a phosphorus mineral with high potential as a fertilizer.",

For example, while corn (a hybrid crop) and soybeans (a self-pollinated crop) were planted on approximately the same land area in the U.S. in 2017, the total value of the corn hybrid seed industry was greater than 4x the value of the soybean seed industry. However, producing hybrid seed is expensive relative to self or open-pollinated crops. In some crops, such as soybeans and wheat, the biology of the plant is prohibitive to the economical production of hybrid seed, thus disabling the realization of the benefits of hybridity in these crops. Enabling a crop such as wheat to be produced as a hybrid would have an annual value exceeding several billion dollars.This project will develop methods to scale the preservation and storage of maize pollen and to enable on-demand use of the pollen. On-demand use of maize pollen in seed production will improve and enable hybrid seed production, thus improving agricultural productivity and food availability.",

        "abstract": "Each year in the United States, over $30B in produce goes to waste due to spoilage. Degradation of produce in inventories is a tax on agricultural production that reduces the overall productivity and resource efficiency of US agriculture. Less waste means that growers and shippers of produce end up with more dollars in their pocket, and that nutritious and high quality produce can make it to the consumer at a more affordable price. In many types of produce, spoilage is driven by degradation due to ethylene gas, a hormone that plants release in response to aging or stress. Ethylene inhibitors can be applied to slow the effects of ethylene aging in produce. Ethylene inhibitors have been transformative in the apple and pear industries, where they enable year-round availability. Hazel&#39;s innovation is to take industrial-level application and downsize it to a continuous application method at the box level. This enables application of this technology across a much wider range of commodity types and means that ethylene protection can follow produce through the supply chain. During Phase I of this project, the delivery technology was successfully implemented, and lab-scale tests in-house at Hazel Technologies and with industry partners showed efficacy across an impressive array of different produce types. This project targets improved manufacturing techniques and third party verification of efficacy at scale, both in a controlled academic environment and within real-world commercial supply chains. Phase II is designed to prepare the technology for full commercialization and to build collateral for new customers. At the conclusion of Phase II and the start of Phase III, Hazel Technologies will be equipped to produce our 1-MCP technology at unrivaled economy and scale. The enhancements to our production engineering proposed under this award will enable new 1-MCP innovations, unlocking more potential for this potent, post-harvest active ingredient. Finally, this award will support third party testing of the technology at commercially relevant scales under both academic and commercial supply chain conditions, which will provide confidence in our product and its results for potential customers. At the completion of Phase III, Hazel Technologies will have successfully commercialized our anti-ethylene insert technology. As a result, US produce exporters will be able to send US products abroad with greater confidence, and consumers will have access to higher quality produce without having to subsidize as much supply chain waste from their pocket.",

The care of chronically ill, technology-dependent children at their homes in rural communities can have a significant impact on the cost and quality of health services. The project develops technology for the early intervention of fragile patients, which may mitigate the development of more severe illness that would likely require inpatient hospital care. If emerging medical conditions are not identified early in this patient population, the situation can quickly deteriorate to an emergency that requires very complicated emergency transportation (helicopter) to a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) in a major city hospital. Most families caring for critically-ill technology-dependent children try to redefine \"normal\" to fit their children&#39;s needs and strive for stability in their routines--routines that are significantly disrupted by even the briefest of hospitalizations in distant locations. In addition to potentially complex and painful medical interventions, rural families in particular experience interruption of their education routines, discontinuity in peer interactions, and a break in the \"normality\" of their life. The system AME is proposes to develop in this application remotely monitors chronically ill, technology-dependent, pediatric patients at their homes in rural areas in order to reduce hospitalizations. Technology-dependent children are more frequently affected by life-threatening illness than the general population and require specialized care to facilitate recovery and rehabilitation.",

        "abstract": "This project will develop and qualify a system that is capable of treating soybean farming operations where susceptibility to SCN is the primary yield limiting pest. Soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines; SCN) is the major pathogen of soybean causing over $1 billion in crop losses annually. SCN is now considered endemic to North America and is spreading as more acres of land are planted in soybean. Widely prevalent strategies for SCN management include crop rotation and the use of resistant soybean cultivars. These approaches have met with only limited success in reducing the populations of parasitic nematodes in the field. The recent loss of SCN resistance in Ohio-grown soybean highlights the importance of generating new methods for SCN control such as biocontrol. Examples of biocontrol with nematicidal activity are found in the scientific literature including numerous strains of bacteria. However, commercial applications by the large seed companies are limited to spore-forming Bacillus strains. While these spore-formers have some limited ability to survive conventional on-seed application processes and supply chain conditions, they can be limited in their effectiveness against target pests. Environmental stress and abuse associated with manufacturing and distribution typically results in microorganism death and/or dormancy, which decrease viability and physiological activity of the microorganism at the time of application. Thus, current microbial products have decreased effectiveness and reliability.3Bar Biologics is creating a disruptive new system to deliver beneficial microorganisms - a low cost, disposable bioreactor that protects the microorganisms until the farmer is ready to activate the product prior to application. On-site growth of the beneficial microorganisms short-cuts the conventional supply chain, resulting in fresher, more viable microorganisms delivered to the field. This bioreactor opens up the potential for farmers to apply more effective microorganism strains with SCN control capability.The work plan addresses four technical objectives to create a functional prototype for commercialization of strains with demonstrated activity on SCN, to i) confirm yields and stability of the bioreactor system under a range of conditions, ii) optimize and scaleup the production process, iii) develop basis for pamphlet and use instructions, and iv) Demonstrate SCN efficacy and soybean yield improvement in the field.This project is directly aligned with USDA NIFA Challenge Area 1) Global Food Security, and Priority 8.2.4) to research biobased approaches for plant protection against abiotic and biotic stresses.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to treat chronic back and lower limb pain more effectively using a high-resolution stimulation technology. Lower back pain affects more than 100M Americans. While spinal cord neuro-modulation is successful for about 60% of patients, many people remain untreated and suffer from chronic pain. Low-back pain is the most difficult to treat due as conventional electrode technology cannot selectively deliver energy to these fibers due to the bulky paddle electrode volume associated with the legacy manufacturing processes. Furthermore, to achieve maximal pain relief, neurosurgeons must wake the subjects during an operation to verify if the patient senses pain relief as the electrode is positioned. Many subjects undergo multiple operations due to inaccurate electrode alignment or movement of the electrode over time due to physical activity. The proposed active grid electrode technology seeks to double the size of therapeutic surface area, including providing therapy to low-back fibers which are not accessible by conventional electrodes. The technology is expected to improve low-back pain relief, as well as use wireless programming to alter the therapy in the event of electrode movement, avoiding the need for re-operation. The proposed project seeks to double the area of the spinal cord which can receive therapeutic benefit, by developing an active stimulation-grid electrode grid technology. By positioning a very small electronic circuit within the paddle electrode, the team is expected to create a 64 contact therapy array to deliver precision therapy. To accomplish these goals, the project includes three critical tasks including: (1) develop a medical-grade design of the implantable electronics, package, and lead array, (2) perform mechanical aging and stretch testing, and (3) prepare prototypes for subsequent ISO 14708 validation testing. The goal of the project is to accelerate the medical-grade hardware development effort to enable future therapies to treat low-back pain. Eventual validation after this project is completed will be performed in humans by selectively applying stimulation and recording if the patient feels therapy in the low-back area.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it addresses the bandwidth crisis, the problem of transmitting an exponentially growing amount of data through a fixed amount of increasingly congested spectrum. The bandwidth crisis limits economic growth by constraining communication, and also poses very serious challenges for national defense and disaster response. Making better use of limited spectrum is therefore of high societal and commercial importance. This project will study a new approach, called spiral modulation, for achieving much more spectrally efficient communication than previously thought possible and thereby directly addressing the bandwidth crisis. Commercially, this could facilitate much more rapid data transfer, enhancing existing business applications and enabling new ones. Spiral modulation is applicable to any form of electromagnetic communication, whether wireless or wire-based. It could lead to commercialization across a wide range of communication sectors including but not limited to wireless, mobile internet, unmanned vehicles, automotive, aviation, and Internet of Things. It is a dual use technology with both civilian and defense applications. Ultimately, spiral modulation could become the core technology for the worldwide telecommunications industry. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project applies new mathematics to the problem of encoding information into waveforms for telecommunication. In current digital communication, information is transmitted using symbol waveforms constructed from sinusoids which have constant amplitude over each symbol period. This approach is known to produce a sharp upper bound on the highest spectral efficiency that can be achieved. By instead constructing symbol waveforms from sinusoidal waveforms with continuously-varying amplitude, spiral modulation bypasses the theoretical limitation on spectral efficiency. Building on prior Phase I research, this project will build an end-to-end hardware prototype to establish the implementation path and performance characteristics of spiral modulation. The research will progress in stages from waveform design and spectral efficiency measurement experiments, through end-to-end radio design in software, the hardware prototype development and documentation of best practices. It is anticipated that this research will show significant spectral efficiency advantages over existing signal modulation techniques. Other possible advantages for spiral modulation may also appear, such as greater tolerance for interference and phase distortion.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of software and monitoring system for the conservation of water resources and the economic sustainability of agricultural crop producers. Agricultural production uses a great deal of water. In California alone, 80% percent of all water usage goes to agriculture. As communities expand and drought conditions develop, the competition for scarce and expensive water resources has become intense. Growers need to minimize costs and water needs by making their irrigation practices more efficient. While new irrigation application technologies have reduced losses from wind drift, leakages and evaporation, large amounts of water are still be wasted as it washes through the soil past crop roots. The technology developed in this project will allow producers to track soil moisture movement through the soil profile and across fields. This will allow producers to develop irrigation strategies based on the unique conditions of their soil types and topography and reduce water waste. It will save producers money and enable them to stay in business and meet new governmental regulations regarding irrigation. Improvements in water management efficiencies and better crop management practices can increase crop production and uniformity, reduce food costs, and help preserve the environment. This SBIR Phase II project addresses priority challenges currently facing growers, producers, and agricultural scientists in effectively using water for crop (food) production. Soil and crop scientists have been examining the need for acquiring higher resolution moisture and temperature data throughout the root zone and across the landscape. A science-based approach is needed to optimally determine the number, location, and depths of sensors to accurately measure, and then model, soil properties for use in precise, effective and efficient water and crop management. Moreover, for perennial crops such as wine grapes, there also is a need to develop models and predictions relating these environmental conditions and historical data to crop quality and volume as well as long-term tree/vine health. The proposed technology uses novel visual analytics to organize the resulting massive data flows and novel predictive models to allow stakeholders to perform precision management of crops based on soil moisture conditions and other field conditions that have not been possible to date.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project relates to the development of non-pharmacological interventions capable of improving clinical outcomes following spinal fusion surgery. Between 1998 and 2008, the annual number of spinal fusion surgeries increased 137% from 174,223 to 413,171 and the national bill for spinal fusion increased 7.9-fold. The greatest risk in spinal fusion procedures is failure to fuse, which can be particularly troublesome in high risk patients. Failure to fuse leads to poor surgical outcomes for patients and may result in chronic pain, secondary surgical procedures, reduced productivity, and/or permanent disability. In addition, failure to fuse results in greater clinical burden for physicians and increased cost per patient for payers. Lumbar fusions, in particular, have a cumulative reoperation rate of 19% over the 11 years following the initial procedure (BCC Research, 2010). The present project could result in the identification of new surgical devices and techniques capable of improving surgical outcomes, reducing complications, and eliminating costs associated with unsuccessful surgery. Osteogenic surgical device and techniques developed in the present project may also be used to accelerate bone healing and improve clinical outcomes following fractures of the skull, face, and long bones. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is to demonstrate in an animal model that osteogenic spinal instrumentation accelerates new bone formation and improves the rate of posterolateral fusion compared to clinically-accepted best practices in spinal fusion surgery. Innovative osteogenic spinal instrumentation (pedicle screws, rods, etc.) facilitates both mechanical stabilization of the spine and focused delivery of fusion-stimulating direct electric current (DC) at the fusion site. Application of therapeutic stimuli via selectively anodized pedicle screws accelerates the rate at which new bone is formed in critical regions of the spine such as the zygapophyseal joint and lateral gutter. The propensity of newly formed bone to create a robust, biomechanically sound fusion of adjacent vertebrae is also increased under osteogenic stimulation. Phase I results demonstrate that selectively-anodized electroactive pedicle screws effectively deliver focused osteogenic stimuli to key regions of the lumbar spine critical to spinal fusion. Results provide computational evidence for the technological and clinical success of novel osteogenic instrumentation in spinal fusion surgery. Phase II will confirm that the system of electroactive spinal instrumentation has the potential to accelerate bone growth and improve post-surgical fusion outcomes compared to gold-standard interventions utilizing a clinically relevant large animal model.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate compatibility of a novel polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) composite coating with metal-polymer bearings currently on the market, scale up the coating deposition process, and implement pilot processing lines. Currently, there is a need for a method to improve adhesion at the PTFE/metal interface while also reducing corrosion, friction, and wear. The implementation of this technology will aid in the transition from traditional lubricants to solid lubricants in manufacturing and has significant implications for the US economy and the environment. Currently, annual lubrication-related maintenance costs are as high as $1 trillion, and consumption of petroleum-based lubricants is estimated to reach 43.78 million metric tons as of 2016. The effective implementation of this technology will reduce maintenance costs and downtime by eliminating premature bearing failure. This project will serve as a proof point for the adoption of nano-coating technologies for reducing friction and wear in mechanical systems. It will also reduce barriers to entry for these coatings in industries dominated by outdated lubrication practices. The total applicable market size for metal-polymer bearings is estimated to be $1.0 billion, and a substantial near-term revenue opportunity for the proposed technology in this sector will be the focus of this effort. This beachhead opportunity serves as an industry validation point for the proposed technology and an entry point to other industrial and manufacturing applications. The intellectual merit of this project is based on improving the adhesion and mechanical properties of PTFE liners in metal-polymer bearings using an adhesive biomimetic polymer. This technology increases the wear-life of PTFE coatings, allowing for applications from which they have historically been precluded due to high wear and delamination. During Phase I, the proof of concept was established through demonstration of strong adhesion, 40% reduction in friction, 80% reduction in wear and elimination of susceptibility to corrosion in current metal-polymer bearings. The focus of Phase II will be in tailoring the coatings for specific product applications and implementation. The proposed SBIR Phase II work will overcome the remaining technical hurdles and validate the use of this technology as both a solution for improving the adhesion between PTFE and substrates and as a replacement for current PTFE liners in metal-polymer bearings. The execution of this project will allow the realization of critical proof points needed by industrial partners and speed the adoption of this technology into product lines.",

Apps are now everywhere. They innovate almost every industry. By making it easy to build high-quality apps, users enjoy better experience and developers enjoy better productivity, benefiting every industry and person that use apps. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to modernize the software development process by combining both program analysis research breakthroughs and big data technologies. Toward this vision, this project aims to build a unique product with innovative technologies to help developers automatically test Android apps. The product continuously tests apps across code changes to detect issues such as performance regressions, crashes, and memory leaks, as soon as problematic code is introduced. In contrast, existing tools often alert developers too late, after real users have been affected and many code changes have been merged, making it both stressful and difficult to find the problematic code. The proposed product gives actionable diagnosis by pinpointing what problematic code developers need to fix and explaining the why and how of the fix. It is thus much more intelligent and easy to use than existing tools.",

Plastic produced from plant materials can have lower environmental impact than petroleum-based plastics, but price and performance issues have limited their adoption. In Phase I, Grow Plastics demonstrated the ability to produce lightweight, low cost, thermally stable 100% bio-based packaging products. In Phase II, Grow Plastics will continue the development of its products while also working to develop a full-scale manufacturing line. The goal of the technology is to replace billions of pounds of petroleum-based plastic with a lower density plastic requiring half as much material, which is made from plants. This SBIR Phase II research project proposes to continue the development of a new manufacturing process for layered structures in biomaterials. Grow Plastics has demonstrated the ability to generate novel, high-performance layered cellular structures in biopolymers in a new manufacturing process using new machinery. The challenge in Phase II will be to continue the development in materials from Phase I while also scaling the technology to industrial scale.

By providing a system for autonomous vehicles to understand the goals and behaviors of humans on the road, the technology will allow autonomous vehicles to react to humans safely and effectively. Without the innovations commercialized with the help of this award, autonomous vehicles will be at best uselessly timid and dangerous additions to urban roads, and at worst a deadly obstacle to the goal of safe, livable cities. Every autonomous vehicle that is capable enough to be on the market will need to solve the problem that this project is helping to solve. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will help to address one of the thorniest problems in autonomous vehicles.

By building an approach based on the leveraging of careful human measurement and state-of-the-art learning algorithms, the innovations developed in this project will help pave a new path towards the computational modeling of cognitive facilities that are central to human intelligence but historically intractable to model using conventional machine learning or computer vision techniques.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project on hospital service robots is improving the quality of care in hospital systems that are under increased pressure to provide high-quality patient-centric care while functioning as profitable businesses. Hospitals face a shortage of qualified nurses and high rates of nurse turnover. Nurses play a critical role in communicating care plans, educating patients, and guarding against medical errors. The amount of time they spend in direct care activities is a key determinant of patient satisfaction, better patient outcomes, fewer errors, and shorter lengths of stay. In the face of nursing shortages across the U.S., it is increasingly important to have nurses performing at the 'top of their license'. Reducing the amount of time they spend on non-nursing tasks is crucial to this goal. Automation could address these challenges and labor shortage by allowing clinical staff to focus on providing skilled care. The proposed project aims to develop technology that is general-purpose enough to transfer to other markets, such as long term care facilities and, eventually, individual consumers. Robots that perform assistive tasks in homes could increase the feasibility of independent living for many older adults. The proposed project will establish the technical and commercial feasibility of developing hospital service robots that act as assistants on acute care units, enabling nurses to spend more time at the bedside with patients. This project will make technical advances along three dimensions: the ability of the proposed robot to autonomously navigate within nursing units and across the hospital (navigation capabilities); to easily adapt its manipulation skills to specific tasks and to physical characteristics of a particular hospital/unit (adaptive learning of manipulation skills); and to work alongside humans in a socially acceptable manner, including appropriate navigation in crowded hallways, speech, and eye gaze behaviors that communicate the robot's intentions (socially intelligent interoperability). The team intends to collaborate closely with a single partner hospital to iteratively improve the reliability and robustness of the artificial intelligence software suite developed with NSF funding and to deploy production-quality versions of the three core competencies. The final 6 months will involve a long-term deployment, with the robot autonomously working on an acute care unit of the partner hospital. The impact of the robot on unit staff and workflows will be documented, with the ultimate goal of developing a service robot that hospital staff view as a competent member of the care team.",

As ever more devices connect to the Internet and rich services move to the \"cloud,\" both the complexity of computer networks and their reliability requirements are rapidly escalating. It is no wonder that network outages and security breaches are common. Yet another side effect of this complexity, which does not make the headlines but is equally damaging, is that network engineers are understandably fearful of making configuration changes, so networks are unable to evolve at a speed that keeps up with changing business needs. The technology developed in this project will enable network engineers to validate correctness, security, and performance properties of their networks proactively, before errors reach the running network. This technology has the potential to improve the robustness of critical network infrastructure that is widely relied upon, to prevent unauthorized access to resources, and to increase the pace of innovation. The project will also provide insights into the largest \"pain points\" in modern networks and develop design and analysis techniques to address them. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project further develops the Batfish network configuration analysis technology. Interactions with pilot customers as well as many interviews with potential customers identified the needs of the marketplace and how the Batfish technology can best be adapted to meet those needs. As a result, the specific goal of this project is to seamlessly aid network engineers in validating network behavior during the policy design phase. Drawing inspiration from how software is developed today, the company will extend Batfish to support continuous integration of network configurations and develop a series of analyses that can find errors in network configurations with minimal input from the network engineers. The anticipated outcome of these research thrusts is a technology that allows network engineers to easily understand and gain confidence in their proposed network designs and to iterate these designs more quickly. The project will be driven by continued interactions with several pilot customers.",

Commercially, the technology described herein has the capability to provide faster, granular, dynamic information about safety and security, globally, to firms, universities, governments, and NGOs. This project uses novel methods to improve Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. As a result, better geo-parsing of digital sources of news about security will result in risk content that can be aggregated, displayed, and analyzed in original ways. This enables security managers at these organizations to better understand risk and protect their staff, providing a higher quality of care. For non-governmental organizations (including firms), this enables improved decision-making about operations, travel, and investment. For governments, this enables improved physical security resource allocation. Socially, this project has the potential to improve transparency and accountability regarding trends about safety and security, by improving the aggregation and visualization of data. As an example, groups of firms and governments in emerging markets can collectively identify previously unnoticed patterns of insecurity, in support of public accountability. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is an innovation over the state of the art in the following ways. First, this project builds on current geo-parsing extraction methodologies by adding methodologies unique to the safety and security space. Second, this project uses external data sources for cross correlations to improve the \"aboutness\" and granularity of extracted reports. Third, this project exploits contributions from users at the organizational level - as well as individuals. That is, this project supports the growth of an ecosystem in which human users of information also contribute to the quality, volume, and timeliness of that information. This contribution is also intended to improve the geo-parsing methodologies via machine learning. The opportunity is the improvement of geo-parsing extraction mechanisms. The research objectives are to test the hypotheses that NLP algorithms can exploit patterns unique to the safety and security space; that external sources of news can be exploited for improved granularity and \"aboutness\" scores; and that user-generated content can serve to support an ecosystem of information sharing. The anticipated results are that the above innovations will result in usability scoring sufficient for the safety and security use case.",

HIV-1 infection can be controlled by available antiretroviral therapy, but cannot be cured due to the persistence of the virus in a quiescent, or latent state. This latent HIV-1 is the barrier to curing infection. While latent HIV-1 can be found in all infected individuals, it is present in very low frequencies. To cure HIV-1 infection, new therapeutics that eliminate latent HIV-1 must be developed.

This is expected to directly feed into the domestic specialty and defense energy storage markets (aerial and underwater drones, on-person battery) and global consumer device markets while it is also expected to prove the technology for further development in the global electric vehicle markets. The proposed project and resulting technology responds to the growing need for low-cost, high-energy, and safe energy storage technology through a scientifically unique and technologically innovative approach. If successful in enabling a next-generation lithium-ion battery, this project will contribute to major advances in drone technology and consumer electronics technology capable of societal transformation. For example, providing 3-6 months of continuous drone flight time creates opportunities for the communications and defense industries, or providing batteries that take up \u00bd the space of conventional batteries for electronics opens the opportunity for higher power and more highly functional consumer devices. Moreover, this project represents an opportunity for the U.S. to grow its leadership position in energy storage. With the global energy storage market projected to exceed $45B by 2020, it is crucial for the U.S. to gain and maintain a substantial position in the field. Despite the slow rate of improvement in Li-ion technology, demand for a higher performing battery is growing quickly. To address this issue, this project proposes to enable a non-flammable, high-energy lithium-ion cylindrical cell technology comprising a high-loading silicon anode and nickel-rich cathode. The incorporation of a high-loading silicon anode in a cylindrical cell format is unique and has proven very attractive across a range of markets. Moreover, the innovation is proposed to be compatible with the existing battery manufacturing infrastructure for rapid commercialization. This SBIR Phase II project will, for the first time, demonstrate a working high-loading silicon anode in commercially viable cylindrical cell prototypes through the optimization of the electrode architecture and its accompanying electrolyte composition. Upon optimizing the prototype cell design the anode will be scaled for integration into cylindrical cells, the prototypes will be characterized for cycling and safety performance, iteration and improvements will be made as necessary, and finally, prototype cells will be incorporated into a drone-ready pack design for delivery to an Unmanned Aerial Vehicles manufacturing partner. If successful in achieving these tasks, this project should direct future research efforts towards a higher focus on electrolyte-enabled battery designs.",

This project will yield a novel electrolyzer component to overcome these challenges and demonstrate that cost-effective carbon dioxide utilization is possible. This component can be integrated into existing electrolyzer designs, and will enable such hardware to convert carbon dioxide into specialty gases. The resulting solution will have higher safety and lower cost than conventional packaged gas. Long term, this technology could be scaled up to higher volume applications, and used as a means of converting industrial carbon dioxide emissions into useful chemicals and fuels, thereby transforming a waste product into a new revenue stream. This scalable technology could therefore be the basis for the creation of new economic value and advanced manufacturing jobs in the United States, while providing a profitable way for existing U.S. industries to reduce their emissions. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will build upon the promising feasibility results achieved in Phase I to increase the performance of a novel carbon dioxide electrochemical cell along key performance dimensions, in order to deliver a commercially-relevant, cost-competitive solution. A viable solution to derive specialty gases from a low-cost feedstock like carbon dioxide will need to have high performance on several dimensions: energy efficiency, high reaction rates, long lifetime, and low capital cost. It will also need to operate at a scale that is industrially relevant. In Phase II, the novel electrochemical component will be scaled up to commercial dimensions, and the performance of the component will be optimized to meet the performance requirements identified during customer interviews. The final component will form the basis for a commercial unit, capable of producing specialty gases from carbon dioxide at cost-competitive rates.

These patients are desperate for a safe treatment that reestablishes glycemic control to augment or replace current management strategies such as metformin and insulin, which only slow the progression of the disease. This proposal provides a unique approach to T2D based on an orally delivered intestinal coating that mimics the beneficial metabolic effects of bariatric surgery. The potential commercial impact of this novel treatment is highly significant as the total estimated cost of diabetes management in the US is upwards of $245 billion, and rising. Overall, an astounding 1 in 5 US health care dollars is used for the care of people with diabetes. Therefore, major insurers are very interested in the reimbursement of alternative approaches for treating T2D, thereby lessening the national cost burden. The proposed project supports the further development of an entirely novel treatment for T2D based on new insights from bariatric surgery. The medical community has recently recognized that certain bariatric procedures involving duodenal exclusion confer profound and immediate benefits in glucose tolerance. Sleeve-type medical devices have provided clinical validation for this approach, but such devices are invasive and not currently approved due to safety issues. The investigators propose a non-invasive and safe orally-delivered intestinal coating which is expected to provide the same effect as surgery and implanted sleeves, but requires neither a specialist nor sedation. This proposal describes in-vitro and in-vivo experiments that build on positive results of the Phase I project, and drive the company towards human clinical trials. Specific Aim-1 is to optimize the active lead compound through evaluation of a limited number of rational structural variations. Specific Aim 2 is to demonstrate the dose-dependent efficacy and safety of lead formulations in a chronic diabetic animal model. Consultation with leading endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, and material scientists has guided the selection of the materials and methods of this proposal. Completion of the studies outlined in the NSF SBIR Phase II proposal will accelerate clinical translation, bringing this novel treatment closer to patients in need.",

ED crowding is a threat to patient safety for high acuity patients and has been associated with avoidable morbidity and mortality across many conditions. Concurrently, EDs are challenged to efficiently manage large volumes of low-acuity patients visiting with non-emergency conditions. The proposed electronic health record (EHR) integrated technology deploys novel machine learning algorithms that predict clinical events at actionable time-points in patients care pathways. Characterizing the ED as a flow system, these decision support tools will concentrate on the root causes that exist at ED inflow and hospital outflow. This new foresight is expected to enable innovative hospital operational models that expedite patient progression (minimize patient waiting), improve patient safety, and directly translate to measurable cost-savings and/or revenue generation. The SBIR Phase II project should result in higher yield and scalable decision support technology while promoting the value of data-enabled science and engineering in healthcare. The proposed project objective is to greatly reduce ED crowding by advancing the data-science, decision-science, and operations research that underpins our decision support technology. This new technology is based upon a novel combination of data normalization, feature selection, and supervised machine learning methods to predict clinical events that drives clear action to optimize hospital resources. This includes a decision support tool that functions at ED triage (inflow) to predict risk of critical events to empower safe separation of service streams for acutely ill and non-urgent patients. A complementary tool functions near hospital discharge (outflow) to predict expected discharge time enabling hospital-wide prioritization of resources required to expedite discharge. This unlocks downstream capacity and removes a major ED outflow bottleneck that creates prolonged waiting. The proposed technology is innovative by design to be scaled, yet adaptive to hospitals individual patient populations, operational objectives, and risk tolerances. The technology is expected to further advance learning with providers about how to consume new predictive and explanatory information for decision support. The specific Phase II objectives are to continue the development of the technology by: (1) integrating feedback into prediction output, (2) developing performance monitoring capabilities, and (3) driving systems-based management of patient progression.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project should increase the adoption of pedagogically validated educational games that facilitate retention and effective use of business concepts taught and relevant to managing organizations. Start-ups, for-profit and nonprofit companies all need managers who can make effective decisions in the face of complexity and uncertainty. It is of the utmost importance to society, therefore, that the next generation of business leaders is equipped with relevant frameworks and tools that supplement traditional teaching methods and enable effective use of knowledge on the job. Hence, this project has the potential to empower the U.S. workforce to be more productive and innovative, which will improve existing business outcomes and thus drive U.S. job and economic growth. Improved business operations will also lead to more profitable business in general and potentially larger tax revenues for the U.S. government. Eventually opening the GDL to third-party authors in the $18.6 billion global game-based learning market will accelerate game innovation and usage in other business and engineering disciplines at a lower cost, which will both enhance the effectiveness of the STEM workforce and encourage more economic activity in the game development market. This project is based on three innovations that differentiate this solution from others: (1) a scientific Game Research and Development (GR&D) process designs games containing pedagogical learning objectives; (2) a Game Design Language (GDL) accelerates implementation of game concepts as automatically validated, domain specific language while eliminating runtime errors; and (3) an innovative web Game Distribution Platform (GDP) minimizes the effort to setup and manage games in the classroom. Typical educational game development in languages such as JavaScript is time-consuming, involves professional software engineers and requires debugging of runtime errors, while usage of game technology in the class is disruptive to the flow of instruction. Such challenges are therefore prohibitive for non-professional programmers and game administrators such as professors. To mitigate the problem of runtime errors, this project employs methods of video game development, which typically use domain-specific languages based on non-Turing-complete models of computation to solve these issues. Games created with GDL will enable rapid new game development and have a guaranteed level of technical quality, allowing professors to focus on pedagogical relevance during instruction. The main technical hurdle is to tailor these methods to result in GDL capable of expressing the Operations Management (OM) games conceived during the scientific GR&D process and playable via the GDP that enables seamless class integration.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop visual search for product recognition in the furniture and home d\u00e9cor vertical. Text-based searches have revolutionized the ability of people to complete tasks more quickly and efficiently as they are able to find the information they desire in an organized, compiled, and logical manner. Visual search provides the next level of disruption in search capabilities by allowing users to find information even more rapidly and accurately by using images. The deep learning-based software being developed will allow consumers to find products they are interested in, and co-purchase related products, quickly. Further, users will be more engaged through exposure to designer photographs of products (inspirational photography). By helping customers find exactly what they are looking for in a timely manner, user engagement and productivity will be increased. Further, related style-based recommendations will increase purchasing overall. Increased spending stimulates economic growth by increasing taxable revenue by retailers, and through increased sales taxes generated from the purchases. This Small Business Innovative Research Phase II project seeks to develop a visual search engine that is poised to disrupt retail and ecommerce by switching the focus from text-based to visual search-based exploration. The platform initially targets interior d\u00e9cor and furniture where deep learning techniques are trained to recognize products across a wide range of conditions. In Phase II, the software deep learning architectures will be generalized to enable a broader range of products, and to allow customers more control over design decisions and choices. A client-facing REST API will allow retailers, designers, and media companies to programmatically access functionality of the platform, and build their own user interfaces and apps on top of the deep learning technology. Lastly, it is proposed to develop a white-label app that can be customized for individual retailers who want to distribute this visual search capability to their customers. Achieving these objectives will create state-of-the-art performance in visual search for applications in interior design, apparel search, real estate search, and product look-up.",

Humans are always building on and shaping the world but there is little hard data to further examine the effects this has. Beyond retail, this technology could affect how teachers layout classrooms, how disaster workers provide relief, or how factories keep their workers safe. The subtle physical details that affect humans everyday will be understood and investigated in ways not possible without the proposed system. This technology will benefit society by increasing economic efficiency because retailers can meet customer needs more easily. This translates into large potential commercial value because of the size of the retail market and because retailers are under pressure to deliver differentiated customer experiences that customers cannot get online or at big-box stores. Such experiences are enabled by understanding the customer at a much deeper level which in turn is enabled by the technology proposed here. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project uses sensor placement models, statistical methods, and face recognition to fully realize the commercial potential resulting from the Phase I development of a video analytics system for understanding human behavior. Research in video-based behavior recognition has seen renewed excitement because of deep learning but current work only addresses pieces of the problem. Critical missing components are robust face identification and registration, a process to install as few cameras as possible while maximizing the viewable area of a store, and video analysis results that are meaningful when combined with other data such as retail transactions. The research objectives of extracting biometric data (such as facial features) from video, automatically computing the optimal positions of cameras, and correlating behavior metrics with business operations are essential to improve the retail experience for shoppers and make the developments undertaken in Phase I more commercially relevant to potential end users of the technology.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project stems from a potential reduction in the capital cost of wind turbines by an astounding 15x. The Company's patented, remarkably simple design also reduces transportation, maintenance, and land costs, and provides greater location and altitude flexibility. It uses the same aerodynamics as today's dominant wind technology, the horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT), but with innovations that build on recent research into airborne wind energy generation. Multiple, 6-meter airfoils (they look like model airplanes) behave exactly like the outer tips of a conventional wind turbine blade, which is where most of the power is generated in a HAWT. The airfoils run along a rail- as if one captured kites and put them on short leashes - and a linear generator makes the power. The proposed research is a continuation of SBIR Phase I research and development that had demonstrated that these principles are scientifically sound. If successful, this Phase II project would drastically reduce the cost of wind-generated electricity, making it competitive with fossil fuels. It would thus be a completely self-sustaining commercially viable entity, creating jobs and generating tax revenues. By out-competing fossil fuels, it would use market forces to encourage renewable energy development, thus reducing energy-related emissions and improving national health, prosperity, and welfare. The project's light weight, low profile, and easy, flexible set-up may also have military and emergency applications that would help secure the national defense. The proposed technology captures energy through translational rather than rotational motion in the tips of the airfoils as they run along a rail tethered by bridles. Its major innovation is a patented bridling system that handles downwind forces (aerodynamic tip-over forces), which are the primary cause of the HAWT's mass and cost. Another major innovation is to run airfoils in an oval rather than a circle. This alters the math behind swept area, the key input for generation capacity. Because the oval's swept area is a function of length and height, rather than radius squared, this project can add capacity in many different ways, escaping the tyranny of building ever-bigger and -taller circles. The first objective is to design, test, build, measure, and refine a 100 kilowatt (kW) device. A meaningful-scale second-generation device will demonstrate the project's ability to meet performance, weight, and cost targets, while facilitating decisions about how to build far larger devices, and modeling their costs. The methods and approaches will continue to conquer challenges in five subsystems: structures, aerodynamics, power generation, control, and grid integration. The team, which includes leading experts in both academia and industry, will design subsystem options. It will convene to find the best system-wide design and construct the device, with many refinements along the way.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from the advancement of a novel water treatment process that reduces membrane fouling and significantly lowers water treatment costs. Membrane filtration is one of the primary water treatment technologies to address the global challenge of water scarcity. However, the membrane industry suffers from low productivity and high operational cost caused by fouling. Over 95% of the water treatment plants in US that employ membrane filtration currently operate at only 30-50% of their design capacity. Our revolutionary pretreatment technology not only mitigates fouling, but also increases system productivity by up to 400% and decreases the required membrane cleaning frequency by a factor of 50, thereby saving water, money and energy. The process can reduce both the capital expense and annual operational cost of water treatment plants by roughly 25%. Our innovation is also applicable to saline water, so it can be used as a pretreatment for desalination, and it can address another major environmental challenge by removing phosphorus from wastewater and thereby reducing the prevalence of blooms of toxic algae. This SBIR Phase II project will continue our scale-up and commercialization activities for our pretreatment technology to improve the performance of membranes in water treatment processes with respect to contaminant removal, process productivity, and energy efficiency, compared to existing technologies. The process relies on application of a proprietary particle in a novel reactor and has been demonstrated in our Phase I work. The objectives of the Phase II work are (1) scale-up and construction of larger treatment modules using commercially suitable materials and fabrication processes; (2) testing under more aggressive operational conditions; (3) improving particle production, delivery, and disposal processes; and (4) evaluating the particles' suitability as an economic approach to remove and recover phosphorus from wastewater. The economic analysis will also be updated using data collected in Phase II study. The effort will advance the technical readiness level (TRL) of our process to TRL6, while providing essential data for further development and credibility for marketing. On completion of Phase II, we expect to be prepared for deployment in small-scale commercial systems treating one million gallons per day, and for testing in larger systems.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a resonant light detection and ranging (R-LIDAR) distance sensor based upon use of an optomechanical beam scanning element actuated at resonant frequency. The broader impact of this project is to commercialize distance sensing instrumentation that advances the development of robotic and autonomous systems (RAS) by providing improved performance and order-of-magnitudes reduction in sensor size and cost. The development of RAS technologies could benefit society by increasing the productivity of economic activities in industries that include: mining, oil and gas, transportation, manufacturing, construction, agriculture, forestry, and defense. These industries are commercially significant and accounted for 24% of US GDP in 2015. Upon development, the R-LIDAR system is expected to make a commercial impact in a total addressable market for light detection and ranging (LIDAR) distance sensors that is expected to reach $739 million/year by 2018. Successful development of the R-LIDAR instrument will also pioneer opportunities for resonant scanning instrumentation in related optical applications that include microscopy, endoscopy, light machining, and display. Resonant beam scanners provide robust high-speed and high-performance operation that address size, weight, and power (SWAP) consumption limitations in state of the art light LIDAR distance sensors. The key outcome of the SBIR Phase I project was the successful integration of a resonant optomechanical element into an R-LIDAR distance sensor, demonstrating a 125 X 125 pixel field-of-view acquired at a 20 Hz frame rate. The SBIR Phase II project seeks to advance R-LIDAR instrumentation through (1) development of low-SWAP robust scanning elements, (2) techniques and instrumentation that allow for improved signal to noise ratio and high-rate data acquisition from pulsed time-of-flight LIDAR sensors, and (3) increased ranging capability of low-SWAP R-LIDAR instrumentation. Successful completion of these technical objectives will result in a distance sensing technology that will be particularly useful for high-accuracy surveying and inspection applications conducted using small unmanned aircraft system (S-UAS), where size and payload constraints are acute.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project continues previous development of an invention disclosure tool that allows users to draft a United States Patent and Trademark Office compliant patent applications by using an intuitive interface and game-based educational tools to draft patent applications. Inventors and small companies having no background in patent law and patent-application drafting strategies struggle with properly describing their inventions. Overcoming this lack of understanding on the part of the inventor requires a great deal of one-on-one educational training with a patent professional in order to draft a quality patent application. However, engaging a patent professional is costly and time consuming. This project expands the capacity of the invention disclosure software by allowing users to configure and customize the software for specific types of inventions and arts. Specifically, this project proposes a new customization tool for integration with the existing invention disclosure tool to allow for widespread adoption into varied technology arts. The customization tool comprises software modules that allow end users to identify and create narrative goals, design software interfaces by configuring display rules, design text output state configurations based on logical operators, design natural language output, design the natural language generated output that is desired for that product type and configure template text, token input, and grammar associations, and determine the position of natural language output into an overall document structure. This customization tool will allow for rapid, scalable distribution of the product to be driven by end users rather than through a traditional software development process, e.g., 1) researching, 2) market testing, and 3) designing and implementing each new version of a product for different technology arts.",

The platform combines a time-travel adventure game, a complementary book, and in-game avatars for important scientists (like Albert Einstein) that can answer students' questions. It is aimed at the need for educating more science and engineering professionals by tapping into children's strong interest in games to augment current science curricula that students often find boring and uninteresting. The story is about STARDUST (atoms) and its formation and history in the universe. It engages students by taking them back in time to identify trillions of atoms they personally inherited from Einstein and the last T-Rex. Besides school use, the game's independent learning and engagement allows distribution directly to children for recreational use, adding another avenue for science learning, and a sustainable business model for the Company through school and commercial sales. The technology can also support independent learning in underperforming schools. The development of the scientist avatar artificial intelligence technology will have wide application for many other educational and training requirements. The innovation is a unique platform for independent learning about the sweeping science saga of atoms during the history of the Universe and Earth, and the connection of each student to that history through the trillions of atoms they inherited from prior beings like Albert Einstein and the last T-Rex. The platform combines video games, a complementary fictional story book (based on the science) that acts as game introduction and player guide, and in-game avatars (like Albert Einstein and Henrietta Leavitt) that can provide verbal answers to students' spoken questions. The artificial intelligence backing the scientist avatars includes learning manager software that guides student learning and provides assessments of progress in achieving pre-established learning goals. Four players cooperate in time travel adventures, exploring the human body, the Earth, and the Universe to find out what STARDUST is (atoms), how and when it was created (in the Big Bang and supernovae), how it got into Einstein, and from him to others (e.g., the carbon cycle). Excellent test results for the Phase I prototype game suggests a successful start at creating good player engagement.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in the development of a novel cost-effective 3D printing process to manufacture footwear. Currently most footwear is mass manufactured, typically overseas, using fixed molds that do not meet the specific needs of an individual. 3D printing of footwear offers the promise of providing individual customization tailored not just to fit, style, and colors, but also to individual biomechanics and/or medical needs. However, a number of technical challenges exist to make 3D printing of footwear sufficiently cost-effective that it can be provided beyond just a select few individuals. This project develops a novel and cost-effective 3D printing process to manufacture the critical components of footwear, using readily available and recyclable thermoplastic pellets. This novel 3D printing process will enable the manufacture of new, innovative footwear designs that cannot be made with any other manufacturing process. Additionally, it will make mass customization of footwear a reality, providing access to healthy customizable footwear for many individuals. Unlike traditional manufacturing processes currently being done overseas, this novel manufacturing technology is very amenable to implementing in the United States on a local level. Thus, this project will not only help move footwear manufacturing back to the United States, generating income for tax revenue, it will create entirely new clean, safe jobs in manufacturing. This project, led by a woman physician-scientist with a unique combination of expertise in both biomechanics and manufacturing, develops a novel and cost-effective 3D printing technology to print a proprietary mix of elastomeric material into a novel sole design that was developed on the basis of over twenty years of biomechanics research. The primary innovation that is being developed in this project is a specialized plasticizing screw-based extruder mounted on a 3D printer, specifically designed to make footwear, that uniquely and reliably extrudes a recyclable, thermo-elastomeric material that is most suitable for footwear, from its most cost-effective raw form: pellets. This project also develops a novel healthy and customizable sole design, based on the principal investigator's biomechanical research, which can only be made with this manufacturing technology innovation. Finally, this project develops a biomechanically research-based algorithm for customizing footwear made with this technology based on an individual's specific biomechanical profile and/or specific medical need. This project will allow for a novel, cost-effective manufacturing process where a bank of 3D printers operate simultaneously, each producing their own made-to-order pair of footwear and/or footwear components customized not only to fit but to an individual's specific biomechanical profile and/or medical need.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project was initiated as a direct result of extensive research into the US math crisis and the complexity of the problem. As a nation, we must invest resources directly into the breaking point: the mid school math cliff. The US shows the greatest decline worldwide from 4th to 10th grade on International tests in math. This project is designed to address all 146 Common Core State Standards (and all other state math standards) from 5th to 8th grade, providing a virtual reality context for each standard, embedded in an engaging, interactive 3-Act math story problem. The theoretical foundation of the project stems from Productive Failure, the concept that students perform better when they encounter productive failure prior to direct instruction in contrast to the reverse, where instruction is given first. Additionally, each simulator directly links student input to functional output to show how the math works, specifically allowing students to persist in exploring solutions. This project supports the NSF mission to support education for all fields fundamental to science and engineering, and holds the potential to positively impact a critical problem in U.S. education through broad commercial acceptance in schools throughout the US. This project is designed to provide simulations in a virtual reality context for all standards from 5th to 8th grade, using a core software platform for delivery that can be ubiquitously used in classrooms throughout the United States. This high-risk technical innovation uniquely embeds math content in such a way that input leads to functional output such that students can see how the math actually works. Students watch the outcomes of their solutions, both the successes and the failures so they can try again. Math problems have context and meaning. Students experience the direct results of their mathematical abilities, while teachers have the ability to deploy specific problems and receive real-time metrics to further respond and support student comprehension. Underlying the advanced classroom technology is the pedagogical framework based on Productive Failure and the intentional withholding of instruction and information prior to direct experience with grappling with a difficult problem with trial and error repetition. The goal of the research is to illustrate that math simulations show the highest achievement in comparison to other methodologies and that Productive Failure is a viable tenant of learning that can be applied to all fields supporting higher math applications and scientific discovery.",

Daylighting is a crucial piece of the green building puzzle. With the appropriate tools, daylighting is arguably one of the most cost-effective methods of achieving high performance buildings (and happier, healthier occupants) throughout the design process. World-wide green building is expected to double every three years. The world's green building market is a trillion-dollar industry, moreover, the green building materials market is expected to reach $234 billion by 2019. By 2018, green construction will directly contribute 1.1 million jobs and $75.6 billion in wages by 2018 in the United States. Between 2015 and 2018, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified buildings in the United States are estimated to have $1.2 billion in energy savings.

        "abstract": "Summary:The Phase I feasibility study proved the ability of the GrainGoat to replace a full-sized combine for the collection of grain for pre-harvest moisture testing with a potential savings to farmers and harvesters of $44M/day across the US during harvest season. The GrainGoat successfully harvested, threshed, and tested the moisture content in several crop varieties.Since the innovative GrainGoat is the only handheld machine that can harvest, thresh and moisture sample on the spot it is imperative that extensive educational outreach be performed. The GrainGoat is not a \"better\" mousetrap it is the \"only\" mousetrap whose existence must be made known to all in the grain industry around the world. Problem:Feedback from researchers testing the GrainGoat concluded the weight must be reduced prior to commercialization.Additionally, not every seed variety could pass through the current screen structure.Solution:Working with a design for manufacture engineer we confirmed changing the current aluminum parts to injected molded plastic would allow for a significant weight reduction, material cost reduction, number of parts reduction and assembly time reduction. Our goal is to reduce the weight by 50% or more. A new design for the screening process is currently underway.  While working with the University of Nebraska Agronomy Department it was determined that a variant of the current model could easily be constructed from the same parts allowing researcher use in greenhouses, headrows, and test plots.After this Phase II research we will design the GrainGoat U model for university and seed researchers.Goals:Phase II financing will cover the screen changes,new CAD drawings and part design changes including the necessary plastic molds for injection molded parts. After field trials on the new design, the GrainGoat will be ready to go into full production. Investors have committed financial support for Phase III.Anticipated Results:Changes in design and manufacturing will produce a lighter weight machine with lower cost of production, faster assembly and rapid production of custom screens. Additional crop types will be compatible with the machine (i.e. soybeans, field peas, beans, rice etc.). The device (after successful Phase II research) will allow farmers to quickly sample any field, any time, to monitor moisture. University seed breeders will harvest test plots without cross contamination of varieties. Small grain farmers (369,000) in the U.S. will benefit from our device, as will small-scale foreign farmers using hand-harvesting methods. A worldwide market will be created. Manufacturing in the U.S. will generate jobs in rural areas.",

PEF processing uses short, high voltage electrical pulses to break cellular membranes (also referred to as electroporation or cell lysing). PEF has been applied across a range of applications, from non-thermal pasteurization of juices to wastewater treatment, and has the potential to lower the cost of growing and processing algae significantly. The focus of this effort will be on lower cost extraction, and predator control during algal cultivation.The direct result will be higher yields and reduced costs for a broad range of algal products.",

        "abstract": "Currently, imported fire ants infest over 140 million hectares in the USA (it is a serious international pest as well) and cost Americans an estimated 6 billion dollars annually for control and to repair damage to agriculture, households, electric and communications, and several other economic sectors (Lard et al. 2006). Current control methods primarily target the household economic sector, which yields the highest profit margin. Control methods include toxic drenches, formulated granular contact insecticides, and baits. All give temporary relief from RIFA infestation, but baits are the environmentally responsible option because baits put much less Active Ingredient (AI) into the environment. Baits are effective because the fire antis efficient at finding retrieving, and distributing the AI to nestmates (Lofgren 1986).There are currently only a two baits available in the market. The AIs of the existing baits are oil soluble. The solvent is either corn or soybean oil, which also acts as a phagostimulant for the target ant. The AI/oil is absorbed into a corn grit product that simple mechanical spreaders can distribute (Williams 1983). By contrast, water soluble AIs are usually formulated as aqueous solutions with sucrose acting as the phagostimulant. The solution may be further formulated before it is put in a bait station that protects the bait from the environment, but allows access to the target ant. Besides borates there are few water soluble AIs formulated in a bait station and available to the public for use against fire ants or household ant pests. Fire ants cost the household economic sector $3.7 billion/yr (Lard et al. 2006). There is a need for new AIs that can be used in baits. Our water soluble biologically-based AI could fill the general public need for bait control of pest ants in and outside homes.RIFA function as opportunistic omnivores, e.g., tending aphids for honey dew, deform new-born livestock, and kill susceptable wildlife, ruining pick-your-own operations, and necessitating hay bale quarantines and fire ant free certification. Invasive red fire ants cause extensive agricultural losses in the areas afflicted. As such RIFA inhibit the growth of organic farming, farm-to-restaurant supply chains, pick-your-own and similar economic development models that can revitalize rural communities. Currently there is no effective organically certified bait treatment on the market to controlRIFA. Our project will produce a biologically-based, cost-effective bait method of control that will be of great use for home gardens, home lawns, pick-your-own farms, green houses and chicken raising facilities, and nurseries.",

        "abstract": "Floriculture and nursery crops represent one of the highest value-per-acre industries in the farm sector. Similar to food crops, ornamental crops are infected by many fungal and bacterial pathogens, resulting in substantial yield and quality losses. This project addresses stakeholder needs by developing a novel, low-risk disease management tool. This project will reduce the inappropriate application of synthetic pesticide chemicals, antibiotics, and environmentally accumulating metals, resulting in eco-friendly production, ensuring public and environmental health. This will increase the net profitability of all stakeholders along the production chain, including growers, distributors and retailers.TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) and our partners will optimize the novel oxidant chemistry for ornamental horticulture protection and microbial plant pathogen destruction. Utilizing the proof of concept data acquired in the Phase I effort, in Phase II we will optimize the formulation and acquire the data necessary to support its commercialization. Specifically, TDA will optimize the formulation, finalize commercial packaging and apply for outdoor use EPA registrations, perform extensive pathogen efficacy testing, application method testing and greenhouse extension work.TDA has developed a novel system to sustain the generation of a low but still highly effective level of oxidant over an extended time. This technology is ideally suited to treat plant surfaces to eliminate foliar plant pests that can cause catastrophic damage and economic loss. We have developed a formulation with biological efficacy just as good as commercially available copper based products; the best of the current systems. Independent testing by The IR-4 Project ornamental horticulture program has shown that our technology is better than numerous new and established technologies. We are developing this technology for use in the ornamental horticulture industry first because it has a faster regulatory path than food crops, this industry is large enough to support a business, and we hope this will allow us to gain acceptance and general use. We believe this technology is appropriate for both ornamental horticulture and food crops, once the product has established itself, we will work to expand its use against food crop plant pathogens.During the Phase II effort TDA will build on the Phase I proof of concept data. An optimized formulation will be identified with pest efficacy and phytotoxicity support data. A packaging and use rate procedure will be developed. This finalized product will be extensively evaluated against multiple pests. EPA registration for outdoor use against plant pathogens will be submitted. Application and extension performance data will be obtained. At the end of this Phase II project, this important new technology will have achieved regulatory approval, and have extensive performance data (both efficacy and phytotoxicity) to support its label and commercial use. TDA will begin commercializing the technology.Bacterial plant pathogens are particularly problematic because there are few pesticide products available to deal with them. Current bacterial disease management methods routinely apply copper-containing bactericides, but copper has a number of problems; copper resistant bacterial pests are becoming more common, copper leaves an undesirable residue on plant surfaces, and copper environmental contamination is a major concern. It is the long-term goal of this project to develop an alternative to copper and antibiotics based disease control, improving plant protection and reducing the environmental impact of accumulating heavy metal pesticides. This proposed work will develop a new bacterial and fungal pesticide management tool for ornamental horticulture applications.",

        "abstract": "This project is relevant to USDA&#39;s Strategic Goal to, \"Assist rural communities to create prosperity so they are self-sustaining, repopulating, and economically thriving\" (USDA, 2014). By creating solutions for rural affordable housing, entrepreneurship, and electric utility financial sustainability, the proposed work simultaneously addresses issues that USDA supports individually through the Rural Housing Service and the Rural Utility Service and aims to do so at greatly reduced overall program costs.Rural Kentucky is facing several urgent issues relevant to communities across the country--an energy-intensive housing stock, a rural electric utility system in transition, and job losses from a rapidly declining coal industry. Three million rural Americans living in pre-HUD code mobile homes spend an estimated $3.8 billion in energy bills every year and contribute to increased peak power demand. As coal-fired power plants are being retired at an unprecedented rate, rural electric co-operatives (REC), which serve 327 out of the 353 persistent poverty counties in the country, are struggling to keep power affordable while undertaking massive infrastructure upgrades. This project aims to develop an ultra-low energy home that is affordable across income brackets and capable of financing the replacement of old, energy-intensive mobile homes using energy savings, while reducing costs for RECs, their customers and industry.Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of: the home cost target, energy and peak power demand reductions of more than 85%, and an enabling rainscreen wall system using rapidly renewable materials. In Phase II, we further develop the BiomieTM construction system. Specifically, we will: develop a vertically-integrated home delivery method with stakeholder input; prototype and test structural panels and their means of connection; design and prototype manufacturing equipment for the system; and project the economics of the construction system and its impact on rural communities. The distributed manufacturing process using farm-sourced materials has the potential to contribute to farm income and create rural entrepreneurship opportunities while cost-effectively improving housing stock and supporting utility viability.",

        "abstract": "In an effort to development more robust optical system coatings DTRA, in collaboration with Sandia National Labs, is working to characterize the degradation of optical materials for space systems when exposed to high intensely EUV/ cold x-rays. The experiments utilizes the Double Eagle z-pinch facility which generates high current, high voltage arc pinch plasma to produce an intense EUV and cold x-ray radiation pulse for exposure of sample coating materials. During this generation process hypervelocity debris and plasma are ejected from the arc which can impact the target causing damage which confounds analysis of the targets radiation degradation. Accurate simulation of the Nuclear Weapon Effects (NWE) illumination requires extreme pinch power levels to achieve representative luminous intensity and beam energy. The relationship between the pinch power levels and the speed of the debris generated limits the luminous intensity that can be generated due to the production of debris that exceeds the stopping capability of currently implemented systems. The first and second generation shutter systems developed and tested in the Phase I SBIR Advanced Electromagnetic Shutter for Hypervelocity Debris Mitigation, demonstrated that it is possible to close a large aperture 57-65 mm in approximately 100 microseconds.",

The developed system is based on a novel design that utilizes a blend of POC-developed and commercial off-the-shelf components. As a result, REGINA offers position estimates similar to those of existing precision navigation systems, while being compact, lightweight, and inexpensive. In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of REGINA through extensive computer modeling and simulation, and combinations of laboratory and field tests of critical components.

Our \"biofeedback control of LED lights\" developed during Phase I is a method to determine how efficiently crops can use light to photosynthesize and grow. It has proven to determine crop-specific lighting requirements and to reduce energy consumption of 30% compared to non-controlled lights. Energy consumption by lighting systems in greenhouses can be as high as $230,000/ha/year and represent up to 30% of the value of the crops produced. The high cost associated with supplemental lighting poses a challenge for greenhouse growers trying to make a profit, while maintaining high yields and quality year-round. During Phase II we will develop and implement anAdaptive Lighting Control technology to bring the benefits of the biofeedback control of LED lights to the greenhouse industry. This is a high precision lighting control system capable to maintain lighting conditions required to sustain crop-specific optimum photosynthetic rates by augmenting natural sun light at reduced energy consumption. Our objective is to develop a technology platform for cloud-based lighting control systems which will continuously provide greenhouse growers integrated lighting solutions. Our goal is to provide greenhouse growers an economically beneficial supplemental lighting technology to increase their operation&#39;s profitability with a ROI in less than two years.

In phase 1 MBAI demonstrated feasibility of producing multiple high value co-products in a barley biorefinery.The current process uses barley to produce barley protein concentrate, BPC, with ethanol as a co-product. BPC has valuable markets as a protein ingredient in aquaculture feeds. However, the price of ethanol has declined. MBAI demonstrated proof of concept for integrating higher value co-products into the BPC process.Organic acids: In the current process yeast ferment sugars from the process to ethanol. MBAI demonstrated that fungal strains which produce lactic or fumaric acid from these sugars can replace yeast and integrated into the process while maintaining BPC protein concentrations. Organic acids have markets in food processing, animal feeds and as feedstocks for bio based plastics.Beta Glucan: In phase 1 MBAI developed a process for extracting and recovering beta glucan from barley used in the process without affecting BPC protein concentration or yield. Beta glucan markets include health foods, food processing, livestock feed and aquaculture.In Phase II MBAI will scale up the process in the existing BPC pilot plant to generate the data for integrating co-products into commercial BPC production and produce for market tests.Co-products will more than double co-product value ensuring the long-term economic viability of facilities which will create high wage jobs in rural areas and purchase specialty barley from growers at premium prices.",

Electrodynamic simulation is essential for computational prototyping in optical and radio-frequency devices. Current commercial solutions require significant upfront investment of both software and hardware. They also suffer from low productivity due to limited in-house computing resources. This project will develop a cloud-based simulation service which will provide on-demand, pay-per-use, virtually unlimited simulation capability without requiring users to purchase any hardware or software. This simulation technology will greatly improve productivity, reduce the barrier to entry, and minimize cost in the design of optical and radio-frequency applications. Moreover, it will serve multiple scientific and engineering disciplines and will facilitate the use of high-performance simulation in all phases of scientific discovery and engineering design. It will revolutionize large-scale scientific simulation and allow anyone with internet access to gain unprecedented simulation power. Ultimately, this technology will help accelerate research and development in the health, energy, and defense industries by offering intuitive, on-demand, and practically infinitely scalable scientific software to engineers and scientists at a price-point significantly lower than any other cloud computing service. There is currently no electromagnetic simulation software which performs efficiently in commercial clouds, because they were written under the assumption that the underlying computing platform is homogenous and has low inter-CPU communication time, i.e. low latency. Starting from the most fundamental level of space-time discretization, we will develop the first electrodynamic simulation software that is latency-tolerant and cloud-optimized. The work completed in Phase I developed several proof-of-concept cloud-based electrodynamic solvers and demonstrated that commercial cloud computing platform is a viable option for offering extremely low cost computing. The general solver to be developed in Phase II will serve a broad set of applications, and will be commercialized as the electromagnetic simulation service in the cloud, featuring a fully immersive web-based visualization interface.",

        "abstract": "The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will scale-up development of eco-friendly, cost-effective novel Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold (ENIG) surface finish with high corrosion resistance and robust solder joints for better reliability of electronic assemblies. Conventional ENIG currently available in the market is prone to black-pad defects (hyper-corrosion related failures) associated with de-wetting of solder. ENIG also suffers from brittle solder joint failures. Due to these reasons, there are field failures and reliability concerns of electronic assemblies - component disconnection which lead to overall malfunction of electronic assemblies. Moreover, most ENIG manufacturers/suppliers provide cyanide-based gold chemistry which has health and ecological hazards. The novel ENIG eliminates black pads- corrosion related issues, achieves robust solder joints and provides improved quality and reliability of electronic assembly. Also, it uses cyanide-free chemistry for immersion gold process making it eco-friendly. This allows manufacturers to consume eco-friendly product while avoiding major field failures and resulting consequences. This new technology would be potential replacement for existing ENIG (with market value roughly about 2-3 billion USD/year). The primary focus of the project is to eliminate black-pad related failures and lead to robust, high quality and reliable solder joints for electronic assemblies. The root cause of black-pad defects has been identified as hyper corrosion activity at gold and nickel-phosphorous interface which involves nickel depletion and an enrichment of phosphorous in localized areas. During Phase I, interfacial engineering approach had been used to successfully eliminate black pads by achieving marked improvement in corrosion resistance. This has led to robust solder joints and elimination of brittle failures. In Phase II, the focus will be to scale-up development, optimize the product/chemistries and carry out further reliability testing. The main goal would be the rapid commercialization of novel ENIG into the market. This will involve development of the chemistries/process parameters for replenishing solution to make it market ready, economical and efficient for customers, further chemical testing for quality compliance (shelf life, quality standards, etc.) as well as reliability testing. Reliability testing will involve real world scenarios and various industry standard based testing including drop and vibration tests and solder ball shear and pull tests at extended thermal exposures.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project, if successful, will be to demonstrate the potential of the technology to dramatically reduce the cost and risk currently associated with production of bio-based products, enabling ultra-low cost product development. The field of metabolic engineering historically has been limited in predicting the behavior of complex biological systems in vivo from simplified models and basic in vitro biochemical principles. In many cases, it has proven much more difficult than expected to integrate a well characterized production pathway into a living host and balance the complex requirements of both biomass growth and production. The technology under development is a first of its kind, truly scalable, high-throughput metabolic engineering platform enabling the rapid development of microbial production strains. This significant reduction in development cost enables the possibility to produce numerous specialty products that would otherwise not have acceptable internal return on development capital. This SBIR Phase II project will develop a high throughput metabolic engineering platform that enables the rapid development of microbial production strains. The platform, which bridges a gap between current in vivo and in vitro bio-production approaches, relies on the dynamic minimization of the active metabolic network in the context of a standardized two-stage bioprocess. Metabolic networks are highly interconnected wherein each metabolite and/or enzyme can interact with endless others. This combinatorial complexity results in a huge potential design space, which is intractable to the kinds of systematic experimentation required for the development of standardized design principles. The global challenges in addressing such a large biological design space have persisted, despite the dramatic advances in, and decreased costs of, reading and writing DNA, high-throughput DNA assembly, and microbial strain construction approaches. Dynamic metabolic network minimization not only results in a design space with greatly reduced complexity, but also provides strains that are robust to environmental conditions. Robustness leads to predictable scalability from high-throughput small-scale screens or \"microfermentations\" to fully instrumented bioreactors. This project will extend the validation of predictable strain performance from high-throughput microfermentation to pilot scale fermentation.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to revolutionize the efficiency of electric motors in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) market. The innovation technology area is a new class of electric motor and control hardware and software that is based on switched reluctance technology, exhibiting very high efficiencies of 90%+ across a broad range of speeds. This innovation will enhance scientific understanding by showing how this new class of electric motors can be optimized to minimize noise and vibration, while allowing variable speed control and Internet connectivity. The potential societal impacts of such a technology are significant: more than half the new motors purchased each year in the United States are 1-5 horsepower motors (1.024M of 1.792M), and they collectively account for nearly 25% of the United States electricity consumption. As such, if commercialized this technology could save retail and commercial organizations millions of dollars a year in electricity savings due to efficiency improvements. The benefits for an adoption rate of just 5% of available applications are $500M / year in electricity savings and 1M tons / year of carbon savings. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to research a new type of electric motor with a high rotor pole switched reluctance (HRSRM) design. This HRSRM motor has a simplified physical construction with no permanent magnets but complex electronics that manage the torque and speed in the motor through carefully timed generation of magnetic fields. This class of motors have proven extremely difficult to research because of highly nonlinear response characteristics, and sensitivity to very small changes in timing, electromagnetics, and physical setup. This project will research methods for adapting dynamic control algorithms to increase the speed and sensitivity of the power electronics to manage these characteristics. Research will also examine physical elements of the design and build a generalized simulation model combining both finite element analysis as well as structural modeling, constrained mode analysis and vibration models to reduce and optimize noise, vibration and harshness measures. Finally this project will optimize the ~600 key parameters associated with an HRSRM motor, allowing the rapid design and prototyping of new motor designs in minutes rather than months.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project, if successful, will be the development of a microbial process for the economical and sustainable production of a highly potent natural acaricide, which is a pesticide that kills mites and ticks. Increasing wariness of synthetic insecticides combined with the need to prevent tick-borne illnesses creates a tremendous opportunity for natural acaricides. The project's terpene target has long been known as a highly effective and safe acaricide; however, its commercialization has been hampered by a high cost of production. The aim is to develop an alternative manufacturing process for biosynthetic production enabling the cost reductions required to effectively penetrate the $1.6 B acaricide market. Because the target is GRAS and because it has been used extensively as a food ingredient for decades, there is a compelling safety benefit combined with its potent efficacy, which may spur increased spraying in public areas and private residences. Overall, this project will provide a new sustainable, cost-effective production route, thereby enabling acaricide commercialization. This SBIR Phase II project will lead to sustainable, scalable, and economical access to a highly potent natural acaricide. A commercial fermentation process will be developed by employing advanced metabolic engineering and protein engineering approaches for improving strain and enzyme performance. Achieving these production metrics will enable formulation and commercialization of various acaricidal products, including yard/area sprays, which will allow better control of tick populations and halt the spread of tick-borne diseases such as Lyme disease. In addition, this work will significantly advance the understanding of producing complex plant natural ingredients, thus providing economical and scalable commercial access to a wide array of compounds with significant potential benefit.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a platform technology for point of care (POC) detection of disease biomarkers present in low concentrations in bodily fluids. This technology can greatly impact the current standard medical workflow by reducing the time-to-results from days or weeks to 15 minutes, allowing for disease screenings during routine doctors visits supporting early diagnosis and improved treatment monitoring. It will promote preventative care, and therefore lead to improved treatment outcomes, patient satisfaction, and reduced healthcare costs. This technology will be incorporated into a portable, low-powered device that can be operated in-the-field, in low-resource settings in the US and internationally, supporting better healthcare monitoring that is often absent in under-served segments of society. The first target application is the detection of liver cancer, a disease that, when diagnosed late, has an extremely high mortality rate and cost of treatment. The proposed system may aid in the screening and early diagnosis of liver cancer. Furthermore, due to the technology?s inherent potential for multiplexing, it may be possible to simultaneous detect multiple biomarkers for chronic liver disease (Hep B, C, and cirrhosis), increasing its applicability to a global patient pool of over 500 million patients. Medicine is increasingly focused on personalized and preventative care and hence there is an increasing demand for diagnostic tools that can facilitate rapid screening, diagnosis, and treatment monitoring. Most current POC tests on the market are lateral flow based and do not target high sensitivity applications like cancer biomarkers, which require quantitative results and are present in low concentrations in blood. The goal of this Phase II project is to develop a standalone diagnostic system consisting of a portable reader and disposable cartridges to rapidly diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via the quantitative detection of AFP. During year 1, a 20-sensor very-high frequency (VHF) biochip will be designed and fabricated, simultaneously the whole blood processing component of the cartridge will be developed and integrated to form an all-inclusive cartridge. A distributed standalone electronic system will also designed and tested in year 1. Year 2 will involve the integration of the reader components to form a standalone system, additionally the all-inclusive cartridge will modified to interface with the reader allowing for plug and play operation. The performance of the integrated system will be evaluated via detection of HCC biomarkers in registry samples and comparison to the current standard of care.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will accelerate the adoption of data intensive precision agriculture, increasing yields while decreasing farm inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides. This project removes the software bottleneck (time and labor) in processing large aerial surveys taken by Unmanned Aerial Systems, enabling a cost-effective and timely process to deliver actionable information to farmers. Using frequent high-quality aerial scans, farmers may optimize the use of fertilizers and more finely control the amount of pesticides and herbicides necessary to increase crop yield. Furthermore, farmers mitigate costs and losses by being able to spot problem areas, minimize the spread of plant diseases, and identify issues such as standing water, irrigation malfunctions, and persistent automated machinery errors in planting or cultivation. This project provides special benefit for rural customers having inadequate internet infrastructure by eliminating the need to upload massive imagery to the cloud for processing. The technology is part of a broad initiative in agriculture addressing the need for large increases in food production by 2050 in response to the projected growth of the world?s population to over 9 Billion people. This project will continue development of algorithms for on-the-fly orthorectification, stitching, and normalization of aerial image mosaics and their deployment in an easy-to-use software prototype. The Phase I already demonstrated industry-leading speeds for such image processing. The technology behind this research project is designed from the ground up to process massive data with less memory and increased speed relative to other approaches, enabled by a proprietary streaming image representation, that allows multichannel gigapixel and terapixel images to be treated as ordinary images. This Phase II supports new extensions to the software that simplify and accelerate delivering a stitched and analyzed map, such as prioritizing computation in regions of the image that a customer is exploring. This would effectively eliminate the delay between image acquisition on unmanned aerial vehicles and when it can be used. Crop consultants have identified this as a transformative capability, as it enables ground-truthing information derived from aerial imagery in the same field visit, saving time and labor. The performance gains in compute-limited environments supported by this project are a key link between new capabilities to gather information and a farmer?s ability to utilize it to increase productivity while reducing costs.",

The recent FDA Veterinary Feed Directive will result in the use of antibiotics being phased out of livestock production. New technologies are needed to control pathogens in the absence of antibiotics. The goal of this technology is the reduction of pathogens in pre-harvest poultry, which may result in safer food and reduced foodborne illnesses. In addition, this technology may help reduce the amount of antibiotics used in poultry production, which has been cited as a major factor in the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This SBIR Phase II project will result in the development of novel antimicrobial technologies using probiotics engineered to produce antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small proteins with remarkable bactericidal properties. During Phase I, probiotics were built successfully and tested as AMP-delivery vehicles. Probiotics are bile-resistant microorganisms that can be provided to animals safely in their food or water. The antimicrobial probiotics will be used to test the reduction of pathogens in poultry guts. Pathogens in poultry guts are considered the major source of contamination of poultry meat during processing. The engineered probiotics will use synthetic DNA promoter regions that are designed to precisely control the delivery of AMPs at the site of infection. The impact will be examined in field trials of probiotics with controllable AMP delivery on poultry challenged by Salmonella enteritidis and Campylobacter jejuni, two common foodborne pathogens. Antimicrobial probiotics also will be tested against Clostridia perfringens, the causal agent of poultry necrotic enteritis, an illness that causes billions of dollars in productivity losses every year in the US.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and apply machine learning statistical tools to Internet of Things (IoT) water delivery and water quality sensors. This will enable prediction and preemptive response to water point failures. The resilience of these environmental services is dependent upon credible and continuous indicators of reliability, leveraged by funding agencies to incentivize performance among service providers. In many locations, these service providers are utilities providing access to clean water, safe sanitation, and reliable energy. However, in some rural areas, there remains a significant gap between the intent of service providers and the impacts measured over time. Achieving the SBIR Phase II core objectives will help close the loop on effective and clean water delivery. IoT sensors and services will address one of the most critical public health gaps by enabling delivery of reliable and safe water. IoT solutions for this environment may help address these information asymmetries and enable improved decisions and response. However, given the remote and power constrained environments and the high degree of variability between fixed infrastructure including age, materials, pipe diameters, power quality, rotating equipment vendors (pumps and generators), servicing, and functionality, any IOT solution would have to either be bespoke engineering, or compensate for these site-wise complexities through analytics. Instead, our SBIR II approach is to develop universal, solar powered cellular and satellite IOT hardware for each service type, and addresses site complexities through cloud-based sensor fusion and statistical learning. In this way, we significantly reduce hardware and logistical costs, and provide value to our customers through service delivery analytics. In Phase I, we demonstrated the application of simple sensors and sophisticated machine learning to identify off-nominal service delivery across a cohort of water pumps of various designs. We developed a universal electrical borehole sensor compatible with disparate fixed infrastructure, and we demonstrated solving the problem of heterogeneous customer hardware with a homogeneous sensor platform and adaptive machine learning backend.",

Such nano-structured surfaces can provide benefits for a wide array of commercial applications, ranging from consumer electronics to automotive and aerospace. These surfaces can save energy by preventing internal reflections in OLED displays and cover-glass reflections on the surface of solar panels. What?s more, these surfaces enable better use of available space by adding functionality to surfaces without adding any appreciable volume. Nanocoining is a low-temperature, chemical-free process that does not rely on chemical etching or nano-particles, which have recently come under scrutiny from the EPA because of unknown health and environment effects. The science contained within the project spans several disciplines, and Nanocoining would ultimately contribute to low-cost, scalable manufacturing for a wide array of industries. Ultrasonic Nanocoining enables low-cost, high volume reproduction of surface textures comprised of nano-structures that are smaller than the wavelength of visible light. This is done by creating a cylindrical mold with a nano-structured surface, then imprinting that mold into plastics using roll-to-roll processing. The objectives of the current project are to use Nanocoining to indent billions of sub-wavelength features into both flat and cylindrical Nickel-plated molds in a continuous pattern, then use these molds to replicate the structure into a variety of polymer materials using roll-to-roll processing. The research will study each step of the mold fabrication process, including focused ion beam machining of the diamond die, controlling a dual-mode ultrasonic resonant actuator and registering millions of indents side-by-side without leaving a significant seam between them. Replicated film surfaces will be tested for optical and wetting properties, and the final result will be functionalized transparent film samples that prove commercial potential. In the future the process may be used to create meter-scale nano-structured metal molds for production-scale imprinting.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a MicroElectroMechanical System (MEMS)-based radio transceiver providing a steep reduction in operating power for wireless data transmission in battery-powered devices. Conventional technology offerings for such radios are numerous, but with 10's of mW of power consumption they are unable to operate for long periods on batteries or scavenged power. If the low power radio promised by MEMS technology is realized, battery life of consumer products such as wireless headphones can be greatly extended, and battery size reduced, saving money and increasing convenience to the end user. With the spread of compact wearable and consumer devices, battery space is becoming increasingly at a premium, strongly incentivizing lower power electronics. As this technology matures, the expanding interconnection of devices (aka, the Internet of Things) offers yet greater potential. With rapidly expanding market adoption of wireless connectivity for sensing, control, and data collection, power consumption is becoming a major limiter in device deployment. If lower power transceivers are available, wired devices may be replaced by wireless and battery replacement cycles reduced or even done away with altogether, saving time and money, and paving the way to true interconnection of all things. The work of this Phase II SBIR project will focus on designing and verifying performance of the MEMS-based radios using fabrication processes suitable for mass production and commercial distribution. By combining MEMS technology with traditional circuit design, the proposed system will enable a 10x reduction in power consumption, low enough that these radios will allow extended operation on battery power alone. In the phase I project, the feasibility of the MEMS-based receiver was tested using resonators compatible with currently available MEMS foundry processes, and power consumption of the core radio-frequency transceiver components was verified at a low 300 mW. In phase II, these results will be expanded upon to add the additional transceiver components and software stack needed for a complete commercial product. The resultant design will be then transferred to the commercial foundry processes needed for mass production. The end goal of this project is to demonstrate a complete MEMS-based radio compatible with the widely-used Bluetooth Low-Energy protocol while operating on a total of only 2 mW in receive-mode.",

STEM fields are widely regarded as vital to a nation's economy, but a disconnect exists between the STEM knowledge and skills that students acquire in schools and those that they need to succeed in an increasingly global, technology-dependent workplace. Phase II research will enable development and testing of a video and peer review tool that will merge the core inquiry steps of successful scientists with state-of-the-art video proprietary technology, and allow collaboration between students and teachers located anywhere in the country. Commercialization of this technology will provide school districts with a needed educational tool to help teachers direct and assess STEM activities, and support students as they learn critical thinking skills and master STEM concepts, a mastery fundamental to successful careers in science and engineering. Encouraging the growth of students' STEM competency through this technology will encourage the growth of scientific innovations of the future, supporting domestic jobs and a strong financial tax foundation for our country's economic prosperity. The technical innovation in this SBIR project is an educational video software platform designed as a framework for STEM critical science inquiry, incorporating proprietary source code, student peer review, teacher assessment, analytics, a searchable database, and secure class-to-class video sharing. Each project requires that students work within a framework mirroring the best practices of professional scientists: Students organize concepts in terms of hypotheses, evidence, and analysis, and communicate their evidence-based projects to be peer reviewed. The secure video software platform is designed to be used within high schools and integrated into teachers' existing Learning Management Systems (LMS) to assess student progress. The goals and scope of the research are to develop the interactive video player source code that supports the educational framework and then demonstrate the results of this platform on student achievement utilizing a standardized achievement test. These goals will be accomplished through several tasks focused on software development to incorporate secure account creation, peer-review interactivity, and LMS integration, followed by demonstration of class-to-class connectivity of the platform.

        "abstract": "The last two decades have seen significant improvements to search and machine learning capabilities, but human-centered design of such systems has not kept pace. This is especially pronounced in domains where large data sets are handled, with applications built from a data-centric (how do we store this information), rather than user-centric (how is this information going to be used) standpoint. Conversely, the design of consumer software has made significant leaps forward, leading to a shift in user expectations that highlights the outmoded and archaic nature of the business tools.  Interestingly, the convergence can also be seen from the opposite direction: where in the past, one might have dealt with dozens or hundreds of documents, its now common for a laptop to hold tens of thousands. The result is that even consumers need tools with a level of sophistication previously relegated to professional domains. We propose that solving such information problems requires addressing them from both sides: first, that using millions of documents should be as simple and fluid as using a mobile app, and second, that such an application should readily handle new document sets, making it feasible for everyday use on thousands of documents on an everyday laptop.",

This research effort aims to develop high-fidelity anatomically accurate training models with embedded sensors suitable for evaluating pressure applied to a tissue and the location and depth of a cut as well as to monitor vascular occlusions. Incorporation of embedded sensors into anatomical training models will enable a much higher level of realism in training exercises, and provide quantitative data for a procedure. This data can be compared with a range of acceptable parameters of interest. This means lower cost of training due to less time required from surgeons to look over the students work as well better feedback. It will decrease the amount of time required in the operating room, reduce risk to the patient, lower operational costs, and increase training frequency for students. It also enables customized, patient specific pre-operation models for use in rare or specialized situations that are time critical with potential loss of life.",

The technology is a subvisible particle analyzer pioneered during Phase I. The technology is designed to fill two critical gaps in biopharmaceutical product development: (1) Scientists can count and image particles with current tools, but they cannot easily identify them which hampers their ability to minimize or eliminate them. (2) Early on in product development where sample volumes are extremely limited, particle analysis is rarely carried out, despite the desire to do so. This is because of the large volumerequirements and the slow nature of current techniques. The Horizon technology addresses these problems with a new imaging technique that can differentiate between important classes of particles. The analysis uses a tenth the volume of current techniques, is at least 10 times faster and is fully automated. The proposed research will involve internal validation followed by a multi-site study to show robustness and demonstrate the utility of the technique on real pharmaceutical samples at GSK. Horizon will speed up biopharma product development time and improve the quality and safety of biotherapeutics by enabling routine particle identification.",

Stress exerted by silicon nitride induces second-order nonlinear susceptibility c(2) on underlying centro-symmetric silicon. NIR light is coupled into silicon and MIR light is coupled out of silicon using sub-wavelength grating couplers respectively. Phase 1 research showed feasibility of low fiber insertion loss and low propagation loss silicon waveguides on the silicon-on-insulator platform at NIR pump and signal and MIR idler wavelengths. Quasi phase matching (QPM) will be employed with periodically patterned strained silicon nitride induced c(2) to generate efficient DFG. Preliminary QPM designs indicates potential to achieve conversion efficiency 11.67%W-1 in periodic tensile strained and 47.15%W-1 in periodic tensile and compressive strained silicon nitride with c(2) ~ 40pm/V in a silicon waveguide of effective length 1.3cm. Periodic DC electric field induced c(2) effects will also be studied. Two-photon absorption (TPA) and particularly TPA induced MIR free carrier absorption will be controlled by experimentally demonstrated p-i-n geometries that reduce silicon free carrier lifetime from nano-seconds to picoseconds. The DFG source will be integrated with previously demonstrated silicon based slotted slow light absorbance sensor for commercialization success.",

Recent advanced materials developments have driven increased use of In Situ Chemical Reduction (ISCR) remediation in the US and globally. Nanoscale Zero Valent Iron (NZVI) holds great potential for ISCR due to its low cost and high capacity for degrading halogenated compounds. However, two major technical challenges prevent wide-spread NZVI adoption: 1) agglomeration, which prevents transport in the subsurface; and 2) passivation, which decreases reactivity to contaminants. During a NIST Phase I program, AxNano, in collaboration with University of Arkansas, proved the feasibility of a novel, three-component composite composed of bimetallic NZVI on a carbon-based substrate (RemRxTM CSI) for in situ remediation of trichloroethylene. RemRxTM CSI achieved 10x greater transport than NZVI particles alone, and 4x greater transport than NZVI particles on activated carbon. Removal of TCE by the RemRxTM CSI was 30% greater than by the NZVI particles alone. Having proven feasibility in a laboratory setting, Phase II will focus on prototyping, scale-up manufacturing and pilot scale field testing of RemRxTM CSI. This SBIR program will produce a novel, low-cost remediation with broad-spectrum efficacy to meet market and society needs.",

This system identifies parts in 2D or 3D images and determines their six degree-of-freedom poses, producing a full description of a scene in a fraction of a second. For this technology to be practically useful in manufacturing, thresholds of accuracy and reliability must be met, and perceptual inferences must be integrated with robust manipulator actions. In Phase II, Symbio will develop our system into a practical, complete sensory picking solution. The keys to executing this plan will be integration of information across multiple sensors and multiple images, learned grasp and motion planning, and new methods of robotic data collection. Building a multi-robot testbed will enable rapid iteration and real-world image and haptic data acquisition.",

        "abstract": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus first appeared in the United States of America in the late 1980&#39;s and causes a disease characterized by reproductive failure in sows and significant respiratory distress in growing and finishing swine. Being a major economic problem for the pork industry, the National Pork Board (NPB) considers the control and elimination of PRRS virus from swine commercial herds a top priority. Convincing evidence of the need for new tools to combat PRRS is best illustrated by the significant increase in the prevalence of PRRS in U.S. swine population over the last several years. At present, more than 70% of the swine-herds in the U.S are infected with North American type (genotype 2) PRRS virus, causing economic loses of over $664 million annually, making it the costliest disease to the pork industry. The steady increase in the incidence of PRRS occurred despite the introduction of at least three commercial modified live vaccines for PRRS virus to the U. S. market. These vaccines provide protective immunity for PRRS virus strains that are highly homologous but limited protection against genetically divergent strains. This concept has its foundation on the fact that the genome of PRRS virus in the field is highly diverse and is constantly undergoing a high rate of mutation. Thus, the difficulty of generating PRRS vaccines that have a high level of genetically homology to a given field virus resides in the fact that fully licensed vaccines, based on either modified live or killed viruses requires several years of development followed by a few more years of regulatory testing to be approved for sale by the USDA. Thus, by the time a vaccine is approved and released for commercial use, its genome, and its composition, has become antiquated due to the genetic diversification of the myriad of field virus variants whose genome have substantially evolved over time by mutation. In addition, their use presents some risks including the shedding of vaccine virus, which infects non-vaccinated pigs, persistent viral infection and the potential of reversion of the attenuated vaccine to its original wild-type virulent phenotype.As a rational approach to solve the problem of the high antigenic diversity exhibited by PRRS virus in the field, which makes the development of an effective vaccine difficult, the aim of this phase II project is to complete our studies aimed at ascertaining the technical feasibility of developing an effective autogenous (killed virus) vaccine for PRRS. Based on the results obtained in Phase I, our approach for identifying an efficacious autogenous vaccine is to use modern technologies to formulate vaccines that will be delivered via the respiratory mucosa. Autogenous biologics are custom inactivated vaccines consisting of herd specific antigens derived from a pathogen isolated from the same herd that will be immunized. Because the pathogens constituting this type of product are inactivated (killed) they are considered safe. Autogenous vaccines are prepared using a virus isolated from animal(s) of an infected herd, to be used in the herd of origin, thus, the viral antigens contained in the vaccine will perfectly match the viral antigens expressed by the virus that is causing disease. Importantly, the USDA Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) approves the use of autogenous products only when commercially licensed product are not available, or when commercially licensed products have not provided adequate protection, as is the case with PRRSV vaccines. Aptimmune has identified a significant need for an effective autogenous PRRS vaccine, by designing a vaccine specifically formulated for newborn piglets, we are aiming to position our product in this underserved market. Our product is being designed to be delivered via the respiratory mucosa to stimulate immunity at the point of virus entry. This feature will also negate the possibility of the vaccine antigen being blocked",

        "abstract": "Stony Creek Colors sells clean and safe natural dyes to the textile and fashion industries, allowing its customers to offer environmentally conscious premium products. Through its flagship natural indigo product, the company has developed and proven a complete agricultural supply chain to replace synthetic dyes with plant-based drop-in solutions. Innovations across the complete crop and processing value chain allow Stony Creek to sustainably produce plant-based dyes with full transparency and authenticity, meeting the technical performance and volume requirements of textile mills and fashion brands worldwide without compromising product integrity. A guaranteed take-off agreement with a leading global denim mill partner ensures the company&#39;s bio-based dyes are in demand, and the naturally dyed denim resulting from this effort is currently being used in premier brands. Stony Creek Colors has demonstrated the commercial viability of the natural indigo supply chain having significantly scaled its operations in 2016, and it is now identifying and executing upon efficiencies made evident in the plant genetics, agricultural operations, and chemical processing activities. Through this NIFA/USDA-funded research effort, Stony Creek Colors is working to optimize the agricultural and industrial natural indigo supply chain by identifying, establishing, and refining scalable and efficient methods of indigo crop production and factory extraction which will allow bio-based indigo the opportunity to compete more closely with its synthetically manufactured counterpart.Natural indigo was once a driver of the world economy, with plantations existing across the globe which grew, cultivated, harvested and processed indigo crops into blue indigo dye. This was usually done through a multi-step but industrially simple and environmentally low-impact process. Following the discovery of a synthetic pathway to indigo dye at the turn of the 20th century, this agricultural crop and its bio-based dye product were quickly supplanted by a commodity industrial chemical synthesized from coal tar and petroleum derivatives. The textile dyeing and finishing industry is now responsible for 17% of industrial water pollution worldwide, and after the turn of the 21st century, consumers are becoming increasingly conscious of the impact of their personal choices allowing socially and environmentally sustainable products to take market share. Major fashion brands like Levi&#39;s &amp; Nike are now making purchasing decisions based on the full environmental and life cycle impact of their products, with a commitment to reduce hazardous chemical use to zero by 2020. Natural indigo is an obvious entry into this new market opportunity, representing a known story that once defined the denim jeans market. The incorporation of natural indigo into an existing brand or line of clothing represents a low-cost differentiator with significant customer resonance allowing for higher margins for mills and brands. However, as an agricultural crop and specialty bio-based product, consistent, reliable, and sizeable sources for natural indigo dye no longer exist in the global marketplace. Natural indigo dye and its parent agricultural crop have missed out on over 100 years of development in chemistry, chemical engineering, and agricultural science. Stony Creek Colors has applied advancement, innovations, and know-how in modern chemistry to develop and validate a proprietary, safe, high-yielding, and chemically benign extraction process for converting indigo crop biomass into high-value, high-consistency natural indigo dye. The company has further developed a network of small- and medium-sized farmers in the Northern Middle Tennessee area to successfully grow indigo as a transplant-crop using tobacco growing assets. Stony Creek Colors scaled this structure in 2016 to 26 acres of indigo production crop and 10,000 sqft of factory production.Phase I of this NIFA/USDA-funded SBIR project ser",

        "abstract": "ISCA Technologies proposes to further develop and optimize SPB REPEL, an innovative solution to control the southern pine beetle (SPB), Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmerman, the most destructive pest of southern yellow pine species. SPB is a tremendous problem across southeastern North America, and is expanding its range northwards. SPB causes high levels of tree mortality, especially during population outbreaks like the one that occurred from 1999-2003. During this period, SPB killed &gt;1 million acres of trees, causing large amounts of tree mortality in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee, with estimated economic costs of &gt;$1.5 billion. Such extensive tree mortality can deplete timber supplies, adversely affect levels and distributions of stocking, disrupt management planning and operations, and increase potential for forest fires by adding an abundance of dead, dry timber to available fuels. Current tactics for managing SPB are limited, primarily consisting of strategic tree removals (thinning), prescribed fires, and in some states the use of registered insecticide to protect individual high-value trees. The coordination of SPB individuals to colonize an individual pine tree is almost entirely semiochemically mediated. We propose to explore this aspect of SPB chemical ecology to develop more effective, and environmentally safe management tools to protect pine trees. ISCA researchers along with collaborators from the USDA Forest Service have been studying the chemical ecology of Dendroctonus spp. and have discovered that treatments using various isomers of the anti-aggregation pheromone, verbenone, effectively disrupt the beetles&#39; orientation and host-finding behavior, disabling the semiochemical coordination of mass attacks and providing effective protection of treated trees. ISCA has developed racemic verbenone formulations in recent years that have proven effective at disrupting mass attacks by several species of bark beetles. Still, none of these formulations have proven completely effective in protecting southern pine trees from SPB attack.Building on research indicating that (+)-verbenone, a notoriously difficult-to-synthesize and expensive isomer, can repel SPB more effectively than (-)-verbenone, ISCA seeks to develop an SPB repellent formulation, SPB REPEL, using the (+) isomer of verbenone, an innovation that heretofore has not been commercially viable.??",

        "abstract": "VRM Labs is seeking commercialization of a proprietary technology that allows preparation of a novel natural and biodegradable flocculant. Flocculants are substances, which destabilize colloidal suspensions and promote the clumping and settling of the suspended particles.Among the most important applications of flocculants is treatment of agricultural wastewaters, such as the wastewaters generated in livestock slaughter and processing plants, rendering plants, etc. Flocculants are also directly applied to soil to prevent erosion in agricultural and construction areas. Most of the currently used flocculants are synthetic and their application in large scale agriculturally-related processes is becoming a growing concern for consumers, public, and regulatory entities due to their lack of biodegradability and potential toxicity of accumulated contaminants. Successful development of a highly efficient biodegradable flocculant will help to address these concerns and provide an environmentally friendly way for treatment of wastewaters generated in agricultural processes.Successful development of a highly efficient biodegradable flocculant will lead to improved methods for reuse of wastewater because currently available methods rely primarily on the use of potentially harmful synthetic flocculants.Flocculants are widely used in agriculture for clarifying livestock slaughter and rendering waste liquids and in many other applications throughout agriculture, mining, and construction. The flocculants of choice by the livestock and rendering industries are often synthetic polymers, most commonly derivatives of polyacrylamide (PAM).While these synthetic flocculants are attractive due to their high effectiveness and low cost, there is growing concern about the environmental and health impacts of these substances. Consequently, much attention, both in industry and in academia, is currently paid to the development of bio-based alternatives to synthetic polymer flocculants.Dr. Garcia and co-workers, from a USDA/ARS lab, recently discovered that hemoglobin can function as a powerful biodegradable flocculant suitable for wastewater recovery.The long-term goal of this work is to develop and commercialize a cost-efficient biodegradable hemoglobin-based flocculant. During the Phase I stage we demonstrated the proof-of-concept and developed a lab-scale prototype, which was found to be an efficient flocculant with both laboratory models and real-life industrial wastewaters. We also performed market research, which resulted in favorable assessment of the feasibility of successful commercialization of this USDA-owned technology. The objective of the proposed Phase II work is the development of a scaled up process for manufacturing of our flocculant and its detailed large scale testing at industrial wastewater treatment facilities.The following Specific Aims are proposed to achieve these goals: 1) Lab-scale optimization of the manufacturing process to achieve the most cost-effective formulation; 2) Detailed small scale efficacy studies (jar testing) at several industrial settings with the emphasis on post-treatment wastewater quality; 3) Scaling up of the manufacturing process; and 4) Large-scale testing of our flocculant at rendering wastewater treatment facilities. VRM Labs team will be responsible for manufacturing of the flocculant, scaling up and testing in industrial settings and ARS team will be responsible for detailed studies of performance of our flocculant in laboratory setting.",

        "abstract": "The product being commercialized is a system for optimizing spray system performance on agrochemical application aircraft, commonly known as \"crop dusters\". Current technology allows applicators to precisely control their location and flight path (GPS guidance), to deal with changing temperature, humidity and wind conditions (Aircraft Integrated Meteorological Measurement System modules), and to control important properties of their chemical mixes. However, it does not allow them to monitor and control a key application parameter, spray droplet size. If the droplets are too small, they drift to unintended locations; if they are too large, plant coverage is poor.The EPA estimates that chemical drift losses exceed $200M annually. Drift litigation claims are also a multi-million-dollar annual cost. Crop loss, environmental damage, and human health costs are other significant impacts of poor droplet size control.This program will provide the missing link: real-time, in-flight, droplet size feedback. It will enable applicators to adjust system pressure and airspeed, in flight, to achieve the desired droplet spectrum. It will allow them to verify the effectiveness of between flight changes such as nozzle settings and chemical mixes. They can now \"close the loop\" on the key droplet size parameter. Automation of the control process may be possible in future product versions.The savings achieved in chemicals, time, litigation avoidance, and flexibility in optimizing chemical mixes will afford a payback time of less than one year. The product will be sold as an add-on to new systems or as a retrofit to existing systems. It will not impact the design, usage, or cost of other spray system and aircraft components.It will open a $25M market, in the U.S. alone, for our product distributor, Transland LLC. It will provide an opportunity for Innovative Scientific Solutions, Inc. (ISSI) to double our current annual commercial sales, with a projected gross annual revenue of $1.3M.

        "abstract": "Our goal is to commercialize the largemouth bass fingerling production system/strategy that was proven effective through our Phase 1 project. This system employs \"out-of-season\" fall spawning followed by winter feed-training and the on-growing of advanced fingerlings indoors. In Phase 1 we developed broodstock acclimation facilities and protocols for out-of-season spawning in raceways. We showed that broodstock conditioned in our recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) outperformed those conditioned in existing flow-through raceways. We also developed a RAS for culturing fingerlings during the winter months and documented the improved growth and economics. An in-depth analysis showed improved economic feasibility of this new strategy over traditional fingerling production methods. We are now ready to implement this strategy on a commercial scale. Our first objective will be to purchase and install the appropriate RAS components to meet at least 50% of our overall fingerling production goals. Other objectives include: improving brooder acclimation, completing an in-depth economic analysis, and generating bi-lingual staff training materials and SOPs for bass fingerling culture in RAS. Full scale commercialization of this production system/strategy will decrease the time and pond space required to produce fingerling bass, improve fingerling production economics, and would subsequently free up more pond space for the production of food-sized largemouth bass. The proposed project would significantly improve our overall farm production efficiency and is necessary to increase the overall sustainability of largemouth bass food fish production.",

Foods are maintained in their natural state for weeks with the same taste, texture, nutrition, and moisture content they had before being supercooled. This technology offers a radically new food preservation method for consumers and the commercial food industry. The goal of the proposed Phase II project is to develop commercially viable supercooling units for technology demonstration and licensing negotiation with interested partners, including major home appliance manufacturers. In conventional refrigerators food items are frozen among ice crystals and their quality is compromised once they are thawed. Supercooling involves cooling of biological samples below a phase transition temperature in a balanced state leading to prevention of their cellular activity. In this supercooled state, damage by freezing such as protein denaturation and cellular structure injuries can be avoided. The proposed research work plan includes improvement of the supercooling stability regardless of any interfering environmental variants and the consistency with diverse perishable materials when the invention is scaled up for commercialization. Our primary strategy is to continue development and optimization of our currently working prototype, with the initial goal of producing prosumer-oriented appliances such as a stand-alone supercooling unit similar to a freezer while seeking licensing agreements to generate cash flow. Once this product line and revenue stream has been established, we can develop further applications for the commercial food industry, leading to the evolution of the food cold chain system.",

In Phase I we proved the efficacy of our H1N1 and H1N2 vaccine candidates in swine and built a H3N2 vaccine candidate based on a field-relevant strain which we plan to further test in a trivalent formulation during Phase II. Our technology, termed Synthetic Attenuated Virus Engineering (SAVE), recodes the viral genome to have a \"de-optimized\" level of translation of viral proteins in the host cell. This deoptimization is achieved via hundred of genetically stable silent mutations, that retain 100% identity to the wildtype protein sequence. SAVE was first applied to poliovirus (Coleman Science 2008), but has now been validated in seven distinct viral targets including influenza (Mueller Nature Biotech. 2010) which has progressed to Phase I clinical trials. SAVE-deoptimized vaccine strains are avirulent while preserving highly immunogenic properties at low doses since they are antigenically identical to the parental wild type strain. The swine industry is &gt;$100B globally and an SIV outbreak has the potential to dramatically reduced the commercial output of this industry by lowering swine weights and leading to mortality. A rapidly deployable, broadly reactive SIV vaccine is needed to safeguard this industry from the clear negative impact SIV could have each season or in an outbreak. This is best accomplished with a live attenuated vaccine.",

        "abstract": "Each year over 1 billion tons of animal manure is produced in US and it can be a pollution source if not handled properly. \"Anaerobic digestion\" is an energy efficient way to dispose manure. Through this process manure is converted to biogas and digestate. The manure digestate can be used as fertilizer. Biogas is a mixture of ~60% CH4, ~40% CO2 and trace amounts of contaminant gasses such as H2S. If the non-methane components can be removed from biogas, biogas will be chemically identical to natural gas, greatly increasing the value of the anaerobic digestion. A solution to upgrade raw biogas (remove CO2, H2S and H2O) is much needed to improve the economics of this conversion from manure to biofuels and valuable bioproducts.Compact Membrane Systems is proposing a membrane separation technology which can efficiently upgrade biogas to biomethane. The Phase I program has been very successful. We have developed membranes with very high CO2 flux and very high selectivity. These membranes have shown excellent resistance to high concentration H2S biogas. Economic analysis shows at least 37% savings compared with conventional natural gas membrane separation. In Phase II we will optimize/scale up the biogas membranes/modules, and design/build pilot membrane systems. Field tests will be conducted on farms.We expect this technology will promote the use of anaerobic digestion to treat manure for biogas production. This will result in less pollution from manure, less greenhouse gas emission from manure degradation, more renewable energy from biogas production, and more jobs in rural areas. .",

        "abstract": "A fundamental goal in agriculture is achieving higher yields per acre, in conjunction with similar or lower inputs, for higher profitability and more sustainable use of resources. To achieve higher yields, plants need to be more energy efficient to complement the trend towards breeding and farming at higher plant densities. To date biotechnology has been very successful at weed and insect control products, but has not made much progress on developing more energy efficient plants due to the complex interactions of the many proteins and metabolic pathways involved. The large numbers of genes needed to improve complex traits affecting yield is beyond biotechnologies current capabilities. Our epigenetic technology provides a very different method to affect the expression of many genes in a useful and natural manner. Surprisingly, this epigenetic technology can be implemented without any changes in the DNA sequence of the plant.One of the fundamental biological processes increasing plant productivity is heterosis (increased yields from hybrid progeny relative to the yields of the parent plants), with hybrid corn as one of the most successful commercial examples. Although heterosis is phenotypically defined, its molecular basis is still debated and unproven. Our epigenetic technology phenotypically meets the definition of heterosis by increasing yields in progeny. Our working hypothesis is that epigenetics is an aspect of heterosis that has not been previously separable from genetics due to their concurrence on chromosomes. It is only with the ability to independently manipulate the epigenome in a biologically useful manner without changing DNA sequences that the role of the epigenome becomes apparent. Our proposal will advance our understanding of how epigenetics affects crop performance in field trials.Specifically in this proposal, we will develop improved methods for creating, identifying, and breeding epigenetic modifications for producing higher yielding tomato plants.The knowledge gained will advance our ability to manipulate the epigenome for increased yields in agriculture in multiple crops. A broad impact across multiple crops is supported by our findings of epigenetic-mediated yield increases in representative species in the Brassicaceae (mustards), Solanaceae [vegetables], Gramineae (cereals), and Leguminosae (beans), thereby providing examples in these important crops inboth dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plant examples.Epigenetics is the collective physical status of chromosomes including their chromosomal proteins and their posttranslational modifications, structural RNA, and DNA methylation components that affect transcription and splicing. The term &#39;epigenetics&#39; is often used to refer to cellular and developmental chromosomal events during a life cycle of an organism as well as transgenerational transmission of this &#39;non-DNA sequence&#39; information, with DNA methylation being the most studied aspect. In this proposal we are focused on the transgenerational aspect of epigenetics and use the term &#39;epigenetics&#39; in that context.A second feature of our epigenetic system is that it appears to require proceeding through one or more sexual reproduction steps. Meiosis appears to be a developmental stage at which epigenetic reprogramming occurs and at which decisions are made for which epigenetic modifications will be inherited.In particular, CHH methylation is partially removed and reprogramed via an elegant vegetative nucleus mechanism that transfers small RNAs from the vegetative cell to the sperm cell of the pollen to reestablish CHH methylation. CG and CHG methylation is predominantly maintained during meiosis and inherited in the progeny of plants.",

        "abstract": "With this research, we would like to provide new materials joining methods to the DOT. This will be achieved with a pulse energy store that has already demonstrated game changing capability in welding a wide variety of metals and alloys. The process we are proposing is known as Homopolar Welding. The weld is created by a solid state fusion welding process whereby high current is passed through the weld interface until the metal reaches forging temperature and then an upset force is applied to the weld interface to complete the process. Some of the steels welded with this process are API 5L Grade X52 X60, and X65. Although they are pipeline steel, they meet the requirements of high performance steel and give confidence that bridge steel will also be welded with good results with this process. Typical test results analyzed from welds of the Nippon X65 series material include tensile yield strengths between 71 and 81 ksi with ductile fracture location predominantly in the parent material. In Charpy V notch testing, a mean value of 91 ft-lb was recorded.",

        "abstract": "The Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (TALOS) program presents an opportunity to provide Special Operators with unique capabilities to achieve increased situational awareness, lethality, and human performance.  In current and future iterations of the TALOS system, a base layer system with integrated physiological monitoring equipment provides insight into Operator health and performance status, along with inputs to guide exoskeleton movement.  While the physiological sensors incorporated into the TALOS base layer provide meaningful vital sign data to individual Operators, team leaders and commanders, raw data streams can only provide so much insight into the state and readiness of an Operator. Data from existing TALOS base layer sensors, when combined with individualized, contextual, dynamic, and validated algorithms, can provide significant information on Operator state and readiness  information that can predict Operator performance, inform decision making, adapt suit functions to Operator needs, and ultimately improve survivability.  In the current effort, Design Interactive will advance the development of the TALOS base layer system and visual augmentation system (VAS) by: integrating our stress algorithms into the TALOS system; developing approaches to present visual information to the Operator; and support testing of integrated components in relevant environments.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this project is to continue the success of our Phase I proof-of-concept work by implementing a full-scale, algal-based treatment system to remove nutrients (such as nitrogen and phosphorus) from wastewater in small rural communities and to produce a pelletized, slow-release algal fertilizer as a value-added byproduct.Problem/Opportunity:Nutrient pollution in our nation&#39;s waterways is a major issue. These nutrients, which stem mainly from municipalities and agriculture, are causing environmental problems such as fish kills and toxic cyanobacteria blooms. To address this issue, state and federal agencies are enforcing stricter nutrient discharge limits for municipalities. These regulations result in a growing need for improved technologies such as our algal system (especially in rural communities). Furthermore, the current methods for generating fertilizer are not sustainable and are energy-intensive. New biobased fertilizer options are desired, and the algal-based fertilizer developed in this project addresses that need.Project Objectives:This Phase II SBIR is designed to produce and collect the remaining data needed to prove to our customers (rural communities) and their professional advisers that our process is reliable, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly. The major objectives of this project are to (1) build and evaluate a full-scale algal treatment system, (2) determine the best method to process algae into a saleable pelletized fertilizer, (3) evaluate the algae fertilizer in plant-growth studies, and (4) conduct an economic and life-cycle analysis of our proprietary algal treatment to fertilizer process. Following this Phase II project, our process will be ready for commercial deployment.",

In Phase II, POC will optimize the antenna design for RF performance, SWaP requirements, and environmental capability, and will develop a full-scale prototype system for validation of hardness, reliability, and performance in a simulated environment to verify theoretical design assumptions. The final report will incorporate a detailed performance analysis of the experiment and an initial design of an engineering development model, to be delivered along with the prototype.

        "abstract": "Enig Associates, Inc. (ENIG) proposes to accurately assess the design space of munitions containing reactive material structures (RMS) components by comparing their penetration, detonation and combustion effects to conventional weapon systems. Recent advances in energetic materials have produced RMS that enable smaller and more capable warheads. However, warhead developers are reluctant to incorporate these advanced materials into their designs, as they do not know how they will affect the trade space. Current models of target-effects do not adequately take into account the full extent of damage delivered using RMS components. Though the use of multi-scale, multi-disciplinary modeling tools ENIG will (i) identify the dominant chemical reaction modes, (ii) extend the existing reaction rate model towards the deflagration of a metal/metal mixture, (iii) demonstrate our hydrodynamic approach to examine multi-phase flow, and (iv) design an experimental approach to validate our developed models. The modeling tools from this program may further be applied to a wide variety of materials, including glass fiber composites, novel structural composites, and complex ceramic systems. The ability to reliably predict damage in extreme environments can dramatically reduce the design cycle allowing for more rapid fielding of high performance materials.",

        "abstract": "This proposal outlines a large-format small-pitch low-power digital pixel readout integrated circuit (DPROIC) for dual-band infrared focal plane arrays to achieve high sensitivity, high resolution, large dynamic range, low noise, large field of view and fast data rate. This digital pixel readout will be a complete camera-on-chip architecture when combined with single or dual polarity dual band detectors in a hybrid fashion. It will have a wide operating temperature range from cryogenic to room temperature to support a broad range of detector architectures. This readout circuit will also be radiation tolerant to survive harsh man-made and natural radiation environments, including high energy particles and photons to prevent catastrophic system failure. The proposed DPROIC will be implemented in a mature complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process with much more reasonable mask costs as compared to that of state-of-the-art line width processes, saving the government money and broadening the possible supplier base. The final product will be flexible enough to be used as a generic readout integrated circuit for a broad range of missile defense applications.

        "abstract": "Accelerator magnets that are currently being used in high-energy physics experiments are limited to a maximum magnetic field of less than 20 T because superconductivity in the low- temperature superconductors from which the magnets are constructed breaks down at higher fields. The next generation of accelerator magnets needs to be made from high-temperature superconducting magnet cables. Such cables with sufficient performance are unavailable. This proposal seeks to develop high-temperature superconducting CORC\u00ae magnet wires that would enable the next generation of accelerator magnets that operate at 20 T and above. They will be tailored for use in canted cosine theta accelerator magnets, which is a design in which the stresses on the conductor are effectively managed to a safe level for the conductor. During Phase I of the program, we\u2019ve demonstrated the feasibility of winding CORC\u00ae wires with a high current density into canted cosine theta magnet structures and demonstrated the their performance didn\u2019t degrade significantly when bent to a diameter of less than 40 mm. During Phase II of the program, we will develop commercial high performance CORC\u00ae wires to enable canted cosine theta insert magnets that can operate inside an outsert made from low temperature superconductors, with the goal to increase the total magnetic field to at least 20 T. The CORC\u00ae wire performance will be increased to 600 A/mm2 at 20 T, while their flexibility is improved to allow bending diameters of less than 30 mm. Several prototype subscale canted cosine theta insert magnets will be constructed and tested during Phase II of the program. High-temperature superconducting magnet wires that have a high current density at 20 T, while being bendable to diameters less than 30 mm, will enable some of the next generation of high- energy physics magnets, proton cancer treatment facilities, practical fusion magnets, and scientific magnets. These magnets will also benefit superconducting magnetic energy storage systems for use in the power grid and for application within the Department of Defense.

        "abstract": "A spray vacuum freezing desalination process is proposed to meet the required seawater desalination cost, with water subcooling suppression at freezing. Both the energy consumption of the proposed desalination method and the cost of water are lower than that of state-of-the- art technology, and the system can be driven by either electricity or low grade thermal energy. The major energy-consuming process, i.e. the vapor pumping, can be satisfied with low-quality thermal energy such as solar thermal energy. To decrease the energy need in vapor compression, nucleating agents is used to suppress subcooling of freezing the sprayed seawater droplets, so that the pressure of vapor generated in the triple point desalination process can be elevated and less pumping power is needed for transferring the vapor to condenser. The Phase II work will focus on building and testing sub-scale prototype of the spray vacuum freezing desalination system, since the Phase I work has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed concept. Nucleating agents will be optimized and tested for seawater application, and a sub-scale vacuum freezing chamber will be designed, fabricated, and tested based on the Phase I benchtop chamber. Other essential modules in the sub-scale system including the water regenerator, nucleating agent separator, and thermal ejector will also be designed and fabricated. The modules will be integrated as an effective desalination system and the performance of the system will be evaluated experimentally. In addition, ACT will collaborate with industrial partners to commercialize the technology. The proposed technology could be applied to seawater desalination and brackish water treatment.   The low energy requirement and low operation cost are the competitive edges   of this technology. Subcooling suppression techniques developed in Phase I work could also be applied in the application of phase change materials.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR project proposes the development of advanced catalyst technology for ultra-deep hydrodesulfurization and cetane number improvement process for diesel fuel. In Phase I of this project, Advanced Energy Materials, LLC. (AdEM) utilized its core technology of metal oxide nanowires platform for catalyst design, and successfully demonstrated the high performance of the two proposed catalysts: (1) AdE-Scat\u2122 \u2013 nickel and molybdenum supported on titanium oxide nanowires \u2013 for highly active hydrodesulfurization of diesel fuel under mild operation conditions; and (2) AdE-Ccat\u2122 \u2013 nickel supported on zinc oxide nanowires \u2013 for cetane number enhancement from 47 to 58 for producing higher quality diesel fuel. In addition, AdEM demonstrated the feasibility of titanium oxide nanowires scale-up production using thermal oxidation and microwave exposure approaches. Both proposed catalysts (AdE-Scat\u2122 and AdE- Ccat\u2122) products were highly scalable and had good mechanical properties such as crush strength and attrition resistance as required to use in industry. The Phase II of this project by AdEM proposes to optimize, develop and introduce these two catalyst products to the markets such as ultralow sulfur diesel, premium diesel fuel, and other applications through strategic partners. Specifically, the Phase II objectives includes Design and optimize the high performance AdE-Ccat\u2122 and AdE-Scat\u2122 catalysts Scale-up production of the nanowire materials toward catalyst production. Establish catalyst manufacturing scalability and determine crush and attrition strength of the catalyst in extrudate shape, Perform technical validation at customer sites at pilot scale for activity and the life time. Sulfur is a natural component of crude oil that is present in gasoline and diesel unless removed. Demand for higher performance diesel engines has resulted in an increase in minimum cetane number required for diesel fuel. The development of advanced catalysts which can remove sulfur to below 15 ppm and improves cetane number simultaneously is attracting considerable attention in recent years due to the new government policies and its fast-growing global market. AdEM\u2019s proposed AdE-Scat\u2122 and AdE-Ccat\u2122 catalysts and their scalable manufacturing methods can lead to the highly efficient desulfurization and cetane enhancement in oil refineries with a substantial energy and cost savings. AdEM\u2019s first commercial interest is in applying the proposed catalysts to the small-to-medium-scale refineries in Midwest.",

        "abstract": "The upgrade of the physics experiments for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) at CERN is currently driving the development of new and more ef\ufb01cient powering schemes to cope with the increase of power demanded by the new high-density front-end electronics boards. Due to the high radiation levels of up to hundreds of Mrad at the HL-LHC, commercial DC-DC converters cannot be used in these powering schemes. Therefore, a critical need exists for custom-designed radiation-hard DC-DC converters to be used in the planned upgrades of the ATLAS and CMS detectors of the LHC, and in other planned future experiments. These converters must also function in high magnetic fields and be implemented within a small form factor with low mass. Alphacore will develop a novel hybrid Gallium Nitride (GaN) and silicon CMOS integrated module DC-DC converter. The converter will have built-in self-test (BIST) circuitry that can be used to monitor the converter\u2019s health during the long HL-LHC experiments. The converter will exhibit the following specifications: Input voltage of 18V (and later 24V) regulated down to an output voltage of 1.0V \u2013 3.3V, with at least 7A maximum load current, Exhibits a minimum of 80% efficiency, Includes radiation-hard built-in-self-test (BIST) to monitor critical performance parameters and calibrate controller parameters for high radiation conditions and over converter lifetime, Integrated, compact, single-module DC-DC converter solution. This solution includes a customized CMOS chip, as well as the GaN-based DC-DC converter\u2019s power stage. These components will be integrated to provide a single-package solution. The GaN and CMOS-based converter functions at total ionizing dose (TID) levels \u2265200 Mrad/Si as well as high tolerance to single event effects and displacement damage, which makes it an excellent candidate for use in the HL-LHC. Within Phase II, a DC-DC converter module will be designed and fabricated, based on the studies performed in Phase I. The module will include GaN devices for the converter\u2019s power stage, along with a custom-designed IC with BIST and monitoring functionality and the converter\u2019s controller and driver circuitry. The GaN-based module will be fabricated and tested for functionality conforming to design specifications, as well as performance under a variety of extreme radiation conditions that approximate the conditions that will exist inside the HL-LHC. The designed converter will find many potential commercial applications, (power systems in space satellites, defense systems, powering of large medical imager scanners, etc.) due to its high efficiency and compact size that originates from the high switching frequency and lack of large passive devices. Large scanners used in medical imaging (combo scanners for MRI and SPECT as an example) require compact powering schemes for up to 20,000 tightly spaced readout channels functioning in high magnetic fields and with low levels of ionizing radiation. Alphacore\u2019s converter meets all of these specs. High Energy Physics and Nuclear Physics research are major fields where the GaN based DC-DC converter chips will be used. The size of this market can be put into perspective knowing the fact that the LHC alone has used $10B of funding so far and will require several billion dollars in the near future for upgrades. There are also several other planned large-scale experiments with millions of readout channels, including the International Linear Collider and the Electron Ion Collider. Alphacore, Inc. will use a novel combination of gallium-nitride and CMOS microelectronic technologies to develop a radiation-hard power converter that is currently critically needed for the planned upgrades of the Large Hadron Collider.",

        "abstract": "There is substantial interest in upgrading existing High Energy Physics accelerators including the Large Hadron Collider in CERN, Switzerland to higher energy levels so as to probe deeper into the subatomic scale and unlock the mysteries of the Universe. Such upgrades to higher energy levels would require use of High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) magnets which can generate magnetic field levels of 20 T and beyond. However, in order to use HTS tapes in ultra-high field accelerator magnets, challenges with flat geometry and wide profiles, anisotropic properties and losses during magnet ramping have to be overcome. The overarching objective of the proposed program is to develop RE-Ba-Cu-O (REBCO, RE=rare earth) HTS wires with performance and features that can enable future accelerator magnets for high energy accelerators. The approach is to develop multifilamentary, ultra-small-diameter round REBCO wires with high engineering current density using ultra-thin REBCO tapes. In the Phase I SBIR program, AMPeers and its Research Institution partner, the University of Houston, successfully achieved the overarching goal of fabricating round, multifilamentary REBCO wires of just 1.6 mm in diameter! Additionally, meter-lengths of round REBCO wires were produced with a critical current of of 440 A at 77 K, self-field. Short wires, with critical current in excess of 495 A at 77 K, self- field (engineering current density, Je ~ 250 A/mm2) have also been demonstrated. In the Phase II project, the round multifilamentary ultra-small diameter REBCO wire technology will be scaled up to manufacturing of 50 meter lengths with an engineering current density of 250   A/mm2 at 4.2 K, 20 T. A supplementary objective of the Phase II project is to demonstrate even higher performance round ultra-small diameter REBCO wires with engineering current density of 600 A/mm2 at 4.2 K, 20 T and 80 times lower AC losses than that of standard REBCO tapes. Achievement of round, multifilamentary, ultra-small diameter REBCO wires in long lengths in the proposed program will meet the needs of High Energy Accelerators that would operate at 20 T and beyond for High Energy Physics. The new technology would also be highly impactful in the commercial market for accelerators which includes proton beam therapy in medicine, treatment of water and flue gases, pharmaceutical drug development and nuclear forensics and cargo screening for security. The outcome of the proposed program can be impactful on even a larger scale for electric power applications such as transformers and rotating machinery including utility generators, electric motors, wind generators and airborne generators. A new type of superconductor wire technology that can enable ultra- high field magnets will be developed in this program. This new superconductor wire would lead to high- energy accelerators that will unlock the mysteries of the Universe as well enable several commercial products that serves the medicine, energy, environment and security markets.",

Phase II develops not only scales synthesis process to the kilogram per day range, but also applies unique capabilities in nanomaterial collection and downstream processing to the problem of graphene production. Graphene attracts both academic and industrial interest because it produces a dramatic improvement in properties at very low filler content.

Even worse is the possibility that some type of device is detonated. The ability to know if material is being enriched or the identification of device debris relies significantly on chemical analysis; what is the elemental and isotopic content of a material. However, current analysis technologies are time consuming and laborious, requiring days to weeks to report results. Advanced technologies for rapid analysis of elemental and isotopic signatures are needed to deter the proliferation of nuclear weapons and safeguard our world. Combine three laser-based analytical laser sampling technologies into a Triple Tandem platform for rapid, precise analysis, increased throughput, reduced influence of isobaric interferences, and ability to measure any elements and isotopic signatures in heterogeneous materials. This project will advance technology for elemental and isotopic analysis using laser ablation sampling with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) and Laser Ablation Molecular Isotopic Spectroscopy (LAMIS). The Triple-Tandem capability was demonstrated showing improve precision, speed of analysis, and the measurement of light elements and isotopes from heterogeneous materials. The configuration for a prototype instrument to be developed in Phase II was established. The research will develop simultaneous LIBS and LAMIS with LA-ICP-MS for improved measurement precision, expanded light-element/isotope coverage, expanded dynamic range (sensitivity) of analysis, and elemental mapping of heterogeneous materials. Sophisticated data analysis software will be developed and imbedded to provide a user friendly instrument platform.

Intermediate and final refinery products as well as petrochemical products must be analyzed to meet regulations, required specifications and to provide certificates. Traditional chemical analysis is based on a multitude (> 100) of the ASTM standard methods but they are slow, laborious, expensive, and each of them is suitable only for one or very few elements. The multi- element analysis can be performed by ICP-OES, but it requires acidic digestion of samples, an evacuated spectrometer with a pump, a flow of high-purity argon, quartz/glassware and other consumables. Sample preparation takes long time. Acids are costly and dangerous, thus require personnel safety training, drills and emergency proceedings. Hazardous chemical waste must be disposed after the ICP measurement. With current low oil prices, advanced data collection and real-time analysis is pursued because it will reduce cost, improve efficiency, and enhance safety without huge capital outlays for refineries. We will develop a multi-purpose LIBS (laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy) instrument for rapid chemical analysis without dissolving the samples, directly in air or a gas flow. We use instantaneous laser ablation of the petroleum mist aspirated into a small chamber. LIBS yields real- time information on chemical composition.

The proposed technology also offers to advance laser acceleration of nuclear particles, thus replacing the traditional mammoth-size and costly accelerator research facilities with room-size devices. Compactness and relative simplicity of laser accelerators promises to greatly reduce the cost and timelines of high-energy research, and advance new scientific discoveries. As particle research could become affordable for universities or even commercial laboratories, the U.S. would be able to maintain leadership. In Phase II Aqwest will develop a suitable front end and test it with the \"advanced IFE driver module\" now being developed by Aqwest under a separate DOE grant. This work will focus on the preamplifier which would boost a beam from a commercial fiber laser to the energies required for injection into the main amplifier modules. The preamplifier will also use the edge pumped disk laser (EPDL) technology used in the main amplifier modules, but instead of gas cooling, it will be cooled by liquid to accommodate increased heat load in the high-gain disks. In Phase II, we will operate the front end with one or more of the \"advanced IFE driver modules\" to deliver one of the most energetic laser beams in the US. The proposed project would greatly advance the realization of the inertial confinement fusion and its transition to commercial inertial fusion energy by using Aqwet\u2019s innovative EPDL while leveraging prior and present Department of Defense investment. In commercial applications, EPDL offers to supplant the German-made thin disk laser, which has been the dominant technology for laser material processing for the last 10 years.",

        "abstract": "An increasingly developed global population necessitates an increased demand for inexpensive energy, which must be clean, efficient, and renewable in order to prevent adverse effects on future resources and the climate. Biodiesel has emerged as a renewably-produced, potentially carbon- neutral hydrocarbon, making it an attractive alternative to conventionally-obtained fossil fuels. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art chemical processing for production biodiesel suffers from inefficient conversion of the most cheap and low-quality feedstocks. Enzymatic biodiesel production has been shown to be a promising alternative due to a more efficient synthesis process, but its adaptation to an industrial scale has been slow due to enzymes\u2019 cost and slow reaction times. BioHybrid Solutions is developing a new enzyme-based catalyst for biodiesel production to improve the performance and stability of enzymes, providing cost-effective access to cheaper and potentially renewable feedstocks. A drastic enhancement of the enzyme\u2019s properties is achieved by utilizing polymer-based protein engineering technology wherein stability and performance can be improved via targeted modification of enzymes with rationally-designed functional polymers. During Phase I work BioHybrid Solutions demonstrated feasibility of the selected polymer-based approach on tuning of properties of the enzyme performance in biodiesel production. Results of the work demonstrated several potential and crucial benefits of the novel enzyme-based catalyst for advancing biodiesel production process. During Phase II BioHybrid Solutions plans to further develop and optimize product formulation, as well as develop initial scale-up capabilities for future commercialization. Additionally, the overall biodiesel synthesis process will be optimized for the newly developed enzyme-based catalyst. The fast-growing biodiesel market is driving demand for more efficient and innovative production. BioHybrid Solutions will be in a position to provide the necessary enzyme-based catalysts to this growing market. This type of enzymatic production will be more beneficial for biodiesel manufacturers due to reduced wastewater production, more energy-efficient processing, elimination of the use of hazardous chemicals, as well as higher quality of final products compared to that achieved by traditional alkali-catalyzed transesterification methods. Among major consumers benefiting from getting access to biodiesel are public transportation sector, trucking industry, US Navy, Air Force and Army. Significantly cleaner combustion of biodiesel in comparison to petrodieselis another crucial public benefit.",

        "abstract": "The monitoring of spent nuclear fuel is not only critical to the operational safety of power plants, but also for nuclear materials control and accountability. Furthermore, up to 30% of energy may be recovered from reprocessed spent nuclear fuel, reducing high level radioactive waste. While radiation sensors may provide measurements of radioactivity, they often lack material selectivity to fully characterize nuclear fuels. New non-radiation sensors are needed, and specifically, sensors that can provide accurate elemental composition of the nuclear materials in a safe manner. Our proposed technology uses a high resolution, broadband spectrograph for laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to detect small isotopic shifts in the emission lines of nuclear materials. Characterizing the isotopic shifts allows the content of the nuclear material to be measured without any sample preparation. Measurements can be carried out remotely, reducing any nuclear radiation risks to personnel. Our proposed instrument will measure small isotopic shifts across a broad spectrum, allowing the detection of isotopic shifts where they do not have interferences from the complex spectra associated with radioactive elements. In Phase I, we have demonstrated \u2013 through optical modeling \u2013 the capability of our broadband, high resolution spectrometer to characterize spent nuclear fuels. In Phase II, we will develop the hardware for the construction of the proposed spectrograph to achieve a resolving power of over 200,000 for isotopic analysis of nuclear materials. We will verify the spectrograph\u2019s capabilities using stable isotopes before testing it with spent nuclear fuels at a national research laboratory. In addition to monitoring spent nuclear fuel, this technology may also be used for national security concerning nuclear safeguards and non-proliferation due to the high resolving power and broad spectral bandwidth of the new instrument. Commercial applications include geological exploration and mining, materials processing, laser spectroscopy, forensics/provenance, and biomedical and pharmaceutical analyses, such as drug testing. Our high-resolution detector will be capable of capturing optical signatures of nuclear materials.

Experimental studies will be conducted at LBNL to understand effects of gas type and pressure on ecton formation and dynamics. CFD Research Corporation (CFDRC) will enhance its recently developed adaptive kinetic-fluid simulation tool for computational studies of EEE processes. This project will investigate effects of background gases on near-electrode phenomena and phase transitions between gas, liquid, and solid states during electrical breakdown and formation of arc discharges. After completing Phase II, a new multi-physics computational tool with advanced capabilities will be available for fundamental studies and industrial engineering of plasma systems utilizing arc discharges. Cathode processes involving localized, non-stationary centers of plasma generation are relevant to many fields of science and industry, including processes on the walls of plasma fusion facilities and industrial scale fabrication of hard and wear-resistant coatings on tools and engines, high power switches, and welding equipment. The difficulties of understanding cathode processes are related to the presence of several phases (solid, liquid, gas and plasma) and fast dynamic changes down to the nanosecond time scale. This project will further understanding of near-electrode phenomena in gas discharges and offer a computational tool with breakthrough capabilities for analyzing plasma- surface interactions in cathodic arcs. The developed tool will be used to understand unipolar arcing in fusion devices, the formation of microcraters and ejection of liquid droplets associated with electrode erosion in cathodic arcs. The project will clarify effects of background gases on ecton formation in arcs with liquid and solid electrodes.

These applications require compressors that operate near the critical point of CO2. However, compressor design at these conditions presents many challenges due to the lack simulation tools that account for the correct fluid property variations in this regime. Our proposed work here addresses this deficiency. A high-fidelity CFD based analysis tool for supporting design and analysis of SCO2 compressors is being developed that will accurately account for the real fluid property variations of CO2 near its critical point. It will provide accurate compressor performance predictions at design and off-design conditions. It will also permit simulations of scaling studies from sub-scale to full-power configurations. In the Phase I effort, a feasibility study of various features necessary for modeling SCO2 compressors was conducted. This included preliminary performance validation, literature survey of thermodynamic properties for CO2 with contaminants, and fundamental condensation studies. The Phase II effort will build upon the feasibility demonstrated in the Phase I effort and mature the simulation framework. Objectives of the work plan include detailed validation of SCO2 compressor performance, thermodynamic models for CO2 with contaminants, and droplet condensation effects on compressor flow fields. The resulting product will be a well-validated design support tool for SCO2 compressors. The SCO2 Brayton cycle is gaining interest across a variety of power generation applications due to its potential for providing higher efficiencies than a steam Rankine cycle.

Transposition of the tapes in a cable structure (e.g., Twisted Stacked Tape Conductors) remains the best means of minimizing these effects. Production of long continuous lengths of these cables will be required in order realize the potential of high field magnets based on these materials. In this program, Composite Technology Development, working with the Plasma Science and Fusion Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, will develop methods for the production of Twisted Stacked Tape Conductor cables in a round former using an insulation scheme demonstrated in Phase I. The work in this program will enable the production of long continuous cables and will demonstrate their applicability to cable-in-plate configurations that are common in fusion magnet constructions. To achieve the goals of the program, Composite Technology Development, Inc. will modify the design of an existing, pilot-scale reel-to-reel system designed for insulating round wire to accommodate the continuous assembly, twisting, and insulating of Twisted Stacked Tape Conductor cable. Cable designs will be developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and they will also develop testing methods and verify the electrical and mechanical performance of the insulated cables produced during the course of the Phase II program.

However, the development of hydropower has been limited by several obstacles, as described by the U.S. Geological Survey: most of the prime locations have already been developed and the costs, time, and environmental impacts of constructing conventional hydroelectric facilities at relatively low power levels are untenable. A low-cost, low impact, high-performance hydropower turbine is needed to cost-effectively tap into the large amount of this available hydropower. The proposed work will create a low-cost, modular, very low-head hydroelectric turbine generator unit. This unit will have a small footprint and reduced environmental impact, and it will function in a broad range of operating conditions. By focusing on low- to very low-head applications many of the issues of free stream power generation can be avoided while still keeping site impact and foot print low. Several design technologies (hydrodynamic and structural) can be applied in this small, very low-head hydro turbine area. These technologies will address performance, cost, durability, and installation issues. Phase II tasks include: Detailed design of turbine generator unit conceptualized in Phase I, Manufacturing cost reduction and life-cycle cost evaluation to ensure lowest possible system costs, both upfront and operational, Manufacture of a full scale engineering prototype, Performance test of full-scale unit and generator set evaluating multiple rotor configurations. If this project is carried over into Phase III, the commercial applications are extensive.

This project will complete 4 years of work by Coulometrics to develop new environmentally friendly and low cost processes for the conversion of graphitic materials into a high quality LIB anode material that exhibits: Lower cost; Improved purification through an environmentally friendly process, and; A high quality and consistent material suitable for demanding electric vehicle applications. Currently, all natural graphite for lithium ion batteries originates in China. This represents the most profitable value-added market for graphite with no current beneficiaries in the US. This is true even though vast high-quality flake graphite deposits of exist in the US and Canada and the US also boasts some of the highest quality petroleum coke that can be used to produce synthetic graphite. Many junior graphite and petroleum companies are eager to see their materials used for LIB anode material however new state-of-the-art process technologies are required that will: Spheronize the graphite with higher yield than what is currently used in China; Purify the spheronized and synthetic graphite, and; CVD coating of the spheronized graphite to provide high efficiency and long life in LIBs.Coulometrics has increased spheronization yield from 30 to 70%, demonstrated new thermal purification technologies that achieve record graphite purity, and developed a new CVD coating process that has allowed us to achieve unprecedented LIB life even when compared to world class cells used in Tesla vehicles today. Coulometrics graphite anode materials meet all automotive specifications including high capacity (>355 mAh/g) and high first cycle efficiency (92-95%).Coulometrics is already working with leading US battery manufacturers and has included letters of support for this effort from Tesla Motors and K2 Energy.

For best performance, these reactors will require large numbers of uranium alloy fuel pins made with annular geometries that reduce fuel temperature and swelling compared to solid pins.  No method currently exists for producing large numbers of annular fuel pins. Creare proposes to develop an advanced, continuous casting method that uses innovative tooling, instrumentation, and process control technology to produce uranium alloy fuel pins with annular geometries that are optimized for future nuclear power plants. The method uses an innovative device to pull a casting directly from the surface of a pool of molten metal, using high-intensity cooling to solidify the pin as quickly as it emerges from the pool. Experiments demonstrated the feasibility of producing annular fuel pins using a continuous casting process. We designed and built key components of the continuous casting system and cast annular pins directly from a pool of molten metal at relatively low temperature. Data from these tests include videos of the casting process, temperature and casting rate data, and dimensions of the castings. In Phase II, we will develop advanced precision casting equipment that can be used to produce annular pins of metallic nuclear fuel. We will apply the designs and process parameters identified in Phase I to higher temperatures using a molten metal that more closely models nuclear fuel alloys.  We will develop the equipment needed to produce the pins, run multiple series of fabrication experiments, and refine the design of the equipment based on the measured dimensions and metallurgical properties of the castings. Use of annular fuel pins will reduce cost and improve the safety and performance of future reactors. The public benefit will be low-cost electricity that is produced by safe and environmentally benign power plants and reduced risk of nuclear materials proliferation.

        "abstract": "To monitor for compliance with nonproliferation treaties such as the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, approximately 80 ground stations around the world collect radionuclide aerosols from the atmosphere and measure the isotopic composition to detect, locate, and characterize nuclear events. These stations process enormous volumes of air to collect minute amounts of the radioactive isotopes needed for detection and analysis. The current approach uses a large air mover and a paper filter media. It consumes a great deal of power, which presents a significant issue for backup power systems. What is needed is a sample collection system that can operate with less power consumption and an increase in instrument sensitivity. In the proposed Phase II project, Creare will continue development of an alternative radionuclide aerosol collection system utilizing electrostatic precipitation, which promises to require much less power than a filter media-based system because the pressure drop through the system will be much lower for the same air volume and the same system footprint. Samples will be collected on rolls of metallized polymer film and sealed for subsequent analysis. In Phase I, we developed a detailed set of requirements and preliminary design models. We conducted laboratory tests to demonstrate the concept and validate our design tools, which we used to generate estimates for pressure drop and collection efficiency. We developed a conceptual design for the prototype to be constructed in Phase II. The plan for Phase II will be to first complete subscale laboratory testing, conduct detailed design work, and then build and test a prototype full-scale system. We will work closely with the team at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to ensure that our sample collection system meets the ultimate system requirements and integrates well with their detector technology. The initial commercial application will be to replace the existing radionuclide collection systems with an improved low-power, high-sensitivity alternative in the current network of 80 sampling stations around the world. This will benefit the public by reducing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and providing critical data concerning public safety during nuclear power plant accidents. Additional commercial applications of this technology we will pursue include bioaerosol monitoring to detect the use of biological and chemical weapons.

        "abstract": "There is strong need to develop new robust RF communication systems to support wireless communications for sensor data and instrumentation control in harsh environments. The nuclear industry has many examples of such environments, including geological repositories and facilities such as nuclear power plants. High-quality reliable wireless communications between operators and automated control systems are critical in these facilities, as wireless sensors become more and more prevalent in these operations. However, conventional wireless communications systems based on narrowband and spread spectrum signaling face significant challenges in such environments. This project develops novel ultra-wideband (UWB) based systems to overcome these problems, with security features embedded in the sensor/communications systems. Dirac Solutions Inc., in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, has developed highly reliable UWB communications systems that have excellent performance in several harsh environments including ships and tunnels. These systems use novel modulation techniques for short pulse UWB communications. The communication units can be integrated with sensors and produced inexpensively in large quantities. In this SBIR project, the utility of this new technology for applications in the nuclear power and related industries will be assessed, optimized, tested, and widely deployed. Major accomplishments included: 1) feasibility of using UWB signals in nuclear plants was tested with existing DSI hardware at the MIT research reactor; 2)  an efficient and secure UWB pulse coding technique that improves receiver sensitivity was developed and simulated in MATLAB; 3) physical layer parameters for a robust  communications system with respect to multipath and EMI were designed; 4) simulations allowed the integration of AES 128-bit method with the UWB physical layer, providing a fully integrated secure wireless communications design in software; 5) two remote powering hardware prototypes (350 and 550 MHz) were designed, developed and tested for future integration with various sensor. In Phase II, we plan to use the hardware, software, and firmware results to develop a secure UWB communications system based on software-defined radio (SDR). SDR is a better option compared to the fixed architecture hardware systems as the communications parameters such as center frequency, bandwidth, pulse shape, link capacity, and duration between the pulses can be modified in software to adapt to various environments. These UWB systems can be adapted for numerous applications such as in tunnels and nuclear power facilities for voice, data, and instrumentation control. Government applications include military and defense, exfiltration of data in difficult environments, first responder communications systems, and many others.

        "abstract": "Fast, reliable, real-time control of plasma is critical to the success of magnetic fusion science and is thought to be required for successful deployment of future power producing reactors. The development of efficient and robust solid-state switches for power systems for fast control of large inductance magnetic field coils, pulsed and/or modulated auxiliary radio frequency (RF) heating, neutral beam injection (NBI), and plasma injection systems is critically important. For example, the Lithium Tokamak Experiment (LTX) at Princeton University will use a high-power magnetron for localized electron heating. This tube requires short, high voltage conditioning pulses prior to the longer main pulse. Eagle Harbor Technologies (EHT) is proposing to design, construct, and test a high voltage (> 35 kV) switch that is compatible with both SiC MOSFETs and IGBTs. EHT will leverage the proprietary gate drive technology previously developed with the support of a DOE FES SBIR. This switch will be used as the basis of a demonstration power supply to drive the pulsed magnetron at LTX in a challenging environment. During the Phase I program, EHT developed two high voltage switch modules: one with isolated power gate drive and a second with inductively coupled gate drive. These switches were tested at 15 kV and up to 300 A at switching frequencies up to 500 kHz for 10 ms bursts. Robust switching was demonstrated for both IGBTs and SiC MOSFETs. In the Phase II program, EHT plans to continue the development of these HV switches based on the success of the Phase I program. EHT will develop a higher voltage switch (> 35 kV) that will be suitable for high pulsed and average power applications. EHT will work with LTX to utilize these switches to design, build, and test a pulsed magnetron driver that will be delivered to LTX before the completion of the program. This demonstration experiment will provide valuable application-based data of the high voltage switch power supply operating in a challenging environment of a fusion science experiment. The commercialization of a robust, high power, high voltage switch module would eliminate the challenges and complexity of other researchers developing a solid-state high voltage switch, while allowing users to take advantage of the latest efficiency developments in solid-state switching technology. Beyond fusion science, applications include fast HV pulses for high power RF production, fast capacitor charging systems, atmospheric plasma production and magnetic and strip-line kickers for linear accelerators. Broader markets include large particle accelerators, medical devices including particle accelerators for cancer therapies, semiconductor manufacturing, and defense applications. EHT has been working with several customers in each of these areas and continued development of the HV switch technology under this DOE SBIR program will greatly increase our ability to produce products that will support these applications.",

In Phase I, computational models simulating flow transport and reaction chemistry were used to study the concept and to deliver proof-of-concept. In Phase II the computational insight will be further fine-tuned, also prototypes will be built and tested in micro reactors. Due to its potentials to save cost appreciably and to provide additional savings in fuel and reduced emissions, it is anticipated that this new technology will be of considerable interest to the automotive industry. Additionally, its fuel cost savings and reduced emissions will be of interest to end consumers, while providing environmental and societal benefits.

        "abstract": "The gasoline engine is the prevalent engine in use today for automobiles and light trucks. In spite of the growth of various hybrids, clean diesel, and electric vehicles, it is projected to be in 71% of the vehicles produced globally in 2022. The gasoline engine has very poor efficiency at partial load typical of its usage in automobiles. Automobile engines can typically produce 200 or even 300 horsepower, but seldom do drivers use more than 40 horsepower. Typically, drivers use only about 20 horsepower, roughly 1/10 of the capacity of the engine. The efficiency of the engine is often a dismal 5% to 15% at these operating conditions and even driving down the highway at freeway speeds. The Continuously Variable Displacement (CVD) drive system for engines improves the overall efficiency by approximately 29%, lowering fossil fuel usage and reducing CO2 emissions. The CVD drive system controls the displacement of the engine to match the vehicle\u2019s power requirement. It replaces the conventional throttle which controls the engine power by choking it of air. The CVD drive system controls the stroke of the engine along with the combustion volume to provide optimum characteristics no matter what the operating condition. The CVD drive system needs to be developed and proven to be commercialized. DOE SBIR Phase I moved the design forward by funding analytical work necessary before building prototypes to test. Phase II will move the design further forward by funding the manufacture and testing a prototype CVD drive system. Although the initial commercialization target is the automobile, the drive system has application to any gasoline, natural gas, or biofuel engine that runs at low duty cycles. This includes delivery trucks and vans, motorcycles, gen-sets, city busses, and small industrial engines. The drive mechanism is also applicable to compressors, including refrigeration compressors and air compressors.",

        "abstract": "Hydraulic fractures must be contained within the target formation so that they do not contact and potentially contaminate sources of drinking water. To mitigate this risk, research is needed to develop technologies that will advance our ability to diagnose, quantify, and map hydraulic fractures and thus help mitigate the danger that hydraulic fracturing results in the contamination of subsurface potable water reservoirs. Specifically, the challenge is to develop a new technology to more accurately and cost effectively characterize the dimensions, orientation, and proppant distribution of hydraulic fractures in near real time as well as provide long-term monitoring capabilities of these same parameters in cased wells. Currently, induction tools that are placed in the wellbore to make measurements are severely limited in sensing and resolution capabilities. In this project, we will adopt and integrate signal processing technologies to design an extremely low-frequency triaxle induction tool with improved aggregate receiver sensitivity and greater noise rejection. Compared to current downhole induction based measurements, the proposed tool will achieve greater range and resolution when measuring fractures generated with electrically conductive proppant in open holes. Based on the findings recently published, it should  be anticipated that improving sensitivity and noise performance will allow for the (i) detection of larger fractures by facilitating  increased spacing between the transmit and receive elements of the tool, (ii) differentiation of fracture sizes with higher resolution (and also detection of smaller fractures), (iii) detection of propped regions that have lower contrast (are less electrically conductive) with the background shale, and (iv) identification of dipping fractures with smaller dip angles by copolarized rather than coaxial measurements. The primary objective of the Phase I effort was to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing the existing proprietary core signal processing technologies to improve the efficacy of Low Frequency Electromagnetic Induction (LFEI) based propped fracture length measurements. This capability is valuable to achieve because it will significantly enhance the ability to collect data associated with hydraulic fracturing operations of shale gas plays and improve our ability to identify and remediate potential ground water contamination outcomes.  In Phase II, a prototype tool will be fully designed and operationally deployed.",

FPoliSolutions would build from the current RAVEN technology recently developed by Idaho National Lab for the purposes of commercializing an integrated data and simulation management framework for nuclear power plants operation costs reduction. RAVEN is essentially a workflow engine with the capability to drive simulators and model complex systems. The engine contains a variety of libraries designed to perform parametric and stochastic analysis based on the response of complex system codes. In its current implementation, RAVEN relies on Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to manage any code, provided parameters that need to be manipulated are accessible by input files or via Python interfaces. The extensible RAVEN framework provides the capability to add simulators, store and retrieve data in a common HDF5 database file. Commercial applications of the RAVEN framework will bridge the gap between the National Lab high fidelity simulation codes and current production software applications in use in the nuclear industry today.  The RAVEN framework will simplify the transition and facilitate roll out of new simulators while increasing plan operators abilities to make informed decisions with high confidence. FPoliSolutions\u2019 approach for commercial deployment for RAVEN will be to develop a customer database that will link to RAVEN via a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) framework.  The RAVEN SOA framework will make service calls between the customer database and the Linux RAVEN side simulator framework. RAVEN within a SOA framework can directly support reductions in plant operating costs and strategy optimization.   The ultimate vision is to implement RAVEN with a SOA framework as the backbone for complex simulation, design/margin optimization, and simulation uncertainty quantification across multiple industries.

        "abstract": "Phase I of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project was conducted under Department of Energy's (DOE) Advanced Technologies for Nuclear Energy (NE) topic 19(b), entitled \u201cAdvanced Technologies for the Fabrication, Characterization of Nuclear Reactor Fuel\u201d. Phase II and IIA preserve the two-pronged vision and goals outlined in Phase I. First, this project seeks to provide a technological answer to DOE-NE's needs, specifically in advancing the performance of accident tolerant fuel/cladding concepts in light water reactors (LWR) and TRISO fuel fabrication techniques. Second, this project will contribute to the advancement of the DOE-NE's long-term con-gressional mandate to enhance current reactor safety, reliability, and life, reduce nuclear proliferation risks, improve the affordability of new nuclear reactors in part through more sustainable nuclear fuel cycles. The present proposal builds upon cross-cutting advances in the following fields:(i) additive manufacturing (AM),(ii) micro-electromechanical-systems (MEMS) design, (iii) micro- and nano-scale fabrication and (iv) ceramic matrix composites (CMCs). These advances are employed in the development of novel Silicon Carbide fiber (SiCf) rein- forced Silicon Carbide matrix (SiCm) CMC fuel structure. They allow the integration of the full functionality of TRISO fuel at a microscopic level encapsulated into SiC filaments, which are in turn embedded into a SiCm to form a fully integrated nuclear fuel and cladding structure. This innovation merges the functionality of TRISO fuels and cur- rent fuel rods into a single element. This novel fuel structure offers a passively safe, integral and energy efficient Silicon Carbide alternative to Zircalloy fuel rods assemblies in LWR with little change to reactor control architecture. The proposed fuel structure's elevated temperature capability and chemical inertness implies lower amounts of and easier to store generated nuclear waste. Finally, micro-encapsulation of fissile material into a CMC would make fissile material retrieval extremely difficult, thereby lowering the risk of nuclear proliferation.  The Phase II of this project was focused on the scalability of nuclear-technology bound SiC fibers. For a commer- cially viable \u201cfuel-in-fiber\u201d concept, the core SiC fibers must be manufacturable in large quantity at competitive prices. With this objective most behind us, we now propose to focus on the value added processes that gives the advanced fuel concepts made using additive manufacturing its full force.",

        "abstract": "Multi-stage hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling technologies have been primary contributors to the very substantial increase in natural gas and oil production from shale and tight sand formations in the US over recent years. With increased application of fracturing in horizontal wells, it is critical to better characterize and monitor \u201cwhere the fractures go\u201d both to optimize production and at the same time to ensure fracture containment in the target interval to avoid inadvertent impact to potable water supplies or out of zone methane migration. GeoMechanics Technologies is developing an innovative technique that characterizes the fracture dimensions using both analytical and numerical simulation with inversion techniques from pulse testing to provide a clearer and accurate (about 66% more accurate) propagation of the fracture based on the pressure response. This novel technique would allow application to real world anisotropic reservoir conditions, such as dipping beds and varying lithology, providing a more accurate fracture analysis than current fracture diagnostic alternatives. During the Phase I study, we developed and validated the methodology to characterize a single hydraulic fracture using pulse testing. We also initiated a simple demonstration of multi-stage fracture study. The results from the multi-stage fracture characterization shows that the proposed methodology should be validated with field data since fracture characterization is highly sensitive to variations in reservoir properties and heterogeneous condition. For Phase II, GeoMechanics Technologies propose to expand on our Phase I efforts to provide a detailed study and an advanced technique of fracture characterization for multi-stage fractures. During Phase II, we will perform detailed numerical modeling studies with integrated geomechanics and flow models for multi-stage fracture system in horizontal wells for a range fracture geometry and formation characteristics. We will also demonstrate inversion technique to characterize the multi-stage fracture system and application with several real-world application examples. Actual field test will be performed during this Phase II. Finally, the fracture characterization techniques developed will be compared with actual field data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques. Successful development and demonstration of this new technique will provide industry with a more cost-effect and improved technique to characterize single and multiple fractures in a wide range of geologic conditions. The technique is less costly than current fracture diagnostic alternatives, such as microseismic monitoring and downhole tilt meter monitoring. This information can lead to more effective production and more reliable evaluation of environmental risks, including enhanced protection of potential underground sources of drinking water.",

A commercially viable, buoy-based remote sensing technology for MABL characterization for offshore wind applications is needed. Key requirements are that measurements must support profiles of wind speed and direction, temperature, humidity, and atmospheric stability up to heights of 200 m, with data sampling and communication rates appropriate for advanced rapid refresh weather modeling. In addition, the sensor package size, weight and power consumption should be suitable for deployment on existing met-ocean buoy platforms. The measurement technology should serve as a lower-cost alternative to existing measurement technologies. The objective of this research and development effort is to develop a low cost, low power, fully coherent, marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) Doppler radar measurement system which can serve as a core element of a buoy-based data collection network for the offshore renewable energy industry. Since the radar provides only wind related data products, additional measurement techniques to measure temperature, humidity and atmospheric stability are required. The heart of our proposed MABL measurement system is a compact wind profiling radar measurement instrument that provides buoy-based MABL characterization for offshore wind applications, including profiles of wind speed and direction to heights of over 200 m and communication rates appropriate for advanced rapid refresh weather modeling. The atmospheric measurement package size, weight, and power consumption are projected to be suitable for deployment on existing met-ocean buoy platforms. The Phase II work plan encompasses the following tasks: (1) refine detailed system design requirements and thoroughly review with end users, and then (2) complete system prototype detailed design, (3) complete the wind profiling processing algorithm validation, (4) develop processing algorithms for additional wind profiling products and finalize support algorithms, (5) develop the integrated hardware/software system prototype, and (6) perform system prototype test / demonstration / validation. The paucity of adequate measurements needed to characterize the kinematic and thermodynamic state of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) has been a perennial problem facing meteorologists and atmospheric scientists. The complex interactions of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) with the Earth\u2019s surface tend to make this layer of the atmosphere highly variable in time and spatially inhomogeneous. Diagnostic and prognostic equations conventionally used in the lower free atmosphere are difficult to apply in the ABL, which makes the need for measurements all the more necessary. Application of the technology to be developed promises to provide a lower- cost and more complete alternative to existing measurement technologies leading to significant cost savings in the offshore wind farm industry.",

        "abstract": "Cooling experiments to ultra-cold temperatures permits exceptionally sensitive measurements to be made. This enables the study of subjects from quantum computation to subtle variations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). To date, there is only one practical technology which can continuously cool high power experiments below 0.2 Kelvin, the Helium Dilution Refrigerator (DR). These refrigerators are extremely expensive, complex, power intensive, orientation sensitive (with respect to gravity), and require the increasingly rare isotope Helium-3. There is another technology used to achieve these temperatures, Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigeration (ADR). This technology relies on the demagnetization of paramagnetic solids which cool in a decreasing magnetic field. Once the field is lowered to zero, the cooling energy is depleted, and thus, typical implementations provide non-continuous refrigeration at the cold stage. Continuous cooling, as needed for CMB experimentation, requires the integration of two or more refrigerators. This has been done by NASA and a few others. However, while the resulting Continuous ADRs (CADRs) have a number of very attractive characteristics, such as cryogen-free operations, they have provided very limited load capacity \u2013 a fraction of common DRs \u2013 and therefore, have never been a commercially viable option for the laboratory researcher. We will address these shortcomings and deliver a high power CADR via innovative design and laboratory-specific optimization of each CADR sub-component and mechanism. In Phase I, a detailed mathematical model of the CADR was constructed to predict system performance and cost modeling, demonstrating feasibility. Several novel subsystem designs were built and tested. In Phase II, we propose to develop and demonstrate a prototype system. The first year will consist of detailed design and testing each of the major subsystems. The second year of Phase II will concentrate on system integration, control, and performance optimization. The commercial applications of the high power CADR include researchers in CMB astronomy, quantum computing, and other fields where more reliable and affordable access to ultra-low temperatures is desired. Ultra low temperature platforms enable cutting-edge science in astronomy, quantum computing, gamma ray spectroscopy and other research topics of national and commercial importance. A new breed of ultra-low temperature magnetic refrigerator will offer significant cost, reliability, and renewability advantages over the current use of helium dilution refrigerators.",

        "abstract": "The Department of Energy (DOE)\u2019s Oak Ridge Integrated Facility Disposition Project (IFDP) involves demolishing and upgrading infrastructure at the Y-12 Complex. Elemental mercury (Hg) and related species have been identified as high priority contaminants at Y-12. Strippable, fixative coatings with visual indication of contaminant capture can offer in-situ monitoring and characterization capabilities, source removal, improve safety, and minimize hazards and waste during the demolition process. Currently-used strippable coatings contain hazardous materials, do not provide visual indication and are not targeted for mercury-specific capture. This project is using an environmentally friendly coating formulation to capture and seal contaminants on the surface providing in-situ detection of Hg through color formation. The Hg- specific coatings are designed for selective and efficient capture of Hg species. The stripped coatings are targeted to minimize hazardous waste volumes, and disposal at a reduced cost. Phase II successfully established that the coatings show Hg-specific color, visible to the eye, in the presence of interferents. The coatings also captured very high quantities (17\u2013247 \u00b5g/g of elemental, soluble and insoluble Hg-species) from soil and brick samples from the Y-12 site, confirmed by analysis of the stripped coating. Robotic application of the coating was demonstrated on 16 feet vertical walls. Small scale field trials conducted by the collaborator at a contaminated facility, indicated the coating captured 4 and 12 \u00b5g/g of Hg from two surfaces. In Phase IIB, the coating formulation will be optimized for Hg-capture and scaled-up for use with a robotic spray applicator. The technology demonstration will be accomplished by: (1) small scale field trials for in-situ detection and characterization of Hg-contaminated surfaces, (2) using robotics to remotely-apply the coating in a highly hazardous area at the Y-12 facility, (3) in-situ monitoring of coated areas, (4) analysis of the stripped coating for waste classification, and (5) assisting in on-site or off-site disposal considerations and application potential in remediation activities. An expanded product line can be utilized by DOE facilities, Department of Defense (DOD), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and commercial facilities in fixing and sealing mercury, lead and other toxic heavy metal contamination during remediation.

        "abstract": "Metallic 3D printing of nuclear fuel assembly components has the potential to remove unwanted cost, waste, and time from the fabrication process. In addition to the direct manufacturing benefits, design engineers can create fuel assembly components that increase the performance of nuclear fuel assemblies with features that were not manufacturable a few years ago. Because of the reduced build time, each new design can be quickly iterated, producing rapid transitions between prototypes and final designs. For these reasons, the Department of Energy is highly interested in advancing methods of manufacturing for nuclear energy technologies that allow for easier engineering and commercial production of nuclear fuel assembly components. Overall, Phase I and II are focusing on optimizing the lower portion of the fuel assembly by adding beneficial 3D printed features and combining components. Phase I successfully built multiple bottom nozzle filter designs and fuel rod capture features. These were all tested for pressure drop, debris filtering efficiency, and fuel rod capture strength to vet which designs performed the best. Specifically addressing the bottom nozzle of a fuel assembly, 3D printing with Inconel-718 can enhance the debris filtering performance by constructing torturous flow passages that can be optimized for debris filtering efficiency and pressure drop. With the bottom nozzle being 3D printed, fuel rod capture features can be added to the bottom nozzle design, allowing for the removal of the lower end grid. Removing the lower end grid can lead to decreased fuel rod cladding wear by removing the contact point between the lower end grid to fuel rod and providing a more rigid fuel rod support. 3D printing a full-size bottom nozzle, analyzing specific features in different reactor environments, and performing full scale flow loop and irradiative testing are the main goals of Phase II. The commercial benefits for 3D printing in the nuclear industry are innumerable. A 3D printed bottom nozzle with fuel rod capture and debris filtering features can directly reduce cost by minimizing fuel rod failures, increasing the amount of fuel in a fuel rod, and decreasing the number of components. In general, the benefits to commercial nuclear reactor operators and the public are the countless areas where this technology can be applied to make nuclear components more efficient and thereby reducing the cost of electricity generated by nuclear power. Cost and time associated with material waste, quality control, inspection, and manufacturing of nuclear fuel assembly components can limit the efficiency of nuclear power plant operations. Using metallic 3D printing minimizes material waste and inspection time while producing close- tolerance products that increase quality and improve nuclear fuel assembly performance. 3D printing also frees designers to focus on component optimization, unhindered by standard manufacturing limitations.",

        "abstract": "A domestic source of high-quality bent crystal optics is needed to investigate properties of plasmas generated during nuclear fusion research. We propose to develop commercial production of these crystals and bent optics. Spectroscopy and imaging of long wavelength x- rays, known as \u201csoft x-rays\u201d requires crystals with appropriately long interplanar spacings, such as KAP. Research at fusion energy facilities is affected by the lack of a domestic supply of soft x-ray crystals.  Additionally, there is room for improvement of the currently available material with regard to achievement of tight bend radii or challenging bend geometries. Prior experience with soft x-ray crystal growth will be leveraged to rapidly scale up production of these materials. Expertise in assembly of bent crystals and in-house x-ray topography will be applied to develop new procedures for fabrication of high-quality bent crystals with desirable geometries. In Phase I, we demonstrated growth of large KAP boules and fabricated bent optics. During Phase II, crystal growth of other soft x-ray crystals will be conducted and processes will be optimized for production of thin bent crystals. Prototypes will be evaluated at fusion research facilities. Development of fusion as an energy source could have a substantial, widespread impact as a sustainable and safe source of power without negative impact on the environment. In addition to the benefit to the fusion research community, the development of bent soft x-ray crystals  could lead to the next generation of surface inspection and material characterization tools,  which would benefit many industries, including semiconductor and healthcare.",

        "abstract": "The stainless steel canister inside a dry cask storage system (DCSS) used to store spent nuclear fuel is at risk for chlorine-induced stress corrosion cracking (SCC), especially near welds and at storage sites exposed to high humidity. It is highly desirable to have a viable technique for in-situ nondestructive evaluation of SCC, specifically to measure the depth of the crack along its length. Laser ultrasonic testing (LUT) has been applied to meet the demanding needs of canister inspection. LUT is a noncontact method for performing ultrasonic testing. It can measure crack depth with high accuracy. The components are resistant to the high-radiation, high-temperature environment inside the cask. The measurement head is fiber-delivered and can be miniaturized to fit into the tight spaces inside the cask. We have demonstrated the feasibility of measuring the length and depth of individual fatigue and stress corrosion cracks in realistic test samples. Concepts have been developed for overcoming the technical and integration challenges associated with implementing our technique in dry cask storage systems. During Phase II we will conclude the technology development and design, assemble and test a prototype laser ultrasonic measurement system that will be integrated onto a robotic crawler and tested on a realistic canister mockup at the Electric Power Research Institute. We will also expand our outreach to cask suppliers, nuclear utilities and inspection service providers. The safe storage of spent fuel is of great importance for the nuclear power industry and is a priority for insuring public safety. Our approach will be a significant advance in insuring the integrity of stored nuclear fuel containers. Our technique can also be adapted for the inspection of piping and other components used in nuclear and conventional power plants. The end users in both cases will be the electric utility companies which operate the power plants, while the direct customers would be inspection companies that perform on-site inspections. The safe storage of spent nuclear fuel is a high priority to the nuclear industry and to society as a whole. We propose to develop a technique for nondestructive evaluation that will help to determine the integrity of fuel storage containers.",

        "abstract": "According to the World Nuclear Association, the U.S. is the largest producer of nuclear power worldwide. In fact, the U.S. provides over 30 percent of the world\u2019s nuclear generation of electricity. Although few new reactors have been built in the past 30 years, the association anticipates that four to six reactors may be built by 2020. The first of the reactors will be built in response to 16 license applications, which have been completed since 2007, to build 24 additional nuclear reactors. Currently, both government and industry are working to accelerate approval for the construction and design of new nuclear energy plants. The U.S. nuclear industry has already achieved significant developments in the implementation of nuclear power plants due to advancements in refueling, maintenance, and safety systems at current power plants. Meanwhile, changes in government policy, which have occurred since the late 1990s, have provided for noteworthy expansion in nuclear capacity. For example, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 evoked investment in electricity infrastructure such as nuclear power. Today, the importance of nuclear power in the U.S. is a geopolitical matter as much as it is an economic one. This is due to the notion that increasing the use of nuclear power reduces the U.S.\u2019s reliance on imported oil and gas. In order to design future systems and continue operational improvements at existing U.S. plants, advanced modeling and simulation of nuclear power reactors is crucial. Despite the known advantages of advanced modeling and simulation, many nuclear energy firms, or other manufacturing and engineering firms with equally complex preprocessing problems, simply cannot afford to contend with the overarching complexity nor deal with the capital outlays. The work proposed here addresses current deficiencies for utilizing advanced modeling and simulation by building a flexible, open-source Cloud/Web-based simulation environment or framework that stresses interoperability and ease-of-use. We will simplify simulator definition, automate HPC workflow description and introduce meshing HPC workflows. In particular, we are targeting nuclear energy, engineering and manufacturing firms that can clearly benefit from this technology, given that we will make these tools easier to use, reduce the need for in house expertise, and reduce the overall capital costs of using advanced modeling and simulation.",

        "abstract": "Solid-state lighting (SSL) panels based on inorganic LEDs are fairly efficient but lack thin and flexible forms, which severely limits the design options and further cost reduction. Organic LEDs (OLEDs) can be readily formed on flexible film substrates but have much lower efficacy and higher cost than inorganic LEDs. This project will develop and demonstrate a revolutionary new type of thin and flexible SSL panels that combine the high luminous efficacy and low cost of inorganic LEDs with the ultra-thin form factor and design flexibility of OLEDs. The proposed lighting panel employs a small number of high-brightness LEDs and a thin and flexible optical sheet that distributes light from the LEDs and emits a soft, uniform beam from the entire surface of the sheet without glare. It incorporates several innovations such as distributing and emitting light using a flexible light guide, efficient LED coupling to the light guide using special optics, and extracting light from the light using micro-scale surface patterning. The proposed technology utilizes minimum raw materials to create a distributed light source using latest-generation LEDs and has a potential to lower the cost of lighting panels by 30% or more while increasing the overall output and quality of light. Once commercially available, the ultra-thin and flexible LED lighting panels could become a new platform technology for making next- generation wide-area SSL panels that are more versatile and material-efficient than conventional products and provide new luminaire design opportunities. In Phase I, we proved the feasibility of the technology and produced a number of functional prototypes of flexible lighting panels that met all of the Phase I performance targets. In the proposed Phase II project, we will scale up the technology to the size of real-world lighting fixtures and focus on further improving the overall panel performance and end-use product development. With the subsequent commercialization in Phase III, we will make viable creating a wide array of ultra-low-cost LED luminaires having innovative shapes and attractive designs. Such LED luminaires could dramatically expedite the conversion of energy-wasting fluorescent lamps to energy-efficient solid-state sources at a much lower cost than the cost of saved energy.",

Empowering domain experts and stakeholders to easily customize modern technologies to the unique needs of grid operation and maintenance is critical. In the Phase I effort Machfu demonstrated an edge-computing platform that was capable of communicating directly with grid equipment using native/legacy protocols. The platform also extended secure access to the grid equipment utilizing native/legacy protocols and new paradigms such as the Open Field Message Bus that is under development with utilities at the Smart Grid Interoperability Panel. The  'glue' that ties this together in the Machfu platform is in the form of a customized set of applications that encodes the business logic necessary to bridge/broker the different protocols. The applications leverage edge computing capabilities to support the efficient and targeted support of different use cases. What is necessary to accelerate the adoption of this architectural approach is to continue to enhance the ability of domain experts to specify, customize, and extend that application logic to meet new and evolving business needs. In the Phase II effort Machfu will focus on the continued development of these tools and support of these abstract workflows to broaden the ability of domain experts to apply and customize the technologies. Public benefits of enabling domain experts to customize edge computing applications to target use cases include efficient grid operation and maintenance and extending the life of the aging grid. Simultaneously this should allow optimal, targeted, and incremental investment to modernize the grid when and where needed.

        "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas reservoirs can be extremely productive but may also be expensive, uncertain, and carry environmental risks. One challenge is the difficulty of mapping fracture networks while they form and as they evolve over the lifetime of the well, preventing a thorough understanding of reservoir dynamics. Major issues include unproductive frac stages, migration of fluids into the environment, and costly interventions for unexpected problems. High quality downhole measurements of seismic signals are proven to help survey reservoirs, study fracture dynamics, and monitor well conditions. However, existing electronic tools appropriate for downhole measurements have high costs and limited survivability in the harsh environments (particularly high temperatures) of modern unconventional wells, with a form factor which is complex to deploy and often incompatible with well configurations where hydraulic fracturing is being used. Our solution is a cost effective, narrow diameter tool string to simplify seismic deployments and reduce cost, encouraging wider adoption in all oil and gas reservoirs. A passive fiber optic sensor allows long- term survival at elevated temperatures (up to 250\u00b0C). Observations and surveys can continue long after stimulation, improving long-term models for future operations. Robust tools with high bandwidth and high sensitivity have already been demonstrated in lab and field tests. Phase I demonstrated sensor designs with minimal size, the ability to optimize sensor response, and simplified assembly and testing procedures. It also produced concept designs for a sensor housing allowing reduced cost and simplified deployment compared to existing seismic sensor systems. Phase II includes efforts to fully optimize sensors for ideal response and minimal cost, produce a prototype tool string incorporating important features of a final product, and to test the system at a range of temperatures and pressures.  It will culminate in a field test of a small scale array of sensors. Improve subsurface modeling that will reduce the number of failed frac stages and dry wells, Obtain data during and after fracturing, improving real-time decisions to maximize production, Identify environmental or safety concerns early, avoiding hazards to operators and the public, help quantify the total resources in a reservoir and increase the recovered fraction.",

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that radon causes more than 20,000 deaths per year in the US, and is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking. Radon mitigation is typically performed using constant ventilation. However, these inefficient fan systems range in efficiency from 15%-20%, requiring excess energy and cost to operate. This grant application seeks to develop an innovative, highly efficient radon fan that is purposefully designed for the unique application of radon mitigation. This is achieved through an optimized design of the flowpath. By partnering with a radon fan commercial leader, precise requirements have informed the design, and a path to commercialization is clear. A baseline real-world radon fan was modeled and its performance characterized to coincide with actual test results. Multiple designs were then considered. Analytical models were built and optimized for radon mitigation conditions. Preliminary mechanical layout was performed.  Based on these results, the project downselected to the proposed design. The design will be updated and then built for testing. Testing will be performed at an AMCA certified facility. Based on fan performance, the design will be updated and a detailed mechanical analysis will be performed. Additional manufacturing and cost analysis will prepare the product for full commercialization. The commercial application is for radon fan mitigation, currently with an installed base of over 1 million units. Additional benefits include the demonstrative effect of the potential energy savings to be realized through more efficient fan design in general, both from a standards setting perspective and a market attribute perspective.",

        "abstract": "Concrete is the primary material of construction. The challenges relating to the health, efficiency, and maintenance and construction costs of our infrastructure point at the need to develop concrete materials of improved durability at reduced cost. Close to 5% of global energy use and 10% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions are attributed to Portland cement and concrete production. A novel method is developed for economical and sustainable production of a high-performance hydraulic cement. This method employs energy-efficient \u2018mechanochemical\u2019 effects at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The resultant \u2018hybrid\u2019 cement can make value-added use of landfill-bound industrial by-products (e.g., low-grade coal ash and metallurgical slags) and combustion emissions. The hydrates and carbonates which form in concrete yield improved barrier, durability, mechanical and (heavy metals) immobilization qualities. The production cost of the hybrid cement is about half that of Portland cement; it also doubles the service life of infrastructure systems. The energy use and carbon emissions associated with production of the hybrid cement are 70-75% less than those for Portland cement. In addition, the hybrid cement comprises 10-15 wt.% of carbon dioxide as a valuable raw material.Viable chemistries of the hybrid cement and its hydration mechanisms were identified. The raw materials selections and formulations suiting this chemistry were selected, and the mechanochemical processing conditions in an environment of combustion emissions were established. Selected raw materials formulations, comprising largely of coal ash and metallurgical slags, were processed in laboratory. The formulations and processing conditions were refined empirically to meed standard performance and safety requirements. The resultant hybrid cement and concrete materials were thoroughly characterized, emphasizing their barrier, durability, immobilization and carbon capture qualities. A theoretical basis was developed for scale- up of the process, and the technology was implemented at pilot scale in a natural gas-burning power plant where the flue gas was used successfully to produce the hybrid cement. The operation conditions of the pilot-scale system were refined empirically, and the scalability of the process was verified. The hybrid cement produced at pilot scale was used successfully in construction applications. The Phase IIA project will advance the technology to a level that could be implemented at industrial scale. The selections of (primarily by-product and emission) raw materials will be further expanded to enable economical implementation in diverse geographic locations. Quality control methods will be developed for reliable production of the hybrid cement. Two pilot-scale runs will be implemented in collaboration with cement and power industries. The first pilot-scale run will simulate the continuous operation conditions of a cement manufacturing plant where stack emissions will be used as a source of CO2 and also as a gas stream for grading of cement particles. Both the prevalent ball and vertical roller mills will be used. The second pilot-scale run will be conducted in a coal-burning power plant were the solid residues and the emissions of coal combustions would constitute the primary raw materials. Adjustments will be made in mechanochemical processing to suit the coal combustion emissions. The resultant hydraulic cements will be characterized in laboratory and also in field in order to verify that they meet the prevalent standards and practices. Outcomes of the pilot-scale runs will be used to verify the performance, cost, safety and sustainability benefits of the technology. The hybrid cement offers significant savings in the initial and life- cycle costs of infrastructure systems. The longer service life and the reduced maintenance requirements of infrastructure systems would improve the efficiency of the economic and societal functions they support. The technology promises to reduce global energy use by up to 3.5%, and anthropogenic carbon emissions by up to 10%. The robust chemistry and effective immobilization qualities of the hybrid cement would divert up to 3.5 billion tons/yr of industrial by-products from landfills, thus preserving an equivalent amount of natural resources.",

        "abstract": "Significant amount of methane from natural gas/crude oil extraction and anthropogenic sources are either flared or vented because it is a cheaper option compared to the capture and use by the existing technologies and/or infrastructures. Methane is an energy-dense molecule (55 MJ/kg) and thus provides opportunities for its conversion into valuable bioproducts using bio-based technology. The goal of this project is to develop a bio-based technology to capture methane, CO2 and other trace gases such as H2S and NH3 towards production of high value products useful in animal and human nutrition. During the Phase I research, we successfully metabolically engineered a methanotroph to convert methane, CO2, H2S and NH into a high value product. Several genetic modifications were carried out which decreased the flux of carbon towards fermentative waste/storage products, eliminated competing pathways, and improved the carbon flux towards the targeted product. The optimized biocatalyst produces the targeted bioproduct at a significantly higher titer and rate. The objective of the Phase II project is to complete the development of prototype biocatalyst by metabolic engineering of the remaining bottlenecks identified during the Phase I research, establish an economical extraction process from fermentation broth, and optimize the volumetric productivity in a bioreactor at lab scale utilizing actual biogas. The proposed technology provides an operationally safe process, simplifies the overall process resulting in less capital and operational expenditures, and utilizes methane and CO2 as feedstocks. It also reduces the complexity of multiproduct intermediates and handling of toxic intermediates during production of the targeted products compared to the existing methods. Furthermore, the proposed technology can be profitably operated at small scale and would help capture stranded natural gas and develop small scale biogas production facilities. The anticipated result of this SBIR Phase II research project is establishment of a prototype integrated bioprocess that will convert biogas (and stranded natural gas) into high value products at a competitive cost.",

Given the high operating pressures (20 to 30 MPa) and temperatures (700 to 800oC) expected with S-CO2 and limited data from kilowatt size laboratory demonstration systems, larger size (i.e., 10 MW) test beds are needed for commercialization efforts; to validate designs; and to identify potential issues when scaling from tens to hundreds of MW. Phase I established a novel high efficiency and scalable turbomachinery concept that uses S-CO2 process fluid lubricated foil bearings in a configuration that minimizes parasitic power losses and operates at optimum speed. This proposed program will build on the established Phase I scalable concept by designing and building a full scale simulated 10 MW turbine hardware test rig. Since system efficiency, reliability, durability and maintainability are crucial to commercialization, integration of the many varied components into a functioning system is crucial. This Phase II hardware test effort will demonstrate key methods to component and system integration and will provide direction for more detailed component development programs. The test rig design will emphasize simulation of relevant full scale turbine operating conditions of load, pressure, temperature and dynamics. The rig design will include: 1) A 10 MW 60,000 rpm turbogenerator rig layout including rotordynamic analysis to ensure dynamic stability over the operating speed range; 2) Capability to sustain 750\u00b0C and 20 MPa internal pressures in the bearing compartment; and 3) Analysis to ensure thermal stability. The rig will be tested at relevant turbogenerator system speeds, temperatures and pressures to demonstrate dynamic viability and scalability of the concept. Using the experimental data, component technology limitations will be identified and detailed plans prepared to address the limitations to scaling the component technologies for multi-hundred MW sized turbomachinery. The proposed research program will offer an improved understanding into the scalability and limitations of key S-CO2 components and turbomachinery power conversion systems in sizes from MW to hundreds of MW. The results will also provide directions for future component and system developments needed to realize the commercialization of efficient and reliable S-CO2 power systems. The demonstration of advanced turbomachinery concepts and knowledge of scaling issues will directly contribute to commercial acceptance of the S-CO2 power cycle both for near term 10 MW systems and longer term for 100+ MW scale. The acceptance of S-CO2 cycles will increase efficiency of existing power plants through bottoming cycles thereby increasing power output and reducing cost of operation as well as application in future nuclear and other power plants. Carbon dioxide compressed and heated to high pressures and temperatures can be used to generate electricity from a variety of heat sources including fossil, nuclear, solar and geothermal. This novel power cycle has the potential to be more efficient and cost effective than current steam power plants. The proposed turbomachinery system with process lubricated compliant bearings is crucial to commercializing this technology.",

        "abstract": "One of the Department of Energy\u2019s, Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fuel Cell Technology and    Hydrogen Delivery, goals is to realize hydrogen as a safe, reliable, and cost competitive replacement for gasoline. A single hydrogen dispenser hose exists on the market, though it does not meet the service requirement of 25,550 fills/year for a combined working pressure of 875-bar and temperature range of -50\uf0b0C to +90\uf0b0C. The current hose price also does not allow for a cost of $2-4 gallon of gas equivalent. A new class D hydrogen dispensing hose, for use on station side applications, is being systematically and chemically engineered to survive 51,240 fills (70 fills/day, 2 years). This metal-free state-of-the-art hose is based on a unique fiber reinforced, high performance, cryogenically flexible polymer to resist hydrogen embrittlement, survive the Joule-Thompson effect thermal cycles, perform consistently at pressures greater than 875-bar (H70 service, 700- bar and safety overpressure), and endure mechanical wear and fatigue at the pump. During Phase I and II, a superior class of non-electrically conductive, low glass transition temperature polymer hose cores were developed that exhibit ultra-low hydrogen presence after severe 180\uf0b0 bending in a -50\uf0b0C chamber, and offer an innovative path to dissipate static electricity. A novel creamer coupling agent was developed to minimize the coefficient of thermal expansion between the fitting and hose, and resulted in significantly enhanced hose burst strengths. Fiber reinforced H2 hoses were modeled and produced using an automated filament winding manufacturing process (16, 3 meter hoses possible per day for reduced cost) with burst strengths > 31,000 psi, with failure due to fitting slippage. During the Phase IIB program, the down-selected H2 hose shall be commercialized with a new fitting to increase the current Technology Readiness Level of 7 to 9. Fittings and hose assembly partners have been formalized to proceed with the certification and commercialization plan. The new hose and fitting system shall be presented to hydrogen dispensing stations and fittings/breakaway/fueling nozzle manufacturers with a detailed integration design plan and cost analysis. The fully integrated hydrogen dispensing hose system, rated for H70 service, shall be demonstrated as compliant with SAE TIR J2601 and NIST Handbook 44, as a durable and competitive alternative to gasoline. This H2 hose shall serve as a new standard for metal-free, hydrogen embrittlement mitigating, high-pressure hoses with the additional benefits of enhanced flexibility, consumer maneuverability, fire resistance, and low temperature durability.",

        "abstract": "Biogas generation from the anaerobic decomposition of biological waste from municipal waste, farm waste, and waste-water treatment presents a renewable source of hydrocarbon feedstocks for fuels and chemical manufacturing. This market is projected to reach $33B in 2022. However, the majority of  biogas currently generated is combusted to produce relatively low value products, like heat or electricity. To increase the valorization of biogas, it is important to find ways to make it more easily inserted into common chemical/fuel synthesis routes. Phase I of this effort resulted in a novel family high-performance catalysts for biogas steam reforming to synthesis gas and Fisher-Tropsch synthesis to liquid fuel. These catalysts achieve excellent heat transfer in reactors, reducing the energy requirement for biogas reforming, and more effectively dissipating heat from the exothermic Fischer-Tropsch reaction. A new coating technology, developed in this project, protects the support from corrosion and enhances catalyst adhesion. Phase I modeling and experimental results demonstrated proof of concept for the approach. Computational modeling confirmed the importance of thermal conductivity to reducing energy consumption of the steam reforming processes, while experimental efforts have demonstrated that surface modification of high thermal conductivity supports can fundamentally improve their performance in steam-reforming and FT conditions. Catalyst testing confirmed the performance the candidate coatings at atmospheric and elevated pressures. To complete the study, the support materials, protective coatings and catalyst materials were combined into composite pellets for packed bed tests, in which the catalyst activity met the predictions of the models, and achieved equivalent or superior performance of commercially available products, with 3X higher thermal conductivity. Process model developed for industrial reformers demonstrates economic advantage the experimental catalyst over conventional options. Extending the model predictions to full-scale reactor conditions, we anticipate that technology developed in this program will provide a drop-in solution for customers\u2019 existing reactors, while consuming significantly less fuel during operation and achieving the same level of performance. In the Phase II effort, experiments using bench-scale reactors to evaluate catalyst thermal properties and validate modeling approaches. Resulting validated computational models of the Fischer-Tropsch and steam reforming reactions will be extended to industrial scale reactors, to predict commercial viability of the approach. In parallel, manufacturing studies of protective coatings and catalyst materials will be completed to confirm manufacturing cost models derived in Phase I and confirm the business model. Beyond biogas-to-liquids applications, the catalyst support technology has direct applicability in a range of chemical reactions, where heat transfer is a rate-limiting process. These include important reforming and oxidation reactions central to the chemicals, refining, and petrochemical industries.",

        "abstract": "One key advantage of superconducting electron accelerators is their ability to operate at high duty cycle and therefore at very high average beam powers. In high-current operation, small transverse emittances are needed to keep the beam losses low, particularly the losses to cryogenically-cooled surfaces. To fulfill these requirements, a new electron source capable of extremely high current and brightness needs to be developed. An ampere-class source would be capable of driving MW-power-level, compact, and efficient accelerators, such as those needed for waste treatment by electron beam irradiation. For dense waste streams, high power and energy of several MeV are required for throughput and penetration. As  brightness increases, these electron sources can also drive accelerators for extremely high power free- electron lasers and high power beam-driven RF sources. Niowave currently operates a normal conducting RF electron gun with a thermionic cathode at 20 mA average current. Electron emission from this 350 MHz gun is gated via a novel combination of both DC and second harmonic biasing of the cathode. Unlike many conventional implementations, the gating design does not intercept any part of the electron beam, and as such allows for a higher brightness beam at extremely high currents. This project adapts that technology for use with a high-voltage transformer from the power distribution industry, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the beam acceleration. In turn, the optics of the design have been revamped to create a clean, bright beam compatible with very low-loss injection into a superconducting accelerator. These improvements of this design are required to scale the current up by a factor of 100, to 2 amperes. This kind of accelerator opens up a number of applications, including sterilization of wastewater sludge at throughputs not possible today. In Phase II, the electron source will be built and tested in stages up to 2 A current with a duty factor greater than 20% (>50 kW average power). Phase III would be funded by an R&D program to create a MW electron accelerator comprising the new electron source and a 1-5 MV superconducting cryomodule. At this point, the system would be marketed commercially to wastewater treatment facilities.",

        "abstract": "For most accelerators, major contributions to electrical inefficiency originate with magnets and RF systems. Consequently, power supplies and high-power RF sources are logical targets for efficiency improvements.  This project is to develop a means for increasing the RF source efficiency. To address RF source inefficiency, Omega-P R&D, Inc. proposes to fabricate and test during Phase II a multi-beam klystron with a new type of depressed collector. This collector allows recovery of a larger portion of energy in the spent electron beams than could a conventional depressed collector, and will significantly increase the tube\u2019s efficiency towards 80% in a single stage and cut waste heat nearly in half. During Phase I, design optimization of a multi-beam klystron with a new type of depressed collector was carried out, based mainly on simulation studies. Preliminary agreements were reached with vendors and a National Lab which will collaborate with Omega-P R&D during the Phase II project on engineering, fabrication, and experimental demonstration of a prototype version of the tube. A high-efficiency multi-beam klystron with a new type of depressed collector can be used for R&D of accelerator-related projects that require mega-watt-level L-band RF power. Those projects could include applications to International Linear Collider, to technical aspects of other accelerators used for discovery science, or for development of components for accelerators intended for industrial and medical settings. Extensions of the work could also yield efficiency improvements for other high-power RF sources at other frequencies and power ranges used in accelerator systems in the US and worldwide.  Markets for RF sources to meet these needs could be significant. For most accelerators, major contributions to electrical inefficiency originate with magnets and RF systems. To address RF source inefficiency, Omega-P R&D, Inc. proposes to fabricate and test a new high-power RF source which allows significant increase of its efficiency towards 80%.

        "abstract": "A very diverse set of applications from lasers for accelerator applications to defense, to industrial to scientific and biomedical applications need to achieve ultrafast laser beams that have both high energy per pulse and high average power. In current lasers systems only one or the other is achievable. Networks of coherently combined massively parallel arrays of fiber lasers provide the promise of achieving both high pulse energy and high average power. The primary obstacle in the way of fulfilling this promise is the current high cost of these individual ultrafast fiber laser channels. Increasing the available energy per pulse in each channel will produce geometric reductions in cost. The goal of this effort has been to develop methods for increasing pulse energy while either maintaining or reducing the manufacturing cost of each channel. In the Phase I portion of this program, 3 different non volume related cost reduction methods have been demonstrated. The first is the use of microstructured fiber such as Photonic Crystal Fibers (PCF) which have a factor of 4 cross sectional area increase over conventional Large Mode Area (LMA) Step Index Fibers (SMA). This translates in to a greater that factor of 4 decrease in system cost as only one channel would be needed instead of 4 for the same pulse energy.  The second is the demonstration of completely monolithic fiber amplifier structures. Monolithic structures have no free space fiber coupling so no mechanical mounts,  no stable and heavy optical breadboards, and no opportunities for misalignment and contaminations, greatly reducing assembly costs and increasing reliability and ruggedness. Finally during the program a counter pumped monolithic harness was developed, fabricated and tested with a chirped pulse seed source and a factor of 3 increase in achievable energy was observed. Overall, a greater than order of magnitude reduction in cost has been demonstrated. The proposed Phase II program will achieve an additional order of magnitude reduction in per channel cost through the use of composite amplifier structures where over 60% of the expensive microstructured fiber will be replaced with less expensive LMA SIF fiber where the peak powers are low. Even higher energies will be achieved through the use of very short sections of PCF rod amplifiers. For these amplifiers, specific, low loss double mode adapters will need to be developed. In addition means for packing multiple channels very close to each other with a method that allows for serviceability for each channel will also be developed. The Phase II program will culminate with the fabrication and testing of a 7 channel parallel ultrafast system. Scientific, Industrial and Biomedical applications will benefit greatly by having access to the devices being developed here allowing ultrafast lasers to move into more parts of our lives. Ultrafast Fiber Lasers are at the forefront to opening a whole new era in laser applications from medicine to industrial to defense applications. This program will increase the available power from these lasers by orders of magnitude while making them low cost and highly reliable pushing ultrafast lasers deeper to solve societies needs.",

        "abstract": "Tungsten and its alloys are candidates for plasma facing component (PFC) armor due to their low sputtering rate, high melting point, high thermal conductivity, high strength at elevated temperatures, and low tritium inventory. Although copper alloys have been selected for the heat sinks for ITER, a working fusion reactor will require the use of higher strength, low activation materials. For example, ITER neutron fluence estimates for structural components are 0.3MWa/m2, which corresponds to a 3dpa. In contrast, the neutron fluence in a demonstration reactor will exceed 10-15 MWa/m2 or 100-150dpa. Therefore, low activation structural materials such as reduced activation ferritic/martensitic (RAFM) steels will be needed. A pre-conceptual power plant such as the ARIES-ACT1 will require a tungsten armored-RAFM steel first wall, which will correspond to 75-80% of the plasma facing surface. Therefore, techniques for joining tungsten armor to RAFM steel substrates are needed. During this effort, additive manufacturing techniques have been developed to allow joining of low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) tungsten armor to high CTE RAFM steels using functional gradient materials (FGMs). Thus, a three dimensional joint is produced and the thermal induced stresses are not concentrated at a planar bond line. Using these techniques, subscale tungsten armored steel mockups have been produced during Phase I. During Phase II, the FGMs and substrate geometries will be optimized to remove 1-5 MW/m2 heat flux. In addition, the use of powder bed additive manufacturing techniques will be developed to produce PFC heat sinks with enhanced cooling features. Therefore, the overall goal of the Phase II investigation will be the development of an additively manufactured W armored PFC to improve fusion reactor performance. In addition to joining other armor materials using additively produced functional gradient materials, commercial applications that will benefit from the technology to be developed include aerospace, defense, propulsion, power generation, semiconductor, crucibles, heat shields, x-ray targets, wear and corrosion protection coatings.",

        "abstract": "Conversion of carbon dioxide to useful products, including gasoline or commodity chemicals, via reaction with methane is problematic due to the energy inputs needed to overcome the large endothermic heats of reaction involved. Moreover, use of fossil fuels or carbon-based renewable fuels as energy sources will result in more CO2 released than is converted. Non-carbon renewable sources of energy, including wind and solar, are intermittent and so present challenges in terms of availability of the high quality, high temperature thermal energies needed for high-yield CO2 upgrading and the impact of this variability on downstream manufacturing steps. Our process makes effective use of intermittent high-grade solar energy by employing a multi-functional material. This material enables the alternating capture and release of solar energy and is highly effective for processing CO2 and CH4 into intermediate products. We also provide for load leveling of the process to maintain constant product production levels. This process utilizes our highly efficient catalyst support for enhanced reaction rates, enabling process intensification and scalability. This combination and approach will enable effective use of solar power, regardless of location or diurnal or seasonal variations, as a pathway to converting waste carbon dioxide into cost-effective commercial products. In Phase I we demonstrated the viability of our proposed process through demonstration of our materials ability to store solar energy when the process is on-sun, release the energy for off-sun use, and convert CO2 and CH4 into chemical intermediates carbon monoxide and hydrogen rich syngas. We showed that the process can produce gasoline at less than $3.00 per gallon based on current and future estimates on costs of solar thermal energy, CO2 and natural gas. In Phase II, we will develop the technology into an integrated process, including applicability of using concentrating solar power to provide high grade thermal energy, study the impact of feed composition on material performance, and options for downstream upgrading of the reaction intermediates. This will be done with realistic on-/off-sun duty cycles and in conjunction with technology providers and customers. Outcome will be a cost-effective replacement for petrochemicals and fuels, enabling solar-powered production of gasoline at a cost point of less than $3.00/gallon, repurposing carbon dioxide emissions into useful products, and improving US energy independence, and increasing US technical expertise.",

Shared solar is the key to unlocking access to solar for the reported 49 percent of US households and business that can\u2019t go solar because they are renters or don\u2019t have adequate roofs. In its original form, shared solar was confined to small groups of motivated citizens. As programs began to spread, stand-alone tools were developed to assist with billing and manage the program membership. Now that the market is maturing and participation is growing, the initial tools for managing programs are becoming increasingly inadequate. In our Phase I application we argued that to expand access to shared solar, versatile white-label software was needed to allow new and larger entities to enter the market with program designs that would scale. We had identified that utilities, energy retailers and major solar developers were well positioned to bring scale to the industry, but they lacked the tools. By developing a solution that allowed them to leverage their existing systems, we could accelerate the growth of shared solar by reducing the cost and complexity of deploying it.

Developing a linear accelerator capable of multiplexing carbon and proton beams would offer a promising approach to simultaneously reduce the cost and improve the quality of the treatment. In response to this problem, RadiaBeam Systems in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory has designed a novel S-band accelerating structure for protons or carbon ions, operating at the first negative spatial harmonic and capable of providing >50 MV/m gradient. In Phase I, we have done the electromagnetic design and optimization of 15-cell negative harmonic structure, and verified the feasibility of this novel approach with 3D beam dynamics simulations. We have performed the conceptual engineering design and manufacturing studies required to build the section, and performed transient thermo-structural analysis to validate the feasibility of structure operation in high gradient pulsed regime at the required repetition rate. In Phase II, RadiaBeam will perform full engineering design of the structure, including cooling, tuning and support elements. Afterwards, the structure will be fabricated, brazed and tuned, and delivered to Argonne National Laboratory for high power tests. The success of this project will be a major milestone towards demonstrating the technical feasibility of the entire carbon-proton linac radiotherapy system. This represents an attractive commercial opportunity in the aggressively growing market segment of hadron radiotherapy.

A highly efficient, X-band, compact, 650 kW sheet beam klystron (SBK) was designed and modeled. The linac structure was designed and simulated, resulting in a 3.7 MeV beam. We have demonstrated feasibility of the novel cross-rod structure by fabricating and testing a prototype with low level RF. The complete system has been preliminary engineered. In Phase II project, we will design, fabricate, and commission the system prototype. At the end of the Phase II project we will demonstrate operation of the KlyLac system that can to produce several microamperes of beam current at beam energy exceeding one MeV and produce X-rays that correspond to a few Ci activity of a source radiating mostly within 200-500 keV range of photon energies. The goal of his project is to build an ultra-compact portable radioactive material-free source of X-rays that will be used in borehole logging, non-destructive testing and other applications. The addressable market is approximately $50 million per year. The source will also help with the DOE\u2019s goal of reducing the use of radioisotopes in industrial applications.",

        "abstract": "Very high gradients are required for multi-TeV future colliders. The main limit to achieving high gradients in normal conducting accelerator structures is RF breakdown. Recent research on high- gradient RF structures indicates that hard copper alloys provide significant advantages over annealed copper. There are currently no well-established low temperature bonding techniques that preserve the hardness, surface finish and cleanliness required for high gradient operation. This project will develop the design and manufacturing process to fabricate a novel high-gradient normal conducting (copper-silver alloy) RF accelerating structure utilizing electron-beam welding (EBW). Further, the accelerating structure will be manufactured in 2 halves, which will reduce manufacturing cost compared to standard multi-cell manufacturing methods. RF design of a SLAC compatible test structure has been performed. EBW process parameters for CuAg have been studied and areas for further work have been identified. A CuAg SW test structure has been manufactured with EBW and validated. A conceptual RF design for a TW variant of this design style has been performed. Final optimization of the SW RF design will be performed. Further EBW process parameters will be refined and designs for ancillary components will be developed and tested. Several iterations of the SW structure will be manufactured and high power tested. A TW structure designed for CLIC parameters will be designed and manufactured. The proposed manufacturing technology and structure design development would have immediate applications in linear accelerators (linacs) for high energy particle colliders, compact higher-energy nuclear non-proliferation systems, compact free-electron lasers, and medical imaging and therapy systems. This project will develop more efficient, lower cost manufacturing technologies for particle accelerators with uses ranging from high energy particle colliders to medical therapy sources",

        "abstract": "Future accelerator applications for discovery science and industrial use will require more intense beams than ever before. New concepts in lattice design are required that can safely handle transport of these high-intensity beams. A possible solution is to use lattice designs with very strong nonlinearities, but which still provide bounded motion. This will allow for safe transport while preventing unstable collective effects which plague high-intensity machines. RadiaSoft LLC, in collaboration with Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, will use a combination of analytic theory and simulations to study how space charge and other perturbations affect single-particle orbits in the nonlinear optics. We will develop an injection scheme for matching intense beams to a nonlinear potential. We will demonstrate novel ways of using conventional diagnostics to provide beam measurements in the presence of nonlinear optics. RadiaSoft has advanced the understanding of nonlinear integrable optics through analytic theory and simulations using the Fermilab code Synergia. We have developed tools and techniques to enhance the IOTA lattice design in support of Fermilab\u2019s Proton Improvement Plan. We have constructed an open-source framework for cloud-based scientific computing, called Sirepo, for providing browser-based access to beam physics codes. We will develop symplectic algorithms for self-consistent space charge and wake field effects in Synergia. We will consider novel injection schemes for nonlinear distributions, as well as the effects of synchrotron oscillations. In addition to the IOTA ring, we will address larger ring designs relevant to Fermilab\u2019s Proton Improvement Plan. We will continue to enhance the Sirepo framework in support of Synergia and associated tools for nonlinear integrable optics studies. Our commercialization strategy is to offer consulting services and subscription-based access to computer-aided engineering (CAE) software via the Sirepo framework.

        "abstract": "Reactor cores in commercial power plants produce spent nuclear fuel which is discharged every 3-4 years. There is currently a pressing need to safely store spent fuel for long periods (decades to centuries) using dry storage systems. Such storage requires monitoring to ensure safe conditions as the waste decays. The system must meet challenging requirements: operate at 200 \uf0b0C, withstand high radiation, have a long term power source, and communicate through the walls of the sealed cask. RMD will design a system that meets the requirements, which integrates a rad-hard radiation sensor, self-sustaining thermoelectric power supply, and a means for transmitting data through the steel walls of sealed waste storage casks. RMD will collaborate with the University of Tennessee in Knoxville and Areva Transnuclear Inc. During Phase I: 1) a self-powered wireless cask monitor system was designed and modeled, 2) a prototype thermoelectric generator system was designed and implemented, 3) a diamond 85Kr radiation sensors was fabricated, 4) a design for integrating the sensor with wireless communications technology was developed, 5) a test apparatus and prototype monitoring system was constructed, and 6) the transfer of monitoring data from inside a sealed metal container was demonstrated. During Phase II, RMD will determine designs and components needed for the power distribution and management, radiation sensor, temperature sensor, pressure sensor, micro-controller and data transmitter, verify the operation of the components in a relevant temperature and radiation environment, and build a prototype. The principal customer for our system is the DOE and its counterparts around the world. Oak Ridge National laboratory estimates the number of casks in the U.S. is growing at a rate of 200/year. The annual discharge of fuel assemblies from the world's nuclear reactors is estimated to be 10,500 MTU. The world-wide cumulative quantity of generated spent fuel is expected to be more than 445,000 tHM by the end of 2020, with the U.S. contributing 88,000 MTU. Based on these growth rates, we estimate that there is an annual need for approximately 1,000 dry cask storage systems on a worldwide basis. We estimate that a complete system that will meet DOE\u2019s specifications will cost approximately $40,000. Therefore, the U.S. market is approximately $8 million and we estimate the worldwide market to be valued at $40 million annually.

        "abstract": "The market for syngas, an important intermediate for the synthesis of methanol, hydrogen, ammonia, and synthetic petroleum fuels, is expected to grow globally at a compound annual growth rate of more than 14% by 2020. The most widely used process for making syngas is steam reforming of methane; however, the process is energy intensive and is more expensive than the DOE\u2019s cost targets for the production of hydrogen. Syngas production through partial oxidation of methane is not as common as steam reforming but does have reduced energy costs. Short contact time partial oxidation of methane has been shown to have promise on the bench scale; however, achieving partial oxidation in practice is difficult due to the tendency to completely oxidize methane to CO2 and water. Reactive Innovations proposes to use the technology developed in Phase I to limit the oxygen delivery to a short contact time reactor for the selective production of syngas. During this Phase I program, a permeable, conductive oxygen conduit was developed for the plasma activated partial oxidation of methane. Use of these conductive conduits limited the oxygen delivery to the plasma zone and enabled the conversion of methane with high selectivity into desired products of hydrogen and hydrocarbons while limiting the over-oxidation to CO2 and water. Adding catalyst to the system increased product selectivity. Similar results for controlled partial oxidation of methane were seen when applying the oxygen conduit to the thermally activated process. The main focus of the Phase II program is to optimize the oxygen conduit and apply it to a high temperature process for the conversion of methane into syngas. This program will optimize the conversion efficiency, optimize the single channel oxygen conduit design, and develop/evaluate a multi-channel reactor system. A sub-task will be aimed at examining the use of the optimized oxygen conduits in a plasma-based process so that results can be compared to the thermal process. The benefits of the technology will be a more efficient method to react natural gas into valuable products such as syngas and other value added products. The use of a controlled oxygen delivery system also mitigates the need for a large O2/CH4 co-feed which becomes an explosion hazard when used on an industrial scale. In addition, the O2 delivery system allows for catalyst regeneration in-situ if necessary as it can deliver oxygen right to a deactivated catalyst surface.",

        "abstract": "With the evolution of the modern grid, energy will also be generated by thousands of microgrids composed of solar arrays, wind farms, and batteries.  In order to orchestrate the precise timing required to control energy flow, thousands of grid computing devices will need to be deployed at the edge \u2013 over wired and wireless/cellular networks. They will be running operating systems and software applications that will need to be periodically updated. All of these devices must be reliably and securely managed and monitored. Similar technology for IT systems will not work: the modern grid will have numerous owners, making standardization on one technology impossible. This also complicates securing the grid. This Phase II SBIR proposes a new approach that is device and software agnostic, enabling it to provide value over decades. To accomplish this we have created device configuration instructions that are independent of the underlying hardware, operating systems, and applications (devices become outdated in 10-15 years, in energy system terms). These instructions tell the devices how to configure their execution environments, the applications, and the security. Likened to building a house, we provide the detailed plans but leave the builder to implement them. The individual devices will have custom, device-specific, \u201cinstruction translation engines\u201d that will consume the instructions and understand how to interpret and follow them based upon the unique features and requirements of each device (likened to state/local home building codes). To ensure that these instructions are properly interpreted by the engines, detailed specifications and guidance will be provided to anyone developing them. Verification and validation of each engine will be required. In Phase I, we developed a complete prototype of our system. The system was composed of a mix of 15 ARM- based and Intel-based devices running different operating systems. We successfully deployed our platform agnostic configuration instructions, and the devices configured themselves (including retrieving code and data from remote, secured, application repositories). We monitored the real-time status of each device (such as CPU and memory utilization), along with their physical location on Google Maps. In Phase II, we will be working in close collaboration with a major utility with over 7 million customers, and the NAESB and SEPA energy bodies, to ensure our research is aligned with their requirements and use cases. We will use the funding to advance our prototype implementation and demonstrate it within the utility\u2019s high voltage substation test facility. We will contribute our software to the energy community to help drive adoption of the next-generation of modern grid standards (the NAESB Open Field Message Bus [OpenFMB]). This technology is relevant for other markets including defense, transportation infrastructure, and hospital medical device systems. The technology developed under this SBIR will be immediately applicable in several other commercial as well as government programs.

Graphite is the primary active anode component used in lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and constitutes 10-14% of the total cell cost.

In addition, the company\u2019s graphite features another very important characteristic: it enables fast charging of lithium-ion batteries \u2013 up to three times faster than standard anodes. Thus, as the project succeeds, it will provide two essential contributions that are fully aligned with the mission of the DOE Vehicle Technologies Office: contributing to reducing the cost of batteries for electric vehicles and dramatically improving charging performance. During Phase I, the company improved the performance of its graphite anode material by optimizing synthesis conditions and demonstrated long-term cycling stability on small full-cells. In Phase II of this SBIR project, three objectives will be met. The first objective is to further refine the graphite production process to maximize material performance. The second objective is to demonstrate fast charging capabilities and long-term cycling stability on larger, 2 Ah lithium-ion full cells. The third objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of this process at a small pilot scale, paving the way for further customer sampling and qualification, as well as providing necessary process data for a demonstration-scale plant design. Lower cost and improved battery charging will contribute to greater customer acceptance of electric vehicles, helping the deployment of clean energy technologies.

There exists an opportunity to significantly reduce the energy intensity of laundry detergents production and transportation through the design of a hierarchical catalyst material that can be used to precisely synthesize a new platform of renewable oleofuran surfactants with improved detergency properties. Conventionally, surfactants for laundry detergents are co-formulated with chelating agents, which help boost the detergency performance of a surfactant in hard water conditions, but add substantial cost, volume, and negative environmental impact. Through Phase I research, a new class of oleo-furan surfactants were identified to have 100x greater hard water stability compared with existing surfactants, meaning they can be used in detergent formulations free of chelating agents. This enables detergent products with up to 30% higher concentration, less cost, and lower energy requirements through a reduction in chemical production and transportation cost. The self-pillared pentasil catalyst materials in this proposal are designed to target the hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature of surfactant molecules and the large molecular size of natural oils with atomically precise pillared catalyst structures that mimic the binding pocket of an enzyme, increasing throughput by three orders of magnitude. Phase I research has demonstrated catalytic synthesis routes and best performing molecules for commercialization and scale up under a Phase II research project. The work outlined in this proposal aims to utilize new catalyst materials to selectively synthesize the oleo-furan surfactants in high yields using a scalable process design. The research will develop a new environmentally friendly and scalable synthesis process for the oleo-furan surfactant using atomically-precise hierarchical catalysts. Proposed experiments will use liquid phase catalytic systems to evaluate catalyst performance and structure-activity relationships. This Phase II research will develop a scalable process for synthesis and chemical separation and purification of the oleo-furan surfactant, enabling continued scale up and production.

        "abstract": "Refineries are the primary hydrogen consumer in the US. Over the last 30 to 40 years they have required more and more hydrogen to remove metals, sulfur and nitrogen from crude oil as well as upgrade heavy crude by breaking large molecules into smaller more valuable ones. Unfortunately, updating refineries to produce more hydrogen is expensive. TDA Research Inc. is developing a process that will allow refineries to produce hydrogen at less than half the energy expenditure (energy lost due to the process of conversion) and a cost that is considerably lower than conventional technologies, such as steam methane reforming (SMR). TDA\u2019s technology will permit refineries to convert less valuable bottom of the barrel feedstocks such as vacuum gas oil (VGO) and heavy feedstocks into valuable hydrogen, which will permit more valuable distillate fuels to be obtained from each barrel of crude oil. TDA Research Inc. tested multiple VGO steam reforming catalysts, optimized the hydrogen yield by performing statistically designed experiments, and demonstrated energy efficient hydrogen production, catalyst stability and cost effective performance. In Phase I we used our bench-scale, single bubbling fluidized bed reactor to simulate our novel reactor system, and demonstrated hydrogen generation from VGO for over 50 hours. We generated hydrogen (70% by volume on a dry basis) without any long-term catalyst deactivation. Based on our Phase I results, we then completed a design for a continuous VGO steam reforming system that we will build during Phase II. Finally, we developed an economic model of our process for generating hydrogen from VGO in an integrated oil refinery and compared it to generating the same amount of H2 using SMR. In Phase II, we will design and build a continuous VGO steam reforming system and measure its performance. The operating conditions and catalyst properties will be optimized for performance with the goal of improving the energy efficiency and reducing the cost of making H2. We will then perform a highly detailed technoeconomic analysis of the process with our industrial and commercial partners. The US oil refining industry is the largest in the world, utilizing 139 operating domestic refineries with a total capacity of 15.5 million barrels per day of crude oil. Energy costs are a major factor in operating refineries, currently about 30%. Increasing energy efficiency will reduce costs, and greenhouse gas and other emissions. TDA\u2019s VGO steam reforming technology reduces energy demands during refining and increases the energy efficiency of hydrogen production in the refinery.",

On the other hand, increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration caused by the fossil fuel combustion are causing  concerns regarding global warming. Although there are several methods for separating CO2 from the flue gases at existing coal-fired power plants, all of them have significant drawbacks, including loss of efficiency and increased capital and operating costs that dramatically increase the cost of electricity. TDA Research, Inc.

During Phase II we continued to improve the performance of our sorbent. We scaled-up its production using commercial manufacturing techniques. We optimized the reactor design to significantly reduce the pressure drop (and hence the parasitic losses). In collaboration with MTR, we built an integrated hybrid membrane-sorbent prototype unit that allowed us to remove 90% of CO2 (2.5 kg/hr) from a 2 to 5 SCFM flue gas stream. We completed more than 250 hours of operation with the prototype unit. We also completed a detailed engineering analysis showing that the cost of CO2 capture by the hybrid membrane- sorbent system is $35.5 per tonne on $2011 basis. A field test with the prototype unit is scheduled in June 2017 at WRI to evaluate the efficacy of the hybrid system using actual coal-derived flue gas. In the Phase IIB effort, we will design and fabricate a fully-automated hybrid membrane-sorbent system, capable of treating 250 SCFM (0.1 MW equivalent) of flue gas. We will carry out extended tests in our facilities to optimize the operation of the unit and get it ready for the field tests. We then evaluate the performance of the system using actual coal-derived flue gas from a power plant. We will then update the design of the hybrid membrane-sorbent system, obtaining accurate cost estimates from vendors. CO2 is a major greenhouse gas and the most dominant source for the anthropogenic CO2 emissions. It is a by-product of the combustion of fossil fuels, in particular burning coal for generating electricity. The proposed technology will provide a cost effective way to control CO2 emissions from the existing and  new coal-fired power plants. There will be a large market when legislation limiting or taxing carbon emissions is put in place.",

        "abstract": "Next generation power systems require greater flexibility in their operations for meeting the higher efficiency  and lower emissions conditions that are geared toward meeting consumer demand and adhering to increased regulatory standards, simultaneously. Devices that can accurately measure the solid flow rate of an operating multi-phase flow system would be of great aid for optimizing and controlling the energy generation processes in advanced reactors. Presently, the availability of such devices, particularly at high temperatures and pressures, is very limited. Electrical Capacitance Volume Tomography (ECVT) has emerged as a viable technology for addressing instrumentation requirements in various energy related multi-phase flow systems. ECVT, in its basic form, is based on passive sensors that measure flow components in real-time. Advanced instrumentation requires active capacitance sensors that can change their design; toward higher measurement accuracy;  based on process variables. In this Phase II A effort, we will continue building a functional prototype of an Adaptive Electrical Capacitance Volume Tomography (AECVT) system for mass-flow gauging of solids or liquids in energy reactors at high pressures and temperatures. AECVT is distinguished from ECVT in its ability to incorporate intelligence in the sensor formations. This feature enables the sensors to change their design, electronically, toward higher measurement resolution. It also allows artificial intelligence algorithms to be incorporated in instrumentations that use AECVT sensors. Using AECVT, mass flow measurements at 5% spatial resolution and 1 Hz temporal resolution will be possible. Phase II A will address further R&D activities required to develop the first prototype. On Phase I and II, the electronic hardware was developed and fabricated for the first adaptive system. Phase II A involve testing of the developed hardware, intelligent algorithm development, and fabrication of high temperature/pressure adaptive sensor for demonstration, software development with graphical user interface, and testing of fully integrated demonstration system. Benefits of this technology include spurring economic growth by introducing a new intelligent instrumentation to the market, helping the advancement of energy generation process by providing accurate real-time flow information to process operators, increasing efficiencies in various energy generating processes, and controlling emissions for safer operation of energy plants.",

        "abstract": "Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation has now become a commonplace tool for simulating plasma ki- netics, but there are constraints on its effectiveness \u2013 timesteps must be small to avoid numerical instabilities, and the number of particles required to reduce statistical noise to acceptable levels may be computationally prohibitive. In plasmas with many multistate ion species, even determin- ing dominant kinetic interactions in the system may be difficult. Speed-limited PIC (SLPIC) methods which constrain the speed of the fastest simulation parti- cles (enabling larger timesteps) are developed. Kinetics-only delta-f methods, which model cold- plasma evolution as a fluid and use PIC only to capture warm-plasma effects, are explored for noise reduction. A global modeling code (GSim) is developed which can be run as a precursor to more complex PIC models as a means of determining key physics interactions in the system. Phase I primarily focused on the SLPIC method, which was shown to reduce wallclock times in simulations of electrostatic sheath formation by factors of 6 or greater, and in simulations of plasma free expansion into vacuum by factors of 2.5. Single-particle drift behaviors of SLPIC particles were shown to be correct except in cases where rapid time variation of the electromagnetic fields (e.g. in polarization drifts or particle loss rates) introduces inaccuracies. SLPIC and KODF implementations in VSim will be validated and exercised separately and in tan- dem to explore the physics of plasma-vacuum expansion and of finite-temperature effects in fusion plasmas heated by RF waves. Global modeling capabilities (e.g. for power balance or principal- path chemistry computations in low-temperature plasmas) will be developed and exercised. Developing faster and lower-noise VSim PIC modeling capabilities enables its use as a design tool for plasma manufacturing equipment, filling a need in the industrial plasma processing community for scalable computational kinetic models. Industrial plasma processing customers can use the software to more rapidly design and optimize equipment to carry out increasingly complex manu- facturing processes, using GSim as a scoping tool to determine optimal machine parameter spaces. Additionally, by studying the behavior of RF physics in fusion plasmas, we will be able to broaden the physics understanding that serves as a basis for complex fusion experiments such as ITER, a multibillion-dollar device presently under construction.",

First principles continuum diffusion model was demonstrated in USim to predict the growth of the 2d layered nanoparticles. Experiments were set up, graphene was synthesized, characterized and the plasma discharge parameters were measured. The trends predicted by the simulations showed good agreement with the experiments. A robust and comprehensive simulation package will be developed for the predictive synthesis of nanoparticles.

        "abstract": "Innovative process development is needed to reliably deposit superconducting niobium films possessing performance capabilities near those of bulk niobium on less costly copper accelerator component structures such as cavities, complex couplers, and nosecones as an alternative to solid bulk niobium. Unlike bulk or thick-film niobium, most thin-film coatings do not afford practical post-coating surface conditioning options. Thin-film niobium coatings on copper are prone to copper diffusion through the entire ~5-\u03bcm coating thickness and poor thermal contact, limiting their use to low- to medium-gradient applications. Niobium-coated copper fabrication technologies for cost-effective high-gradient superconducting radio frequency (SRF) components are needed for the economic viability of future accelerator facilities. Ultramet, in collaboration with Cornell University\u2019s SRF Group, is demonstrating thick-film (~150 \u00b5m) chemical vapor deposited (CVD) niobium on OFHC copper that is compatible with state-of-the-art cavity surface  conditioning methods and has great potential to achieve bulk-like performance capabilities for use in high-gradient applications, but at lower cost by minimizing or eliminating many costly, time-consuming, and often performance- limiting fabrication steps as well as affording an estimated 90-95% reduction in the amount of niobium required. The feasibility of depositing thick-film niobium layers on OFHC copper using lower temperature CVD was demonstrated. The 30- to 150-\u00b5m CVD niobium coatings were shown to be diffusion bonded to the copper, and interdiffusion analysis showed that the bulk of the coating thickness remained pure niobium even after elevated temperature exposure for extended periods. Coating adherence was excellent, and the coated surface looked similar to bulk niobium. The BCS portion of surface resistance was good. Residual surface resistance was elevated, but this was not related to RRR and was likely due to surface inclusions that can be reduced or eliminated by conditioning. Process variables deemed critical for material optimization, process scaling, and accelerator cavity and component fabrication and conditioning efforts were identified. Ultramet will team with Cornell and Niowave to fabricate and characterize multiple single-cell 1.3-GHz SRF test cavities of the ILC design utilizing the newly developed lower temperature CVD niobium process. The CVD niobium on copper fabrication methodology will be scaled to produce testable flanged niobium-lined copper cavities. Extensive cavity characterization including temperature mapping, post-test dissection, and surface material analysis will be performed by Cornell. Ultramet will generate cost estimates for 1.3-GHz CVD niobium-lined copper ILC single-cell cavity fabrication as a cost indicator for complete 9-cell ILC cavities. Ultramet\u2019s thick-film niobium CVD process is uniquely well-suited for coating complex SRF accelerator component geometries because the virtually 100% dense coatings are formed on the substrate at the molecular level and purity levels in excess of 99.99% are achievable. The CVD coating process exhibits the greatest throwing power, or ability to uniformly deposit materials onto/into intricately shaped or textured substrates. This research is a necessary step toward the commercial and scientific application of advanced accelerator component-forming technologies that represents a significant technical milestone in developing reliable fabrication techniques for reproducible niobium- lined copper accelerator components offering high-gradient operation and substantial cost reduction for SRF applications worldwide. Large quantities of superconducting radio frequency components are needed for use in particle accelerators in fields as diverse as high-energy physics and airport security. Advanced chemical vapor deposition processing is being developed for economical fabrication of high-performance and low-cost thick-film niobium-lined copper accelerator components, representing a paradigm shift in SRF component manufacturing.",

The overall goal of the entire SBIR project is to transfer the in-line Activation Station (AS) technology from the laboratory level through design, manufacturing and field testing of the AS pre-production prototype. Based on feedback from commercial customers the required improvements in the laboratory AS prototype were identified as keys to commercialize the AS tool. Specific objectives of the Phase IIB include: (1) upgrade the AS tool hardware to improve AS reliability, accuracy and maintenance, (2) upgrade AS tool operational software to allow hand shaking with in-line commercial equipment, (3) improve throughput and insure AS applicability to different shapes and types of silicon substrates, and (4) integrate AS tool in the solar module production line. By completing Phase IIB project the AS technology will progress from the current    Technology Readiness Level TRL5 to TRL7. Silicon solar module technology represents a quickly growing national and world- wide energy market. One of the current technological problems that face solar module manufacturers is identification and elimination of sources of mechanical defects such as sub-millimeter length seed cracks which lead to the loss of integrity in a silicon wafer or solar cell and their ultimate in-line breakage. The problem is of increased concern in light of the current strategy of reducing cell substrate thickness down to 100 \u00b5m in the long term, from the current range of 150 to 180 \u00b5m. The inspection method is grounded on a novel methodology for advanced crack inspection using the AS concept integrated with Resonance Ultrasonic Vibration system. The AS fundamentally relies on an accurately controlled    mechanical stress applied to a substrate and measurement of the elastic force response. The research program is based on proven feasibility obtained in Phase I, which established that: (i) the AS method is applicable to both silicon solar and ceramic fuel cells; (ii) the method sensitivity depends on crack location and covers up to 96% of the wafer area supported by computer modeling; (iii) the speed of AS components can be matched to a throughput of production lines. In Phase II, the following tasks were completed: (a) AS tool configuration (system\u2019s component hardware and software) optimized, (b) laboratory AS tool integrated into automatic Resonance Ultrasonic Vibrations system, (c) statistical algorithm for crack inspection developed and implemented in the tool\u2019s software, and (d) the in-line AS prototype tested in solar module and fuel cell production with statistically verified yield improvement.",

In this program, SiC switches are being developed as they are the key component to enable the electronics needed to meet this need. In 2016, over 700,000 plug-in electric vehicles were sold, which includes a 30% and 100% increase from 2015 in the leading EV markets of US and China respectively. It is expected that by 2023, there will be ~3.2 million plug-in electric vehicles on the road in the U.S. alone. The EV Everywhere initiative has set the goal to make electric vehicles as affordable as gasoline vehicles by 2022. To meet the goals, the costs for batteries, motor and electric drive train must be reduced while simultaneously reducing weight. Increasing the drive train conversion efficiency has a significant impact as it extends battery life, increases vehicle range and allows for a reduction of heavy cooling components through the reduction of heat generating losses. Therefore, increasing the efficiency of the inverter that drives the electric motor is needed and it is well known that inverter efficiency and power density can be increased while simultaneously reducing weight through the use of silicon carbide (SiC) devices. Electric vehicle motor drive applications require high current power modules while cost effective SiC devices have been limited to lower currents (",

Without adequate potable water, society succumbs to human suffering i.e. dehydration, disease and inevitably limited supply results in human conflict. There is therefore a need for an efficient, and cost effective method of producing quality potable water from low grade sources such as brackish or sea water serving small populations and isolated communities. The Company\u2019s aim is bringing to commercial reality a reasonably low cost, high efficiency method of generating high quality potable water suitable for these small populations and isolated communities. The Company\u2019s concept is to create a small scale integrated system for potable water supply using a custom water permeable ionomer membrane based vacuum assisted pervaporation distillation system coupled to passive solar non-potable water heating, to improve water purification rate. The system is further integrated with photovoltaic panels and a backup power system (electrolyzer/fuel cell) to make itself contained as well as on-demand electrochemical Ozone production to maintain the purity of the clean water produced. In Phase I the Company demonstrated that the potable water produced by our custom membrane pervaporation system is exceedingly pure, having less than 1/10 the salinity allowed as drinking water and, due to the nanoscale ionomer channels, full elimination of pathogens.  The Company\u2019s single stage, PEM Distillation system with integrated Ozone Disinfection system demonstrated many key features including (a) higher water purity, (b) 50% lower electrical demand, (c) total grid independence (and autonomy), (e) smaller overall footprint, (f) integrated hot water production, (g) the ability to efficiently process a wider range of saline water streams and (h) the ability to use low grade heating in the form of solar (water) heating that is very prevalent in developing nations. In phase II, the Company will develop and install a fully functional, independent, integrated, scalable and highly efficient 100-gallon / day membrane based vacuum desalination system utilizing passive thermal heating & enthalpy of vaporization recycling, providing the highest purity, sanitized via insitu disinfection, potable water (with optional hot water delivery) from seawater. Phase II development focuses on improved component performance, cost reduction and reduction to commercialization to reach the performance and cost goals allowing commercial success. Utilizing current technology, the small commercial desalination plants utilized in Antigua and Barbuda provide potable water at roughly 10x the cost of the large-scale plants in Singapore and Israel. There is both a human need and a commercial need for low cost small desalination plants which our technology addresses. In addition to the U.S. needs in rural and isolated areas such as outlying islands, there is a large need worldwide. While very large scale Reverse Osmosis with disinfection such as used high population density areas along a shore line is very cost effective, The Company\u2019s technology fits into the small town, island, single home scale where current water solutions are high cost and with high environmental impact.",

        "abstract": "The search for rare-events, such as double beta decay or dark matter detections, is primarily a fight to reduce the incidence of background events to sufficiently low levels so that the events of interest can be seen. Background sources include trace radioisotopes found within the materials used to construct, support, and shield these experiments, and any surface contamination caused by exposure to atmospheric radon. Direct detection of alpha emission is necessary to accurately characterize surface contamination on these ultra-pure materials, but available screening techniques do not have sufficient sensitivity at the levels required. The DOE \u2013 a major supporter of rare-event search activities \u2013 therefore has an active interest in the development of ultra low activity materials. By extension, there is also an active interest in developing instrumentation for characterizing such materials, since it is impossible to improve something that cannot be measured. We propose to develop an instrument to characterize radiopure materials for surface alpha emission, whose detection limit will be over 100 times lower than that of the best commercially available instruments. XIA manufactures and sells the UltraLo-1800 alpha particle counter (UltraLo), the present state-of-the-art in low background alpha particle detection. The proposed approach converts an UltraLo from an ionization chamber into a small-scale time projection chamber (TPC) to extract additional signal information and push achievable background rates towards 1 \uf061/day/m2, without shielding, at the earth\u2019s surface. We began by converting our two-channel UltraLo into a 64-channel small scale TPC built around a new electrode design comprised of an 8x8 array of 1.3 cm square pixels, each individually connected to a preamplifier. We developed a new preamplifier design whose noise performance was improved by a factor of 4 and is now limited by the FET input capacitance. Signals generated by an alpha source placed in the TPC were captured and shown to match those predicted by our simulations. Analyzing these data, we demonstrated that noise levels were sufficiently low to allow emission points to be localized, ionization track orientations determined, and charge distributions identified \u2013 our Phase I proof of principle goals. Finally, we produced a cost effective design for a 1600 channel full-scale TPC instrument, capable of achieving background rates approaching 1 \uf061/day/m2. If successful, this instrument\u2019s direct benefit will be its support of a variety of rare-event experiments seeking to expand our understanding of the universe\u2019s basic operating principles. Moreover, the enhancements made to the capabilities of the UltraLo will provide a significant performance advantage in other areas, including environmental remediation alpha measurements, and the semiconductor industry where controlling alpha activity from packaging materials is critical to increasing device reliability. The US plays a leading role in scientific research seeking to expand our understanding of the universe\u2019s basic operating principles. This work furthers these efforts by providing scientists with a major improvement in instrumentation to support the next generation of sensitive experiments.",

        "abstract": "To minimize the impact of each distributed solar installation on the grid (and hence, to increase the use of solar everywhere), customers must be able to use a greater percentage of the energy generated by their own solar panels within their own building or facility.  Currently, systems within commercial and industrial facilities are poorly adapted to this objective. PV production is often monitored, but that information is seldom used by on-site systems such as building energy controls, lighting controls, storage systems, or any other potentially flexible loads within a facility. In this project, the EE Team will develop an extensible, modular software prototype to take advantage of electrical load flexibility in each major facility subsystem that will maximize local use of locally-generated solar energy. In Phase I, the Extensible Energy (EE) Team created a proof-of-concept simulation model that demonstrated significant savings in both energy and demand charges for a modeled office building with a behind-the-meter solar installation. This Phase I model employs an advanced Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm that simulated control of heating ventilation and cooling (HVAC) controls, lighting controls, stationary storage (e.g., a single large battery), and EV charging stations in conjunction with realistic variability in PV output. These results show savings can be achieved much more cost-effectively by varying building loads than by use of battery storage systems alone. In Phase II, the EE Team will adapt the core components of our Phase I simulation to a cloud platform to build a prototype of the Solar Load Balancing Software (SLoBS). The EE Team will develop interface modules for SLoBS which will enable the software to control multiple energy usage subsystems. EE will then conduct a field test of the complete SLoBS prototype by controlling energy usage in response to varying solar output in a real building. The proposed research fits well with DOE\u2019s stated interest in increasing the penetration of distributed solar everywhere my maximizing local use of locally-generated solar energy. This Solar Load Balancing Software (SLoBS) will help vendors of lighting controls, building controls, solar arrays, storage systems, and numerous other technologies to identify new opportunities to offset solar variability and increase the adoption of distributed solar.

        "abstract": "Enable a new electrical grid control architecture that is decentralized and flexible, allowing increased      Distributed Energy Resources (DER) (generation) AND Demand-Side Management (usage) to be managed on the last mile of the grid or the \u2018grid edge\u2019. Using autonomous distributed edge intelligence software is a radical new approach to increasing the control of DER in the grid providing real-time grid optimization. The problem to be investigated here is confirming the dynamic stability of a decentralized and autonomous system approach. The method proposed uses market-based economic principals to balance the systems competing demands including energy balance concerns (supply and demand) and engineering performance criteria. It uses a fractal grid architecture with control algorithms that are self- similar (fractal) at multiple levels of the grid. Real-time pricing signals are developed at pricing nodes and broadcast to lower edge devices that make independent, local, and real-time control decisions. In Phase 1, a new grid architecture (Fractal Grid Control) was developed and fully detailed. The design was also tested to determine how these new real-time pricing signals would enhance adoption of the technology and DER. Lastly, the project explored the development of algorithms for the edge devices, proving that edge control was feasible. The proposed project\u2019s objective is to confirm the dynamic stability of an operational microgrid using the fractal grid architecture developed in phase I coupled with real-time pricing signals (transactive energy system) to manage the electrical grid, autonomously balance demand/supply, and keep the system engineering requirements within acceptable tolerances. The project is developed around Brunswick Landing, a former Naval Air Station run by the Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority. The current business park will be fully characterized from an engineering standpoint with 45 smart grid sensors as data to be fed into a three level simulation of the Fractal Grid Control architecture. This will confirm that autonomously developed real-time pricing can provide for effective, dynamically stable control of the grid from the edge. Commercialized, the new grid architecture and control algorithms enables distributed intelligence in the electrical grid while being inherently secure, reduces transmission losses, increases efficiency, optimize energy demand distribution, and makes large-scale distributed energy a reality. This project and the innovations developed in the process can also be used in managing transportation for smart cities; helping the US become more efficient.",

        "abstract": "Advanced instrumentation for energy processes is critical for improving efficiencies, controlling emissions, and optimizing process control. Multiphase flow processes are an integral part of almost all energy generation systems. Monitoring and controlling energy generation multiphase flow processes requires instrumentation that can withstand the harsh conditions of energy processes, is noninvasive, easy to implement, can be scaled to various dimensions, and can be operated in different multiphase flow combinations of gases, liquids, and solids. Such solutions are currently scarce and very expensive. Electrical Capacitance Volume Tomography (ECVT) has emerged recently as a viable solution for     advanced multiphase flow instrumentation. The overall approach of Phase I/Phase II project involved developing ECVT sensors and algorithms to withstand the harsh conditions of energy processes. That effort concluded with a demonstration unit capable of withstanding temperatures up to 900C for a gas-solid flow system. The unit was used to demonstrate operation on a multiphase flow system of air/iron-oxide flow in a Chemical looping reactor. Algorithms were also developed to calculate the mass flow rate in this gas-solid reactor. In this sequential Phase IIB project, we intend to expand the application of ECVT technology beyond gas-solid applications. In the year after concluding the first Phase II effort and developing the first prototype; we received purchase orders from customer interested in the gas-liquid and gas-solid-liquid applications. The plan in Phase II B is to further develop the ECVT technology and work on a prototype for those applications. The conditions for those new applications involve high pressures, high temperatures, and liquid phases. The liquids nature of those applications requires more research and development to adapt the first prototype design, materials and algorithms to address this need. (attached are two purchase orders we received, one for a geothermal gas- liquid application and the other for gas-liquid-solid application in the Oil industry) Future commercial applications involve a variety of multiphase flow instrumentation for phase measurement of liquid flow rate in geothermal pipes, Oil flow rate in Oil pipelines, Solid flow rates in feedstock feeders, and three phase measurements in advanced energy processes. Those applications are crucial to advancing the energy industry and spurring economic growth.",

        "abstract": "The life expectancy of offshore wind turbines is at least 20 years, during which they must operate optimally with respect to power production, minimization of mechanical stresses, plant wake distribution, and more in a range of atmospheric conditions. These conditions are currently observed using meteorological masts, which provide inadequate observations, thus resulting in suboptimal turbine design and operation. The blades of the tallest offshore wind turbines, Vestas\u2019 V164-8.0 MW, are currently reaching 195 meters at Burbo Bank Extension wind farm in England, and experts predict that further cost reductions of wind power will mostly be achieved through increases in turbine size. As turbine size increases, meteorological towers are no longer cost-effective, and the value proposition for using meteorological masts alone is rapidly vanishing. Pressure from grid operators demanding more accurate power scheduling from wind farm operators and pressure to reduce the cost of offshore wind energy are making remote sensing devices increasingly attractive. Microwave radiometers can provide thermodynamic measurements within the marine atmospheric boundary layer most economically. Development costs for this technology, capable of providing vertical profiles of temperature and humidity, cloud parameters, and integrated measurement of the liquid water content of the atmosphere, are less than the cost of one offshore meteorological mast of modest height. The cost of a fully equipped buoy for observation of wind and thermodynamic variables within the marine atmospheric boundary layer is approximately one tenth of the cost of a meteorological mast. In addition, such a buoy would provide more complete information about the status of the atmosphere than a met mast, requires less permitting, and could be relocated easily. Preliminary design of the Marine Profiling Radiometer (MPR) was finalized during Phase I, culminating in a robust, autonomous instrument, capable of operating on a buoy in the corrosive marine environment without maintenance for more than half a year. Its power consumption, size, and weight were determined, and a conceptual design for mechanical attachment to the WindSentinel FLiDAR 6M buoy was finalized with AXYS Technologies, including the electrical power interface, communications format, and data transfer to the shore. Improved, more localized, offshore or near-shore weather forecasts have a broader societal impact, with beneficiaries including the general public, aviation, marine transportation, renewable energy producers, electrical utilities, energy traders, and others. During Phase II we will build two prototypes of the MPR and prove its observational value through comparison with other remote sensing and in-situ instruments at an atmospheric observatory.",

More modern applications include ship and tank-mounted weapons, as well as systems that hold weapons which are usually man-operated.  One aspect common to all of these systems is an absolute position command.  A user selects a target or a direction, and then the system holds the weapon in the proper orientation.

The separator material will be a non-corroding and protective against toxicity of electrolyte. This advanced separator will also demonstrate excellent thermal stability over a range of temperature (-32C to 250C), and strength to withstand battery manufacturing operation.

The costs to mitigate combustion instability can be extremely large due the need to rely upon hardware intensive build and test efforts.  This combination of high likelihood, high severity, and high cost that makes combustion instability a critical risk factor in the development of missile defense systems.     The breakthrough Universal Combustion Device Stability (UCDS) process provides detailed insight into the dynamics of a rocket motor that allows engineers to reliably predict the oscillation characteristics of a combustion device.  In this effort, GTL will be applying UCDS to evaluate the stability characteristics of a solid rocket motor and identify features that could be adjusted to alter the motor behavior.  In addition to demonstrating UCDS effectiveness for this application, the effort will improve the understanding of combustion instability physics in solid rocket motors and provide engineering guidance on how to develop better motors.

No existing detector meets these demanding performance parameters. Phase I successfully designed and demonstrated an octave spanning (3-6 m) III-V based MWIR detector using a barrier diode architecture with excellent NEP meeting spec at 200K. Phase II will optimize the MWIR (3-6 m) detector design and fabrication process, and will design, manufacture and test a LWIR detector combining the properties of SWIR pin and MWIR/LWIR photodetectors in a way that harvests the advantages of each so that all performance requirements are met. Specifically, we will construct detectors with a built-in field in the absorber layer to rapidly sweep out carriers and a patented barrier layer architecture to suppress dark current. Phase II will further develop both MWIR (3-6 m) and LWIR (6-15 m) prototype detector systems with integrated thermo-electric cooler (TEC), focusing lens and high-bandwidth, low-noise transimpedance amplifier.

        "abstract": "Corrosion is a ubiquitous phenomenon causing the degradation and failure of crucial infrastructure.  It is known that in a metallic structure undergoing galvanic corrosion, impinging RF signals can be non-linearly mixed together in metal-to-metal contacts, leading to the emission of intermodulation products of these RF signals. In our Phase I effort, Tanner demonstrated an approach that monitored IM signals from corroded sites to detect and track progress of corrosion.   As corrosion progresses and degrades the material properties of these sites, distinct signatures are seen in the IM signals, providing a path towards identifying and tracking the progression of corrosion, even in hidden or unexposed areas.  In Phase II, Tanner proposes to design, assemble, characterize, and deliver a corrosion detection prototype capable of monitoring galvanic corrosion on metallic surfaces from stand-off distances.  Tanner will deliver a handheld prototype that can be used to inspect the location of interest, collect these signals, analyze them, and display the results to the operator through a graphical user interface. The proposed prototype will be characterized on a variety of both lab and real-world corroded samples to validate the operation of the instrument before delivery to MDA.

The militarys mission means that hazards cannot always be predicted since service often occurs in a wide array of uncontrolled environments. The usual first line of defense, area monitoring, is not applicable due to the variable workplace facing the military. Thus, personal dosimeters are required that measure a person's exposure to chemicals by testing the air that the person breathes regardless of location. Since many of potential threats are unpredictable and possibly have never before been identified, it is necessary that a personal dosimeter can gather, store, and stabilize vapors from broad array of chemical compounds with widely varying chemical properties. Finally, the logistics of obtaining supplies and power, and the requirement for ruggedness impose a definite requirement for a light passive dosimeter that can be attached to a uniform. To meet these requirements, a universal passive dosimeter based on a mesoporous material containing a variety of different surface coatings will be constructed and tested.  These materials will selectively trap toxins and only release them with the application of heat.  Such universal passive dosimeters will safeguard the health of military personnel and detecting emerging problems before they become critical.",

        "abstract": "Traditional weapon systems often fail to meet the requirements of close combat typical of the previously discussed engagement, where insurgents often blend in or store weapon amongst friendly or non-combatant forces, to shield them from precision strike munitions of a technologically superior force. This type of warfare has led to an increased focus on the use of less-lethal weapons, to reduce lethal fire and casualties which translates well to that of CBW threat. Often, it is possible to cause release of an active CBW from the confining structure of a production due to blast and overpressure if a tradition high explosive weapon is used. The resulting facility or containment vessel breech can result in a CBW laced plume which can have disastrous consequences. To combat this risk, Hyperion Technology Group (Hyperion) in partnership with Battelle propose to further expand the successful work completed under the Phase I SBIR High Power Munitions to Attack and Defeat Weapons of Mass Destruction contract number HDTRA-1-15-P-0058 to develop a second generation X-ray system and conduct a series of static arena test against targets of interest to demonstrate the utility of a fully developed weaponized X-ray source for use as a Directed Energy Weapon on",

While these new tourniquets have been developed, validated, and approved for use, training systems that teach and refresh skills related to these technologies have only been partially addressed. These training systems are vital because these skills are critical but infrequently used. To address these needs, we are developing Tourniquet Master Training (TMT), a scenario-based training system featuring (1) a reconfigurable sensor system linked to a software-based virtual mentor that provides objective assessment during training, and (2) a mobile mentor that provides refresher training.

It is compact, simple in concept, and the data product is nearly immune to long-term degradation because it collects solar and lunar signals using the same optics in the same way.

The development of fast instrumentation and measurement capabilities that can readily be integrated into the extreme conditions present under such test conditions is one of several major technological challenges associated with the design, building, and operation of these complex test environments.  Spatially and temporally resolved measurements of velocity, density and temperature remain significant yet essential challenges in these facilities.

        "abstract": "Highway-rail grade crossings, at which there is an abrupt change in the level of the road surface as it crosses the tracks, present a severe hang-up risk to vehicles with low ground clearance. In Phase I and II, ATR developed a conceptual design for a Low Ground Clearance Vehicle Detection System (LGCVDS) to actively prevent such accidents. The LGCVDS is able to use a priori crossing profile data and measurements of the vehicle underbody profile in order to assess hang-up risk and warn the vehicle driver of the hazard. The Phase IIB effort extends this capability to support route planners in order to completely avoid risky crossings. By leveraging low cost in-vehicle navigation systems and low cost sensors that are becoming available on mobile platforms, the LGCVDS can provide a significant benefit to both commercial trucking companies and non-commercial vehicle operators by reducing the cost and time for transporting their payloads.\n\nA cloud based service will be developed under the Phase IIB program that enables third party route planners and navigation systems to incorporate vehicle hang-up risks.\n",

        "abstract": "A strong need exists to protect the US, its deployed forces and allies against all ranges of enemy ballistic missiles in all phases of flight. Current methodologies tend to use prior fixed measurements and features for identifying missiles and cannot adapt/change decision logic based on new information collected during an engagement which is critical as tactical operational environments are often different from those used to collect or generate sample data. Our proposed solution entails a novel adaptable cognitive algorithm approach that synthesizes current signature information from the radar and auxiliary information, such as DTED/GIS, target operating characteristics, prior flight profiles, etc., to provide feedback, through a sensor resource manager, to empower the adaptive modification of the next radar collection mode ensuring that the future collected signature will aid in maintaining or increasing the confidence level of the current target identification. The target recognition paradigm uses a blend of template-, feature- and model-based paradigms blended through a hierarchical information tree approach. As most research today focuses on prior collection data and known system parameters, our innovative adaptive cognitive approach will enable high-confidence target identification reporting through the provision of a robust architecture that excels under multiple normal and extenuating operating conditions.

While these tools help missile defense planners learn the skills they need to construct defense designs, they use static, scripted scenarios that do not provide the variety and complexity that Warfighters must encounter to construct resilient defense designs that address complex and unanticipated adversary attacks. The MDA needs a training system that will develop these skills. In Phase I, we designed and demonstrated the feasibility of Remediation for Adaptive Missile Planning through Gamified Resilience Training (RAMPART) by constructing an underlying game framework and several example training scenarios to illustrate useful training modalities. We propose to build on this work by developing and evaluating a full-scope RAMPART prototype that will provide game-based training with broad and dynamic training scenarios generated using mixed-initiative scenario authoring and evaluated with grounded metrics for scenario performance and trainee skill. Scenarios are integrated in a game-based trainer that combines several game modes to challenge trainees and develop advanced planning skills.

In order to defend against this threat, the Ballistics Missile Defense System (BMDS) has been developed to intercept the targets. The construct of using multiple interceptors on a single target is both costly and taxing on the BMDS command control. However, implementation of Multi-Object Kill Vehicles (MOKVs) on a single interceptor is a force multiplier with the potential to overcome the difficult countermeasure challenges. The LoadPath Multiple Object Deployment System (MODS) is an advanced mechanism that will enable implementation of reliable restraint and deployment of multiple Kill Vehicle (KV) payloads on a single interceptor in a precise, predictable, and repeatable manner. Unlike existing systems utilizing a single KV launched as necessary, our approach is designed for multiple KVs aboard a single interceptor that will counter demanding target scenes and ballistic missile threats.  MODS provides a fast-acting, compact, integrated design that addresses a wide range of operational engagement scenarios. Its modular, resettable design allows easy implementation with a variety of missile defense boosters, as well as significantly improving the assembly, integration, test, and flight operations.

        "abstract": "Technical Abstract (Limit your abstract to 200 words with no classified or proprietary information) Injury and death of marine mammals can be caused by ship strikes and exposure to high level acoustic sources.  It is incumbent upon all U.S. mariners to take whatever precautions necessary to avoid such incidents.  The current procedure for mitigating these events is human observers watching with binoculars.  To tackle this problem more effectively an automated solution is desired.  Aret Associates will develop a Multi-sensor Autonomous Marine Mammal Adaptive Locator (MAMMAL) which will use inputs from radar, IR and EO systems.  This data will be processed using advanced registration, detection and tracking algorithms to identify marine mammals at ranges of 1000 yards.  For this direct to Phase II we will leverage our marine mammal radar tracking experience and our IR/EO fusion experience to develop and demonstrate a prototype system.",

Having competed the effort of designing the magnetic braking and electric taxiing system in Phase 1, the Team is able to look back and take account the Program goals, accomplishments, and necessary next steps in order to bring the proposed design to fruition. The team is seeking approval from the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and NAVAIR in order to move forward with a Phase 2 proposal to build and test the proposed braking solution. The goal of the Phase 2 would be to design, build and test a full scale brake that is able to provide the necessary torques in order to stop a to be identified Navy aircraft. During Phase 2, we would work closely with DLA and NAVAIR to identify and redefine the candidate Navy airframe for eddy brake integration. We will define the operating envelope, weights, and other important braking parameters such as the normal and RTO landing conditions for the aircraft.",

Our modularized approach utilizes four 250W Bricks combined through a waveguide combiner. Future growth potential to 2000W output power was also demonstrated by extending the power level of the Bricks to 500W. The extended capacity is used to provide reserved capacity that can be activated if any of the PA units fail. The modularized approach along with reserved capacity demonstrated an extended MTBF along with graceful degradation characteristics and hot-swapping capability. The proposed system will maximize the reliability, sustainability, and supportability, leading to a reduction of overall life-cycle cost.  As for the active device, MMIC power amplifier capable of 70W of output power is proposed and designed in the necessary frequency band. The Bricks that will integrate eight 70W MMICs and combines output power into a waveguide port is proposed. Its building block of 2 and 4 way combiners were built and demonstrated in Phase I. Final module will consist of four of these Bricks, cooling system made of heat pipe network, and Ethernet communication system for various status and command of functions.

        "abstract": "The United States Aegis Weapon System (AWS) uses the Link16 waveform for communications. The throughput and latency of the system is limited due to time division multiple access on the predefined timeslots and frequency division multiple access on the 51 channels available for the network groups (NETs) and their Network Participation Groups (NPGs). As the number of terminals, NPGs, and NETs all increase, the individual throughput degrades and the latency increases. The current system lacks the capabilities of sensing the quality of the slots across the channels, which contributes to the reduced throughput. Our approach brings in our state-of-the-art spectrum sensing algorithms that can detect signals at low levels. Once the signals are detected, their properties are classified and are passed to the spectrum activity analyzer. The spectrum activity analyzer matches the detected signals with previously seen signals in its database. By comparing the current activity with historical measurements, it anticipates what the spectrum activity might be for the next communication block. Our new timeslot reallocation scheduler and NET planning tool will utilize both the RF sensing data and dynamic traffic demands to maximize successful transmissions. Finally, our solution is software based and requires no hardware modifications on the radio.  Approved for Public Release | 16-MDA-8951 (15 December 16)",

        "abstract": "Concern has been raised over the prevalence of behavioral health disorders in military personnel returning from deployment to the Middle East.  While not appearing as an overt physical injury, disruptions of a psychological nature are often as debilitating, and there is an increasing need for support tools.  Such tools should allow for standardized tracking, monitoring, and mitigation of anger and stress outside of face-to-face treatment, and enhance the overall treatment plan for individuals struggling with psychological health issues. To meet this need, Design Interactive proposes further development and evaluation of the prototype Mobile Stress and Anger management Tool (MSAT), a CBT treatment support suite that links providers and patients in a way that they never have before.  The tool meets the most critical needs of patients by providing real-time mobile support when anger/stress triggers are encountered during their day to day life by continuously tracking their stress/anger levels with physiological sensors.  An integrated provider portal provides powerful information to support practitioners in what they have deemed their most difficult task in CBT, determining the patterns that trigger anger and stress in patients.  Expansions include an upgraded, unobtrusive physiological sensor suite, real-time biofeedback, and additional mitigation and training strategies among others.",

        "abstract": "This Phase II SBIR project seeks to develop and commercialize methods for recycling rare earth materials from strategic waste streams.  Rare earth materials are critical for a broad range of technologies.  Important industrial sectors such as defense, manufacturing, energy, transportation, and electronics all utilize rare earths in abundance.  There are currently a limited number of economically viable sources of rare earths materials, making the recycling of rare earths an invaluable practice to industry.  However, presently only a small percentage of all rare earth materials are recycled.  Xylon Technical Ceramics has developed and patented a unique, environmentally-friendly recycling technology that has the potential to be universally applicable to rare earth wastes.  The proposed project would develop the commercial utility of the process to recover rare earths from thermal barrier coating (TBC) wastes. TBCs are critical to the aviation and energy sectors, and their production generates substantial amounts of waste.  Xylon has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the process for recycling TBC wastes during Phase I work.  Positive results from this project will comprise a scalable, commercial manufacturing process to recycle rare earths from TBC waste in a manner that facilitates an environmentally safe and economically viable way to conserve critical resources.",

        "abstract": "There is growing interest in the use of ammonia as a clean alternative to fossil fuels. Ammonia belongs to a group of energy-dense liquid fuels that are much easier to store and transport than hydrogen. As ammonia decomposes to hydrogen through in a single reaction step and neither carbon oxide nor sulfur is involved in the product stream, ammonia is one of the most promising carbon neutral liquid fuels (CNLFs). The continuous cracking of ammonia to supply smaller size compressors for smaller high pressure tanks will allow modular capability and increase the reliability of hydrogen refueling stations. Low cost and reliable on-demand hydrogen generation technology will also find wide application in many other industrial areas. However, the state-of-the-art ammonia cracking technologies are not cost-effective and issues caused by high cracking temperature and the use of expensive catalysts still need to be addressed in order for ammonia cracking to be a viable option for on-site hydrogen generation applications. As a result, the ability to produce hydrogen through ammonia cracking at low temperature and high pressure and without the use of expensive catalysts is highly sought after for purposes of both energy and production efficiency as well as cost. Bettergy Corp will develop a novel catalytic membrane reactor to allow low temperature on-site hydrogen generation from ammonia. The proposed low temperature ammonia cracking membrane reactor system is comprised of non-precious metal ammonia cracking catalyst and a robust composite membrane. The objective of this project is to achieve a hydrogen delivery cost at target pressure (20bar) < $4.5/kg, at a scale as small as 10 L H2/min. Once the low temperature ammonia cracking membrane reactor system with the above characteristics is developed, it will have a significant impact on the development of the fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) market, as it will help provide reliable, low-cost, zero-emission on-demand hydrogen refueling stations for FCEVs, as well as on portable and stationary power generation systems, and other industrial uses.\n",

From the available energy sources, Lithium-based batteries play a key role due to their high energy and power volumetric and gravimetric densities. The requirement to evolve towards more fuel efficient and more environmentally friendly aircrafts demands Lithium-based battery systems that can operate for longer periods of time in a safer and more reliable manner. On the battery monitoring and control area, focus has been directed at achieving accurate and stable long-term estimation of cell State of Charge (SOC), State of Health (SOH), and Remaining Useful Life (RUL). These efforts have achieved excellent progress and accuracies below 3% error are common now. Complimentary to these efforts, new approaches are needed that intelligently utilize the estimated and predicted information and turn it into tangible and considerable battery health and life performance improvements. Fuel-based aircrafts also benefit from these advances as they use batteries to power auxiliary loads, which also demand intelligent battery utilization that can translate into longer battery life and safety. Our proposed system answers these needs through the creation of a battery that adapts to the demands of the application and to the changes the battery suffers as it ages.",

However, many UASs are capable of increasingly autonomous operation.  As autonomy pushes against this boundary it is inevitable that the LoS requirement must be replaced with onboard intelligence to sense and avoid trouble without pilot intervention. The software making these decisions must be developed and tested to standards that ensure reliability and safety.  Robust development, test, and operations tools will ensure quality development, adequate testing, and insightful operations of UASs.\n\nWindhover proposes to build upon their Phase I efforts to create a complete ecosystem of flight and ground software, as well as processes and standards for achieving the levels safety needed for operations of small UASs. The newest UAS operators are solving problems in their respective industries.  They need a robust UAS software development tool chain that provides access to vehicle control in a safe manner that their existing IT resources and software personnel are already familiar with. \nApplication developers building on the Windhover infrastructure use the entire tool chain to create robust test campaigns.  The onboard test agent and ground automation provide a rich scripting environment that facilitates the efficient creation of multi-level test campaigns for verification and validation.  These application test campaigns are built upon the pedigree of the Windhover framework that has been developed and tested with the same tool chain.  \n\nOur Windhover software ecosystem will enable an exponential rate of innovation in the UAS software market and lead to novel solutions to the problems facing the integration of small UASs into the National Airspace (NAS).

NASA CAD models inherit errors and issues during their inception that prevent them from being used with NASA?s radiation transport code, High Z and Energy Transport (HZETRN). XL Scientific developed a ray tracing tool to generate inputs for HZETRN, called the CAD Radiation Integration Tool (CRIT). This tool maintains material density and type, unlike any other existing capability. XL Scientific also developed methods of identifying and correcting common CAD errors. In phase II, XL Scientific will expand both CRIT and the CAD repair tools developed in Phase I. Functions will be added to CRIT to read STEP and DICOM file types. We will add interfaces for both HZETRN2015 as well as industry standard radiation transport code, Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP). MCNP is widely used in the nuclear community for radiation transport calculations and adding it to CRIT will expand commercialization options to the nuclear and healthcare industry. We will also automate the CAD repair tools developed in Phase I. Automation will allow users to correct common errors quickly and reduce the overall time spent repairing models. Furthermore, XL Scientific will add a sensitivity analysis option to investigate what effect model simplification has on radiation transport results. At the end of the Phase II effort, XL Scientific will have a tool to diagnose and repair CAD model quickly and provide robust radiation transport calculations.

This antenna uses a tunable dielectric material and an array of radiating elements to create an interference pattern that steers the beam in the desired direction. This method provides moderate gain without the use of mechanical steering and similar functional performance to a traditional phased array at a fraction of the size, weight, power, and cost (SWAP-C).\nThe Ka band ASM is specifically designed to be a flexible component in the communications chain. All of the interfaces to the ASM are simple, non-proprietary interfaces, and the KGS ASM is agnostic to radio, waveform, and network selections. A receiver can be readily integrated with the ASM to enable closed loop tracking, and the simple command interface of the ASM provides the communication system with the ability to easily and rapidly refine the beam position to maximize gain and ultimately improve link margins and data throughput without incurring additional power draw or mechanical stability effects.\nModifications to the aperture to better integrate, survive launch, and operate in space were designed during Phase I; during Phase II, KGS plans to update the control electronics and software that drive the antenna and then build and perform RF test on the overall system to verify compliance with requirements. \nTo date, a low-SWAP Ka-band steerable antenna for small satellites has not been successfully demonstrated in space. At the conclusion of this Phase II contract, the KGS ASM will be ready to go to space qualification testing and then a demonstration launch, where KGS will have the opportunity to prove the ASM's capability in the target environment.",

A number of such modules can be connected together into several possible cryocooler layouts to scale heat lift capacity, achieve system redundancy and provide flexible integration with the BAC coolant loop.

Phase II will focus on integrating the gate drive buffer IC fabricated during Phase I with a 1200 V rated power SiC DMOSFET. Process and device development of a SiC PMOS technology will be conducted during Phase II, in pursuit of a SiC CMOS gate drive circuit.

The airframe capabilities will be expanded to achieve high altitude flights through strong winds and damaging airborne particulates. The SuperSwift's well-documented power and data interfaces will be employed to integrate the sensors required for the measurement of atmospheric volcanic phenomenon that will have broader applications for atmospheric research.\n\n\nThe atmospheric models that are employed by dispersion studies provide information that can affect human safety. Examples not only include volcanic ash aviation hazards, but pollution alerts, toxic releases, dust storms and wildfire smoke hazards that often depend on the accuracy of these models. Accurate data input from the location as well model validation are needed for these important safety systems. Even basic atmospheric conditions such as wind and temperature are estimated or modeled from nearest weather stations that could be far from the location of interest and at limited elevations. Ground systems, manned aircraft, balloons and even dropsondes supply this data but have limitations.

These devices contain no moving parts and can sense rotations and accelerations with high bandwidth. However, there is a fundamental tradeoff between the size of an optical gyroscope and its sensitivity. Highly sensitive gyroscopes are needed to meet navigation goals, but Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) are extremely precious resources in spacecraft or UAVs. Enhancing the sensitivity of existing devices, reducing their size, or both can allow the use of inertial navigation in smaller airframes, or free up room to include larger mission payloads for scientific or military purposes. Using fast-light effects generated in fiber with Stimulated Brillouin Scattering, we will enhance rotation sensitivity of conventional Ring Laser Gyroscope, to develop IMUs that will deliver higher performance and/or lower SWaP than a traditional navigation system. In Phase I we built, tested, and analyzed an SBS RLG test bed with automated control and data collection, both under quiet conditions and under rotations.  We also established requirements on system stability to produce an interesting RLG using the technology, and determined it is technically feasible to achieve in Phase II. In the proposed Phase II work, we will demonstrate fast-light enhancement of an RLG in the lab and produce a prototype to characterize the potential performance of a fast-light enhanced IMU product.",

The first is to identify stage efficiency improvements and verify  structural feasibility of shrouding a low aspect  ratio HPT rotor blade designed to use CMC blades.  The second is to perform similar analyses for metallic and  CMC LPT blades . HPT stage efficiency gains will be determined using CFD analyses for shrouded and unshrouded HPT turbines as a function of clearance and stage reaction. The increase in blade component stresses due to the presence of a shroud, and the stresses in the shroud itself will be determined from structural analyses. Comparing analytic results  with available structural data for shrouded metallic LPT blades  will increase confidence in the structural predictions of shrouded HPT blades.\nThe reduction in engine weight from  using CMC blades in the  LPT will be determined.

concept \nInflammatory bowel disease  IBD  affects about      of the worldandapos s population  Due to its early onset and lack\nof an adequate cure  this disease requires lifelong treatment  IBD affects the gastrointestinal  GI  tract and\nmanifests as two subtypes  Crohnandapos s disease  CD  and ulcerative colitis  UC   In recent years  anti TNF biological\nagents have transformed the treatment of IBD  but these are not ideal drugs  requiring administration by injection \nand in some instances hospitalization for intravenous infusion  These agents have numerous side effects \nincluding increased infection rates  additionally  anywhere from        of patients either lose response  through\nthe production of neutralizing antibodies  or become intolerant  e g   site reactions   Long half lives of injected\nantibodies  which can result in TNF blockade over sustained periods  can exacerbate these issues and make it\nhard to control drug exposure to minimize safety issues  Although current anti TNF drugs possess similar modes\nof action  switching from one agent to another is an established treatment approach for patients who become\nunresponsive or intolerant  Stelara  ustekinumab  targets both the IL    and IL    pathways and is efficacious\nin Phase III Crohnandapos s disease clinical trials in TNF resistant patients  However  there is some concern about\ncardiovascular safety events  as illustrated by the removal from the market of briakinumab  which also targets\nIL    and IL     due  in part  to increased cardiovascular risk  IL    is produced locally in the intestine and plays\na fundamental role controlling intestinal mucosal inflammation  Hence  selectively modulating the IL    pathway\nlocally in diseased tissue is the preferred strategy  Such an approach would provide high concentrations of drug\nin diseased tissue and block IL    function locally in the intestine  During the Phase I SBIR   we developed a\npotent    nM   orally stable antagonist  PN      of the IL    receptor  IL   R  that is efficacious when orally\ndelivered in a TNBS induced model of colitis  PN     prevented body weight loss  reduced the colon weight to \nlength ratio  and  most importantly  improved colon macroscopic pathology  PN     was predominantly\nrestricted to GI tissue with minimal systemic exposure  The overall objective of this Phase II SBIR proposal is to\ndevelop methods for characterizing in vivo target engagement  including pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic\nmethods to characterize the binding of PN     to IL   R in various compartments and how binding affects\ndownstream biomarkers and efficacy  These biomarkers will be used to aid compound and dose selections  and\nto provide early stage clinical proof of concept  The specific objectives are to     Develop the required target\nengagement methods to enable quantification of binding of PN     to IL   R bearing cells     Identify the\nrequired pharmacodynamics biomarkers that would reflect the downstream biological changes upon target\nengagement  and    Correlate target engagement and pharmacodynamics biomarkers with efficacy readouts in\nTNBS models of colitis in rats  This Phase   SBIR program is supported by a team that has a track record in the\noral delivery of constrained peptides  a proven capacity in translating early stage research to clinical outcomes \na group of scientific and clinical advisors with significant experience in IBD  and the appropriate research\nenvironment  In this Phase II SBIR proposal  we describe the development of the appropriate biomarkers that\nwill establish early proof of concept and the effective human dose range through an assessment of target\nengagement and pharmacologic activity in early stage human trials  These are important steps towards our\nultimate objective of demonstrating clinical benefit in late stage clinical trials  These biomarkers will permit the\nassessment of mechanism specific and disease related parameters in blood  fecal  and or colon biopsy samples Narrative\nInflammatory bowel disease  which encompassed Crohnandapos s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis \nafflicts over     million people in the United States and is estimated to cost $    billion in direct\nhealthcare costs  The disease has no cure  has an onset early in life and requires life long\ntreatment  Current treatments are not effective in all patients and many patients have\nsignificant adverse effects  Protagonist is developing an orally active  local acting and GI\nrestricted peptidic antagonist of IL    receptor that will ultimately lead to more efficacious  safe\nand durable treatment for IBD than current systemic approaches  This Phase II SBIR proposal\ndescribes the development of target engagement and pharmacodynamic biomarkers to\nprovide robust translation of preclinical results to the patient population",

This is especially important in typical Squad engagements where the enemy has local knowledge that we lack, causing reliance on GPS to have disproportionate impact on operations.  Locating and targeting these transmitters is challenging because of complex signal environments, including the possibility of multiple simultaneous emitters, and the likelihood of communications and GNSS jamming, which will render existing emitter-finding systems ineffective. Phase I demonstrated new geolocation algorithms which are robust to complex environments and confusion from multiple emitters. In Phase II SSCI has executed simulations and flight tests to confirm algorithm performance.  In this program SSCI will integrate closed-loop sensing for data collection guidance, as well as GPS-denied navigation technology, and demonstrate an airborne emitter-finding system with improved timeliness and accuracy, continued ability to perform in multiple-emitter scenarios, as well as zero vulnerability to hostile GPS or communications jamming. In addition to these added capabilities, SSCI will reduce the size-weight-power footprint of the system prototype, showing a route to implementation on Group 3 UAS, and perform flight demonstrations against GPS jammers.",

The management of diffuse coagulopathies is extremely important in military medicine as these conditions represent a significant source of combat morbidity and mortality. HemoSonics device is based on sonorheometry, an ultrasound-based technology that can measure dynamic changes in clot stiffness during the process of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Sonorheometry does not require moving mechanical parts and utilizes a self-contained consumable cartridge with embedded lyophilized reagents. This technology has significant advantages over competing viscoelastometric devices such as TEG and ROTEM; sonorheometry is faster and more sensitive than TEG and ROTEM, it is ease to operate and to interpret, and it is robust to environmental vibrations. The overall goal of this proposal is to finalize the development of sonorheometry into a portable instrument that can be used in the expeditionary medicine environment. Based on the success of Phase I activities, the focus in this Phase II application will be to develop and validate an integrated prototype that is capable of performing automated SR measurements and assess its clinical utility in trauma.",

Ultrasound is a diagnostic and treatment technology that currently fulfills mission medical capability support on ISS and is planned to accompany future deep-space missions. The Flexible Ultrasound System (FUS) is a new platform that is currently being developed by NASA and research partners to support this mission role. We propose three specific aims for this project proposal for methodological development utilizing the FUS platform: 1.) Define a list of highest priority/yield ultrasound methods to develop and implement using the FUS and our guidance prototype through careful review of the HRP roadmap and direct discussion with ExMC Physicians. 2.) Expand an Augmented Reality (AR) user interface for these ultrasound methods that provides procedural guidance in acquiring and initially diagnosing sonographic data for ultrasound procedures to enhanced degree of procedural competency. 3.) Develop and test the integration of magnetic-based Volume Navigation, and complementary dimensional referencing technologies, on the FUS platform to allow for 3-dimensional ultrasound procedural guidance through the Head Mounted Display. 4.) Integrate the current system with procedural guidance resources such as Electronic Procedures (eProc) and existing ultrasound training materials. 5.)

        "abstract": "There is a clear need to advance the state-of-the-art carbon-carbon coated Nozzle Extensions (NE) beyond the engine/mission performance currently established by Herakles technology, which is intrinsically limited to about 3000 F. The well-established SiC-based (CVD, pack cementation) technologies currently available also have upper temperature limits around 3000 F, imposing stringent limitations on increased performance and system level changes (i.e. hotter propellant) for future NASA missions. In addition, the intrinsic CTE mismatch between C-C substrate and refractory carbides/oxides further limits the use of many other classical coating technologies. The successful Phase I results established the feasibility of overcoming these limitations through the use of a novel, functionally graded (FGM) coating technology. The proposed Phase II builds on the success of the Phase I program and clearly increases its TRL by offering subscale component testing at representative engine conditions. A successful Phase II program will clearly offer a new dimension in the nozzle extensions by offering different coating systems for multi-cycle capability at temperatures from 3000 F up to 4000 F.  The expected ability of the coating to survive such an aggressive testing combined with the sufficient retention of mechanical properties offers a direct path for a Phase III with many of the commercial space payload companies. The overall approach is based upon a multi-piece C-C NE concept, which focuses the requirements for high temperature oxidation protection to smaller diameters of the nozzle extension (e.g. A cone), allowing the CVD coating technology to remain within current SOTA CVD capabilities. Larger diameter segments, which are exposed to lower temperatures, will utilize non-CVD lower cost technology which is well suited for large diameter components.

In Phase I of the program, we used ADONIS to design a reference circuit  a high-speed comparator  in 16nm FinFET technology. The design was then tuned for Complementary E-Beam Lithography. The result was a 34% reduction in the number of exposures needed by the CEBL system, which would translate directly into reduced patterning time. The comparator design was released for fabrication at 16nm through the DARPA CRAFT program. In Phase II we are proposing to extend the work to include 200 logic cells, an SRAM instance, 20 mixed-signal functional blocks, a DICE-like differential amplifier, analog and digital circuits to implement chip specific writing, and a high-performance analog front end. The comparator from Phase I will also be bench tested. A testchip will be designed to demonstrate compatibility with the CEBL equipment.

In Phase I, we have demonstrated the requisite performance using existing hardware coupled with off-the-shelf control electronics. Based on our results, we have designed a fully-integrated module capable of disseminating timing signals with sub-femtosecond error from 1-10,000 s. In Phase II, we will package the device and deliver it for external testing. Our system is expected to improve ground-to-satellite synchronization a million-fold over current RF-based time transfer systems, enabling applications including clock-based geodesy, very long baseline interferometry, coherent LIDAR arrays, and tests of general relativity.\nThe Phase I breadboard demonstration performance is consistent with a timing jitter of 3 fs @ 1s and integrates down to 700 as at 30 seconds. The corresponding fractional timing instability is 3 x 10^-15 @ 1 second, which flickers at 2.7 x 10^-17 out to 2000 seconds. We have identified the systematic effects that limit both short and long term stability and incorporated the improvements into the Phase II design. With these improvements, we expect a 10x improvement in both short and long terms stability of the system.\nIn addition, we reviewed and formalized the laser driver and control electronics specifications. The initial schematic capture for critical analog sub sections was completed and a suitable FPGA/microprocessor combination was chosen to control the system and process the timing information. Based on these designs, power and size estimates were used to complete the mechanical enclosure model for the time-transfer system. For maximum flexibility in the final architecture of the overall free-space time transfer system, each frequency comb sub-unit that includes the laser and control electronics will be housed in a 1U rack mount enclosure.",

Urban Mining Company offer a solution; the Magnet to Magnet recycling system takes waste magnets from end-of-life appliances, reduces them to powder, and then reforms them into new magnets with better magnet properties than starting materials. This process could alleviate supply risk in the US by largely operating outside of the conventional magnet supply chain.   In the proposed study, the Magnet to Magnet recycling system will be modified to work with as many different grades and compositions of scrap magnets as possible, to make the process more robust.

        "abstract": "The effects of electromagnetic interactions in electrical systems are of growing concern due to the increasing susceptibility of system components to electromagnetic interference (EMI), use of automated electronic systems, and pollution of the electromagnetic environment with electromagnetic emissions. The effects of EMI can be detrimental to electronic systems utilized in space missions; even small EMI issues can lead to total mission failure, resulting in significant mission delays and economic loss. Additionally, NASA is challenged to find ways of effectively shielding sensitive electronic equipment from EMI without adding significant weight to space flight vehicles and satellites in order to manage fuel costs. The solution for both issues resides in the use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which offer the most promising solution for reducing spacecraft wire weight. CNTs are an alluring alternative to conventional conductors used in coaxial data cables because they combine mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and low density. DexMat has developed a novel CNT deposition process for directly applying CNTs onto dielectric materials to produce an electrically conductive EMI shield. By placing a premium on the quality of raw CNTs, DexMat has created a product with increased potential to reduce cable weight while minimizing insertion losses when incorporated into wire. In the proposed research, DexMat seeks to develop a small-scale CNT Tape production process and continue the development of the CNT separation processes. The need for CNT Tape was discovered while obtaining feedback from potential customers that noted the desire for a product format that allows for quick and easy integration into existing manufacturing processes without the need for outsourcing processes.",

        "abstract": "In the Phase 1 program, ENGIN-IC studied the key technologies to develop a Solid State Power Amplifier (SSPA) to replace the Klystron Tube currently used for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense Element of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  ENGIN-IC demonstrated a GaN Power amplifier MMIC design offering greater than 40-W saturated power with more than 45% efficiency, a 160-W sub module which integrated four of these MMICs, and a top level design that utilized these in a modular approach that achieved the High Power Amplifier (HPA) requirements with good margin.  Using high reliability devices and a solid redundancy plan, reliability levels are raised significantly for the system.  In Phase 2, ENGIN-IC will be advancing the top level designs such that final performance requirements can be generated for the key internal modules.  ENGIN-IC will then finalize designs and fabricate these elements including the GaN MMIC and 160-W SSPA sub module.  With these designs complete, the high risk elements of the full HPA design are significantly minimized and a future phase program can move forward to achieve the final objective system.

        "abstract": "Breakthroughs in the development of neural interface technologies have been prevelent over the last decade, in large part due to the success of DARPA-funded. These advancements have included state-of-the-art prosthetics controlled by neural interfaces as well as implementation of sensitization using interfaced prosthetics. While these treatments continue to improve and have achieved moderate success, existing technologies lack the long-term stability and precision that will be required for clinical translation. The two primary limiting complications with existing neural interface technologies are tissue damage and mechanical failure of the device. The 5-6 order of magnitude discrepancy in elastic modulus leads to a variety of implantation and chronic use issues such as tissue damage, difficult surgical attachment, and relative motion during use. Luna Innovations is therefore developing a unique nanofiber-based material system known as bioCXN. This exciting material technology is being proposed for use with the TIME interface design, but will also be applicable to many other existing neural interface technologies in the future.",

Understanding whether space weather is the cause of such problems\nexpedites investigations and guides successful design improvements resulting in a more robust\nsatellite architecture.

Real time algorithms addressing\nthis need that calculate how a satellite charges due to the radiation along any orbit for user\nspecified architectures were developed during phase 1. The next phase of the project will\nexpand on that development and advance the usability, reliability, and quality of the system by\nadding needed enhancements, validation, and testing.

In Phase I, RSS explored the marine debris, and\nmarine object detection applications space. In doing so, we have arrived at a series of radar\nimaging sensor solutions that are targeted and customized to the individual observational and\ndetection requirements. The primary application considered was marine debris, but we\nextended our consideration to include ice-berg/bergy-bits detection and characterization, seaice\nfreeboard mapping, marine mammal detection, vessel detection, search and rescue, rapidresponse\nand fisheries support. In particular, we propose to employ various sampling and\nmeasurement configurations at Ka-band to exploit scattering properties of the targets as distinct\nfrom the ambient scene. Ka-band was chosen because; 1) It has a high temporal correlation\ncontrast between water and objects; 2) High precision interferometry (ATI, XTI, etc.) can be\nachieved with relatively small antenna separations; and 3) This technology is relatively mature.\nA novel system architecture was devised that will enable XTI/ATI, MSAR and DBF custom\nconfiguration of the DSOM for land, sea and airborne platforms. In the long-term, upon the\nadvent of high-altitude long-endurance platforms, the DSOM has the potential to expand our\nspatio-temporal observational capabilities for marine debris and objects by orders of magnitude.",

        "abstract": "In this work, Trident will develop an Ultra Digital RF Transceiver (UDRT) FPGA processor for high reliability applications. In Phase I of the SBIR, Trident demonstrated the feasibility of a high-speed, high fidelity, reprogrammable kernel for use in high-speed digitization and signal processing applications. Trident utilized FPGA processing hardware and implemented associated firmware and software to demonstrate that the processing requirements and key performance metrics could be met. Hardware was matured with higher rate digital conversion hardware and kernel re-configurability was implemented. Using internal research and development, Trident began the translation of the Virtex5 FPGA architecture to the Zynq UltraScale+ architecture and initiated prototyping activities that have demonstrated the technical feasibility of this approach. This Phase II SBIR effort proposes to complete the development of the skip generation processor based on Trident's Phase I developed architecture and existing Digital RF Transceiver. The resulting Phase II hardware will address the emerging need of the industry; significantly increasing processing power and flexibility, while balancing size, power and cost, in a highly reliable transceiver.

        "abstract": "Reliance on fishmeal and fish oil is a significant constraint to aquaculture expansion in America,\nand globally. As U.S. marine fish farming expands, genetic improvements could increase\neconomic performance and decrease ecological footprint. This is critically important to\nsustainability, scalability and profitability of the industry, and is key to attracting capital\ninvestment. Commercial opportunities and sustainability concerns are probably greatest for\nhigh-value marine finfish, such as kampachi (Seriola rivoliana). Phase I research identified\ngenetic markers that were highly-significantly associated with enhanced performance of\nkampachi on soy-based feeds. This work also initiated early development of high-throughput\nscreening panels for this trait, which could improve sustainability and profitability of kampachi\nproduction on U.S. agriculture-based feeds. Primary Phase II objectives are to validate and test\nheritability of these markers through marker-assisted broodstock selection; and, identify markers\nassociated with other Seriola phenotypes critical for health, survival and yield in commercial\nculture (fillet yield, fat content, spinal deformities, sex, skin fluke resistance).

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel, intraoperative imaging technology to address the problem of inadvertent cuts to vasculature during minimally invasive surgeries. More than 17% of patients who undergo these types of in-patient surgeries suffer from an intraoperative bleeding event. When a vessel is injured, there is a higher probability of hospital borne infection due to the loss of blood, and the added cost of care per patient increases by thousands of dollars due to corrective action and extended length of stay for the patient. The risk of vascular injury is compounded by risk factors, such as obesity, which limit the surgeon's ability to visualize and navigate vasculature. Therefore, there is a critical need to identify and assess hidden vasculature in real time. The proposed technology helps identify blood vessel before a cut is made. Importantly, this system will be designed for seamless integration into a suite of surgical instruments for multiple applications. Long term, the company will provide surgeons with the preeminent imaging platform to view, assess, and characterize a range of vessels (i.e. arteries/veins, ureters and bile ducts) in real-time for improved surgical guidance and outcomes. The proposed project will develop a novel blood vessel detection and visualization platform using low-cost optical imaging sensors and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The proposed technology will provide visual and quantitative information about vessel presence and size in real-time that can supplement a surgeon's technique. This system will be simple, cost-effective, easy to employ, and highly accurate. Traditionally, the avoidance of blood vessels during minimally invasive surgery is accomplished by visualization or costly intraoperative imaging. The proposed technology will use pulsatile light absorption characteristics of blood vessels to provide quantitative information about vessel presence and size in real-time, supplementing a surgeon's technique. This project will also add significant value to the body of research conducted in the areas of signal processing and image analysis. In addition, the proposed technology will remove the risk of data loss due to artifacts in general and motion artifacts in particular. The proposed technology will be validated ex vivo and in vivo using a porcine animal model.",

This provides an opportunity to reduce estimated $78.5 Billion - $127.3 Billion in waste due to reactive maintenance per year in the US commercial facilities market alone. A data driven, proactive approach provides a unique opportunity that enable facilities managers to assess as-is conditions of assets, avoid non value-add activities and plan maintenance tasks to avoid failures and shutdown. This will contribute towards transforming a traditional industry to an advanced data-driven one. It will also enable significant reduction in the disruptions caused to occupants due to failures in facilities. Given that Americans spend 85-90% of their time indoors and any disruptions caused by facilities directly impact their qualities of lives, the broader societal impact of reducing failures in facilities is significant. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project intends to research, develop and demonstrate the feasibility of using big data analytics and machine learning to transform facilities operations and maintenance decisions. Owners and operators of the over five million commercial and institutional buildings in the United States are faced with the challenges of managing aging and crowded building infrastructure. They waste between 30% and 40% of resources by operating in a predominantly inefficient, reactive mode. This project targets development of computational mechanisms that automatically analyze integrated building information to identify patterns that lead to actionable insights that help reduce non value-add activities and improve resource utilization in FM daily operation and planning. By combining advanced machine learning technologies with existing building information modeling (BIM) resources, the company is proposing to develop high-impact, statistical and visual methods for optimizing the decision-making abilities of facility managers and with that, the performance of critical facilities infrastructure and maintenance crews. The results of this research will include algorithms and methods to normalize heterogeneous building data, detect patterns and anomalies, from which actionable insights can be derived with domain knowledge, and generate qualitative and quantitative output appropriate for improved decision making in managing commercial facilities.",

The purpose of the Phase II program is to complete the development of an Smart Electroanalytical Multi-Sensor (SEMS) device for analysis and process control of biocidal silver in potable water, with the option integrating an Ag+ ion generator. The device will automatically provide continuous and on-demand maintenance of Ag+ ion biocide levels in spacecraft water streams and storage tanks, as well as providing output data for silver concentrations and a profile of total silver added to the system over time. Considerable test work is planned under AES programs and, given silver ion's 'elusiveness' in water systems, the data will be far more reliable if the methodology for adding the biocide and measuring its concentration is performed by a reliable and flight-qualifiable design from the beginning. Phase I culminated in a validated analytical methodology and 4 flight preproduction prototype for measurement and control of silver ion at sub-ppb levels in finished waters. The Phase II Technical Objectives and Work Plan are dedicated to fabrication, test & delivery of 3 flight-qualifiable instruments that conform to spacecraft applications and specifications as defined by NASA. The specific objectives will be to 1) develop a complete analytical characterization of the detection method, inclusive of automated autocalibration and QA/QC functions, 2) develop automated machine-learning capability to support agile & reliable operation in long-duration missions, 3) demonstrate the Feedback Control Function to maintain consistent Ag+ ion concentration in active water systems, and 4) demonstrate all operating parameters required to analyze Ag+ in the ranges of 50-5000 ug/l in potable water.",

        "abstract": "One of the biggest obstacles preventing the widespread implementation of small satellites is the process of actually getting them into space. Current methods include hitching rides as secondary payloads. Although this initiative has provided significant new launch capacity for CubeSat-class spacecraft, it is not without issues, most specifically limited orbits and orbital lifetime. Many missions need higher orbits to perform their missions; and lower orbits are subject to atmospheric drag that may cause premature reentry. Safe and affordable miniaturized propulsion can overcome these limiting factors and is a high-visibility capability sought by the CubeSat community. Even basic capabilities to push in one direction will allow nanosats to remain in orbit longer, or allow a satellite placed into low-Earth orbit to propel itself to a higher or more circular orbit. In Phase I, Plasma Processes designed, fabricated and delivered to NASA a miniaturized propulsion system compatible with non-toxic HAN- and ADN-based green monopropellants for small spacecraft propulsion. In Phase II, the green propellant thrusters will be tested will both monopropellants for pressure fed and pump fed 1U propulsion modules. The use of advanced, non-toxic propellants will increase mission capabilities including longer mission durations, additional maneuverability, increased scientific payload space, and simplified launch processing. Adding propulsion will also enable de-orbiting of the satellite after completion of the mission.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR will support rover locomotion and manipulation with a system of newly-developed penny-sized 70-W brushless servomotor controllers that are networked on a bus-topology (CANopen DS-402 protocol). Each \"P3\" controller is small enough to be mounted in the tiny volume normally reserved for the encoder; and, indeed, each P3 carries the entire active electronics of the encoder function by measuring the magnetic field of a 6x2.5-mm radially-polarized button magnet bonded to the tail of the spinning motor shaft. A Kalman filter enables the encoder to read down to 12-bits-absolute at commutated speeds up to 14,000 RPM. The controller has the functions expected of conventional controllers. However, based on three patents of international scope and a fourth PCT application, the part count has been substantially reduced, with subsequent reduced size, fewer sensitivities to radiation, fewer parts that otherwise generate quiescent power, and reduced cost. Phase I demonstrated successful integration with NASA-selected motors and stress-testing of P3 in adverse environments including temperature extremes, vibration, and vacuum, resulting in a TRL-advance from 3 to 4. Phase-II efforts will focus on design-modifications relevant to space-qualification, performance characterization, and further environmental testing including radiation testing. Phase II is expected to result in a TRL of 6. Phase-III commercialization efforts will create a system of motor controllers that not only support NASA rover missions with a TRL of 7, but also support other space-based non-terrestrial applications, such as servomotor actuation on satellites for precision antennae and laser pointing and the deployment of articulated structures.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) operating in the national airspace system (NAS) have the potential to significantly impact modern society. It is now common to consider UAS for difficult and dangerous tasks such as fire fighting and dull tasks such as surveying crops. In addition, the autonomous elements from such UAS are being considered as a means to provide safe personal aviation. Open questions remain, however, about how unmanned autonomous aircraft can be safely incorporated into the NAS. UAS operating in the NAS must (1) sense and avoid other vehicles and follow air traffic commands, (2) avoid the terrain and land safely without operator intervention, (3) react to contingencies such as engine-out and lost-link scenarios, and (4) be reliable (by FAA airworthiness standards) and cost-effective. The current approach for UAS integration relies on radio links and the operator's acuity to direct them safely. Lost links, however, are unavoidable. UAS must have the capability to make their own decisions based on information available via databases and any information discovered by onboard sensors. This is especially the case for rare events such as the failure of propulsion or safety sensing.\n\nNear Earth Autonomy proposes to develop technologies and capabilities leading to fully autonomous systems that are able to discover and safely adapt to rare events in their environment with minimal or no human involvement. This proposal focuses on developing an Autonomous Contingency System in the form of sensors and computer software that will enable UAS of the future to be operable safely in the NAS. Additionally, the proposal addresses how the technical challenges can be met and how the technology developed can be shown to be both trustworthy and commercially viable for general aviation.",

        "abstract": "Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) proposes to develop a low-cost Loop Heat Pipe (LHP) evaporator using a technique known as Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), otherwise known as 3D printing, to produce low-cost LHPs to be used in CubeSat and SmallSat applications. The wick structure in an LHP assumes the role of a pump in a standard loop, pumping liquid from the lower pressure condenser to the higher pressure evaporator by capillary forces. The overall thermal performance of the system is therefore highly dependent on the in-situ characteristics of the wick structure. Current LHP wick manufacturing and installation processes are cumbersome, labor intensive, and suffer from a low yield rate. It is estimated that the cost to produce an LHP evaporator, including the attachment of the bayonet, secondary wick and compensation chamber, accounts for approximately 75% of the total system?s manufacturing cost. By 3D printing an evaporator envelope with an integral porous primary wick structure, the overall complexity and cost of the design can be significantly reduced.\n\nThe Phase I program was fully successful. In Phase I, an LHP with a DMLS evaporator was built using ammonia as the fluid, and carried the predicted 45 W.  The overall technical objective of the Phase II program will be to design, build, and test a complete LHP thermal management system for a CubeSat.  Phase II work will include further optimization of the LHP manufacturing parameters, and the development of advanced wick structures such as a graded wick design. The deliverables at the end of the Phase II will include an LHP that has been thermal vacuum tested, and a second LHP flight unit with ethanol working fluid, that can be tested at NASA?s option on the ISS.",

The Phase I BEAST system design combines outputs of Aegis classifier, radar measurements, and intelligence data to improve target classification and tracking capabilities, with low reliance on prior measurements. Semantics-based knowledge representation was developed to bridge the gap between abstract intelligence data and field measurements for target recognition. A Bayesian inference engine and truthing process was also developed to evolve threat behavior hypotheses based on the missile defense sensor measurements and post-flight analysis. These Phase I results demonstrated BEASTs feasibility to enhance Aegiss target recognition capabilities, set the groundwork for Phase II development, and defined a pathway towards future integration and testing of BEAST. In Phase II, we plan to enhance BEAST software, mature its algorithms and inference process, and integrate them into a Phase II prototype for testing, evaluation, and demonstration. A transition plan will be developed with the prime contractor to integrate and test BEAST in a testbed in Phase III.  Approved for Public Release | 16-MDA-8951 (15 December 16)",

The code, though still a surface paneling algorithm, has proven to be significantly more robust and computationally efficient. FlightStream uses CAD or an unstructured surface mesh and is adaptable to subpanels varying in vertex valence from triangles to surface polygons. \nThe focus of the recently completed Phase-I effort preceding this proposal has been to develop the viscous formulation of surface-vorticity to allow the prediction of non-linear aerodynamics and the onset of flow separation through a new approach called the Fluid Strain-based Separation model. This theoretical development and demonstration has laid the foundation for an effective, high-fidelity, physics-based solution for flow separation. \nIn this Phase-II proposal, the focus is to expand the scope of application of these non-linear aerodynamics and flow separation models through robust algorithmic implementation to the FlightStream code base. A part of this focus will also be to validate the conclusions obtained from the strain-based separation model about the nature of fluid flow and to develop fundamental relationships between the proposed Maximum Fluid Strain property and the primary fluid properties with regard to flow separation. \nSeveral major performance and fidelity enhancements are also proposed for this effort that are expected to place FlightStream in a very unique position in the aerospace industry. These include the application of the Fast Multipole Method for improving the solver speed and reducing its memory footprint; a higher-order vorticity sheet solver to improve the fidelity of the solutions and improve solver stability in non-linear flow environments and other mutually supporting enhancements. \nResearch in Flight hopes to use this current effort to develop the very first commercially viable viscous, surface-vorticity, flow solver.",

A successful Phase I effort has demonstrated the feasibility of applying the technology of Liquid Interface Diffusion (LID) Bonding to embed and join heat pipes (Haynes 230) to the core.  An added bonus is that this LID Bonding technology will simultaneously eliminate the seams and voids created from a core made from pieces of U-7Mo thereby providing an integrated heat pipe / U-7Mo core sub-assembly with no internal voids or separations between core pieces or from the core to the heat pipes.  LID Bonding will even allow for the core to be built up by various horizontal and asymmetric pieces such as split heat pipe channels to easily receive heat pipes, consolidating the core material around the heat pipes during the LID Bonding process. Phase II will allow NASA to produce FPS up to 10 kWe and beyond to meet the power requirements for landing astronauts on Mars, and also to provide power to a host of other programs, including programs such as Neptune Systems Explorer, Kuiper Belt Optic, Trojan Tour, and Jupiter Europa Orbiter.",

        "abstract": "Both the current NAS, as well as NextGen, need successful use of advanced tools. Successful training is required today because more information gathering and decision making must be done manually, which requires training in the fundamental principles and objectives of traffic management. Successful training is required in NextGen due to the increased reliance on automation.\nGiven the multitude of input channels and actors that must be included in an environment for comprehensive training of Traffic Management Coordinators (TMCs), it would be too costly and too complex to attempt a full-scale human-in-the-loop simulation or table-top exercise that includes the direct participation of all of these entities. In Phase I of this research, we studied and prototyped effective techniques and technologies to allow virtual and/or constructive simulation of key components of the TMC's environment to achieve a significant step forward in the state of the art of TMC training. In Phase II, we will conduct further research on Traffic Management (TM) training techniques and create a more comprehensive prototype system for evaluation. The proposed innovation and focus on this research is called the COMprehensive Environment for TM Training by Simulation (COMETTS).\nNASA's recent research thrust in the Shadow Mode Assessment using Realistic Technologies for the National Airspace System (SMART NAS) Test Bed provides an important step toward, and platform for, research in simulation-based training for the controller and TMC workforce. Such research holds the potential to significantly improve the transition of technologies from NASA to the FAA and onward to fully successful implementation and acceptance by the end users.

Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen are the typical cryogens as they provide the highest specific impulse of practical chemical propellants.  These cryogens are stored at temperatures of nominally 20 K for hydrogen and 90 K for oxygen.  Due to the large size of these tanks, refrigeration loads to maintain zero-boil-off are high, on the order of tens of watts at 20 K and hundreds of watts at 90 K.  Space cryocoolers have been developed for cooling space sensors that have modest cooling loads and are not suitable for high capacity applications.  On this program, we proposed to develop a high capacity turbo-Brayton cryocooler that provides 150 W of refrigeration at 90 K.  On the Phase I project, we developed a preliminary design of the 90 K cryocooler, assessing its size, mass, performance, and maturity.  The proposed cryocooler significantly exceeds the performance targets set forth in the solicitation -- the cryocooler specific power is only 8 W/W (solicitation goal of 15 W/W), and the specific mass is 0.4 kg/W (solicitation goal of 12 kg/W).  On the Phase II project, we propose to develop and demonstrate the least mature components, the compressor and its inverter drive.  On a future Phase III project, we plan to build and demonstrate an engineering model cryocooler.  Successful completion of this project fills a clear void in space cryocooler technology.",

        "abstract": "Three of the key abilities needed for making future NASA and commercial launch and in-space transportation systems more affordable and capable are: a) the ability to \"live off of the land\" via in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), b) the ability to reuse in-space transportation hardware, and c) the ability to leverage continuing advancements in lower-cost earth-to-orbit transportation. All of these abilities require the ability to transfer large quantities of cryogenic liquids (Oxygen, Hydrogen, and Methane) between tanks on separate vehicles. While all cryogenic rocket stages have to have a propellant fill/drain coupling for loading propellant on the ground, existing designs are not capable of in-space refuelability. A dual-purpose coupler that could be used for both ground fill/drain and for in-space refueling would be extremely valuable.In this proposed SBIR Phase II research effort, Altius Space Machines proposes continuing the development of just such a dual-purpose, lightweight, high-flow cryogenic propellant coupling to enable both ground fill/drain and in-space refueling. This coupling incorporates an innovative new cryogenic sealing architecture to enable a coupling with very low insertion/extraction forces, for manual, robotic, and astronaut-connected cryogenic propellant transfer operations. In Phase I, Altius demonstrated the innovative new cryogenic sealing architecture, and performed insertion/extraction and leak tests, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional spring-energized polymer seals, raising the TRL from 2 to 3 at the end of Phase I. In Phase II Altius will continue refinement of the cryogenic sealing architecture, and will design, fabricate, and test a family of couplers based on this architecture, and focused on an industry-provided launch vehicle application. Testing of the ground and in-space couplers during Phase II will raise the system TRL to 6, paving the way for Post-Phase II flight demonstration (yielding TRL 9).",

In particular, a technique for the in-situ generation of cleaning/sanitizing solutions is needed to reduce the demand of earth based materials like cleaning supplies to meet personal hygiene requirement during space missions. Therefore, In this Phase II SBIR program, Faraday will continue the technology development efforts of the Phase I by: (1) demonstrating the potential of the device design by testing under zero gravity; (2) optimizing the GDE catalytics, structure, and wettability, (3) demonstrating the potential to use onboard ISS water utilities, (4) developing an electrochemical peroxide detector, and (5) designing and building an &#945;-scale reactor to produce 1 L/day of 2 w/w% H2O2. This evaluation will enable TRL enhancement and demonstrate a potential path forward for demonstration.

        "abstract": "Advanced space borne instruments require cooling at temperatures of 10 K and below.  Potential missions include the Origin Space Telescope and the Superconducting Gravity Gradiometer.  Cooling loads for these detectors will range from 50 mW to 500 mW at the primary load site, with additional loads at higher temperatures for other subsystems.  Due to jitter requirements, a cryocooler with very low vibration is required for many missions.  In addition, a multi-stage cooler, capable of providing refrigeration at more than one temperature simultaneously, can provide the greatest system efficiency with the lowest mass.  To address this need, we plan to develop and demonstrate a two stage turbo-Brayton cryocooler that provides refrigeration at 10 K, with additional cooling at 50 to 70 K.  On the Phase I project, we optimized the performance of an existing cryocooler and measured its performance.  During the proposed Phase II project, we plan to optimize key cryocooler components for operation in a 10 K cryocooler, and demonstrate the performance of the advanced technology through demonstrations at cold load temperatures of 10 K and below.  We will use these test results to develop a design for a fully optimized, flight cryocooler for a particular NASA mission class.",

Two-phase pumped loops are an ideal solution for these applications.  A critical need for these pumped loops is a refrigerant pump that reliably circulates very slightly subcooled liquid refrigerant in the loop.  Creare proposes to develop a reliable, vibration-free pump that has innovative features to prevent cavitation in the pumping chamber and in the hydrodynamic fluid bearings, enhancing the overall pumped loop reliability.  The development of the refrigerant pump is built on Creare's proven pump technologies for space applications.  In Phase I, we designed and built a proof-of-concept refrigerant pump and demonstrated its ability to reliably achieve the target flow rate and pressure rise, with a minimum required Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH) less than 0.5 psi.  In Phase II, we will optimize the pump rotor, bearing and motor designs; assemble a pump prototype; demonstrate its reliability and its steady state and transient performance under prototypical inlet conditions; and deliver it to NASA JPL for further performance evaluation.",

For CORSAIR, NASA has baselined a rather robust high strain composite (HSC) TRAC Boom to tether a comet Sample Acquisition and Retrieving Projectile (SARP) to the spacecraft and prevent the harpoon-like penetrator from recoiling back and impacting the spacecraft during retrieval.  However, questions remain as to how to design and build a composite TRAC Boom with sufficient strength so as to tolerate the relatively long storage time (several years in-transit to the comet) and relatively high deployment speeds (~30-150 f/s) necessary for the CORSAIR harpoon system.\nTo address this challenge during Phase II, Roccor proposes to improve the performance of the bondline in composite TRAC Booms by reinforcing the adhesive joint and developing mechanical end fittings that allow higher packaging strains while minimizing creep.  We also propose to validate a relatively low cost, out-of-autoclave process for affecting the bond, and validate analytical models to simulate the time- and temperature-dependent viscoelastic behavior of composite TRAC bonded joint, and guide engineering qualification of the joints for future NASA missions, including CORSAIR.  Moreover, Roccor will also further optimize the system design, including proximal and distall end fittings that connect TRAC Boom into the CORSAIR storage canister and sample return projectile to validate strength and creep performance to mission requirements, and to incorporate load-limiting features that prevent catastrophic failure of the TRAC boom during operation.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a handheld, one-step paper-based device for rapid self-testing of sexually transmitted infections. The company aims to replace lab-based assays for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and expand testing access to previously unreachable settings. The technology combines the ease-of-use and very low cost of rapid point-of-care (POC) diagnostics with the high accuracy of lab-based tests, enabling unprecedented reliability at the POC and at home. CT infection is one of the most prevalent STIs in the US. An estimated three million new cases occur each year with direct annual medical costs of greater than $3.5 billion. Untreated CT, symptomatic or not, may cause long term pregnancy complications, even infertility. Traditional lab-based CT assays prevent the ability to test-and-treat within one patient visit. This delay results in a high number of cases that do not get treatment due to loss-to-follow up (especially for young STI patients) and increased infection transmission. Phase Diagnostics? novel device will be: (1) Fast: Results to the patient in less than 15 minutes; (2) Affordable: Costs less than $1 to manufacture; (3) Accurate: Sensitivity and specificity on par with lab-based assays; (4) Convenient: Handheld with no required equipment or training. The key innovation of the company's novel device is to use aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs) to selectively pre-concentrate the pathogenic bacteria prior to detection, thereby dramatically enhancing the accuracy of conventional rapid LFA POC technology and enabling the use of urine samples for the detection of CT. During Phase I, the company was able to adapt ATPS to urine medium, attain improved limits of detection of its system and make considerable progress in fully integrating all components into a true one-step paper microfluidic strip. The objective of Phase II is to fully develop the company's proposed device to be ready for FDA 510(k) clearance and CLIA waiver enabling clinical studies. The company will first complete the product optimization work initiated in Phase I and perform additional device robustness studies. As these experiments near completion, the company will work with a contract prototyper to design and develop prototypes based on the final optimized device components. At the same time, the company will establish small scale manufacturing processes to ensure that it can generate a reproducible pilot batch. The company will then perform Alpha and Beta product testing to determine the clinical performance of its prototype as well as obtain feedback from end-users to determine areas for optimization.",

This reduction in image quality can have serious impacts on the ability to carry out missions by reducing situational awareness and preventing target identification. EM Photonics has been working to overcome these challenges for more than ten years through the development of a real-time image enhancement solution, known as ATCOM. While ATCOM has been demonstrated on a wide range of applications, it is not currently in a format that would allow for low-SWaP deployment. In this project, we will build on our existing solution and extend it in several key technical areas, including algorithmic development, software optimization, and hardware packaging. The result will be a man-portable, remotely-configurable, field-deployable implementation primarily intended for imaging paths close to the ground.",

Physics-based, reduced-order models (ROMs) will be developed and demonstrated with data from CFD models of the X-56, an experimental aircraft that NASA and the U. S. Air Force are using to test systems for flutter suppression and gust-load alleviation.  Extended range and low fuel consumption through lightweight materials and large wing spans (high lift-to-drag ratios) are the drivers in next-generation aircraft like the X-56, but these attributes create challenges in maintaining flight safety, ride quality, and long-term structural durability.  The development of flight controllers that can actively manage aeroservoelastic effects (body-freedom flutter, control reversal, gust loading) without compromising safety and aerodynamic performance is a key objective of both the X-56 Program and the proposed project.  Through the proposed technology, nonlinear, aeroservoelastic ROMs can be coupled to other components of a flight simulator (six-degrees-of-freedom flight mechanics models and control software) to improve the fidelity of simulations that support controller design for a wide range of operating conditions.",

The differential imaging methods developed in Phase I will be improved and the methods implemented in turn-key software and hardware.  In Phase I the feasibility of using differential time domain THz imaging methods to enhance the contrast and detectability of features such as disbonds was demonstrated.  Kissing disbonds and cracks may only weakly reflect the THz pulses in conventional THz imaging.   The Phase I project developed the methods of shearographic loading of the samples, and used penetrating THz pulses to detect the subsurface deformation of the defects with better contrast than traditional THz imaging.   In a  disbond there is a region where the two sides of the material are not adhered, and the space between the two sides are essentially so close that THz interface reflection pulses from the non-adhered region may be partially cancelled out..  The  defect signature may be only  weakly detectable compared to when the spacing is greater than the minimum THz wavelength.

        "abstract": "The proposed research pursues a path for reducing structural weight, increasing structural performance, and reducing fabrication cost while also minimizing maintainability.  The approach, which is based on selective reinforcement, is a change in the basic design philosophy and will result in the development of a hybrid material form.  The selective reinforcement approach allows the structural design requirements to define the material form.  This method is the reverse of the typical development flow path used for building structures.  This backward path results in more efficient material forms that are of greater value to structural engineers.  Specifically, the proposed effort will combine a metal matrix composite (MMC) prepreg tape with an ultrasonic additive manufacturing process.  The combination of these technologies will lead to enhanced lightweight, cost-effective metallic structures with shielding and thermal management built in.",

        "abstract": "Luna proposes to continue development of integrated high-definition fiber optic sensors (HD-FOS) and carbon nanotube (CNT)-graphene piezoresistive sensors for inflatable space habitat materials to enable full coverage structural health monitoring (SHM) and impact detection. Inflatable habitats are key to reducing the weight of space structures, enabling future long term missions and planetary habitation. There is a need for monitoring the structural health of these habitats, as many of the methods used on earth are not applicable to the space environment or the materials used. To accomplish this goal, Luna has teamed with Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) who is a leader in the development of CNT sensor technology. Luna is teaming with an established manufacturer to fabricate a sub-scale inflatable structure with integrated SHM sensors which will enable thorough characterization of the approach. During Phase I, the team successfully demonstrated damage detection in an inflatable prototype as well as dynamic impact detection of soft goods layers with the technologies. Phase II will focus on increasing the TRL of the sensing technologies and preparing for transition into future NASA missions. Phase III will focus on commercializing the technology with NASA and NASA affiliates.",

The mission presents multiple challenges, such as: ubiquitous presence of hazards at all scales, including craters, crevasses, boulders, etc.; ultra-high radiation environments due to proximity to Jupiter; and extremely limited lander resources for mass and volume and, hence, the amount of shielding that can be carried.  Therefore, the critical phases of this mission require the ability to perform terrain-relative navigation (TRN) and surface-hazard detection in short time. \nTo satisfy these requirements, a dual-functionality (altimetry and hazard mapping), large-format, monolithic, low-noise, highly sensitive, silicon single-photon avalanche photodiode (SPAD) lidar imager will be developed. The SPAD imager will be robust, radiation-hardened, and low in size, weight, and power, and it will provide altitude measurements to the ground beginning at an altitude of 8 km and all the way to touchdown (10 m altitude). At an altitude of 500 meters, it will provide a dense 3D terrain map covering a 100 m x 100 m landing area with 5 cm ground sample distance and range errors of less than 5 cm (3-sigma) in less than 1 second.

Aircraft without ADS-B Out capabilities, ranging from commercial or general aviation aircraft with failed transponders to adversarial aircraft deliberately operating without required transponder equipment, will continue to exist within the general airspace and pose navigational hazards and tactical threats to SUAVs.  To meet these needs, Nokomis proposes to adapt its ultra-sensitive RF detection, identification, and geo-location (DIG) system, called Hiawatha to provide an unsurpassed trajectory management and anti-collision avoidance capability suitable for integration into SUAV platforms.  The Hiawatha system provides flight-tested state-of-the-art ultra-sensitive RF detection, identification and geo-location performance which has been proven to detect UAVs at distances up to 15km.  Nokomis will develop the Hiawatha Aircraft Anti-Collision System including software and hardware to aid in trajectory management and safe traffic flow of autonomous UAV operations capable of meeting the SWaP requirements for incorporation into a representative SUAV payload platform.  The RF-based traffic management and anti-collision avoidance system will be capable of monitoring the entire spectral range from 30 MHz to 3 GHz, while providing the necessary detection, identification, and locating abilities from all angles while operating in a non-interfering manner with other potential payloads. Specifically, as part of Phase II effort, Nokomis will enhance existing geo-location capabilities and implement Trajectory Prediction and Anti-Collision/Well Clear Modules to protect aircraft and allow for efficient Traffic Flow System for maintaining aircraft spacing.

        "abstract": "Techshot's innovative 3D metal printer offers the unique ability to fabricate metal components and tools in space which can be utilized for sustainability, maintenance and research. The proposed system will accomplish this task through the utilization of a two-stage filament melting process whereby a metallic filament is first heated to Curie temperature through induction and then deposited on a build platform where it is fused to the previous layer by exposure to a low energy laser.  This new unique process is known as Sintered Metal Printing with Laser Exposure (SIMPLE). Induction heating is not entirely new to Fused Deposition Manufacturing (FDM). There has been recent research into the integration of an induction coil into the \"hot end\" of a plastic filament FDM printer. The induction coil surrounds the metal nozzle, known as the \"hot end\" and inductively heats the nozzle when an AC current is applied. The nozzle then heats and melts the plastic filament allowing it to be extruded onto a platform where a part is formed. The use of induction heating, when printing with a metal filament, is similar but the induction coil heats the wire filament directly as it passes through its center. This system offers faster melt times resulting in faster feed rates, lower mass resulting in quicker more accurate printer head movements and lower overall power consumption.  Conceptually, the wire filament will not be heated to melting but heated to the Curie temperature and laid as a hot filament on the build platform. To gain adherence between deposited layers, a low energy laser is used simultaneous to the layering process to heat and fuse adjacent filament layers.",

The DSCS extends the Miniature Low Cost Cryocooler Electronics (mLCCE) performance reducing size, weight and power of the deep-space rad-hard integrated circuits.  The DSCS enhances the thermo-mechanical unit with a new inertance tube and regenerator packing to optimize the cryocooler design for 35K cold-tip and 150K heat rejection temperatures. To achieve this higher performance, the DSCS cryocooler is based on the Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC) TRL-6 High Power Microcryocooler. LMSSC's initial trade study shows the predicted performance of the High Power coldhead is significantly better than the standard coldhead.  This is largely due to a greater regenerator volume, and thus greater regenerator heat capacity.  The High Power coldhead heat exchangers are slightly larger, increasing their effectiveness and improving performance.

Current CubeSat and small satellite solar arrays employ either fixed panels mounted directly to the Satellite side-wall(s) or small hinged rigid panels.  These arrays generate very low power (4-20W) due to the limited area available for solar cell installation, thereby constraining CubeSat payload capacity, capability and mission applications.  Composite Technology Development, Inc. (CTD) proposes to develop an approach for a high-power, flexible and compact deployable solar array for Deep Space CubeSat Applications.  The Composite Beam Roll-up Array (COBRA) is a very high specific power solar array that combines the Photovoltaic Assembly with the deployable boom structure into a unified integrated laminated assembly that can achieve >265 W/kg at the array level, including the deployable structure. The integrated structure will also shield the solar cells from the harsh space environment.  The objective of this SBIR is to develop a COBRA for a 6U Spacecraft that generates at least 200W for Deep Space Applications.  The unique design is also inherently low cost due to the design simplicity and very low part count.  Furthermore, the COBRA technology is highly modular and scale-able, and could be easily scaled to provide in excess of 600W for a small satellite.",

        "abstract": "A bidirectional dual active bridge (DAB) dc-dc converter for electrical power systems (EPS) is proposed. The converter operates as a charger, upconverter, and downconverter using a single transformer. The converter uses smart technology to interleave DAB converter stages for ripple current reduction and optimized load sharing of stages to extend the high efficiency load range of the converter to 6.25% of full load. By using smart technology, the load condition of each DAB converter stage is monitored and its load sharing controlled depending on the converters total load condition. In this way, each converter stage is kept at or above 25% load. Therefore the minimum load of the new DAB converter with four interleaved stages is one fourth of 25% or 6.25%. The design employs radiation-resistant and cryogenic-temperature-capable GaN HEMT devices to process 2 kW of power per stage. Mainstream has tested GaN HEMT devices to -225 C. GS66508T GaN HEMT devices are rated for 650 VDC maximum drain-to-source maximum voltage stress allowing for a maximum steady-operating voltage of 400 VDC at 60% derating.",

        "abstract": "We propose to develop a sensitive PM measurement instrument to determine soot particle mass distribution from aircraft engine exhausts as well as from other IC engine emissions. Fundamental of the proposed technique is to measure particle charge under an electric field. Through extensive experimental and theoretical investigation on soot emissions from IC engines over the past four decades, it has been well-known that engine soot particles are usually charged. Counting particle charge at specific mass could lead to the determination of both total particle count and mass. Currently commercially available electrometric measurements on charged particles suffer from rapid signal drift, which limits its applications on soot emission measurements. In our proposed design, an amplitude modulation scheme is included to eliminate the background signal drift and also improve detection sensitivity. The proposed soot mass distribution monitor will be approximately 50 pounds in weight and consume approximately 300W electrical power. It will also be capable of being remotely controlled and operating under vacuum condition. Total cost of the proposed device could be less than $30,000.",

The nonlinear aeroelastic solver solves the aeroelastic equation of motion to add the incremental aeroelastic forces to the right hand side of the 6 degree-of-freedom equation in the flight dynamic model to account for the dynamic aeroelastic effects in the flight dynamic simulation. The generalized aerodynamic forces involved in the nonlinear aeroelastic solvers are provided by three nonlinear aerodynamic Reduced Order Models (ROMs); namely the modal, gust and control surface ROMs, that are derived from the Navier-Stokes (N-S) solver of FUN3D. The nonlinear modal ROM is constructed by a neural network model and the nonlinear gust and control surface ROMs are in the form of the first and second order Volterra Kernels. A wrapper around FUN3D, called OVERFUN, will be enhanced to drive FUN3D for generating the training data that leads to the three ROMs. OVERFUN also can directly drive FUN3D to perform a full order aeroelastic analysis including trim, flutter, gust and maneuver loads analyses whose solutions can be used to verify the accuracy of these three ROMs. The NL-DFS system will be validated with the flight test data of F/A-18 Active Aeroelastic Wing.",

The state of the art active de-icing method on leading edges involves either an electrical, pneumatic or vibration induced debonding of accumulated ice. There is a need for an anti-ice coating that functions synergistically with active de-icing methods. The advantages are reduced power consumption, improved service life of mechanical components, lighter electronics and extra protection in case of failure of active device. The Phase I program has addressed this need and technology gap, and has demonstrated the feasibility of combining a durable anti-ice coating with an active deicing device, thereby creating an integrated de-icing system. Icing tunnel testing results demonstrated that the coating provides improved de-icing efficiency, along with a reduction in power consumption of the active de-icing device. In collaboration with a manufacturer of active de-icing systems and a company developing advanced technologies to enhance aircraft performance and safety, the Phase II effort will refine the coating composition and application characteristics for use on aircraft so as to meet the stringent requirements of the aerospace and aeronautic industry. Further, we will establish a product specification of an anti-ice coating system for use with active de-icing systems and develop protocols for applying the coating at both OEM sites and field applications. The success of the program will lead to prevention of ice buildup on aircraft leading edges, improve aircraft safety, and reduce energy consumption during deicing procedures.",

One of the instruments of the 1970 and 1976 Soviet Lunokhold rovers included a shear vane geotechnical tool.  Since 1976, there have been no geotechnical instruments deployed on any planetary body.  Our intent is to provide a geotechnical tool that will allow us to begin exploration again.\n\nThe Apollo penetrometer approach was excellent for greater depths, while the Soviet approach worked well for the near-surface. We combine the two approaches into what we call the Stinger, a percussive shear vane penetrometer capable of measuring near-surface and subsurface soil properties to a depth of 50 cm or greater.  \n\nThe objectives of Phase I were to design and build a simplified breadboard Stinger GeoTool and test it in lunar and Martian soil simulants to determine its applicability for robotic and human missions. The results of Phase I show not only accuracy and precision in determining soil properties, but also flawless execution of the breadboard design.  This paves the way for the Phase II effort.\n\nThe primary objective of the proposed Phase II effort is to develop a compact impact shear vane penetrometer - the Stinger - up to TRL5/6 to determine soil physical properties near the surface and down to 50 cm depth.\n\nIn conjunction with the instrument development, a soil mechanics model will be formulated based on laboratory tests with the instruments, in soil simulants, and in vacuum conditions.",

While the approach of single Caution And Warning (CW) message mapped to a single response procedure may be sufficient for simple cases, for a well-connected system with inter-dependencies among the components a single component failure will likely negatively impact other components functions downstream that are dependent on the failed component. This may lead to the generation of multiple CW messages and hence the potential invocation of multiple conflicting malfunction and response and recovery procedures. QSI is proposing, with significant feedback from the NASA COR and other NASA stakeholders, on a more proactive approach that improves the CW message generation itself and produces a more appropriate, prioritized and actionable set of CW messages through the identification of the root cause failures, impact or consequence analysis of those failures and the associated risk assessment all of which are critical to the choice for the appropriate response/recovery procedure(s). The proposed solution will provide real-time capability to assess the health and its impact on the capability of a spacecraft, and utilize it to identify suitable recovery options to ensure crew safety and mission success.

The ideal laser source will be high performance for lidar (high pulse energy, high rep rate, short pulse duration) with specific targeted emission spectrum to meet ocean water transmittance and filtering requirements. It will also feature low SWaP and a rugged form factor with high reliability for continual use on mobile platforms. No existing laser source can meet these demanding requirements.\n\nTo address this challenge and meet NASA's lidar source needs, Bridger Photonics, Inc. (Bridger) proposes creating a high power Q-switched, off-line Nd:YAG source at 946 nm, which, when frequency doubled to 473 nm, will provide high transmittance through ocean waters. Bridger's design will leverage three key innovations proven out in its Phase I effort: efficient, end-pumped, low-quantum-defect architecture; gain crystal design for optimal heat removal; and robust monolithic, alignment-free fabrication. The proposed design would allow for widespread deployment of mobile ocean-penetrating lidar transmitters.  Successful completion of this Phase II effort will allow Bridger to demonstrate >10 W of average blue power in a compact, turn-key package. Bridger has modeled and constructed similar lasers through SBIR efforts previously and will apply the innovations developed there towards this new system for NASA.",

        "abstract": "We propose an innovative, low coherence probe for rapid measurement of free-form optical surfaces based on a novel method of spectrally controlled interferometry. The key innovations are the use of a new interferometric modality and a novel non-contact optical probe that together measure high surface slope acceptance angles to nanometer sensitivity. When the probe is integrated with a precision motion, x, y, & z metrology frame, it will meet NASA's need to measure free-form optical surfaces from 0.5 cm to 6 cm diameter ranging from F/2 to F/20, including slopes up to 20 degrees (with potential for 60 degrees), with an uncertainty targeted at 2 nm RMS. The probe operation does not require tilting to measure slopes. This results in this simplified cartesian metrology frame, also critical to achieve 2 nanometer measurement uncertainty. These features: nanometer resolution and 20 degree slope acceptance angle, have up to this time not been found in a single probe or sensor, non-contact or contact. This Phase II proposal takes the probe and its innovative spectrally controlled light source into a production prototype level capable of meeting NASA metrology goals.",

Space qualified, high voltage power electronics can lead to higher efficiency and reduced mass at the spacecraft system architecture level, and serve as an enabling technology for operational concepts such as solar electric propulsion.\n\nSilicon carbide (SiC) is a robust technology with superior electronic properties for power applications. SiC devices offer higher temperature operation, lower on-resistance, higher breakdown voltages, and higher power conversion efficiency than silicon devices. However, high vulnerability to heavy-ion induced degradation and catastrophic failure has precluded this technology from space PMAD applications. Importantly, physical mechanisms for this vulnerability are not well understood, resulting in the inability to develop radiation hardened SiC devices. \n\nCFDRC, in collaboration with Vanderbilt University and Wolfspeed, is applying a coupled experimental and physics-based modeling approach to address this challenge. In Phase I, we performed electrical and heavy ion tests on 1200V Wolfspeed SiC JBS diodes to generate response data, and performed TCAD simulations to investigate diode sensitivity to design parameters and analyze electro-thermal mechanisms behind measured response. In Phase II, we will develop further insight into physical mechanisms in the diodes via development and application of advanced physics models. We will parametrically analyze design features to identify promising hardness solutions, which will then be fabricated and experimentally characterized. We will also perform heavy-ion testing of 1200V SiC MOSFETs and apply simulations for insights into governing mechanisms (to be further developed in follow on work).

Technologies to realize future propulsion noise reduction will require detailed experimental characterization and diagnosis of the acoustic mechanisms and sources within an engine system or component. ATA Engineering, Inc. (ATA) proposes an SBIR project to further develop and validate methods for obtaining phased array acoustic data from complex distributed noise sources using continuously moving, or continuous-scan (CS) microphones in conjunction with state-of-the-art phase-referencing techniques. The benefits of the CS method include (1) effectively infinite spatial resolution, as the sound field cross-spectrum may be described between any two locations along the scan trajectory, (2) preservation of phase data for improved source and propagation modeling, including beamforming (BF) and acoustical holography (AH), (3) significant reduction of test data acquisition time (potentially two to ten times faster) per operational point, and consequently either (4) reduced test operational cost, or (5) the opportunity to screen more design concepts within a given budget. The Phase II effort will use subscale aeroacoustic testing to validate the novel continuous-scan beamforming (CSBF) measurement techniques with the aim of eventual implementation in NASA acoustic wind tunnel and free-jet testing facilities.

Thus improved capabilities to model and predict component behavior in harsh ground test environments are needed for enhanced facility design.

Important nonequilibrium mechanical and thermal effects will be considered by using a drift-flux model and adding an additional energy equation for the liquid temperature.

Recently, the Game Changing Development (GCD) Program, which is a partnership between NASA, DOE, and industry, was initiated to evaluate the feasibility of a low enriched uranium (LEU) NTP system.  A critical aspect of NTP is to develop a robust, stable fuel.  One of the fuel configurations currently being evaluated is a W-UO2 cermet.  Fabrication of full-size cermet elements (>20?) has proven to be difficult.  As a result, the use of cermet segments to produce a full-size fuel element is of interest.  However, techniques for joining the segments are needed.  During Phase I, diffusion bonding techniques were developed for producing fuel elements from cermet segments.  Microscopic examination and preliminary properties testing showed excellent joints were formed.  For example, quantitative tensile testing of W samples produced at 1500C HIP with a Nb interfacial coating showed the failures were in the bulk W and not at the Nb-W interfaces.  Therefore, the strength of the joints were greater than the strength of the bulk W material.  Using the most promising fabrication methods, a 6.3' long simulated cermet fuel element comprised of twenty-five 0.25' thick segments was produced to demonstrate proof-of-concept.  During the Phase II investigation, the HIP diffusion bonding process will be optimized for making W cermet based fuel elements.  This will be accomplished by performing a process parameter-characterization-properties study.  The optimized fabrication methods will then be used to make prototype fuel elements with W claddings and subscale fuel elements for delivery to NASA for hot hydrogen testing.",

To the extent that the power will be generated by solar panels, cube satellites have a limited round trip energy budget. Increasing solar panel efficiency and complexity alleviates the energy issue to some degree. Both however, occur at the expense of the original cube satellite advantages of being inexpensive, small, and reliable. As such, the objective of high power capabilities must also assume fairly short time scales in order to preserve the energy budget. It's this mode of operation, maximum energy and short high power events, where hybrid system designs typically make practical sense.\n\nIn all cases, the energy storage requirements will depend on the payloads power profile and mission requirements. Cube satellite payloads are becoming more sophisticated and, in many cases, power hungry. Interesting high power payloads currently in development for small satellites include Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and mechanical actuators for performing larger satellite maintenance. In order to continue the trend of increasing cube satellite capabilities, it's important to be ready with energy storage that is both capable of supplying high power and flexible to suit the range of payload possibilities.\n\nThe hybrid ultracapacitor module proposed is a flexible, high efficiency, novel design that will enable satellite engineers to quickly and easily realize benefits such as extended battery lifetime, high peak power, and smaller size and weight that may be possible through a hybrid energy storage system.

        "abstract": "Current NASA missions to the International Space Station (ISS) are heavily dependent upon ground controllers to assist crew members in performing routine operations and maintenance as well as responses to off-nominal situations.  Performing these procedures often requires close collaboration between ground controllers who have deep knowledge of the spacecraft's systems. This collaboration becomes more difficult in extended missions and crew members will need to have more autonomy. Augmented and virtual reality technology can help replace some of the guidance that ground controllers offer to crew members during procedure execution.  Our proposed approach focuses on integrating augmented and virtual reality technologies into the same tools that mission operations uses today, allowing for augmented and virtual reality assistance to be built and updated by flight controllers and other mission specialists just as they do for their other work products. In Phase I, TRACLabs integrated its PRIDE electronic procedure platform with augmented and virtual reality systems such as the HTC Vive. In Phase II we will extend the PRIDE platform to augmented reality devices such as the Microsoft HoloLens. TRACLabs is also partnered with the Georgia Institute of Technology's Augmented Environments Laboratory who will develop algorithms that dynamically adjust the augmented reality cues (both their position, orientation, and scale, along with the specific graphical elements used) such that they align with the necessary parts of the world without obscuring important parts of the world.",

Apart from the detector, the performance of these FPAs is determined by the Read-Out Integrated Circuit (ROIC) that amplifies and multiplexes photo generated charge for signal processing by peripheral circuitry.\nIn this project, we propose to develop a new ROIC for low background applications, specifically designed to overcome present limitations of image persistence and inter-pixel capacitance (IPC). The main innovation in this project is an adaptive unit cell that can be individually and randomly programmed via on-chip logic to control bias state and reset duration of any pixel in the array while the integration of science data is on-going.\nIn Phase I we conducted a pixel trade study and performance evaluation for a Capacitive Trans-Impedance Amplifier (CTIA) and a source follower per detector (SFD) type pixel using analog circuit simulations. Then we generated the optimum unit cell layout, defined the overall architecture and created the top-level schematic. By the end of Phase I we have completed the blue prints for the design. The completion of the top-level schematics, verified through simulation, is a critical milestone in the development. It substantially reduces the risk associated with creating new ROIC technology and will allow us to efficiently fabricate and test the device in Phase II. All results from Phase I are documented in a preliminary Interface Control Document (ICD) so that the new ROIC can be considered for future missions.\n\nIn Phase II we will produce the layout of the entire chip for fabrication using stitching lithography in a state of the art CMOS foundry and demonstrate its functionality on packaged prototypes. By the end of Phase II, wafers of a known functioning ROIC design will be available for hybridization.",

This is a major advancement over the current state-of-the-art because of reduced workflow creation time, parallelization, portability of deployment and use, extensibility, and robustness.

Currently the UAS arena includes traditional airframers, established UAS manufacturers, hobbyists, academic institutions, and many air vehicle newcomers such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook that see UAS as a means to other commercial ends. A myriad of issues continues to slow the development of verification, validation, and certification methods that will enable the safe introduction of UAS to the NAS. These issues include the lack of both a consensus UAS categorization process and quantitative certification requirements including the definition of handling qualities. The how to of safely integrating UAS in the NAS raises many questions, and to date, there have been few answers. Perhaps the problem is too big. Because of a lack of quantitative data, attempts to address core problems thus far have failed to achieve consensus support. This Phase II program does not propose to tame the entire verification, validation, and certification problem, but instead to address the important need to define UAS handling qualities in piloted, pilot monitoring, and autonomous operations via a mission-oriented approach with an end product being the UAS Handling Qualities Assessment software toolbox (UAS-HQ) and corresponding specification that will guide UAS stakeholders through a systematic evaluation process. This process will be validated in Phase II via full flight envelope testing of a fixed wing UAS and low/speed hover flight regime testing of a multi-rotor UAS.",

An operational prototype was developed demonstrating how the Intelligent Information Processing System (IIPS) will operate in actual accidents/incidents.\n\nFor Phase II, we propose the following operating environment extensions from the flight deck environment: NextGen scenarios emphasizing interactions with air traffic controllers operating in fast paced, increased volume of manned and autonomous traffic; UAV operations emphasizing introduction of UAVs into the NAS, transition to autonomy and fully autonomous operations; and IIPS in flight training environments both simulated and airborne.  \n\nWe also propose an extension to the manner in which conditions were developed in Phase I.  Conditions were developed using post analysis of accidents and incidents.  The error chain of events was identified, information necessary to prevent the event was identified, and finally, a condition developed that detected the circumstances for a possible safety failure so that a notification could be transmitted to the actor who would then take the appropriate action to break the error chain.  This paradigm of condition development can be characterized as reactive.  With the NAS moving into a state of flux with the integration of UAVs and general increased traffic volume, reactive safety may not be acceptable.  In order to continue the steadily improving safety record of aviation, a more proactive approach must be considered.  We propose the use of a classical rule-based expert system and other artificial intelligence approaches that can make inferences of possible unsafe conditions using a temporal knowledge base populated by propositional statements generated by IIPS information sources.",

        "abstract": "Currently, flight controllers are often tasked with generating responses to multiple failures when they occur. However, during future space missions, flight controllers may be less available for this task, due to long communication delays during deep space missions, task overload as flight controllers manage many missions simultaneously, or reduced flight controller staffing per mission. To reduce the workload on the crew and/or flight controllers, it would be highly desirable to generate response procedures for multiple failures automatically or semi-automatically. When multiple failures occur, it seems attractive to use the procedures that were developed in advance to handle each of the individual failures. However, simply combining procedures in just any order might not work due to interactions among the faults, procedure goals, conditions, and effects. During Phase I, we began to develop the Multiple Failure Response Procedure (MFRP) System, which will automatically generate and present procedures for responding to multiple failures and ambiguity groups. The central idea of MFRP is to encode each the rationale of each procedure in a machine-readable way and to use this knowledge at run-time system to handle multiple problems and situations which may not have been specifically anticipated during procedure development. During Phase I, we developed a domain model and software prototype which generated valid responses for eight multiple failure scenarios for which naive application of single failure procedures was invalid or suboptimal, thus demonstrating the feasibility of our approach to multi-failure plan generation. For Phase II, we propose to extend MFRP flexibility, robustness, and ease of use. We will develop or enhance processes, models, algorithms, and software applications and tools to demonstrate the ability to handle complex domains, display multi-failure responses to users effectively, and reduce the cost and difficulty of applying MFRP to each domain.",

        "abstract": "Conventional PPM laser transmitters, a CW laser followed by a modulator, are inherently inefficient since the data must be carved from the laser's steady output.  95% of the optical power is discarded in a standard telecom RZ format, with another 8x efficiency reduction using a PPM scheme. An alternative is to form the pulse train with a mode-locked laser. However, since the resultant MLL pulse train is periodic, it must produce pulses in every symbol slot, not just once per symbol.  This means that for a 32-ary PPM scheme, the MLL optical efficiency is reduced by a factor of at least 32 by discarding the un-needed pulses.  In both cases, the electro-optic modulator itself induces an additional 60% optical loss, and requires nearly 0.5W of power to drive.  An alternative is to use a low-repetition-rate MLL in combination with a switch fabric to delay each output pulse into the correct PPM slot.  However, the use of photonic integrated circuits (e.g., silicon) is prohibitive due to the high intrinsic loss.  A 100-MHz PPM data rate scheme requires ~5ns pulse delay.  This represents 43-cm propagation in silicon, inducing a power loss over 10 dB.  Adding the loss due to spiraled delay lines, switch junctions, and coupling on/off chip, the aggregate loss of the switch fabric is 18 to 24 dB, representing a significant efficiency loss.  RAM Photonics proposes the development of a qualitatively novel approach to high-efficiency, low-bit-rate laser transmitters compatible with space-borne missions.  Specifically, we propose to develop a laser transmitter that attains highly efficiency optical data generation by (1) generating only one optical pulse per symbol at arbitrary temporal location, (2) eliminating all electro-optic modulators, and (3) exploiting new advances in fiver optic and opto-electronic packaging.  The new transmitter device has low dissipation (< 0.5 W total) and low SWaP footprint, and can operate at arbitrary data rates and generate any symbol formats.",

        "abstract": "Modern high efficiency gas turbine engines typically operate with hot section temperatures so high that metal parts in those areas need to be cooled to maintain strength and life properties. A well-established approach to this bleeds a portion of the compressor discharge air to flow through and over turbine parts. As engine compressor pressure ratios continue to increase, the temperature of this compressor discharge air also increases, to the point that the cooling air itself needs to be cooled.?Micro Cooling Concepts is involved in developing a concept for a heat exchanger co-located/integrated near the point of fuel injection in order to provide cooled cooling air. The main advantages of this concept are the minimization of the amount of heated fuel between the heat exchanger and fuel injector tip such that the fire danger from leaking tubing is eliminated, and the ease of delivering cooled cooling air to the secondary air circuit. Additionally, the modular concept distributes the heat exchange function, allowing for easy replacement of an individual heat exchanger module. For this program, high temperature materials will be used for fabrication using Micro Cooling Concepts' laminated foil construction approach. The end goal of the program will be to develop a prototype fuel-air heat exchanger and test its performance at engine relevant conditions. This effort supports the NASA goal of improving aeropropulsive efficiency through reduced fuel burn and increased cycle temperatures, specifically by enabling very high turbine cooling effectiveness.",

Consumer demand for all-natural ingredients in food has increased multifold, primarily due to health concerns. Despite the strong consumer demand, delivery and stability of natural food colors pose a great challenge for the food and beverage industry. This challenge results due to an inherent chemical instability of natural ingredients and due to their accelerated degradation during food processing and storage. But the current solutions are not cost-effective and require the use of synthetic additives and preservatives, which are not desired by the consumers. This project is aimed at providing an array of low-cost, stable natural ingredients that will improve the overall stability of the finished products both during food processing and storage. This will also address the unmet societal needs for healthy food ingredients and improving sustainability of food products. This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop bio-based encapsulation solutions to improve natural food color and phytochemical stability in food and beverage products. Current solutions are sub-optimal providing limited pH (color), heat or oxidative stability and short expiration dates on food and beverage products. To address this unmet need, this project aims to develop encapsulation of natural colors and bioactives that will enhance the overall stability of a finished food product. This will be achieved by working on the primary objectives of this project: Selection and screening of the carriers and natural ingredients to be encapsulated, physico-chemical stability testing of the encapsulated ingredients, scale-up methodologies, stability testing in a finished food/beverage product, consumer evaluation and customer validation of the formulations. As a result of the proposed approach, solutions will be provided that will allow the food and beverage industry to replace artificial with natural colorants as well as significantly extend shelf-life of their desired food products. This will also benefit the consumer who is seeking natural health-promoting ingredients in what he/she consumes.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is through providing a wearable alcohol monitoring device to the general population which will lead to a better awareness about alcohol consumption, and ultimately enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce burden of illness and disability. Incautious alcohol use causes health and social problems that either manifest over time due to sustained drinking (e.g., heart disease, cancer, liver disease, diabetes, etc.), or are short term effects of acute intoxication and/or impaired decision-making (e.g., motor vehicle crashes, violence, etc.). Excessive alcohol use led to approximately 88,000 deaths per year in the United States from 2006-2010 and in 2006 alone cost the economy approximately $224 billion. In light of the above social impact, the proposed graphene based wearable alcohol monitoring device addresses the urgent need to implement health approaches to reduce the loss of life and the huge economic costs that result from excessive drinking. In fact, the growing need for personalized health-care is highlighted by the estimated market size of $19 billion for wearable biosensors by 2018, pointing towards the potential commercial opportunity for self-monitoring alcohol sensors as well. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the unmet need for a small, light, unobtrusive, convenient-to-use alcohol sensor for real-time self-monitoring of alcohol consumption. Excessive alcohol consumption is a health risk behavior and the fourth leading preventable cause of death in the United States. Most strategies to improve safe drinking rely on obtaining accurate and timely information about alcohol consumption; these include self-report of number and timing of drinks, breathalyzers, blood analysis by lab, and wearable devices. Wearable alcohol monitors have clear advantages in terms of accuracy and feasibility compared to other methods for self-monitoring. However, current wearable devices for alcohol monitoring are bulky, inconvenient to use, obtrusive, and do not provide consistent, real-time data on the level of intoxication. In this Phase II SBIR project, a stand-alone graphene nanoelectronic transdermal alcohol sensor integrated with calibration electronics and Bluetooth transceiver will be developed, tested and benchmarked on a large group of recruited adult volunteers. Good correlation between the graphene sensor and a legal grade breathalyzer in large-scale human tests will confirm the technical and commercial feasibility of the proposed sensors, which can then be shipped to early adopters, pitched to investors, and ultimately introduced for sales.",

Our approach targets both long-term malware trend prediction utilizing attack graphs and short-term approaches monitoring malware and capturing forensic data to provide real-time predictions. A hybrid of short-term and long-term approaches offers many benefits. Captured samples would confirm or better inform the long-term predictions of what evasions and attack paths malware uses. Long-term predictions would enable advanced defenses to be prepared to capture malware samples.\n\nOur hybridized predictive malware trending scheme will significantly increase situational awareness into both short-term and long-term attack trends.

To fully utilize the variety of Trajectory Based Operations (TBO) concepts planned for the NAS, some of which utilize advanced aircraft capabilities for implementing trajectories, an air traffic controller (ATC) must be able to simultaneously support a variety of TBO concepts using different aircraft automation systems to fly the desired trajectory. To accomplish this, the ATC needs automation support to simplify the inherent complexities of using a variety of different BO concepts and trajectory implementation strategies and provide the controller with the tools needed to execute the desired trajectories, maintain situational awareness at all times, and support off-nominal situations. IMMA (Integrated Multi-Mode Automation) provides the automation to simplify the inherent complexities of using multiple TBO concepts by focusing the controller interactions on common core functions (e.g., the initial clearance, compliance monitoring) that all TBO concepts must support.",

ARCA's operational safety assessments are objectively linked to hard data. As in any estimation (human or automated), there are always uncertainties.

This novel imaging system will include a compact, single focal plane array camera and end-to-end image processing software to produce, high quality, low noise, high-speed video not currently possible with today's technology. The compact camera will be compatible with existing SSC camera housing and acquired imagery will be stored off-camera to prevent loss of information in the event of a mishap. The system will be able to record entire test sequences at >250 fps lasting up to 45 minutes. Most importantly, the system will produce XHDR (>120 dB dynamic range) HD format (1080p or larger) imagery so that relatively dark test cell infrastructure and test article hardware will be visible alongside exhaust plumes that may also contain ultrabright molten material. The imagery will be calibrated to provide engineering information such as radiance, color temperature and particle trajectories. Stereo calibration will enable multiple cameras to provide accurate 3-D XHDR image products. Rocket engine certification ground testing requires clear visual high-speed video recording that can capture essential information for NASA during rocket engine certification ground testing. This need is particularly true in the event of a mishap, when investigations into the underlying cause ensue. This technology can avoid common limitations of typical cameras such as image saturation, rolling shutter image wobble, camera geometric distortion, and no off-board storage, which makes it nearly impossible to obtain critical information in catastrophic situations that result in the loss of a camera.",

CRG has already demonstrated the efficacy of thermally-reversible polymer structures in commercial adhesive applications, as well as in previous NASA technical efforts for modifying waste packaging plastics to provide improved compatibility to AM processing (NASA SBIR H14.03-9603), and in the feasibility demonstration of the Phase I effort of this project.  The proposed concept not only has the potential to enable resource reclamation and AM capability, but also to advance the state-of-the-art in AM materials technology.  CRG's proposed approach to develop thermally-reversible polymer materials for thermoset polymer reprocessing, and demonstration of reclamation and manufacturing compatibility evaluation, will provide NASA with a material and processing technology readiness level (TRL) of 5 at the conclusion of the Phase II effort.",

The first innovation involves the development of a web-accessible model invocation engine (the \"Web-based\" part of SWIFT) which was prototyped earlier, demonstrated to NASA/Ames in December 2016, and will be fully developed in the current proposed projectI.  This model invocation engine can be used as a front end to SMART-NAS and can potentially transforms NAS simulations into a Software as a Service (SaaS) model.  This transformation will make it practical for NAS analyses to be run anywhere, and its design is compatible with the Data Distribution System (DDS) engine inside of SMART-NAS as well as with the Sherlock database system maintained by NASA.  The second innovation, which is coupled with the first, is a standard modeling language, which we call the Predictive Query Language, or PQL (the \"Interrogable\" part of SWIFT).  PQL is a powerful language for coordinating model runs across the distributed SMART-NAS environment, or any other model-based infrastructure.  The final innovation involves developing applications (\"app\") that run on both Apple IOS and Google Android smart phones that enable commercial pilots to easily access the status of the NAS (the \"Stakeholder\" part of SWIFT).

        "abstract": "Radiation detectors are an invaluable tool for space applications spanning planetary science, astrophysics, heliophysics, space weather, and dosimetry for human exploration.  Scintillators are materials that generate a light flash with an intensity that is proportional to the ionizing energy deposited.  However, scintillator efficiency gradually decays with increased exposure to radiation.  For exploration missions to hostile environments, such as those around Jupiter, Venus or Mercury, large ionizing doses are expected for the scintillation material, rendering them useless.  A common practice to mitigate dose effects is to anneal the scintillation materials.  In addition, sensitivity, dictated by detector volume, is critical for science missions, such mapping H2O concentration over a planetary surface.  This project will develop a scintillator module using advanced materials, such as Cs2LiYCl6(CLYC), LiSr2I5 (LSI), or Tl2LiYCl6 (TLYC), that provide both high-performance gamma ray and neutron spectroscopy within a single volume.  Si photomultipliers (SiPM) will maximize the active volume relative to the total volume.  The project will result in a large-volume, high-performance detector module, rigorously tested for flight, with protocols for annealing and science operation",

The novel TAPS technology has no hot moving parts and incorporates well proven, reliable linear motors and alternators in an engine based on the Stirling cycle.  NES has designed, optimized, built and tested all sub-systems for reliability, ease of manufacturing and cost reduction over currently available Stirling engines.

Methane and ethylene are well known polymer precursors that can be used as starting material to make plastics in extraterrestrial environments.  PEM water electrolyzers have already been proven space worthy and are commercially available at various scales. Our innovation enables the creation of polyethylene and other polymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoates from the most basic starting materials: CO2, water and electricity. In Phase II, Opus 12 will continue to improve performance of the CO2 conversion process and build a working prototype of ethylene and methane production that will serve as the basis for a future commercial device.",

        "abstract": "In brief, USNC's accident submersion safe drums are control drums where a small amount of fuel is added opposite to the neutron absorber and the drums impinge on the active core to substantially increase the shutdown criticality margin of the control drums. Phase 1 results indicate that the  shutdown criticality margin is more than sufficient to maintain sub-criticality in the worst-case water submersion accidents. Key accidents that the accident submersion safe drums address include submersion in freshwater and sand with a stuck drum in the full-on position and submersion in water and wet sand with reflector loss.\n\nThis SBIR will develop the submersion safe reactor shutdown system for Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) identified in the Phase 1. Remaining subcritical during a during water submersion accident is a design requirement for NTP systems. As of now, all thermal spectrum NTP concepts (including LEU NTP systems) fail to remain subcritical during water submersion and thus are not water submersion safe. USNC's submersion safe control drums enable thermal spectrum NTP systems to remain subcritical during water submersion accidents. \n\nKey tasks that will be completed include:\n\n1.Develop a detailed integrated thermal-mechanical and neutronic design of the control drums.\n\n2.Design a power cycle and coolant paths that adequately remove heat from the submersion safe drums while minimizing complexity of the NTP system. \n\n3.Demonstrate the Submersion safe control drum technology in a prototypical reactor experiment and raise the technology's TRL up to 4/5. \n\n4.Deliver a set of NTP system point designs that showcase the full implementation of the drums integrated into a realistic NTP system.",

The result is that an arc plasma can be produced, with a Lorentz force that creates a plasma disc (similar concept to a cyclotron). The thought behind this concept is that the thermal actuator authority provided by the plasma arc is coupled with an induced swirl component into a boundary-layer flow, which will enhance mixing and allow flows to remain attached across strong adverse pressure gradients. Effectively, the proposed actuator would function like vortex generators that one can actively enable or disable on command.  This subsystem demonstration will pioneer a family of devices to address a notoriously difficult problem in active flow control.  The new capabilities in aerodynamic performance enabled by this innovative actuation approach will be demonstrated in both ground and flight tests.

Currently these programs rely on serial nonlinear programming solvers such as the Sparse Nonlinear OPTimizer (SNOPT), despite the fact that their own codebases support full parallelization. The same is true for tools used in other industries for applications such as electric power grid optimization, nuclear reactor control and stock market analysis. The NLPAROPT algorithm can be quickly incorporated into these existing software solutions via a user-friendly interface and will offer an instant runtime reduction for very large-scale optimization problems. Irrespective of runtime gains, Phase I analysis has shown that the NLPAROPT algorithm is capable of outperforming industry standard serial solvers such as SNOPT for tested problems, including complex trajectory design problems. The Phase I effort has also identified several potential computational research avenues that, once completed in Phase II, will result in massive execution speed increases, further improving the attractiveness of this new parallel algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Monofilament Vaporization Propulsion (MVP) is an innovative new propulsion technology targeted at secondary payload applications. The approach with MVP, rather than using exotic propellants to achieve maximum specific impulse and system performance, is to use an inexpensive, inert, solid propellant. This enables the use of a propulsion system on lower budget missions by lowering the unit cost (no valves or pressure vessels), and minimizes range safety expenses. By using a commercially available, space rated polymer as propellant, MVP overcomes potential issues associated with liquid propellants such as freezing, over-pressurization, degradation (of tank wall and/or propellant itself), and cg perturbations due to sloshing. As a result, MVP's standalone risk to the primary payload is no greater than that of a CubeSat not equipped with propulsion. MVP harnesses technology used in 3D printing applications to feed propellant into proven electrothermal propulsion technology developed by CU Aerospace. To date, MVP has demonstrated a continuous 105 seconds specific impulse with 20 W input power, with 107 seconds peak. Phase II performance is expected to exceed 130 seconds. This should provide 900 N-s total impulse with a 1U (10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm) system, attributable to the high storage density and permissible thin walled construction. A 4 kg, 3U CubeSat equipped with MVP could achieve 250 m/s Delta-V while expending less than 25 W during operation. CU Aerospace will design, fabricate, and deliver a 1U MVP system to NASA at the end of the Phase II program.",

What is necessary is a rethinking of how best to both present and interact with the large amount of information presented by a C2BMC system in an intuitive manner. Leveraging our background in building intuitive information displays, haptic interfaces and missile defense, SA Photonics has developed the concept for a C2HMI system for ballistic missile defense. This system consists of an augmented reality display, a head tracking system and an optional set of digital data gloves with gesture recognition and haptic feedback. We will use our deep expertise in human factors engineering, especially in designing experiments to quantify the utility of display systems, to ensure that the system we design yields an absolute improvement in information understanding for both operational and training systems for the C2BMC system.

        "abstract": "The proposed Multi-Purpose X-ray Source and System (MPXS) can be used on flight missions, space stations, planetary excursions and planetary or asteroid bases, to meet nearly all NASA imaging needs in the Exploration Medical Condition List (EMCL).    This includes a range of radiographic imaging modalities - 2D, digital tomosynthesis and half or full CT to cover routine and emergency imaging needs.  The MPXS source is comprised of sections, each designed for a specific range of x-ray imaging conditions.   The source is currently designed as a rectangular box made primarily of aluminum nitride (AlN) sheets.   Each AlN sidewall has a window that allows x-ray flux to exit.  The window can be a hollow section of the sidewall or a thin strip of low Z material over a window aperture in the sidewall.  Thin strips of metal can be placed over the windows for beam filtration.   Each window will output flux from one or more rows of spots (x-ray pixels, or xels) on the metal anode inside, for example a 1 x 30 xel row.  These xels are digitally addressed with separate electron beams from field emission cold cathodes in the cathode array.  The system will comprise one or more sources, paired with one or more digital x-ray detectors, controlled by software loaded on a laptop or mission systems.   Each pair will weigh less than 0.1% of a current tomographic imaging system in less than 0.1% of the volume.  Extensions to the source design can reduce these figures even further.   The programmability of the x-ray flux sequences/patterns from the sources will enable the range of imaging modalities, and make MPXS well suited to use with emerging AI capabilities in radiographic diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Earth observing missions like NASA's LANDSAT Data Continuity Mission - Thermal Infrared Sensor (LDCM-TIRS) require greater spatial resolution of the earth than the ~ 100m provided by the current instrument.  Improving resolution to the desired ~ 30m requires increasing the number of pixels on target from the current 640x3 to ~ 2048x3.  The TIRS instrument contains 640x512 longwave infrared quantum well infrared photodetector focal plane arrays (LWIR QWIP FPAs) jointly developed by NASA/GSFC and QmagiQ.  QmagiQ proposes to achieve the higher pixel resolution while simultaneously improving quantum efficiency and operating temperature by using antimony-based strained layer superlattice (SLS) detectors. A key challenge is dealing with the effects of reducing pixel pitch from 25 microns down to ~ 10 microns, viz. optical fill-factor, optical crosstalk, processing difficulties, pixel operability, etc.  As a stepping stone in Phase I, we developed and delivered an SLS FPA with 1280x1024 format on 12 micron pitch that achieved record performance, viz. > 40% quantum efficiency and dark current half of MCT Rule07 for FPAs with cutoff wavelength > 11 microns.  In Phase II, we will increase FPA format to 2048x2048 and push cutoff wavelength to 12-13 microns while still hitting desired quantum efficiency and operating temperature targets in consultation with NASA/GSFC.  Several FPAs will be delivered to NASA for evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Summary\nIn a variety of diseases and conditions when oral feeding is impossible  enteral feeding through\npercutaneous gastrostomy  PG  is necessary to provide long term nutrition for adult and\npediatric patients  It is estimated that over    thousand feeding tubes are placed in pediatric\npatients in the US annually  However  these patients frequently experience complications\nassociated with PG tube placement  Late onset complications  at least   days after PG\ninsertion  were estimated to be     in pediatric patients  Common complications include\ninfections  tube clogging  tube dislodgement and poor stoma formation  Poor stoma formation \nin particular  leads to a variety of problems such as peristomal infection and gastric content\nleakage  PG associated complications often require hospital revisions  resulting in higher\neconomic cost as well as increased patient morbidity and discomfort  Revisions are estimated to\ncost over $  million annually in pediatric PG patients in the US alone  Therefore  effective\nstrategies are required to prevent these complications  without introducing more issues  in\nchildren whose nutrition is dependent on PG feeding  Here  Sharklet Technologies  Inc \nproposes to develop a novel Sharklet micropatterned pediatric PG device that is anti \ninfective  anti clogging and improves stoma formation in children who receive enteral\nfeeding  The power of the Sharklet technology is that the novel micropattern can be produced\nin the same approved biomedical materials used currently  without the addition of any potentially\ntoxic chemical  It therefore offers a safe solution for vulnerable infant and child populations \nconsistent with NICHD goals of ensuring that all children have the chance to achieve their full\npotential for healthy and productive lives  free from disease and disability \nSharklet Technologies  Inc   STI  applies proprietary micrometer scale topography onto a\nvariety of medical and consumer devices in order to control bioadhesion  Design of the Sharklet\nmicropattern is inspired by the microtopography on shark skin that has a natural anti fouling\nactivity  STI has received Phase I SBIR funding to test the feasibility of Sharklet pediatric PG\ntubes and majority of milestones have been achieved  Sharklet surfaces have been shown to\nreduce at least     feeding formula accumulation and prevent microbial biofilms by      In\naddition  Sharklet micropattern promotes human epithelial cell migration towards wounded\nareas by       Building on these successes  in this Phase II project  STI proposes to verify the\nefficacy of Sharklet PG devices in reducing complications  and to manufacture and\ncommercialize this novel device for pediatric patients  Phase II Aims are proposed to scale up\nSharklet PG development  Aim    Develop manufacturing for a silicone PG tube using design\ncontrols and product development to produce a first generation product  Aim    Examine first \ngeneration PG tubes for performance against in vitro tests of anti clogging  bacterial\ncontamination prevention  and cell migration improvement  Aim    Test the PG tube for use in a\npreclinical porcine model of feeding tube implantation to demonstrate improved stoma formation\nin the presence of bacterial contamination or trauma  Aim     Manufacture a final production lot\nof PG tubes for validation and verification testing such that requirements are met for    k\nsubmission with the claim equivalence compared to a predicate device  Phase II results will lead\nto the submission of a     k  regulatory package for a device level claim  The strong Phase I\nsuccess and the broad based technical  business and regulatory skills of STI s expert  multi \ndisciplinary team sets the stage for a successful Phase II manufacturing and validation project\ndesigned to lead to post Phase II clinical trials in collaboration with a third party investor or\nindustry partner  In all  the proposed Phase II project will validate the efficacy of this innovative\nPG product that harbors multiple patented Sharklet micropatterns to minimize PG associated\ncomplications in pediatric populations Project Narrative\nPediatric patients  whose conditions do not permit oral feeding  rely on percutaneous\ngastrostomy  PG  to deliver long term nutrition  The pediatric enteral feeding world market is\nexpected to grow to $    million in      from $   million in       PG tube placement however \noften is associated with complications such as infection  tube clogging and poor stoma\nformation  Sharklet Technologies Inc   with outstanding preliminary results from Phase I SBIR\nefforts  proposes a continuing Phase II project to validate the efficacy and scale up development\nof the Sharklet pediatric PG device that will significantly reduce risks of PG associated infection\nand tube clogging  as well as will improve stoma formation  The potential commercialization\npotential is high as this novel PG device prevents complications described above without any\nadditional chemical  providing an efficacious while safe option for

The proposed chemical sensor probes will be a new class of onboard engine instrumentation for real time monitoring engine and bleed air system operation in flight. Sensor arrays developed by MEI have been demonstrated for ground tests to quantify composition of critical constituents in turbine engine exhaust products, including CO, CO2, NOx, O2, and HC (unburned hydrocarbons). There currently is no flight capable instrumentation for real time measurement of high temperature gas streams from engine bleed air or the turbine exhaust. Ground test demonstrations with high temperature capable (500 to 600oC) solid-state chemical microsensors have shown the potential value for engine health monitoring and detection of engine faults or abnormal operations from ingestion of high moisture levels or particulate from volcanic emissions. The development of flight qualified engine sensors that can measure key chemical species will enable a new level of aeronautical vehicle health management.\n\nPhase I of the program demonstrated approaches in sensor miniaturization and robust probe design that enables placement of multiple species in a compact single port.

        "abstract": "In this proposal, Reservoir Labs introduces an innovative approach to the problem of orbital track reconstruction and discrimination from radar data. We propose a technique that utilizes radar returns over a much longer observation window than is current (minutes and tens of minutes  not seconds), for greatly improved integrated tracking and discrimination. As an example, we extract key information related to ballistic missile break-up events by working in a state-space of orbital invariants only. The key to our approach is the space-time viewpoint, where time is not measured by the counting of measurements, or by seconds on a clock, but by the accumulation of information from measurements. This line of thinking leads not to a conventional track filter, but to a set of static constrained optimization problems that we attack using new methods arising from research in the field of convex optimization. Clutter and debris are very real practical challenges to tracking in the types of environments encountered in BMD. This challenge is also addressed head-on, by introducing a detection-level filtering concept for debris. During Phase II of this program, we will focus on demonstrating our algorithms on measured data and creating a software prototype for test and evaluation.

The computational methods rely on accurate materials damage model that can predict the progression of damage to fragmentation. Peridynamics, an updated mesh-free continuum mechanics method, provides a theoretical basis to model fracture and defects in a continuum solid without special treatment to handle discontinuities and without costly re-meshing to account for large strains.  Peridynamics has been well demonstrated as a method to simulate fracture in brittle materials, but has historically exhibited inaccuracy when applied to ductile fracture. Phase I of the project demonstrated an elastic-plastic materials model with significant improvement in the accuracy of predictions of ductile failure over a range of strain rates.  This translates to more accurate predictions of fragmentation patterns with improved efficiency compared to other continuum mechanics based methods.  In Phase II, the improved models will be integrated into a LagrangianEulerian modeling framework to simulate debris patterns that arise during system level tests of high velocity impacts. The methodology will be verified and evaluated by comparison of model predictions to archive test data.  Approved for Public Release | 16-MDA-8951 (15 December 16)",

Ready and capable simulations could save tens of millions of dollars a year and validate the approach of using simulations to predict system performance and capability.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to empower farmers to capture a greater share of revenue from the marketing of their crops. Agriculture is a significant engine to the U.S. economy, and farming itself is vital to creating economically vibrant rural areas. Farmers are often at a disadvantage when it comes to capturing good prices from their crops because there are significant information asymmetries in the marketing supply chain. We have developed a combination of hardware and analytics that greatly improves crop forecasts at dramatically more accessible prices, which allows farmers and their trusted buyers to make more informed marketing decisions. Whereas improved agronomy could raise yields by 5-10%, improved marketing could raise revenue >25%, especially for high value crops. In addition to the narrow application of sensing hardware and analytics for forecasting, the data collected by our platform can also be used by growers to make decisions that improve operational performance of complex agribusinesses and improve the agronomy of the farm. These tools make it easier to compare performance of crops to improve yields and reduce resource costs. Together this technology continues to raise productivity and profitability per farmer. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project integrates a completely novel plant and weather sensing platform with analytics that synthesizes data into actionable forms that can drive agribusiness decisions. We have bundled a suite of capabilities into a single hardware unit that includes sensing, communications, GPS, mounting, and solar power, which dramatically reduces the cost and increases the simplicity of collecting agricultural data. These data are uniquely designed to monitor crop performance and its sensitivity to weather and management. Data synthesis is a critical pain point in transforming raw numbers into insights for growers to act upon. By creating an integrated hardware platform, the data is poised to provide useful advice that allow a farmer to act on emerging situations, anticipate upcoming events, and even predict the future. Our research objective here will be to generate probabilistic forecasts that use the unique data from our hardware to estimate key crop growth parameters and project forward for an operational yield forecast. This coupling between highly informative quantitative in-field data and sophisticated parameter estimation and forecast techniques could dramatically improve marketing decisions and help farmers capture better prices for their products.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be focusing on automatic pairing and provisioning of Internet of Things (IoT) for the Multi-Family-Home (MFH) industry, to help them increase revenue potential by digitizing their apartments. It is estimated that the Smart Home Automation industry will reach $71B by 2018. If installation and setup of IoT devices could be automated and simplified then the MFH industry could roll out Smart Apartments quickly and in large scale. Being able to gather data and insights on buildings could lead to increased revenue from more efficient use of labor and materials and through better management of energy. It also gives them the opportunity to create new revenue streams from software and services targeted at the data output. The MFH industry can also get insights on their entire building portfolio versus a single building and more efficiently manage their entire portfolio. The MFH industry implementing Smart Home Automation technology has huge societal benefits by integrating with smart grids and utility demand response programs. The potential energy savings of 18M Smart Apartments could be hundred thousand gigawatt hours or $7.3B in savings. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to enable the deployment of a scalable and maintainable infrastructure through the use of mechanisms including automatic pairing, tiered authentication, and network isolation in low cost, resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The problem with existing IoT pairing methods is that they are targeted at Single-Family-Home deployments and the number of nodes that needs to be paired are relatively minimal. However, this is not a scalable model when trying to address the needs of the Multi-Family-Home (MFH) industry. In the multi-family dwelling, the sheer density of nodes creates new problems. The technical challenge that remains for this phase is to ensure that all the devices will easily pair and to differentiate the nodes so that they authenticate and provision to the right apartment in a dense, RF noisy environment. Developing a cost effective, scalable solution for this high-density scenario is a key component to fulfilling the value proposition of mass deployment in the Multi-Family-Home industry. The anticipated result of this project is to solve the issue of pairing large quantities of end nodes and authenticating them appropriately to the correct apartment.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project comes from addressing the thermal challenges brought about by the significant increase in transistor density that semiconductors have experienced over the past few decades. This trend has enabled many advancements ranging from high performance servers to Internet of Things devices. Still, with every advance in chip technology, the difficulty of chip cooling continues to increase. Three major thermal interface material (TIM) market segments exist: polymer composites, metallic materials and phase-change materials. Commercial carbon nanotubes (CNTs) will create a fourth market segment that will supplant existing TIMs, initially in the chip testing market and eventually extending into servers, high performance computing and Internet of Things devices. CNT researchers and small businesses have made little progress towards a commercial TIM product. Among other factors, this failure is driven by poor positioning in the crowded low-cost TIM space, which is currently dominated by thermal greases and pads. Progress towards a viable solution lies in the strategic alignment of product features with industry pain points. This Phase II SBIR aims to develop a means to scale the ability to produce CNT based TIMs as well as to further improve their performance. The technical objectives of this SBIR Phase II project are to: 1) scale up of the CNT TIM manufacturing process to achieve a production capacity of 200,000 sq. in of product annually and to 2) enhance the conductivity of the CNT array by a factor of 3x or more to facilitate entry into the TIM1 and TIM2 market. This project will ultimately develop processes that will translate into achieving production scale CNT based thermal interface materials for the first time in the world. Scale up will be achieved through a combination of physical vapor deposition and chemical vapor deposition processes developed on tools designed specifically for CNT production. In Phase I of this research effort, two commercial products aimed at the semiconductor chip testing market were developed and validated through collaboration with leading chip manufacturers. In addition to the chip testing market segment, in Phase II products will be developed for entry into the TIM1 and Internet of Things markets.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop precision-guided delivery of drugs or diagnostic compounds to the site of damage in traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI is quite common; every year, over 10 million people worldwide injure their brain, and it is the most common cause of death and disability in young people. There are currently no drugs available that would limit the additional damage to the brain from swelling and inflammation after the injury or help repair the brain. The company's technology allows one to guide a drug to the injured brain and keep it there until it has done its job, while less of the drug goes to normal tissues. This way, it will be possible to use drugs that, while beneficial in brain injury, may do damage elsewhere. It also makes it possible to use new types of drugs that would otherwise not reach their target in the brain. If the company is successful in bringing this technology to the clinic, it may make brain injury victims better, and significant savings to the healthcare system may also be obtained. The proposed project will develop a highly efficacious technology platform for site-specific delivery of drugs to acute brain injury. The main reasons for the failure of neuro-protective agents in clinical trials are lack of specificity and the dose limiting effects of the therapy. Targeted delivery can circumvent this problem. In Phase I, the company described a novel peptide, CAQK, which specifically delivers various types of payloads to sites of brain injury from systemic administration. Developing improved variants of this peptide with high affinity and stability is important in ensuring optimal clinical translation of this technology. The objective of this project is to optimize the delivery platform by exploring different modifications of the CAQK peptide, and to use high throughput screening of chemical compound libraries to search for compounds that reproduce the CAQK activity. The outcome of this Phase II application will be a panel of stable, long-circulating, high affinity peptides and/or small molecule chemical mimetics that can be used for targeted drug delivery to injured brain. The most promising compounds will be validated in animal models of brain injury. Transformative advances in brain injury treatment in the form of increased efficacy, reduced side effects, and ease of administration should ensue.",

Negative health impacts of some high volume synthetic colorants are driving demand for natural and safe colorants that are obtained from biological sources. This project will advance the commercial feasibility of a class of naturally occurring pigments that have properties of color, functionality, stability, and safety that make them attractive as food colorants. Based on six years of prior university research, a potentially suitable botanical source of a red pigment has been identified. The goal of this project is to develop a commercial process to produce the pigment from this botanical source. The pigment will be tested as a replacement for a synthetic red pigment that has been widely used as a food additive. The goal is to provide a natural alternative to reduce the health risks associated with artificial colorants. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a naturally occurring red pigment from a plant source as an alternative food color additive. Phase I demonstrated that the red pigment could be extracted at small-scale and performed well in food applications. The goal of this Phase II project is to scale up commercial processes for extraction and purification of this red pigment, and to conduct further performance testing. The pigment, which previously has not been available in commercial quantities, will be produced from a selected variety of a major crop species. The goal is to develop processes to scale pigment production under conditions that will validate a commercial scale. This will include the integration of mechanical separation, food grade extraction, and various commercially-available clarification systems. The products will be tested for performance characteristics and consistency of quality during scale up by examining thermal, pH, and light stability in a range of probable food and other applications.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports the development of a technology to improve the way drugs are delivered in the body. Less than 2% of the dose of any medication finds its way to the place in the body where it is needed. The other 98% is either eliminated or, even worse, concentrates in areas where they can lead to side effects. This happens with all medications from daily anti-inflammatory drugs to the latest cancer therapies. If successful, this new approach will turn a regular drug into a medicine that is concentrated and activated only at the area where it is needed. This advance should increase the efficacy of the therapy and minimize its side effects. For example, the local drug activation can target chemotherapies to tumors with minimal side effects. Antibiotics could be delivered at higher local doses than is currently possible, eliminating local infections and limiting the creation of drug-resistant bacteria. Anti-inflammatory medications could be more powerful, improving the management of post-operative pain, potentially reducing the use and misuse of opioid drugs. Overall, this technology could reduce the costly burden of adverse drug events, estimated at more than $177 billion. To create targeted medicines, researchers rely on the endogenous differences between diseased tissue and the rest of the body (e.g., molecular markers or differences in enzymatic activity). Local drug activation provides a new path to create targeted medicines. The approach starts by injecting a biodegradable polymer at the desired site. The material contains exogenous chemical activators that do not exist anywhere else in the body. Then a drug is given systemically that is inactive until it comes in contact with the gel improving local efficacy and diminishing systemic side effects. Phase 1 results showed that an inactivated chemotherapy eliminated tumors in mice after only 10 days of therapy with minimal side effects. The Phase II project will expand the benefits of the local drug activation platform to other therapies, including cancer therapies and pain medications. The long-term goal is to show the applicability of the approach to multiple classes of drugs and increase their potential to improve outcomes for diseases that affect local areas of the body. If successful, this advance should enable medications for people who are too frail to receive them and enable therapies to work in combinations that were previously impossible due to dose-limiting toxicities.",

Currently, the primary method for an individual to receive customized information in public spaces is through personal devices. The heavy use of personal devices in public often leads to heads-down, isolating, and even hazardous situations. The delivery of personalized information through infrastructure can significantly improve these issues. However, the bandwidth requirements in doing so have been prohibitively high using standard computational architectures. This project aims to improve the performance of such a system, allowing practical applications that will broadly enhance safety, accessibility, transportation, and other areas. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on creating a scalable computational pipeline and architecture that will allow a display system to direct personalized visual information in real-time to large numbers of people. Technically, this involves computing, transmitting, and displaying image data for large crowds in parallel. The architecture takes advantage of the inherent redundancies in this application to provide a cost-effective solution.

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project will continue development of a non-resorbable surgical film which prevents internal tissue-attachment. The proposed device will improve post-surgical outcomes from patients who suffer from internal tissue-attachment triggered by cardiothoracic or neurological surgery. Patients who undergo surgery are at risk for developing unwanted tissue-attachment due to trauma as a result of surgical intervention. This tissue-attachment can lead to severe complications and increase the burden of post-operative care resulting additional expenditures through extended hospital stays, readmissions, and increased morbidity and mortality rates. In addition, undesirable tissue attachment can obstruct the surgical field upon re-operation when necessary. Surgical related tissue-attachment is a problem amongst many surgical procedures in a number of areas. However, cardiothoracic and neurological procedures are often more complicated than gastrointestinal or gynecologic procedures, making any complications more expensive and risky to providers, payers and patients. Additionally, re-operations in cardiac or neuro-spine cases are extremely difficult, which underscore the need for an effective solutions to prevent this malady even more urgent. A product that can effectively prevent undesirable tissue-attachment and provide the surgeon with a clear surgical field and plane of view would be highly desirable in both cardio-thoracic and neurological surgery. The proposed project will conduct additional pre-clinical work leading to a regulatory submission for a cardio-thoracic indication and additional validation within the neurological field. Positive animal studies completed during Phase I & IB efforts revealed the capacity of the Sintact Film? to reduce tissue attachment and provide for a clear field of view upon re-entry or re-operation. Initial Phase II work will examine the feasibility of scaling-up certain manufacturing and production processes resulting in a clinical grade product which will undergo sterility, safety, animal, biocompatibility, and mechanical testing. This testing will be compared directly to a predicate or equivalent approved medical device. Results will need to show equivalency of the Sintact Film? to the predicate device across all testing metrics. Additional Phase II work will enable further validation of the Sintact Film? for neurological indications. A larger definitive neurological study will be completed to address the capability of the Sintact Film? to be deployed effectively in a neurological setting. Positive results from this study will provide a basis for pursuing expanded indications and additional market opportunities. If successful the implications that a non-resorbable product can be an effective countermeasure in these areas would alter the current methodology in the field.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a sustainable, low-cost, and replicable method for large-scale production of micro-algal biomass. Microalgae production is a form of aquaculture capable of producing valuable products including: Nutraceuticals, specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, feed for finfish, shellfish, and livestock, as well as food for human consumption. Moreover, microalgae can be used as a feedstock for biofuels while simultaneously removing CO2 from the environment. However, for the nascent algae cultivation industry to achieve its full commercial potential, the technology must be improved. While typical algal cultivation relies on high-density cell growth, this project will focus on the science of low-density algal cultivation to achieve high productivity, while minimizing process requirements for supplemental energy and concentrated CO2. In addition, the development of a closed-system photo-bioreactor with emphasis on low cost and modular design will allow the process to be easily replicated on a variety of lands with otherwise marginal value. As such, the system can become the basis for a robust aquaculture and biofuels industry, leading to greater economic development in marginal communities and a source of sustainable products for the growing world population. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to further optimize the design of the large-scale algal production system developed during the Phase I project to address key challenges in algae cultivation including frequent contamination, low productivity, and increased operating costs due to inefficient use of water and energy. Research activities will focus on four main objectives: 1) Finalize key design specifications for reactor geometry, materials of construction, and system components in order to maximize productivity and minimize capital costs; 2) optimize harvest apparatus design and biomass concentration procedure to further reduce water consumption; 3) develop a new media formulation to allow for stable pH control without the need for concentrated CO2; and 4) refine manufacturing of the reactor bladder to ensure sterility, durability, and product consistency. In addition to the basic algae cultivation techniques employed in Phase I, Phase II will make greater use of engineering /computational analyses to arrive at optimal designs. The target outcome of the project is a 120,000-L closed photo-bioreactor capable of sustaining H. pluvialis algae production rates of greater than 9 g/m2/d for a minimum of 4 months without detrimental contamination. In addition, the system will provide significant reductions in consumption of energy, water, and concentrated CO2.",

Without dramatic innovations in the development of ultralow power sensory processing, continuous and accurate sensing will remain a niche application limited to environments with a stable and plentiful power source and significant computing resources. The technology described in this proposal will demonstrate the viability and potential widespread deployment of continuous sensing devices in mobile or remote environments with strict energy constraints. An important immediate market for the proposed technology with significant customer base is the smartphone and wearables market, where many new and emerging end user applications could leverage environmental sensing to trigger context-based and anticipatory actions. The proposed technology is broadly applicable to a number of other markets and domains, including medical, health, and safety monitoring of critical patient sensors, personal fitness devices, military applications, and environmental monitors. The ability to flexibly deploy continuous sensing for these and other applications has the potential to revolutionize these markets and create entirely new and unforeseen application domains. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 2 Project plans to research and develop algorithms based on the properties of biological spiking neurons and the sensory processing capabilities of the human brain. The human brain is truly unique in its ability to use a basic computational element, the spiking neuron, and perform a broad variety of tasks. The brain has the ability to accurately classify sensory patterns from multiple modalities (touch, sight, etc.), to interpret the outside world, and to recognize the current context. A key intellectual merit of this project is a demonstration of how these novel neural algorithms can perform accurate, robust, and low power sensory analysis across multiple sensory domains. Just as the brain is capable of processing data from very different sensors. Researching and developing these neural algorithms will provide insight as to how the human brain learns to recognize important sensory information, how it is able to integrate information from such different sense modalities, and how it is able to perform complex analysis so efficiently.",

Each year over 600,000 workers suffer a musculoskeletal injury due to lifting related activities, which cost US companies over $15bn annually. Worker injuries affect employee morale, absenteeism, productivity loss and employee turnover, all of which are challenges to the efficient running of a company and are a unnecessary cause of human suffering. By developing a wearable device that can detect high risk lifting activity and provide immediate feedback to workers, safer lifting practices can be promoted and a reduction in the number of unsafe lifts registered, leading to a reduction in injuries. The project includes three main technical objectives: i) the development of machine learning algorithms to detect lifting events from sensor data, and to measure risk related metrics associated to those lifting events. When a lift is considered high risk, real-time feedback will be provided to the worker; ii) the deployment of the device in an industrial setting at several customer sites for 12 months, with the number of high risk lifts performed by workers quantified over time to measure the ability of the system to drive behavior change in the workforce; and ii) the development of a model that can predict the likelihood of musculoskeletal injures based on the risk metrics measured. It is expected that the outcomes of the project demonstrate a significant reduction in the risk of suffering musculoskeletal injuries, paving the way for a clear return on investment value proposition for the industrial companies and their insurance carriers who are potential customers.",

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable lower cost and better performance for power devices in switching or transferring electricity under varying power requirements across the voltage spectrum in a variety of applications ranging from consumer, to communications, automotive and industrial applications. In all of these applications, the ON resistance of the power MOSFET and IGBTs can be reduced and the switching speed and performance further improved by reducing the device thickness. Additionally, in consumer and mobile applications, reducing the form factor of the power MOSFET devices can enable slimmer and lighter products. A significant broader impact of this technology will be the reduction of expensive and environmentally hazardous waste treatment processes associated with wafer grinding technology used in the power MOSFET industry. While the power MOSFETs developed using this technology can have broad commercial and societal impact, the use of this thin crystalline technology can have even broader impact across all modern semiconductor devices such as LED, PV, flexible CMOS and passive devices. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses challenges to further scaling of Power MOSFETs which are one of the key building blocks of the electronic revolution over the last few decades. While the feature size of transistors has been constantly shrinking, the substrate thickness has been increasing. These substrates are currently mechanically thinned to minimize the negative impact of this increased thickness on performance and form-factor. There are significant challenges to continue this trend and the thin crystalline technology and device architecture proposed here can enable continued scaling of device metrics over the next decade with favorable cost structures. During phase I, functional power MOSFETs were demonstrated with this thin crystalline technology to establish the feasibility of this technology for power devices. This phase II effort will focus on the following specific technical challenges to bring it to market. (1) Develop power MOSFETs with improved switching characteristics using the thin crystalline technology (2) High voltage high current characterization of the thin crystalline power MOSFETs (3) Process yield and reliability characterization of package thin crystalline power MOSFET parts and (4) Convert existing process line to use thin crystalline exfoliation technology in high volume manufacturing flow.",

The commercial potential of this project centers on developing compact cameras for endoscopes, navigational and robotic surgical systems and more. Embedding these cameras in endoscope systems, and even the surgical tools themselves, permits new treatments across a broad range of medical specialties that otherwise are not possible. Switching to the minimally invasive forms of some common surgeries could save an estimated $14 billion in healthcare spending. Oncology, urology, gastroenterology, women's health and pediatric medicine are just some of the specialties that will significantly benefit from these ultra-compact cameras. A broader impact will ultimately come from utilizing submicron pixels in unique ways in high density arrays. The sensor?s small size and fast response times offer unique opportunities for spatial and temporal oversampling. The resulting large numbers of pixels can be employed in a compact multi-aperture arrangement to deliver significantly enhanced color mapping over traditional semiconductor imaging arrays, multispectral imaging, 3-dimensional image reconstruction, motion free auto-focusing, or some combination of the above, providing unique applications in medical imaging, defense, robotics, and consumer electronics. The miniaturization of camera systems calls for the continuous shrinking of pixel sizes. At a certain point, however, the maximum photo-electrons a pixel can hold becomes limited, yielding low\u00a0signal-to-noise ratios and poor dynamic range. This project develops a novel optical sensor that maintains sensitivity down to hundreds of nanometers. As the size of this sensor decreases, the maximum measurable light intensity can remain constant and the signal-to-noise increases, bringing significant improvements to images? dynamic range and color/feature rendition. This result stands in stark contrast to the behavior of conventional pixels where maximum intensity threshold scales down with pixel size and noise increases with decreasing pixel size. Reducing these image sensors to practice requires transitioning from gallium arsenide based devices to silicon. The work focuses on 1) finalizing design parameters, fabrication, and characterization of the electrical properties and optical response of the system and 2) fabrication and characterization of a linear photodetector array for the creation of both linear images and 2-D images assembled from linear images to characterize the noise, contrast and other image quality parameters of the prototype.",

The technology will utilize advanced data fusion algorithms to combine various sources of imagery while preserving the best spatial and temporal attributes of the data sources. The complexity of accessing, processing, and analyzing various sources of satellite imagery creates a significant barrier to its use. Synthesis of regionally and globally continuous high spatial / high temporal resolution imagery is a challenge as in addition to inherent differences in spatial and temporal resolutions of the source data, the new models need to account for enormous data volumes and sparse coverage of high spatial resolution imagery. Existing techniques to handle these challenges have severe limitations which curtail their use outside of the research arena. The technology will overcome these limitations by implementing algorithms that are robust, automated, scalable, deliver accurate data, and are usable in operational settings. They will provide spatially consistent and temporally relevant imagery which will empower businesses with regional and global outreach to make better decisions with better data.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in reducing the energy consumption from air and gas compression. In the United States, industrial air compressors consume over 12% of manufacturing electricity consumption, or 399 trillion BTU. 5% of natural gas production in the US is consumed by compression to move the gas to the end-user. On a global basis, compressors driven by electric motors are estimated to consume 32% of the electricity consumption from electric motor driven systems, or 2,267 terawatt hours per year. At $0.10 per kilowatt hour, this translates into nearly $227 billion of annual electricity costs for compression. Carnot's technology has the potential to reduce energy consumption from compression by 20% or more across multiple compression applications. By reducing the energy consumed for air and gas compression, the technology will reduce the carbon footprint of industrial and commercial activity in the US and internationally. Isothermal compression has been thought unachievable due to the requirement of rapidly capturing the heat of compression. The Phase I project allowed us to integrate proven design elements from prior prototypes, along with a complete liquid recirculation and heat dissipation system, into a single platform. This project will build upon research performed under the Phase I project to bring our compression technology to commercial readiness. A 2-year research and development plan will be executed to address key systems engineering elements of the technology to achieve commercial ready status. A combination of lab experiments, thermodynamic modeling, design, engineering, and benchtop prototyping will be used to develop a commercial ready system design that can be applied to a broad range of industrial compression applications. Further study and exploitation of isothermal compression may lead to an ever-evolving field of application, potentially creating additional areas of research and learning.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the development of a low-cost, wireless, and energy harvesting environmental sensor, and a data aggregation / visualization platform to enable effective communication of data to users and control systems. This project addresses major barriers in our main market, the application of IoT to the buildings sector, where complexity is encountered in the placement and powering of sensors in monitoring locations where access is limited. By reducing the upfront and maintenance costs of wireless sensor networks, the project allows cost-effective building sensor data collection of unprecedented longevity and density. These rich data sets in turn enable myriad benefits, including more effective building management controls and in-depth automated energy evaluations. The commercial availability of a low-cost, wireless, energy-harvesting environmental sensor would enable high-granularity sensing, feedback, and control to several additional markets including industrial, agricultural, and any other market application that would benefit from monitoring where power or access is in short supply. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project focuses on developing a low-cost, wireless, energy-harvesting environmental monitor using commercially available components and standard processes. An energy harvesting sensor of this type is not available commercially, and is uniquely enabling for building energy auditing and controls, supporting a new generation of automation and systems integration while eliminating the cost of extensive powered sensor installation or battery maintenance. This device was developed through Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 in Phase 1 of the SBIR program, in parallel with supporting data infrastructure, including dynamic cloud databases, data access via API methods and a beta data visualization platform. Phase II of the program aims to expand the scope of the low-cost, wireless, energy-harvesting environmental sensor from a network of low-power, short-range devices to a plug-and-play building-wide sensing solution, which includes the incorporation of additional hardware elements, including routers to extend the range of the low-power devices, and the development of automated data analysis strategies to extract valuable building information for the end-user.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in its ability to improve healthcare in fundamental ways, such as (1) low volume draws that will enable diagnostics in low-resource settings like drug stores, at home, or in developing countries, (2) higher quality small-volume samples to make Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostics more competitive with lab tests, enabling faster results in critical care/outpatient environments, and (3) low draw volumes, coupled with small volume diagnostic tests, that will enable improved care for patients at risk for hospital-acquired anemia, including neonates and patients with bone marrow damage caused by cancers or suppressed bone marrow due to cancer drugs. Our technology will enable medical testing from a small amount of blood, which could significantly impact global neonatal and pediatric healthcare, particularly in developing countries, and expand the market for blood containers. This project aims to design a microliter-scale blood container that offers the same analytic stability and consistency as blood samples obtained by larger volume tubes. Critical to specimen stability is the ability to rapidly and uniformly distribute an anticoagulant in a blood specimen. In larger containers, mixing is achieved by shaking a collection tube, creating turbulent flow wherein eddies and vortices mix the blood with the stabilizing reagent. In low volume containers, fluid flow is laminar and shaking does not produce mixing. Typical low volume containers rely on diffusion driven mixing. This process is slow, and frequently results in the formation of micro-clots prior to complete specimen stabilization. We will use our proprietary actuated, surface-attached posts (ASAP) to rapidly and thoroughly distribute anticoagulant in blood, increasing the accuracy and the reproducibility of results obtained from small volume draws. This project will begin with an assessment of the biocompatibility of materials and specimen processing procedures. We will test a number of ASAP configurations in order to minimize the time required for specimen stabilization. The project will culminate with the production of a fully functional prototype that will be validated via comparison against blood stabilized in a larger volume specimen tube.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the production of enhanced-nutrition soybeans that have high levels of protein for use in aquafeed. Meat and fish consumption is rapidly growing due to increased world population and affluence. Aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector. Small wild-caught fish are used for aquaculture feed. Wild-caught fish harvests have not changed in 25 years and overfishing small fish jeopardizes the marine ecosystem. Aquafeed producers are turning to soy-based protein to replace fishmeal but soy-based proteins lack taurine and are deficient in methionine, two important nutrients for fish. To meet fish nutritional requirements, producers supplement soy-based aquafeed with synthetic taurine and methionine. In addition to added costs, synthetic taurine and methionine are produced from hazardous substances, and synthetic taurine has been shown to contain arsenic. Successful development of enhanced-nutrition soybean seeds would reduce the amount of supplemental nutrients required in aquafeed, a $2.2B global annual cost predicted for 2020, and could save aquafeed producers 20% of their additive feed costs. Enhanced-nutrition soybean seeds would be an economical, healthy, sustainable, environmentally friendly and secure source of taurine and methionine for the rapidly growing aquaculture industry. This SBIR Phase II project will use a biotechnology approach to increase the essential nutrients in soybean seeds for use in aquafeed. Many aquafeed producers use plant-based protein, primarily from soybean, as a replacement for fishmeal. However, plants lack some nutrients required for normal fish growth and development. Taurine and methionine, two nutrients either lacking or limited in soybean, are supplemented to soy-based aquafeed, thus increasing feed-production costs. The goal of this project is to increase the levels of taurine and methionine produced in the seeds of a commercial-grade, high-protein soybean variety that has high feed digestibility. Molecular and biochemical methods will be used to identify soybean seeds with: (1) taurine and high methionine levels; (2) uncompromised quality and viability; (3) unaffected levels of other nutrients; (4) normal to higher-than-normal protein content; and (5) low levels of nondigestible compounds. The anticipated results are the production of soybean seeds with a minimum of 0.2% taurine (dry seed weight) and at least 50% more total methionine compared with control seeds.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the effort to bring our biomimetic rotor design to the marine hydrokinetic (MHK) market. MHK energy is a socially and environmentally friendly alternative to hydroelectric power, which harnesses energy from rivers, tides, ocean currents and manmade waterways without the use of a dam. This market is potentially large but still nascent due to high technology costs, concerns over turbine survivability, fish friendliness, and difficulty in permitting deployments. Our rotor's small, flexible configuration is a unique approach that addresses many MHK challenges with the mission of reaching the largest set of individuals underserved by current energy technologies. Our rotor seeks to displace diesel generation and complement intermittent renewable energy sources by providing an affordable, baseload clean energy solution for any individual or community; with the objective of scaling up to larger deployments by leveraging the scalable rotor design. This R&D Project will expand the body of knowledge for the rapidly emerging field of biomimicry by developing a flexible micro-hydro solution that enables energy generation from flowing water by allowing fluids to move over the surfaces of the rotor in their naturally preferred way. This project will transform our promising proprietary rotor design into an optimized MHK turbine to be incorporated as the key component of a flexible micro-hydro system that addresses many of the challenges faced by the MHK market. The rotor is based on biomimicry and was designed using streamlines found in moving bodies of water with a deep profile to maximize the power transfer from low speed flows. The logarithmic design with receding edges results in a turbine that avoids damaging impacts with debris and marine life. The design is stable in variable flow conditions, which allows for a flexible power takeoff configuration with both the generator and power electronics housed above the water for improved affordability. During the project, computational fluid dynamic modeling will be used to simulate design changes and drive performance improvements. The most promising designs will be prototyped and integrated with multiple generator and tether combinations to determine the most efficient flexible power takeoff system. Conversion to power output for 12V battery charging will also be tested and optimized resulting in a complete power conversion chain. The performance of the rotor and system will be characterized by full scale testing locally and with The University of Washington.",

Completion of Phase II objectives is expected to have the following impact: Commercially, the availability of new signage products will create significant economic impact through partial capture of the $14.2B domestic billboard and sign manufacturing market. Up to 10% of US zoning codes are estimated to prohibit LED-based (light emitting diode) signage while potentially permitting a reflective digital signage technology, expanding the domestic market up to $5.6B, with a 10x impact worldwide. Environmentally, greenhouse gas reduction is expected as an alternative to LED-based technology; up to 40x reduction in energy consumption is anticipated relative to LEDs. Additionally, billboard wrap waste will be reduced by replacing printed signage. Scientifically, the use of dielectric elastomers as a class of materials in products would be promoted through addressing technological and manufacturing hurdles currently limiting market translation. Societally, increased impact from timely public service announcements on digital billboards displayed during natural disasters, when catching fugitives from the FBI?s Most Wanted lists, and with Amber/Silver alerts are expected through large-area digital sign proliferation. In phase II, electroactive polymer-based proof-of-concept display modules will be constructed and tested, ready for pilot testing with initial customers. The low-cost display design uses unique electro-hydraulic driving principles to enable exceptional refractive index matching within the optical stack for highly vivid and reflective full-color generation. In phase I, a functional proof-of-concept pixel array module was fabricated using scalable processes. To achieve pilot readiness, improvements in performance, resolution, and calibration to meet advertiser standards are needed, as well as environmental qualification for outdoor operation, development of industry-conscious software control, and qualification of supply chain inputs to enable further production at scale. Phase II research will address these technical challenges by introducing process refinements and quality control standards, conduct color calibration using existing techniques, perform industry-relevant environmental testing, work with vendors to source soft-tooled components, and develop module and multi-module control software. The result of phase II efforts will be a calibrated and rugged one square foot, full-color, 16mm pitch, reflective display module ready for scaling to pilot production following phase II.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to develop copper based pastes for the metallization of silicon solar cells. Photovoltaics (PV) offer an opportunity for clean and affordable energy and over the past decade the PV industry has seen annual compound growth rates of over 50%. Although revenues are high, the profit margins for many manufacturers have substantially diminished, necessitating the need for cutbacks throughout the value chain. One area marked for cost reduction, is in the metallization of the solar cells, which now commands nearly 10 percent of the world's supply. Having the cost of photovoltaic panels tied to a precious metal with price volatility can lead to higher prices for renewable energy; thus replacing silver with copper is a significant opportunity for the industry. Thus the outcomes of this project would be a product for making solar energy more affordable. The project also includes creating two new full time positions in Kentucky in Advanced Research and Manufacturing. This proposal will enhance scientific understanding of the copper-silicon contact formation and durability of the material during operation. The technological feasibility of the copper pastes with an inherent diffusion barrier was demonstrated on standard and bifacial solar cells in Phase I. Phase II will further improve the screen printable pastes to industry standards. To achieve the high electrical performance required in this market, the project will investigate the copper-silicon interface to investigate the mechanisms involved during contact formation, and the chemical nature of the copper-silicon interface. This information will be used to optimize the chemical composition and thermal treatment of the pastes to improve electrical performance and cell lifetime. The pastes will be optimized for industrial operating equipment to provide the manufacturer with a product that can be dropped in, with minimal changes to the production line. Phase II will also involve scale up of the core materials in the pastes to be able to engage customers in further printing trials. Through the assembly and testing of prototype solar cell modules, the durability of the copper contacts will be demonstrated. The outcomes of this proposal will be screen printable copper pastes that can be direct drop in replacement for the silver pastes; thereby enhancing the profit margins of the solar cell manufacturer.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the challenge of fouling on membranes used in biopharmaceutical processing. The successful application of this coating would enable increase in the membrane lifetime and product yield of various production streams as less of the valuable compounds remain trapped in the membrane. This can increase production capacity for life-saving medicines, reduce production costs and, in certain cases, enable continuous biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Furthermore, functionalization of membranes currently involve significant quantities of environmentally harmful solvents, which may be leachable during usage of the membrane. This issue is avoided in the current project by utilizing initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) process which does not require any solvent. This coating technology can also be extended to other systems including wastewater purification, food & beverage production, industrial separations, and medical devices that rely on a similar functionalization. The objective of Phase II will be to demonstrate a commercially viable manufacturing process to produce surface modifications within porous membranes using the iCVD process. Previous work in this subject has focused on top-coats on the top surfaces of reverse osmosis membranes, but the chemistries utilized have never before been demonstrated within interior structures of the membrane filters. During the Phase II work, the performance of the coatings will be optimized by using existing deposition equipment to tune the coating chemistry and process conditions to maximize the flux and throughput by minimizing protein fouling. The other main technical goal of the work will be to translate the current batch process into a continuous roll-to-roll process that is amenable to large-scale manufacturing. The outcome of this study will be a proven coating chemistry that is effective and durable in the membrane application, and an optimized manufacturing process capable of being implemented within current standards of membrane manufacturing.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to develop a new technology that combines advanced bioengineering with traditional chemical manufacturing. This hybrid approach will allow production of high value chemicals for the polymer industry using biomass at a lower price than current petrochemical based processes. This unique approach allows for the retrofit of existing ethanol fermentation facilities in rural areas with a bolt-on chemical upgrading unit to produce chemicals with far higher value than ethanol, improving the economics of operating these facilities and creating new jobs. The initial chemical product targeted by this project has an estimated $100M annual market and is used in manufacturing a variety of consumer products including specialty polyurethanes, inks, and UV degradable plastics which can be dramatically expanded to $1B by 2020 through cost reductions enabled by this new technology. Eventually, this approach combining existing fermentation facilities with a bolt-on chemical processing unit can be used to produce carbon-neutral fuels that are fully compatible with gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel at price comparable to current petrochemical fuels. This project, while here focused on the higher value polymer market, will enable later development of cost competitive fuel production technology. The objectives of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate at pilot scale a complete downstream process capable of manufacturing the target chemical from the intermediate platform molecule produced with fermentation. In upstream Visolis work, the key intermediate has been produced using fermentation facilities hosted at the Advanced Biofuels Process Demonstration Unit at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories and the National Renewable Research Laboratories (NREL) at pilot scale, and based on current performance metrics the intermediate can be manufactured at prices comparable to ethanol at commercial scale. The goals of this downstream project are to utilize the intermediate generated using a 9000L scale fermentation facility at NREL to demonstrate cost-effective production of the target product from this intermediate. The work includes construction of a pilot scale high pressure chemical reactor, production and testing of several catalysts for performance in producing the target molecule at different process conditions, optimization of the chemical production process, evaluation of the process and catalyst for long-term stability, purification of the products to the levels required by customers, and technoeconomic modeling to inform the design of a commercial facility.",

        "abstract": "Abstract  Plant cell cultures are becoming a commercially valuable source of pharmaceuticals  particularly\nthose that are too complex for economical chemical synthesis  For example Phyton Biotech  in Germany  has\nachieved great commercial success by generating taxoids for Paclitaxel production in sterile plant cell\nbioreactors  However  the efficiency of these systems is limited by the loss in viability of the slow growing plant\ncells associated with conventional extraction procedures  The objective here is to develop a system that\nallows plant cells to be harvested repeatedly for high value pharmaceutical products without losing viability \nPhase I demonstrated that nanoparticles can be functionalized to enter plant cells and bind specific bioactive\nflavonoid metabolites before being extruded  and these metabolites recovered  all without loss of plant cell\nviability  Phase II now aims to demonstrate that a similar  but more selective  approach can be used to harvest\nhigher value pharmaceuticals from plant cells  i e  proof of application   The most valuable types of metabolite\ncurrently produced from plants include isoflavones  alkaloids and monoclonal antibodies  the latter from\ntransgenic plants   Phase II aims to show that each of these types of product can be harvested from plant cells\nby their selective binding to nanoparticles on which specific oligopeptides have been conjugated  Each product\nexample is relevant to anti cancer therapeutics  The first is the phytoestrogen  liquiritigenin  which is a selective\nagonist of the estrogen receptor  ER beta that should reduce risk of breast cancer post menopause  This\nflavanone will be harvested from overproducing mutant cultures of licorice root by selective binding to the\nERbeta ligand binding oligopeptide conjugated to nanoparticles  The second example is to nanoharvest the\nchemotherapeutic vinca alkaloids  currently extracted from intact plant material by Eli Lilly  from overproducing\nmutant cultures of Catharanthus roseus  These alkaloids will be harvested by affinity to nanoparticles bearing\noligopeptides representing their binding sites on human tubulin  These two examples are natural metabolites \nbut the most commercially important application of this technology may be to harvest foreign polypeptides  i e \n biologics   such as antibodies  from transgenic plant cells  Here the example will be the harvesting from\ntransgenic tobacco cell cultures of a monoclonal antibody  mAbH    directed against tumor cells  Selective\nbinding will be achieved using nanoparticles in which an oligopeptide mimicking the antibody binding site on\nthe antigen has been conjugated to the surface  In all of these examples the objective is to show that\nnanoparticles can repeatedly remove the desired commercial product without loss of plant cell viability  This\nwill reduce  down time  and could also reduce  response time   for example the urgent requirement for\nantibodies or vaccines in an outbreak of disease  In addition  separation of product by affinity to an\noligopeptide binding site means that the harvested products will be simultaneously semi purified  Phase II\nshould demonstrate proof of application for the nanoparticle harvesting technology as applied to high value\nanti cancer pharmaceuticals  The applicants will then move toward commercialization in partnership with\nidentified pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the US and Europe  see Commercialization Plan  Project narrative\nDrugs can be produced in plant cell cultures as an alternative to extracting them from intact plants  This has\nsome advantages  but a major disadvantage is that  harvesting  the drugs requires the destruction of the slow\ngrowing and expensive plant cell cultures  This phase II proposal is to further develop a continuous harvesting\nsystem in which nanoparticles can be used to extract drugs from plant cells without damaging the cells",

RICCA is based on unstructured data analysis and integration and event context modeling. Its advanced contextual analytics engine enables automated processing flow to retrieve social media data from multiple outlets (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube), extract environmental, social, meteorological, political, economic, and other factors relevant to an event of interest, correlate them in geo-space and time with data stored in a computer-aided-dispatch (CAD) system, and generate alerts for first responders and emergency/incident/crisis management. The innovation in unstructured data processing and integration and multi-resolution event context modeling can improve incident command's situational awareness and understanding. In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of RICCA by developing a set of operational scenarios, identifying the external factors in social media and operational incident data, developing core analytics modules, and implementing algorithms to measure performance and improvements. In Phase II, POC plans to mature the RICCA prototype and its correlation and analysis algorithms for the target scenario established in Phase I and support a pilot protocol by which a social media feed is correlated with operational incident data. Validation and trust algorithms will also be developed to support more timely and targeted response actions and allow for escalation preparedness.",

Ongoing efforts exist to bring motor vehicles and infrastructure onto CV networks, but bicycles have been largely overlooked. Consequently, a significant need exists to bring cyclists onto these networks so other connected entities can be aware of their presence, and cyclists can take advantage of the benefits available when receiving information from other connected entities. To address this challenge, Charles River Analytics executed a successful Phase I effort to design and demonstrate the feasibility of a Multimodal Alerting Interface with Networked Short-range Transmissions (MAIN-ST). Our Phase I MAIN-ST prototype brings cyclists onto CV networks using a hardware-agnostic approach, whereby a commercial DSRC radio and a tethered smartphone are used to source and transmit a basic safety message for bicycles. This CV connectivity enables a suite of MAIN-ST safe-cycling capabilities, including automated hazard assessment with multimodal alerting designed to communicate hazard information while promoting heads-up riding. Under Phase II, we propose to develop and evaluate a full-scope MAIN-ST system, through refinement of and human-use validation of current capabilities, and to pursue commercialization of MAIN-ST through strategic partnerships with industry.

By cost-effectively, in terms of time and resources, collecting representative data in an unbiased fashion, PredNet will allow researchers to reliably replicate, and as a result, validate studies of predictive social science theoretical models.  We successfully demonstrated the feasibility of our approach in an earlier research and development effort, Reliable Mission Planning from Sub-Optimal Data in Cross-Cultural Environments Using Integrated Social Network Decision Models (ISDM).   The ISDM tool set successfully demonstrated in our previous work consisted of several distinct components including handheld applications and server side software.

Lacking are methods to test the effectiveness of user interface technologies for improved situation awareness and decision-making ability.  Knowledge Based Systems, Inc.s (KBSI) Intuitive User Interface Technology Evaluation for Optimal BMDS Performance (INTUITION) method and application framework addresses this challenge by supporting the rapid configuration (and quantitative evaluation) of highly efficient human-machine user interfaces for various phases of BMDS engagement, including long-term, mid-term and dynamic planning, implementation and deployment, operations, battle management and post-battle forensics.  Building off the successful Phase I innovation, the Phase II project enhance the INTUITION methods and tools leading to a hardened, focused, and transition-ready INTUITION missile defense technology application.

The presence of Red Plague is often not located until stored wire is stripped during installation, repair or replacement. Visual inspection for Red Plague is not consistent and is very subjective, especially if the Red Plague is found at the ends of the wire and the extent of Red Plague within the length of the wire is unknown.

Beyond Photonics LLC's \"SWIFT\" laser was matured and largely productized, with an initial unit delivered in Phase I.  In parallel, conceptual and preliminary design and risk-reduction of a very compact short-cavity Tm,Ho:YLF Q-switched laser was achieved, which will be extended significantly in Phase II and result in a robust injection-seeded, actively pulse-stretched prototype.  The compact transmitter will include a \"nano-SWIFT\" that will have size and weight comparable to a butterfly-packaged DFB diode laser but with far better frequency stability and higher power.  In Phase II we will demonstrate output characteristics of 32 mJ, 100 Hz PRF, and 300-500 ns pulse durations from this compact robust injection-seeded transmitter.  This moderate-PRF moderate-energy transmitter will be immediately suitable for 3D winds from ground and airborne platforms and with continued TRL advancement eventually space platforms.  The transmitter will be capable of efficient operation at >4 W average power at lower pulse energies and higher PRFs (e.g.. 1 -4 kHz)  which is suitable for IPDA spectroscopy and hard target measurement lidar systems operating from space (following an appropriate engineering and qualification effort) using either coherent or direct detection with state-of-the-art low-noise direct detectors. The overarching objective of the proposed effort is to develop compact, efficient, and reliable pulsed and cw lasers and lidar transmitters for future NASA missions.  Specifically, we address needs described for 3D winds, atmospheric CO2 and H20 concentration sensing in the 2.05 um region; but we also recognize that such innovations can be readily applied to transmitter laser operation at other IR and SWIR wavelengths and associated instruments.",

In this phase, Evernym will research and develop a decentralized key management system (DKMS) based on the DID (Decentralized Identifier) specification developed in Phase I. The DID specification has already been embraced by the leading developers of blockchain identity solutions and is currently being implemented for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Sovrin.\n\nThe combination of DIDs for identity and DKMS for public key discovery and verification will enable a decentralized identity management (DIDM) infrastructure that will empower people and organizations to securely and confidentially manage and assert their identities. Open standards and established industry protocols will permit identity owners to selectively disclose identity claims and manage their privacy and digital relationships.\n\nEvernym's thesis is that the combination of DIDs, DKMS, and DIDM architecture, using public and/or private blockchains as \"trust anchors\", can meet traditional information security principles of confidentiality, integrity, availability, non-repudiation and provenance as well as privacy-by-design principles of user control, selective disclosure of information, and pseudonymity.\n\nThis proposal presents the basic research challenges that need to be accomplished to adapt traditional PKI technologies to blockchains, simplifying both identity management and key management for individuals and institutions while at the same time enhancing both security and privacy. Our proposed effort and deliverables will enable the development and release of commercial products in Phase III for Homeland Security Enterprise applications and enterprise customers.",

The Brown and Levinson model suggests several of these such as \"bullying\", \"buttering up\", \"discrediting\", etc. A politeness-based linguistic analysis approach, augmented as needed with deep semantic processing and plan-recognition techniques, will be combined to provide recognizers for such strategies.  Candidate strategies will be derived from a literature review of fields such as the psychology of team and group affiliation, marketing and communication, and from interaction with SMEs in the detection of social influence.  Recognizers will be validated first through laboratory experiments establishing correlations with human rating of handcrafted dialogues and then to dataset(s) of real discourse data in the modalities of interest.  Concurrently, if suitable datasets can be found or created (such as in rating data for products offered or changed after discourse), SIFT will explore the real, behavioral effects of these strategies.

Moreover, the filter will exploit classification knowledge to select the motion models used during stochastic simulation of the target dynamics. The stochastic simulation component will exploit a library of target-specific dynamic motion models that are customized for the variety of targets encountered. Each target class will have a defined dynamic motion model derived through knowledge of target motion models in addition to empirical analysis of collected data on these targets. The appropriate dynamic models are selected in real time based on the results of a target classification module, which exploits kinematic characteristics of the object in track, as well as contextual information, and exploits any a priori knowledge of the different targets operating parameters in order to classify the target (or at least restrict it to a subset of targets). Correlated random processes will be used to model any uncertainties in the dynamic model. The developed track filter will be evaluated on realistic sensor data on representative targets in order to demonstrate superior performance when compared with other track filters.

The proposed collision warning system exploits measurements and estimates from different sensors about the presence, relative locations, and dynamics of pedestrians and cyclists near the bus, and assesses the risk of collision by combining this information with the movement of the bus and environmental variables. Upon detection of an alert, a warning is relayed to the bus operator in an intuitive fashion for an immediate response.

However, current blockchain technology stacks have been designed and optimized such that they are tightly coupled to a specific application area.

Digital Bazaar therefore proposes to build a blockchain technology stack that is capable of producing many instances of \"fit for purpose\" decentralized ledgers.

The system will offer a means to deploy a scalable mesh network across a broad area that allows sensors to relay information through open data exchange standards to an operation center for monitoring of both flood conditions and heavy rain conditions that serve as predictors of floods. After collection, the information will be relayed to handheld devices through wireless emergency alerting. In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of RAFFAR by building and testing a preliminary prototype network and performing an analysis of a full-size network roll-out. At the end of the Phase I effort, the RAFFAR system reached TRL-6. In Phase II, POC plans to manufacture sufficient sensors to deploy a 100+ unit network for extensive outdoor testing. The successful completion of this project at the end of Phase III will benefit the nation in both government and commercial sectors by providing real-time disaster data so that first responders can react appropriately based on the best possible information. Commercial applications for this technology include applications in disaster prevention and recovery, manufacturing and equipment monitoring, and irrigation management.",

This will make wind energy more attractive economically, improve the energy security of the U.S, create jobs, and indirectly help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A 2% AEP increase is generally considered attractive. Two turbines (5kW and 50kW) tested during Phase I have shown an increase in AEP between 2% to 8% while reducing the COE by 1% to 6%. About 150,000 turbines worldwide can be potentially be retrofitted with this technology. This project will address challenges related to aerodynamic efficiency of wind turbines and the cost of wind energy. It is based on a deeper understanding of wind turbine aerodynamics from a more 3-dimensional point of view; most wind turbine designs are based on 2- dimensional theories. The key technical challenge in bringing this technology to market is to demonstrate the increase in AEP of utility scale turbines retrofitted with our deflector technology in realistic field conditions while reducing the COE. This will be addressed by performing testing at a few customer wind farms and NREL testing centers. The R&D plan consists of designing, manufacturing, and installing deflectors on a few utility size turbines (30-100 meters diameter rotors). The tests will include power performance comparison between baseline and retrofitted turbines according to international standards.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to significantly improve outcomes for cardiothoracic surgical patients while reducing healthcare costs by ensuring proper post-surgical drainage. In the United States, approximately 750,000 major cardiothoracic surgeries are performed each year. Each of these patients receives an average of two chest tubes to drain fluid and facilitate proper recovery, but approximately 36% of chest tubes become clogged. Patients with clogged chest tubes are more likely to experience post-surgical complications, which can result in life-threatening conditions and significantly increase the cost of care. To mitigate the risk of clogging, surgeons typically use large-bore chest tubes, which are more likely to be misplaced and to cause injury to surrounding organs. The novel device under development addresses these issues by preventing clog formation in small-bore chest tubes, thus maintaining proper fluid drainage. Anticipated impacts of the device include reduced time to ambulation and discharge, hospital readmissions, and nursing time. Commercially, the device addresses a $300 million initial market opportunity and has the potential to save the U.S. healthcare system approximately $1.7 billion per year from costs associated with preventable chest tube complications. The proposed project aims to develop a novel chest tube device to address the clinical need of maintaining proper fluid drainage after cardiothoracic surgery while enabling the use of small-bore chest tubes. Existing systems are prone to clogging, which can lead to life-threatening conditions, longer hospital stays, and increased costs. Building on the feasibility demonstrated in Phase I, the objective of this research is to continue development of the device and prepare for market entry; the research will be performed in three Aims. In the first Aim, critical aspects of usability and manufacturability will be addressed and incorporated into the final device design. In the second Aim, verification and validation activities will be performed to ensure the device meets all safety and functional requirements before clinical use.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the quality of care for anterior ocular wounds. To accomplish this, the project is focused on the development of a novel, hand-held, point-of-care device that can be used to evaluate the ocular surface in post-trauma or post-surgical patients. The device should be able to provide an accurate, objective measurement of a tear film biomarker that can be used by medical professionals to identify dangerous fluid leaks in the front of the eye which can save vision. Currently, this evaluation is only performed by trained eye doctors and requires positioning the patient at an expensive, immobile machine called a slit lamp to evaluate their eye. This cannot be done on patients who are unconscious or uncooperative and availability of this machine is limited. The lack of adequate tools for evaluation results in limited access to care, costly hospital transfers and missed diagnosis of wound leaks which can cause severe ocular infections and permanent vision loss. Successful commercialization of this product is expected to improve the accuracy of ocular examinations in 3.8 million Americans annually and may introduce a new frontier of tear film testing. The proposed project is focused on developing the device for direct use for patient care. The technological aim of the research is on the creation of a sophisticated biosensor that can accurately and noninvasively evaluate the tear film concentration of a specific biomarker. This work is expected to include the development of the electrical circuitry, the chemical composition and the channels for connection to the base unit. The plan is to also design the model for the handheld device. In order to make the device safe for patient use, the device can then be tested for its shelf-life stability and develop the proper sterilization. The next steps of testing can include clinical patients to evaluate the ability of the device to record the findings from the tear film. This information can then be used to refine the exact testing parameters for the device. The anticipated result of this research is a final prototype of the device that can be used for regulatory approval and clinical trials. The goal of the project is to transform the current standard of care for eye professionals and enable physicians to have an objective measure that can warn them about possible wound leaks and potentially save vision.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to offer a low-cost novel filter to purify water with higher effectiveness and superior performance than currently available technologies such as carbon filters. The global water scarcity, including some parts of the US such as the southwest, has led to a strong need for efficient technologies to purify wastewater for direct or indirect potable reuse. Recently, there has been growing concerns over emerging contaminants such as perfluorinated compounds (PFCs e.g. PFOA and PFOS) in surface and groundwater. These PFCs are being found at many groundwater sites and in drinking water wells affected by PFCs. Current technologies are not efficient for the removal of PFCs from water, and there is an immediate need for new cost-effective treatment technologies. To address this unfulfilled need, this project seeks to develop a low cost, reusable filter unit for water purification to remove emerging contaminants such as PFCs. The technology is expected to be used by entities conducting industrial wastewater and groundwater treatment, and wastewater utilities that have a focus on water reuse. The objectives of this Phase II research project are to develop a prototype water filter, test and optimize it for the removal of emerging contaminants with a focus on PFCs. Specifically, the project will focus on: (1) optimization of the adsorbent performance and synthesis method; and scale-up of the synthesis method for bulk production of filter media; (2) optimization of the filter regeneration process; and (3) design, construct, and test a prototype unit of the technology; and determine the process cost. The work will confirm the effectiveness of the filter in removing the target contaminants as well as the effectiveness of the regeneration process to reuse the filter. The PFC contaminants will be first removed from the water and then destroyed. The overall performance of the technology will also be evaluated and compared with other available technologies to determine its cost-effectiveness.",

This software platform will address a need for data integration and analysis tools to aid pharmaceutical researchers in 1) phenotypic screening, 2) toxicology analysis, and 3) drug repurposing. It will help these researchers quickly gather and interpret complex molecular and phenotypic data, making the drug discovery process more efficient and creating value for pharmaceutical companies. The economic impact of reducing the preclinical drug discovery process by just two weeks is estimated to be a $252 million cost savings for the industry. By using data more effectively earlier in the R&D process, this software platform also promises to enhance the quality of drugs that enter clinical trials. Thus, it provides an opportunity to reduce overall R&D spending and increase the number of drugs that enter the market - resulting in more economically priced medicines available to the population. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to build an informatics-based software platform that solves cross-domain data integration, analysis, and user application challenges in order to effectively use data to draw insights earlier in the R&D process and compress the development pipeline for new or repurposed drugs. Using highly scalable semantic graph technologies, a flexible three-layer architecture is being developed that includes the 1) Biomedical Data Layer, 2) Computational Layer, and 3) Application Layer. This architecture allows the system be fully scalable and extensible to other datasets and biomedical applications. The system will be beta-tested by pharmaceutical researchers and evaluated though the creation of scientifically relevant use-cases. This development will result in a commercial software system that makes important biomedical data and insights available to all researchers within a pharmaceutical organization by addressing high need data integration, analysis, and application challenges.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to fundamentally change what a storage device can do, and give storage a third capability that is not addressed by existing storage technology - the ability to actually process user data. For the computation to take place, only the computational request and the resulting data need to transfer over the storage interface, reducing interface traffic and the required power. The advent of Big Data and the increasing use of Hyperscale Server technology have resulted in the creation of an additional storage tier that is different from traditional enterprise storage. This new tier requires significantly larger capacity yet lower cost, lower operating power, and yet must still exhibit enterprise level reliability. This combination of characteristics cannot be serviced by existing technologies, and execution with large data sets typical of Big Data results in inefficient solutions. The information being stored represents the large, unstructured data mined by today's companies for key information and trends that help dictate corporate direction, advertising, and monetization. Future applications include machine learning for video analytics, genome sequencing and enabling Fog Storage and Fog Computing, among others. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project explores the Big Data paradigm shift where processing capability is pushed as close to the data as possible. The In-Situ processing technology pushes this concept to the absolute limit, by putting the computational capability directly into the storage itself and eliminating the need to move data to main memory before processing. The technology innovation begins with a solid foundation of an enterprise SSD tailored for the needs of modern Data Centers. Key technology that will be added to support these capabilities include hardware-assisted quality of service control, low-cost 3D-TLC and QLC NAND Flash enablement through the use of advanced ECC, and a proprietary elastic Flash Translation Layer to support extremely large capacity drives. The final element added to this foundation will be the ability to perform computation directly on the data with the addition of specialized In-Situ processing aided by hardware accelerators.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the potential dollars saved in healthcare costs to environmental protection. The greatest overall savings cannot be judged only in dollars, but in helping to preserve human lives and end diseases and illnesses caused by problems with water. The product will provide unique opportunity to populations to test their water for safety and health benefits, in locations where good water treatment facilities do not exist. The water testing equipment market is divided into low-end, low-cost on-field test equipment (such as nitrate strip) that gives qualitative information about the analytes, and high-end testing devices used in labs (such as mass spectrometer) providing accurate quantitative information. If successful, the sensor technology will bridge the gap by providing low-cost, sensitive, accurate tools for quantitative measurement of analytes. The portable, low-cost, plug and play sensor product will cater to the needs of the water quality monitoring market. The product will also mobilize ?citizen scientist? to partake in environmental data collection and popularize sustainability education. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is expected to lead to the development of a multiplexed, low-cost, portable instrument capable of making real time measurements of nitrate and phosphate in water and soil samples. The sensor system for this instrument will be based on the highly selective nitrate and phosphate reducing working electrodes along with reagents contained in the microfluidics to perform real-time sensing without sample preparation. As the concentrations of phosphate in solution are usually small, and since the inorganic phosphate in a water sample is changing due to biological processes, time is often a critical factor in taking measurements of phosphate. Due to these factors, there is a need for sensitive, inexpensive, and portable instruments in order to monitor the eutrophication process effectively. Currently available instruments for making phosphate measurements in the field do not adequately address these needs. Phase I development showed that disposable electrode with microfluidic integration, and smartphone app controlled sensor is capable of detecting nitrate with high sensitivity and specificity. Phase II proposal is focused on commercialization of the nitrate sensor and development of multiplexed sensor platform to detect multiple ions such as nitrate, and phosphate for larger commercial market.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will address a pressing need for more environmentally responsible coating alternatives in the anti-corrosion market through the commercialization of a novel aluminum-based coating. If successfully commercialized, the aluminum electroplating process will displace multiple existing anti-corrosion coatings, which are based on toxic metals. The current market for these coatings is valued at $10 billion annually. The replacement of the toxic metals with aluminum will eliminate their release into the environment. The process is also expected to be less expensive than the incumbent technologies. The reduction in cost arises from decreases in plating solution, waste treatment, and metal costs. By decreasing the cost of corrosion-resistant coatings, it may also be possible to reduce the flow of plating jobs to less environmentally responsible areas overseas. For the aerospace industry, which is the initial target market, the availability of the process will mean safer conditions for workers, less environmental impact, and lower costs. In the process of addressing these needs in the coatings market, the research will elucidate a variety of interesting phenomena associated with electroplating of highly active metal species. The intellectual merit of this project is associated with its exploration of aqueous electroplating of highly active metals in the presence of atmospheric moisture and oxygen. Typically, electroplating of aluminum has taken place from organic solvents such as toluene at elevated temperatures under an inert purge. The expense and difficulty in scaling this technology has prevented its adoption for many applications, which might make good use of aluminum coatings. The goal of the project will be to overcome the technical challenges in scaling-up an aqueous aluminum electroplating process for producing aluminum coatings. Challenges to be addressed include mass transfer, current distribution, and coating quality control in industrial-scale plating baths. To address these challenges, the project team will work closely with partners in the electroplating industry, ultimately demonstrating the technology at scale in a working commercial plating shop.",

Emerging technologies, such as educational videogames, have the potential to increase the accessibility of learning materials, promote readiness and knowledge of employment options, and improve students' attitudes toward full-time employment. Unfortunately, the lack of an accessible, coherent career planning system in the United States has left many high school students unprepared to meet the rigorous demands associated with being college and career ready. This project will teach critical life, social, and academic skills related to a career in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). This project is designed to enhance student learning, reduce school costs, and increase the efficacy of transition plans, which are mandated for every student with a disability under Federal law. The game aligns with Common Core Standards and the Universal Design for Learning framework. While this project will be designed for students with disabilities, it is assumed the highly accessible career preparation software will also meet a critical need for other students at risk of learning failure or students without disabilities. This project is a critical component of a comprehensive product line that will provide adolescents with virtual career training. During the project, participants will experience mini-games related to their daily living skills, a \"day in the life\" of a person in a STEM career, and social skills that those allow individuals to interpret different cultures in a STEM environment. A virtual mentor coaches the student to make choices that will lead to career advancement and explains the hierarchy of jobs within the chosen career. The virtual mentor also provides financial advice throughout the daily living games, modeling exemplary fiscal management and reinforcing decisions that have a high likelihood of leading to financial stability. The project team will build, test, analyze, and revise the mini-games and then compile the revisions into a beta version of the game. Initial friends and family tests of the alpha builds will include qualitative evaluation using observations and interviews. This will be followed with beta testing in public schools using a mixed methods design. Beta testing will include students with and without disabilities in grades six through nine, special education and general education teachers, counselors and parents.",

        "abstract": "This project proposes to develop an innovative approach to improve and sustain math educators' problem solving teaching skills. Despite the expectations placed on math teachers by the Common Core State Standards, most are insufficiently prepared to teach students how to become critical thinkers. Much of this problem is due to limited pedagogical skills of teachers in providing adequate problem solving instruction and supports on top of teachers' own limited problem solving skills. This project remedies this with its integrated modules and powerful analytics engine that suggests learning pathways for both expert and novice teachers. They anchor their research in National Council of Teacher's of Mathematics Principles to Action. It will help teachers develop confidence and skills in planning and evaluating their lessons, as well as understanding student misconceptions and intervening in a timely manner. Teachers who approach problem solving with confidence inspire students to approach difficult math tasks the same way. This has great implications for how many students will continue to enroll in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math programs. In addition, the project sets the stage for educators to develop 21st Century skills including critical thinking, communication and collaboration - essential job skills for the young minds they mentor. This effort refines and scales up their product, which is a web and mobile application that works seamlessly in conjunction with our current student-facing platform, to provide teachers with timely supports for improving students' problem-solving skills and math communication. This project will deliver professional development continuously and in-context using virtual peers, rich rubrics, interactive tools and actionable data. The analytics engine leverages adaptive learning models in order to build robust modules. The Data Collector Layer will contain interfaces for users to get recommendations, receive user feedback and provide other analysis reports. The Analytics Core Layer will be implemented using a collection of machine learning algorithms. The Service Layer will calculate recommendations based on user profile, user feedback, pre-stored best practices and other use cases. The Persistence Layer will store and get calculated data to recommendation engine's own database. The company plans to conduct several formative evaluations during the course of the project, as well as two pilot studies at the end of each year with a control and experiment group. The results will enable them to determine the effectiveness of ongoing, just-in-time supports for improving teachers' skills and confidence inside and outside the classroom.",

        "abstract": "This project creates an educational, touchscreen-based software that translates visual educational content into accessible, multisensory content for students with special needs, and particularly those with blindness and visual impairments. Consider the challenge in the educational landscape today: schools are increasingly adopting digital tools oriented toward creating a more interactive, personalized experience for mainstream students, but at the same time, are struggling to accommodate their diverse student population, particularly, the 6 million students in special education in the U.S. This problem is exaggerated in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), where content is often complex and visual. This project addresses these challenges, building on what we already know about human information processing and haptic interfaces to create software that will automatically convert highly visual content into content that can be seen, heard, and felt in real-time in class. This project supports NSF?s mission ensuring that inclusion of all students is at the forefront of the digital transformation of U.S. classrooms. The societal impacts of this work overcome several barriers impeding students with special needs from being independent and active contributors in the STEM educational experience and ultimately, many STEM professions. ViTAL projects a direct, financial return on investment for taxpayers within three years of operations, generating both revenue and new jobs, with plans to multiply this growth year over year. The innovation in this project is the creation of methods and algorithms for effective translation of visual content into multimodal content, appropriately down sampled for the nonvisual sensory channels yet effective in conveying the most meaningful information. Such a conversion currently does not exist, which results in high overhead costs to create accessible graphics and is a major pain point in special education, particularly for individuals with visual impairments or blindness. Further, translating graphical content from the visual to the multimodal (visual, auditory, and haptic) space is not a straightforward conversion due to the limited bandwidth of human touch compared to vision and the complexity of features presented in graphical information. This challenge is exaggerated when accounting for the varying types of haptic feedback that can be provided from varying platforms (Android and iOS). This project addresses these challenges, creating a streamlined solution for generating accessible, multisensory content, in real-time, on commercial platforms for K-12 classrooms. The outcomes of this project will (1) create the algorithms needed to provide an automated conversion from the visual to multimodal space, (2) establish a teacher \"dashboard\" to streamline the proposed software?s integration in the classroom, and (3) expand the software to the iOS market while simultaneously uncovering novel haptic effects that leverage Apple?s unique Taptic feedback. Upon completion of the development, the software will be beta tested with partnering schools, and then released on both Android and iOS markets.",

This game is being developed to improve the instruction of photosynthesis and cell respiration, which are required curriculum for high school students in life science courses. These processes are largely invisible, comprised of a complex and interdependent set of interactions, and difficult to teach. By creating educationally sound interactive tools to undertake complicated science subjects, the project aims to increase secondary student involvement and interest in STEM, and to help build the core scientific knowledge and higher-order thinking skills they will need to address the challenges of the 21st Century. The app content and design is based on evidence-based pedagogical approaches to effective science instruction. Developing a more immersive and practicable learning method upholds the NSF's mission to promote exceptional science education and will help attract and prepare more students for STEM-based careers. This work will provide teachers with an instructional tool that conveys accurate details of chemically-based biological processes, enable them to deliver differentiated instruction to their classes, and ensure that all their students, whatever their level of pre-existing knowledge and ability, are able to meet the prescribed national and state-level life science standards. The project proposes to develop and implement a working simulator that produces scientifically accurate output for a virtual lab learning environment, with which students can quickly build practical understanding of the scientific method through trial and error. This enables a) the introduction of legitimate agency into student learning so that their choices drive the learning, b) the generation of meaningful (non-generic) instructional prompts that respond precisely to how each individual interacts with the game, and c) the establishment of a valuable framework for assessing student learning based on their multiple authentic interactions with the simulator. The simulator will represent biological processes using a mathematical model in order to support an arbitrary range of hypotheses. Additional innovations include a) automated tools that differentiate instruction at the classroom level to help teachers address a range of student proficiencies, from remedial to advanced, b) expanded device-to-device student interactions that utilize collaborative assessments and argumentation games, c) app management tools that enable teachers to organize, monitor and assess individual student participation within these collaborative activities, and d) the integration of relevant geohistorical climate data into each player's \"reward garden\" in order to build aptitude and foster interest in quantitative analysis activities.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project includes tremendous commercial potential, societal benefits, and scientific advances. Conventional superabsorbent polymers (SAP) are based on polyacrylates or polyacrylamides derived from petroleum feedstock. They are widely used in the absorbent cores of hygiene products, with disposable diapers representing approximately 85% of the global SAP market of $6B. Increasing consumer and supply chain demand for more natural, sustainable materials and products has driven the development of eco-friendly / natural labeled absorbent hygiene products (AHP). Eco-friendly diaper products currently make up about 3% of the global market and are experiencing strong growth at 10-15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). This project will lead to the commercialization of a low-cost high-performance biobased SAP, offering significant environmental benefits as a more sustainable, eco-friendly alternative to petrobased SAP. This project could also generate positive economic impacts on domestic agriculture by creating new demand for bio-feedstocks such as waste glycerol. Finally, this project advances the scientific and technological state-of-the-art by developing a new bioprocess based on microbial co-cultures that could be extended to render more efficient, cost-effective routes for producing other biobased fuels and chemicals. The objectives of this Phase II research project are to develop a new biological route, based on microbial co-cultures, for cost-effective production of gamma-polyglutamic acid (PGA) and to commercialize cross-linked PGA SAP for AHP applications. In Phase I of this project, a microbial co-culture process was developed for efficient production of PGA via in-situ precursor production (ISPP) from low-cost bio-feedstocks. materials. Building on promising results in Phase I, further R&D will aim to reach pilot-scale production by the end of Phase II. Three specific technical objectives will be pursued: Objective 1: Strain engineering and bioprocess optimization to develop an ISPP fermentation process with commercially viable performance metrics. Objective 2: Optimization of downstream purification, SAP cross-linking, and finishing to produce a high performance finished PGA SAP product. Objective 3: Pilot-scale process demonstration to produce commercial quantities of PGA SAP for large scale customer/partner trials. This R&D plan will lead to transformative technological outcomes. The proposed process based on microbial co-cultures represents a distinct shift from the conventional paradigm of utilizing single-species monocultures for bioprocessing and offers substantial cost-savings. The engineering and process development strategies developed during this project will be transferrable for a broad range of other co-culture bioprocessing applications.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in the improvement of atmospheric state observations from various platforms. This compact, integrated and ?plug and play? receiver design will make the existing observations more available, more economical, and will also enable previously unattainable observations of water vapor distributions within the atmosphere. This environmental sensor?s small size and low power requirements enables its deployment on various airborne, spaceborne or ground-based platforms, such as unmanned aerial aircraft, nanosatellites, ocean buoys, and remotely located ground-based instruments. One promising commercial application is private weather observing satellite constellations. It has been estimated that around 400 remote sensing nano/microsatellites will be launched worldwide between the years of 2016-2018. Water vapor and cloud observations are among the most important observations promising further understanding of weather events and to better synoptic or mesoscale forecasts. Improved atmospheric observations are directly related to increasingly accurate and useful weather forecasts. The benefits are expected to extend widely across the economy. Meteorologists point to more accurate and rapidly refreshed atmospheric observations as one of the necessities for the continuous improvements in weather forecasting, understanding of the atmospheric physics and climate. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will complete the design and build a fully functional prototype of a very compact, direct detection radiometer receiver, operating in the vicinity of the 183 GHz water vapor absorption line. All the receiver components will be designed and evaluated, including a noise source, detectors, filters, Monolithic Microwave Integrated circuits and others, first as individual parts and then within the assembly. A novel receiver architecture and integration of all components into one assembly allow for a drastic reduction in the receiver size and reduction of its power consumption, while improving its observational capabilities and stability. There are several aspects of the proposed effort that are unique and would provide profound advances in ultra-compact microwave radiometry. The receiver is expected to consume less than 0.5 Watt of power and weigh around 100 grams, with a continuous two-point calibration capability at its input.",

Material weight is a primary factor limiting kinematic reach which establishes a need for advancements in material systems. CRG proposes to develop a low-cost, multifunctional thermal protection material system based on CRGs high-temperature MG resin systems. The unique features of these materials will allow for thermal protection, combined with structural contribution, and electrical protection properties integral to the TPS material system. MG could enable a transformative change in interceptor performance, not only expanding kinematic reach, but also improving robustness, reliability, and cost. MG lightweight composites combine a non-flammable thermal barrier resin with fiber reinforcements for structural performance, and conducting pathways integral to the material system for ESD, EMI, and lightning strike protection. In Phase I, CRG demonstrated ablation performance almost twice as good as a state-of-the-art, commercially available carbon-phenolic material and mechanical performance equivalent to phenolic with similar reinforcements. MG was also shown to be conductive when subjected to a high temperature graphitization process. The MG platform presents a new paradigm in TPS design that includes multi-functionality, ease in processing, and low cost.  Approved for Public Release | 16-MDA-8951 (15 December 16)",

(1) Initial research by the Principal Investigator on analyzing the energy drain of AngryBirds has demonstrated the severe energy inefficiency of popular mobile apps in today's app market. The importance of this work is heightened by smartphones being an important enabler of Internet access for disadvantaged people in both developed and developing countries, and hence being an important tool in overcoming the \"digital divide\". (2) Commercially, the project will foster a paradigm shift in the mobile app industry ($101B industry in 2020) from the current feature-centric to energy-aware app design. Such a paradigm shift will have a significant, long lasting impact on the app industry. Energy-efficient apps lead to longer battery life, which in turn leads to longer user engagement time, which ultimately translates into millions of dollars of increased mobile revenue as all major businesses are shifting towards mobile. Hence this SBIR project will lead to a marketable product. (3) Technically, the proposed work will extend the performance profiling technology that is foundational to the software industry into the energy dimension, which is critical to the mobile software industry. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop the industry's first app energy management (AEM) solution to help app developers reduce app battery drain, and extend the battery life of billions of smartphones. The research objectives are (1) to develop advanced energy debugging techniques that can automatically identify energy drain opportunities from legitimate energy hotspots; and (2) to develop an SDK-based app energy monitoring system for monitoring app energy drain when running on consumer phones in the open market. These objectives pose significant technical challenges. While similar challenges on performance metrics (such as running time) have been well studied for traditional software, in particular in high-performance computing, in this project the company is expanding them to the energy dimension for the mobile app industry, which has not been attempted before. The company will develop novel machine-learning based solutions to learn, classify, and auto-detect energy optimization opportunities. As a result it expects to develop the first set of solutions to these fundamental challenges in optimizing the energy drain of millions of mobile apps in the app market.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a hormone-free treatment alternative for women suffering from vaginal atrophy. Vaginal atrophy is a condition in which the vaginal tissue is thin, dry, and inelastic. Women with vaginal atrophy experience day-to-day vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse. This SBIR project catalyzes the development of a technology platform that will enable a novel home-use, hormone-free medical device to treat vaginal atrophy. This project represents a medical device treatment for vaginal atrophy developed specifically for women wishing to avoid hormone-based therapies. Currently available treatment options fall in two categories: over-the-counter products and hormone-replacement therapies. Over-the-counter products, like lubricants, are available at drugstores, but these products are often limited in their efficacy relative to the severity of symptoms many women experience. Hormone-replacement therapies on the other hand, such as estrogen creams, can be effective for women; however they are contraindicated for large market segments of women (e.g. breast cancer survivors and women with cardiovascular risk factors). Therefore, this SBIR project is critical to the development of a safe treatment alternative for women and represents a chance to significantly improve their quality of life. The proposed project supports the technical work required to develop this medical device treatment and addresses a major unmet need for breast cancer survivors and post-menopausal women. The work supported by this SBIR grant will complete necessary device improvements and prepare the technology platform for commercialization. The main objectives of this project are to 1) optimize the device for safety and usability, 2) execute specific design enhancements to ensure cost-effective manufacturability, and 3) complete all necessary quality system testing to meet FDA (Food and Drug Administration) requirements. To achieve the first objective, the company will complete all prescribed activities under the company's quality management system. User interviews will also be completed with device prototypes to explore features that enable and encourage appropriate device use. This work will be completed in cooperation between the company's engineering team and an outside industrial design firm. The second objective will require design for manufacturing activities, which will also be completed in a partnership with an outside firm. The third objective will be executed again by following the company's quality management system policies, processes, and procedures. All of these activities, once complete, will ensure the company's device is ready for commercialization.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project, if successful, will be to advance the development of a novel microbial fuel cell (MFC) system that generates energy from the wastewater being treated. MFC technology could revolutionize wastewater treatment for small and mid-sized breweries, fruit processors and other food and beverage processing plants. Over 40 billion gallons of wastewater are produced every day by sources such as breweries, juice processors, dairies, and other bottling plants. The company's microbial fuel cell technology is expected to offer significant economic/technical advantages for these companies by reducing their disposal costs, reducing the footprint of treatment facilities, and helping them to adopt a more sustainable process for wastewater treatment. MFC technology also has potential in the low-cost, highly-efficient treatment of municipal wastewater. The objectives of this Phase II research project are to construct and validate the performance of an innovative MFC technology in a scaled-up, simulated commercial-scale system and to validate the technical and economic benefits of utilizing this system to effectively clean brewery and fruit-processing wastewater at volumes representative of commercial operations. Small to mid-size breweries, fruit processers and other food and beverage processing plants are searching for an affordable and effective water-treatment option. A promising approach is microbial fuel cell technology; however, significant technical/economic challenges have prevented commercialization of this technology. During Phase II, the MFC technology will be scaled up and tested at near-commercial scale to demonstrate the same high performance metrics. The cost-effective cathode and separator components and highly efficient reactor design are expected to finally make MFCs practical for wastewater treatment applications.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project answers the call that science students go beyond memorizing facts to understand content on a deeper, conceptual level. In chemistry, this goal is particularly difficult to achieve because the underlying concepts describe the behaviors of particles that are not directly observable to students. College instructors are also under added pressure to transform their teaching methods to help ensure student retention and success. In the subject area of organic chemistry, this transformation is even more important, due to the relatively high fail-rate in the course, especially for under-represented minorities and first generation students. The mobile learning tools and data collection platform in this project would help to solve both of these issues with an innovative method for intuitive learning and assessment which helps to make molecules and reactions come alive with game-based mobile applications. The game apps are playable by students of all ages, so the concepts of organic chemistry, as well as other science courses, become familiar and accessible as early as middle school. The broader vision is to open the pipeline for students to progress into STEM careers which have been difficult to reach in the past. This project makes the theoretical touchable for organic chemistry students by building mobile game-based learning tools based on mechanisms, a key underlying concept used to teaching the course. This project will produce the Mechanisms suite of game apps, and bring an intuitive, tactile interface to learning chemistry. The research and development of this phase of the project will expand the user interaction model from Phase I to multiple modules of content for students. The data from the mobile learning tools will be synthesized with machine learning techniques to create an adaptive method to ensure the applications provide the appropriate level of challenge to the student learner. Clinical and longitudinal efficacy studies will be part of the research effort as the game modules are developed and released. The data platform will be optimized to integrate with multiple learning management systems and to be readily expandable to subjects beyond organic chemistry. The dashboard of the platform will allow both instructors and students to access the data and inform learning processes to achieve greater comprehension and success in the course. Commercialization will be achieved through direct-to-student downloads, subscriptions of the data platform by institutions, and licensing the technology to courseware providers.",

        "abstract": "This project seeks to develop, manufacture, and evaluate a novel nervous system simulation platform consisting of freely connectable electronic neuron modules. These devices will be used in the secondary education and post-secondary education classroom to further students? conceptual grasp of neuroscience, engineering, and physiology, and to generate lasting enthusiasm for a career path centered on the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) sector. Per a 2012 study by the Department of Education, undergraduate STEM major retention rates are only 35% from initial declaration through graduation. Studies have shown that unengaging introductions to STEM are partially to blame. The firm believes that their product?s positive effect on new knowledge formation and student enthusiasm for STEM has the ability to increase this low retention rate. They also believe that the company will grow at a similar rate to our benchmark companies in STEM and neuroscience education which, after approximately five years in business, each have several dozen employees and annual sales greater than $1 million dollars. The outcome of our proposed project includes development of an electronic neuron simulation ecosystem, as well as development of instructions, experiments, and curricula for NeuroBytes secondary and undergraduate education classroom use. The prototypes produced during Phase I of this project were suitable for proof of concept demonstrations and testing, but much work is needed to develop robust and student-friendly devices for large scale manufacturing at the end of Phase II. Through our Phase I customer development interviews, much important insight was gained into needed and desired input/output devices, accessories, and kits in the secondary and tertiary education segment. These accessories and devices will be an important outcome for increasing the commercial potential of our products. The curricula will be developed in conjunction with partner educators at the middle school, high school, and college levels to ensure that they are properly structured and documented for the maximum possible benefit by our future customers.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is aimed at improving healthcare patient outcomes, potentially saving lives, and decreasing healthcare costs. The Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 set stricter manufacturing standards on sterile injectable compounded medications that have closed many third party suppliers, thus creating shortages and higher prices. In response, the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists expects 40% of the US market, 2000 hospitals, by 2018 to receive insourced compounds. Hospitals that insource hope to decrease their costs and improve patient safety with higher quality product. Today, insourcing hospitals often have multiple information systems and use paper records cobbling together how a compound is made and to whom it has been administered. When an ingredient recall occurs, hospitals spend hundreds of man-hours identifying the problem source and affected patients. To prevent further patient risks speed is demanded. This SBIR Phase I project will provide hospitals the capability of an end-to-end quality management that will track every production process step and tracing medications to patients. Hospitals will be able to prevent patients from receiving recalled medications and identify quality production compromises thus improving patient outcomes and potentially saving lives. The proposed project is a novel medication barcoded label encryption technology compatible with existing hospital scanners to provide track and trace capabilities of intravenous medication compounds. Key objectives include both patient specific and anticipatory workflows with labels, a Passive Auditing management system for compounding quality control, and an innovation to improve operating room environment medication barcode scanning compliance. Today, healthcare providers utilize multiple barcoded label technologies with minimal embedded medication data across disparate systems. Medication labels could be the link across these systems for ingredient traceability. However, existing solutions are inadequate to meet 2013 legislative traceability mandates. The project invention will encrypt serialization fields within the barcoded label connecting a specific medication to its production data, and eventually to the patient. Compounding process data, such as ingredients, environmental conditions, and production instructions, will be connected to individual medication labels and stored in the patient?s electronic record. When an ingredient is recalled or questionable process identified, an extraction algorithm will pull the encrypted data from the EHR and will be connected to production data. Success of this project will be label readability by existing hospital scanners and retrieval of the serialized data from the EHR",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will support the technological refinement and concomitant commercialization of the first accurate and portable instrument that can perform in the field nondestructive test for hardness, strength and ductility of existing infrastructure. The material properties measured include yield strength, work hardening exponent and ultimate tensile strength of metals, specifically steel. The on-shore oil and gas pipeline transmission industry has pressing needs for non-destructive tests because of the aging infrastructure, national need for energy, and recent explosions and leaks that have cost lives and billions in remediation. Although transmission pipelines have low failure rate per mile of assets, pipeline operators are asked to proactively enhance pipeline integrity where they do not have all the necessary strength data. Therefore, there is an immediate need to verify strength during the 80,000 excavations done each year so that the life of these costly assets can be extended by identifying and remediating the few sections that are vulnerable within the extended network of 300,000 miles of pipelines. Pipe cut-outs and hydrostatic pressure tests are alternatives to nondestructive testing, but both damage the asset and require expensive and complex service interruption. The overall technical objective of the Phase II work is to perform the necessary research and development to enable the development of engineering specifications, system integration, and validation of the instrument to successfully perform valuable nondestructive testing to provide precise and accurate material property data. The research and development program includes three milestones, each enabling the implementation of the research into design and manufacturing of beta test units. Milestone 1 is to enable full instrument functionality under adverse field environments such as vibration, moisture, and extreme temperatures. Milestone 2 is to perform the necessary work for designing ruggedized field units. Completion of this milestone will enhance the capability for initial field testing services. Milestone 3 is to develop the knowledge to fully and reliably integrate the system, validate the sub-systems, and package it for manufacturing. The overall goal is to enable the company to have the necessary knowledge and experience to enter the instrument market with a leasing program for use in pipeline inspections.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the result of introducing a new generation of low-power wireless sensors for detecting Acoustic Emission events and detecting fatigue damage in structures. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the US transportation infrastructure has 605,102 operational bridges, of which 66,561 are structurally deficient. In particular, the fatigue damage monitoring technology of the project will initially target the more than 18,000 US highway bridges that are categorized as ?fracture critical? by the Federal Highway Administration. The technique?s ultra-low energy consumption will enable its use in low-power wireless sensors and make it an ideal response to this challenging problem. The anticipated benefits and commercial applications of this project are (1) a low-cost, easy-to-use mechanism for effective monitoring, allowing for early detection and timely repair of fracture and fatigue damage in infrastructure systems such as highway bridges; (2) improved public safety, with reduced maintenance costs and extension of the service life of critical and high-valued infrastructure systems; and (3) additional commercial applications in monitoring the structural health and integrity of other structures, including aircraft, oil and gas pipelines, machinery, cargo cranes, ships, etc. Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses distributed structural health monitoring (SHM) of infrastructure systems, particularly highway bridges. Because the creation of fatigue cracks in a structure is accompanied by the propagation of acoustic emission (AE) waves, wireless AE sensors can be used to detect such cracks. However, a challenge of AE detection sensors is high energy consumption, significantly more than the energy available in a battery-operated wireless device. As a result, conventional AE detection methods cannot be used with low-power wireless sensors. This project uses a novel and ultra-low power technique for long term monitoring of strain. Then, AE monitoring is activated only if history of tensile strain in the structure under monitoring suggests likelihood of fatigue damage. In addition, using history and pattern of AE events, the method estimates the severity of fatigue damage in a material. Moreover, the method uses a variety of techniques to eliminate the effects of mechanical noise on AE measurements and achieve a high reliability in fatigue damage assessment. After development, the method is planned to be evaluated on highway bridges, airframes, and pipelines.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project will develop an easy to use real-time formative assessment tool for educators that will be uniquely aligned to each student and deployed via a virtual reality learning game that uses venomous marine snails as a conduit for exploring scientific issues in nature. The USA is currently ranked 52nd in the world in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. This is detrimental intellectually and economically to the future of American society. Recent studies indicate it is not what is taught, but how it is taught that enhances student-learning abilities, particularly as it pertains to STEM. As a result, this project is driven by the research objectives to understand how children learn specific science content and why certain game elements are better suited to convey scientific material. The outcome of this project is a proprietary multi-tiered formative assessment tool that can measure real time student learning of novel STEM content obtained through a virtual reality learning game experience. This project will enable teachers to nimbly tailor future instruction with individualized student learning goals. Commercialization of the products created in this project will transform scientific learning and measurable engagement in educational games for social and economic benefit to meet the NSF?s mission of supporting education initiatives that improve the lives of U.S. Citizens, and generate income for tax revenue and jobs via the employment of software designers, educators and scientists. The proprietary technology developed in this SBIR Phase II will be a first-of-its-kind assessment dashboard that will link virtual reality and web-based learning environments with formative assessment to fuel instruction and deepen learning. This project will build proprietary assessment tools into online and virtual reality games which continuously engage users in the process of scientific inquiry and discovery using novel formative assessments customized to each player. The proprietary assessment dashboard allows teachers and players to measure their progress in real-time and identify opportunities to enhance their STEM learning. Using Unity as the platform, player actions and decisions will be met with tailored formative assessments and ongoing feedback throughout game play. This feedback helps teachers delineate where their students are along their learning progressions and fuels further instruction. The novel approach of this assessment dashboard transforms qualitative and quantitative learning and has the potential to significantly enhance student engagement and commitment to scientific inquiry to support emerging science changemakers. The research objective of the player/teacher dashboard is to align feedback on student learning during game play with dynamic quantitative and qualitative formative assessment that create a seamless demonstration of knowledge acquisition while providing teachers with multiple opportunities to engage learners in deeper and more meaningful levels of inquiry before, during, and after gameplay. The products generated from this project are aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and the International Baccalaureate (IB) program to ensure the content is of the highest caliber and distribution is to a large global customer base. The anticipated results from exposing teachers and students to this project will be increased competencies in STEM, which will transform players into lifelong learners and enhance engagement in STEM fields and careers.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the proposed system will enhance the ability of the 1.3 million people currently living in the United States with a lower limb amputation to walk in unconstrained environments. The proposed Quasi-Active Prosthetic Ankle System (QPAS) addresses the RH6: Human Assistive Technologies area. QPAS will be lightweight, have a long battery life, and optimize the passive dynamics of amputee gait in unconstrained environments by using battery energy to tune its physical system properties, ankle equilibrium angle and torsional stiffness. The device provides a unique set of features that do not currently exist in the market, strengthening its value proposition. The amputee population is growing; 2,000 new lower limb amputation are performed each week. Therefore, QPAS will have strong market potential and the significant societal impact of improving health by supporting a more active lifestyle for lower limb amputees. This will also lead to more community and family involvement. Additionally, because of the many possibilities to control QPAS, gait researchers will be able to study amputee compensation preferences. A better understanding of the kinematic and kinetic preferences could lead to improvements in the design of purely passive ankle prostheses. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the needs of lower limb amputees. Lower limb amputees suffer from reduced self-selected walking speed, increased metabolic cost, increased reaction loads on the sound limb, poor gait symmetry, and reduced stability with increased risk of falling. Passive prosthetic feet are only tuned for level ground walking at one speed. QPAS will utilize a patented compliant actuator to achieve a unique set of features: passive energy storage with an articulating ankle joint, adaptable ankle angle for slope gait, low electrical energy usage, a large range of ankle motion, adaptable stiffness to optimize variable cadence level ground and slope gait, and controlled energy delivery to ensure energy builds naturally and smoothly. In this phase 2 SBIR, an intuitive and autonomous controller will be built for the QPAS and human subject evaluations will assist in refining the device towards commercialization. QPAS will become a successful product by focusing on improved amputee gait performance in unconstrained environments, and being simple to fit and adjust, reliable and affordable.",

        "abstract": "This project will improve the awareness and perception of careers that require science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) competencies. Advocacy is a critical component of career readiness, yet current advocates (parents, guardians, educators, or members of the community) are often not in the position to inform students of potential career options. Career and workforce readiness programs are resource constrained, don't meet the needs of differing learning styles, have inherent bias, and are largely focused on compliance over student competency building. Many underrepresented youths who would otherwise succeed in STEM are often deterred by a lack of role models. If youth understood the opportunities, they could pursue academic pathways to amass skills that better prepare them to enter the workforce. Furthermore, educators need professional learning experiences and access to insights about their students in order to improve STEM teaching and learning. Helping individuals select rewarding and suitable degrees, training, and careers will increase the likelihood of higher job retention. As more individuals are inspired to pursue and stay in STEM, taxpayers will benefit from increased innovation which in turn will provide tax dollars to invest in such things as healthcare, national security, education, or humanitarian assistance. The project will address technical challenges of amassing and distributing massive amounts of 3rd party STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) resource data (both structured and unstructured), developing an information management system for educators and families, developing adaptive learning skill modules, advancing a second generation smart recommendation engine based on big data, machine learning and predictive modeling techniques, and performing database mining and creating data visualizations to derive meaningful workforce development insights. In addition, the project will involve controlled experiments and usability tests whereby a large amount of anonymized and aggregated student data and business/education entity feedback will be collected. The ultimate goals of the R&D and experiments are to validate that the resulting application, predictive models, information management practices, advocacy networks, and data visualizations have the desired outcome of boosting immediate and near-term student outcomes regarding STEM career intentions and actions.",

        "abstract": "This project will address the need for accessible, creative music education. Over 90% of Americans believe music education is valuable, but very few people ever learn enough to create their own music. Instrument lessons are a great way for some beginners to learn about music; however, instrument lessons are expensive and difficult, and focus on performance and technique at the expense of creativity. This project uses a simple audiovisual composition interface to empower music learners to create their own original music on mobile devices from the very beginning of their music education. By combining this intuitive composition interface with data tracking and analysis, this project creates the opportunity to provide music makers with personalized, adaptive feedback as they compose. Currently, $3 billion are spent each year in the United States on instrument lessons, even though they are unaffordable for many potential customers. By leveraging the proliferation of mobile devices worldwide, this project will deliver an accessible, low-cost digital music education option, creating a new market that includes customers who are currently priced out. Expanding participation in creative music education will increase the quantity and quality of music composed worldwide, while also building a sustainable, revenue-generating business and creating new jobs. Through data-driven agile software development, this project will address the need for accessible music education through the creation of a technology platform that delivers adaptive learning to musical beginners. Because the platform upon which this project is built is already empowering the creation of thousands of songs each week and collecting usage data from live users, this project is uniquely positioned to tackle the complex problem of providing algorithmic feedback on creative work at scale. Research and development will proceed in four stages: (1) expanding internal tools to allow for direct analysis of the thousands of songs being created on the platform each week; (2) developing an algorithmic approach to analyzing songs and reporting the results to users; (3) applying analysis to match users with relevant communities and collaborators; and (4) implementing adaptive learning approaches to help users more effectively learn to create music. This staged development process will result in an innovative and highly differentiated technology that enables beginners with no musical experience to compose their own music, and uses data to actively support their individual needs as they learn.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\n After decades of effort  global campaigns to eradicate poliovirus are nearing completion  Eradiation of\nwild type PV   has been certified and PV  and PV  may be eradicated in the next few years  Many\norganizations and countries have collaborated in these efforts and are to be congratulated for their dedication\nand persistence  The oral polio vaccine  OPV  has been the workhorse of mass vaccination efforts because of its\nlow cost and ability to stimulate robust and durable immunity  However  OPV quickly reverts to pathogenic\nphenotypes in the human and vaccinees secrete wild type virus that can infect na ve bystanders  In addition \nthe virus can replicate chronically in immune compromised people who can shed virus for many years  For\nthese reasons  OPV is being replaced by the inactivated polio vaccine  IPV  which also stimulates durable\nimmunity  Unfortunately  IPV costs considerably more than OPV per dose  $    vs $     on the subsidized\nworld market   Because the WHO and most countries have plans to continue vaccination for at least    years\nafter eradication  there will continue to be a market for the vaccine  Because of the high cost of the IPV  efforts\nare underway to derive improved and less expensive IPV vaccines \n In a Phase   SBIR  we tested the feasibility of producing a less expensive IPV using a recently developed\nradiation inactivation method  A reconstituted Mn   decapeptide phosphate complex  MDP  from the\nradiation resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans protects antigenic sites in proteins from oxidative\ndamage at radiation doses that obliterate DNA RNA genomes of viral and bacterial pathogens  We\nhypothesized that the new method could increase the antigenicity per unit of starting virus because it avoids\nthe extensive         day formalin incubation that damages the polio antigens by spontaneous protein\ndegradation and cross linking epitopes  Preservation of antigenicity would increase the number of doses that\ncan be produced per milligram of purified virus and simplification of the inactivation process could reduce\ncosts further  After optimizing the process for inactivating      of virus infectivity while protecting the protein\ncapsid  we normalized the irradiated PV  virus to the D antigen concentrations found in commercial vaccines \nRats immunized with irradiated PV  developed robust neutralizing titers  A      fraction of the normal human\ndose of irradiated PV  stimulated similar levels of neutralizing antibodies as a  X dose of the commercial IPV\nproduct \n We propose to extend these findings to include PV  and PV  and then derive a trivalent vaccine having\nthe minimum dose of each component that stimulates equivalent neutralizing antibody levels as IPV  In\naddition to a reduction in cost  the novel vaccine will have two additional features  the use of attenuated Sabin\nstrains and the development of lyophilization procedures  The transition to Sabin strains will reduce the\nbiohazard risks currently associated with producing large quantities of pathogenic strains  This feature may\nallow less sophisticated companies or government labs in developing countries to manufacture their own\nvaccines  In addition  the use of the Sabin strains may improve acceptance of the product due to the reduced\nrisk perception associated with low levels of residual infections virus that may not be detected in quality\nanalysis procedures  The development of a lyophilization process would improve product stability such that the\nvaccine would not require refrigeration during shipping and may reduce the need for refrigerated storage  In\naddition  a lyophilized vaccine could be stable for many years when placed in national vaccine stockpiles \n We have discussed the findings of the Phase I with several polio vaccine experts and scientists at\ncompanies that currently manufacture the vaccine  The results have been met with enthusiasm and interest for\nfuture interactions  We will keep the wider community informed of our progress during the Phase II so that we\nmay have partnering options earlier in the development process than originally planned \n The main goal of the project is to develop an improved and less expensive inactivated polio vaccine \nHowever  the project will also advance the irradiation technology using a highly characterized virus  The same\nmethod could be applied to the rapid and efficient preparation of vaccines against newly emerging pathogens\nsuch as Ebola  Zika  and other deadly pathogens  The regulatory pathway derived from the development of a\nradiation inactivated PV vaccine would be invaluable when developing vaccines against these less\ncharacterized pathogens Narrative\n Because of safety concerns surrounding the reversion of pathogenic phenotypes with the\nuse of the oral poliovirus vaccine  OPV   WHO and other agencies recommend that inactivated\npoliovirus vaccines  IPV  be used in the final stages of global eradication and for post \neradication vaccinations  The WHO advises countries to continue vaccination    years after\neradication is certified and many countries plan to stockpile polio vaccine for biosecurity\nreasons  We estimate a need for    B vaccine doses over the next       years  IPV is produced\nby inactivating purified virus by prolonged incubations with formalin which reduces the\nimmunogenicity and leads to a relatively high price of $    dose compared with $     dose for\nOPV \n In a Phase   project  we tested a recent discovery for improving the immunogenicity of\nIPV while reducing the manufacturing costs at least    fold  Our collaborator  Dr  Michael Daly \nfound that a decapeptide manganese complex protects the protein component from ionizing\neffects of high doses of radiation  Using PV   we have optimized the conditions to inactivate\n     of the infectivity while protecting the antigenic proteins from radiation damage  In\nimmunization studies in animals  we found that  at lower antigen doses  the irradiated PV \nstimulates significantly higher neutralizing responses compared to the commercial IPV used at\nthe same concentrations  In this Phase    we propose to extend the studies to include PV  and\nPV  serotypes and to perform additional animal studies to solidify the immunization results \nWe will optimize the concentrations of the three viruses in the trivalent vaccine and perform\nadditional studies on the mechanism of antigen protection  In addition  we will investigate\nlyophilization as a method of improving long term storage of the vaccine and other measures to\nprepare for IND enabling studies  If successful  this vaccine may help ensure a polio free future\nby developing a safer and more cost effective vaccine",

More specifically, the Phase II project will demonstrate net power drag reduction on an airfoil section similar to that used on Predator B UAVs.  A preliminary design analysis based on earlier wind tunnel results indicates that, for the same take-off weight and fuel load, a SLIPPS system offers dramatic performance benefits for a Predator B-like system.  For example, the estimated 60% reduction in turbulent viscous skin friction drag makes possible substantial increase in loiter time, payload, or operating radius can be increased.",

Functionality of the imager includes the ability to track the target with and without targeting lasers using a very high frame rate imager with region of interest that allow >6,000 frames/second to remove motion blur from the fast moving projectile.  The advantage of SWIR is its ability to image at long range through the atmosphere while being an uncooled technology thus minimizing the SWAP and cost.  The removal of the cooling system and the minimum number of components to operate the imager with high speed imaging is necessary to survive launch shock.

We propose to develop an innovative ventilation and cooling system that will maintain a cool, dry environment inside the helmet while also meeting applicable safety standards. The key thermal technology innovations are: (1) increased internal ventilation at moderate- to high-speed travel enabled by a novel comfort padding design, and (2) a custom blower for adequate ventilation of the microclimate in the face during low-speed travel (near 0 MPH). In Phase I, we proved the feasibility of our approach through numerical modeling and laboratory tests. We will use the\nPhase I results to develop a detailed design concept for development and testing in Phase II.

        "abstract": "The distributed nature of the power grid, and of its regulatory and supervisory system, makes user adoption of automated technologies even harder than usual. Perceived utility and perceived ease of use, the two principal drivers of user adoption, are harder to achieve in a diverse environment in which users will have different scope of responsibility and skill levels. The difficulties in anomaly detection will set a high floor to the false alarm rate. A large number of false alarms, that need to be responded to by a distributed heterogenous team of supervisors, can easily trigger in supervisors a \"cry-wolf\" effect, rendering the detection system useless. To achieve the objective of helping power grid operators build and maintain situational awareness, without succumbing to user rejection, Barnstorm Research proposes to develop RAMI, an anomaly detection triage engine. To avoid triggering the cry-wolf effect, RAMI will sort the predicted adverse events into detection classes according to their impact on supervisor actions. The detection classifier will analyze the predicted failure mode and the corresponding recovery actions along multiple complexity metrics (duration, geographical scope, severity). The detection classifier will use class-specific action thresholds, tailoring the false alarm rate to class-specific ability to mitigate its effects.",

        "abstract": "Recent technology evelution has turned power grids into complex networks comprised of multiple layers with strong coupling between. Security risks now arise from fragile interactions between the cyber and physical layers. Adversarial cyber attacks can exploit this fragility to cause physical harm. Since we can't stop all intrusions before they damage the infrastructure, it is critical to respond quickly to attacks underway. To facilitate a quick response grid supervisors are to be at all times aware of the state of the grid, and receive ample warning that an event is underway. Difficulties in anomaly detection lead to false alarm rates that can trigger the cry-wolf effect on grid supervisors Instead of setting unrealistic false alarm rate goals for anomaly detectors, FRONDES focuses directly on supervisor situation awareness and on mitigating the cry-wolf effect, even with moderately high rates of false alarms. FRONDES will work in conjunction with an anomaly detector and an anomaly triage engine. For each detection class, FRONDES will develop engaging supervisor workflows devised to blend response to the detection with other on-going supervisory activities. Such workflows will promote engagement, build situational awareness and enhance the supervisor's chances of successfully dealing with true malicious events.",

        "abstract": "The Next Generation Equipment Committee (NGEC) developed a standard for specifying the use of an Ethernet based digital train line (DTL) network to replace the COMM line for passenger trains. These specifications are PRIIA 305\u2010919 Digital Train Line Hardware and PRIIA 305\u2010920 Digital Train Line Software. The intent Is to eventually allow for the improvement of passenger train control. DTL specifies a need for a wireless DTL (WiDTL) network to be used as a redundancy or backup in the event an inter\u2010car jumper connection fails.\n\nConstructing a working DTL system is beneficial for developing a WiDTL specification.\n\nBecause PRIIA specifications require the use of commercially available networking equipment, equipment from three vendors will be utilized for both DTL and WiDTL systems to ensure interchangeability. This testing will be performed in a laboratory environment. Once confidence in the performance of the system is high enough, SA recommends that Phase IIB, if requested, begin with testing moved to an environment that more closely resembles an operating passenger train.  Only in this environment can certain parameters be measured, such as the extent of the reach of the wireless signal, which is important to quantify as it directly affects the security of the system.\n",

        "abstract": "Modern battlefield medicine has improved the rate of salvage of life and limb at the expense of a greater burden of hospitalizations for acute traumatic injuries and surgical care. The inflammation that accompanies the normal recovery from such tissue trauma is often clinically indistinguishable from early sepsis. This uncertainty can lead to delayed treatment with antibiotics and to substantially increased mortality rates. It can also lead to unnecessary treatment with antibiotics, with substantially increased morbidity, cost, and antimicrobial resistance. In several recent high-profile manuscripts, we published on the development and validation of three sets of biomarkers for sepsis that use gene expression profiling of the host immune response. For any patient with acute inflammation, these host-response gene sets can (1) determine whether an infection is present, (2) determine whether an infection is bacterial or viral, and (3) risk-stratify patients (predict 30-day mortality). This proposal aims to translate these biomarkers into one single point-of-care diagnostic for bacterial sepsis. To do this, we are partnering with a company whose device can rapidly quantitate multiple gene expression targets in multiplex with high accuracy at low cost. The final sepsis diagnostic will fill an unmet critical need in both defense and civilian applications.",

        "abstract": "With the introduction of Level 2 (L2) vehicle automation technologies, a core challenge facing drivers is to remain engaged in the driving task and aware of the vehicle environment despite not playing an immediate role in the low-level driving control loop. To overcome this challenge, SoarTech and its partners, UMTRI and Delphi Automotive, propose to develop DAISY, an innovative vehicle sub-system that maintains internal and external situation awareness and is able to the engage the driver in order to maintain safe L2 driving. Rather than removing the driver from the vehicle control loop, DAISY elevates the driver\u2019s involvement to a high-level, supervisory control loop. DAISY leverages two core innovations: computational situation awareness (CSA), which estimates the driver\u2019s engagement and complements the driver\u2019s awareness of the vehicle state, and smart interaction (SI), which provides a natural, multi-modal mechanism for interacting with the user to share situation awareness and engage the user in the driving task.

landmark\ndiscoveries that demonstrated Cas  protein from Streptococcus Pyogenes could be reprogrammed with\nsynthetic RNAs  sgRNAs  to generate site specific double strand breaks  DSBs  in vitro and in mammalian cells \nCRISPR technology appealed to the world of genomics and gene editing as it made the task of generating large\ngenome editing libraries possible for functional genetic screens  Although there has been a tremendous increase\nin CRISPR related publications over the last two years in many areas of drug discovery and gene function\nanalysis  it is already being recognized by the scientific community that the application of the technology to high\nthroughput functional genomics screening comes with its own unique challenges and a significant improvement\nis warranted  As research in this field focuses on improving effectiveness  increasing selectivity and reducing off \ntarget effects  companies aim to develop simplified  flexible  robust and cost effective CRISPR screening\nplatforms  incorporating all of the above with experimental and bioinformatics tools for data validation and\nintegration of this information into operational cell based models \n CRISPR technology can be used to either achieve sgRNA directed gene knockout by Cas  endonuclease\n CRISPR KO  or sgRNA directed regulation of gene expression by mutant dCas   CRISPRa for transactivation \nCRISPRi for inhibition   While published studies have provided proof that both CRISPR KO and CRISPRa i can\nbe successfully used in high throughput functional genomics screens  substantial margins of improvements do\nexist in multiple aspects of the technology  Additionally  although the CRISPR system has opened many potential\navenues for improving the drug discovery process  those remain only potential opportunities until we develop\nrobust commercially available CRISPR screening technologies  as well as experimental and bioinformatics tools\nfor data validation and integration of this information into operational cell based models  Following the successful\ncompletion of Phase I studies  in the present Phase II application we propose the final development and\ncommercialization of

However, there is currently no motorcycle-specific hazard tracking or alerting system available for riders. To address this need, Charles River Analytics executed a successful Phase I effort to design and demonstrate the feasibility of a system for Bolstering Awareness with Real-Time Rider Alerting and Cueing for Upcoming Danger Avoidance (BARRACUDA). Our Phase I prototype captures and integrates relevant information from an array of public databases and a custom crowdsourced hazard reporting capability. It then fuses this information and applies automated geolocalization and risk assessment algorithms to allow riders to plan safer routes prior to departure (via a route planning smartphone application), and be alerted to upcoming hazards while en route (via an augmented reality heads-up display combined with a proof-of-concept ecologically-grounded display symbology). In Phase II, we propose to design, develop, and evaluate a full-scope BARRACUDA system, primarily through refinement of current capabilities, development of computer vision-based hazard detection capabilities, integration of additional alerting modalities, and validation through human-use studies.

RPAS will leverage the investment and research already made by FRA in its sponsored portable ride quality meter. By extending the ride quality data acquisition framework to accept inputs from suspension displacement sensors, RPAS can correlate data from acceleration and displacement sensors with geospatial information.  The RPAS concept would allow users the flexibility of correlating a variety of data types in real-time in an effort to better validate vehicle models, and detect track and/or vehicle anomalies. No one data type can always definitively predict or identify anomalous conditions, but correlating multiple data types can achieve a greater level of confidence in the measurement results. In the future, additional sensors (i.e., strain, force, temperature, load, RPM) can similarly be integrated into RPAS for additional on-board situational awareness.\n",

        "abstract": "For high-speed ballistic intercept applications, the targeting sensor must be forward-looking in order to acquire, track, and neutralize the target. Traditional forward-looking sensors must reside near the nose of the projectile where hypersonic aerothermal loads can exceed 1000C; effectively blinding IR seekers and producing extreme thermal loads on sensor electronic components. As more advanced hypersonic railgun weapons continue to be developed, this thermal loading only stands to increase, further pushing the limits on available materials and requiring sensors to reside under a protective radome, for ablative heat shielding.    FIRST RF has developed a novel conformal, high-temperature and high-shock compatible, forward-looking, high gain antenna, suitable for use in hypersonic seeker applications. This capability fully enables dual mode IR and RF targeting for the 40 mm railgun projectile as a multi-threat kill vehicle.  The FIRST RF design uses sensors with technology demonstrated in extreme thermal and mechanical conditions.  It also implements low-cost manufacturing techniques that minimize scrap. The part count is low and the construction method is very simple and robust.  This overall solution significantly lowers cost, while also considerably reducing performance risk associated with high thermal and mechanical environmental conditions.",

        "abstract": "Ballistic missile defense (BMD) systems use carbon cloth - phenolic (CCP) resin composite materials as ablative insulators in the inlets and throats of many rocket motor nozzles. However, the reliability of hydrophilic phenolic resin composites is compromised through variations in their moisture content, which is created endogenously and added or lost according to the humidity of the storage environment. Pressure exerted within the composite by the H2O gas can cause delamination and/or pitting during heating, leading to unacceptable nozzle performance. An alternative ablative insulator, carbon-carbon composite (C/C), offers improved dimensional and environmental stability but suffers from high cost and long lead times. In Phase I, TDA prepared and characterized a hydrophobic carbon fiber composite that offers enhanced environmental stability and a very high char yield relative to CCP, yet also reduces cost and lead times relative to C/C. In Phase II, TDA and our partners will scale-up the synthesis of the resin, and prepare coupons for detailed testing, allowing the project team to optimize performance.  Tests with a 6-inch diameter rocket motor will conclusively demonstrate performance under the most realistic conditions. This work will lead to an advanced material that will assure the performance of U.S. missile assets.",

        "abstract": "The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will implement a proprietary rare earth extraction process on recycled NdFeB magnets at pilot scale to prove commercial production feasibility. By recovering rare earth elements (REEs) readily available in waste streams, this effort will help create a secondary source of these critical elements, thereby reducing U.S. dependence on an unstable, limited supply from China. This will, in turn, lay the groundwork necessary for the production of cutting-edge technologies reliant upon these materials to return to the U.S. The Nd and Dy elements which are recovered from this process are the critical components that increase the efficiency of electric motors by up to 30%. The availability of these resources will also significantly improve the vertical integration of manufacturing for national security technologies that depend heavily upon REEs, such as guided missile actuators and jet-fighter control panels. This project will also impact the electronics recycling sector by creating a new, reliable revenue stream for electronics recycling companies. The process to reclaim REEs from NdFeB magnets is simple and energy-efficient, with a minimal environmental footprint. The Phase I SBIR project demonstrated the feasibility of developing the process beyond laboratory scale to pilot scale, improved the purity of the end product and reduced the amount of waste from processing. The Phase II project will focus on the following objectives: 1) designing a scale up strategy and building a pilot scale production plant; 2) optimizing the pilot scale production process; 3) maximizing product recovery at pilot scale; 4) designing a wastewater treatment and reuse strategy; and 5) minimizing residual contamination in the final products. To achieve these Phase II objectives, we will develop process parameters for maximum yield, maximum purity, and minimum processing times at pilot scale. The first stage will be to successfully obtain production yields of 90+% and purity levels of 99+% in pilot scale batches. For the second stage, we will focus on scaling production to prove commercial-scale feasibility, with ideal product yields and purities of 95+% and 99+% respectively. Throughout all stages, we will focus on understanding and treating the accompanying waste products, including wastewater and residual metal impurities.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new alloys whose thermal expansion properties can be tailored for laser applications. The tailored thermal expansion alloys will prevent shifts in laser output frequencies, i.e. laser color, by preventing the natural temperature-induced thermal expansion and contraction that occurs in laser housings. This temperature stability is extremely important for fiber-optic systems that are the backbone of the telecommunications industry. According to Strategies Unlimited, the telecommunications laser market was $3.515 billion in 2014, and it is expected to increase with the increasing number of mobile devices and growing demand for high-speed internet. While oil and gas telecommunications systems were identified as the beachhead market, the alloys developed through this project will also have potential to add value to the wider telecommunications market and a number of other industrial and electronics applications. The intellectual merit of this project lies in a new method to exhibit unprecedented control over thermal expansion properties in metal alloys. The discovery that mechanical deformation tailors or \"programs\" the thermal expansion of a bulk metal to match that of other common materials (metals, polymers, and ceramics) will change the way scientists and engineers design for thermal compensation. These alloys can also be tailored not to expand or contract with temperature changes and even be made to shrink when heated. This wide range of tailored alloy responses is achieved without chemical changes or composite fabrication methods upon which competing technologies rely. This Phase II project will reduce the risks associated with implementing the tailored thermal expansion alloy technology in laser applications by developing high thermal conductivity alloys and testing prototypes. Alloys will be purchased, engineered to have a desired coefficient of thermal expansion, and tested for laser performance. The expected outcome of this work is the realization of tailored thermal expansion alloys in laser prototypes.",

        "abstract": "Searching for street parking, a behavior known as cruising for parking, leads to excess congestion and pollution. Many recent smart parking interventions have attempted to address this issue, but the problem of effectively detecting and measuring cruising remains largely unsolved. The goal of this work is to\ndevelop methods to detect and measure cruising for parking and its effects on congestion using dense, low cost networks of automatic vehicle identification (AVI) sensors combined with novel parking occupancy prediction. Bluetooth AVI sensors are widely used for travel time measurement on freeways and arterials,\nas most new vehicles contain Bluetooth devices that can be passively detected and tracked across multiple stationary sensors. We have extended these techniques to urban environments for vehicle route reconstruction and travel time measurement. Cruising routes are sufficiently distinct from normal travel routes, so we are developing a classifier to reliably classify vehicles as traveling or cruising. To\nstrengthen the classifier, parking occupancy prediction based on payment events from parking kiosks will be correlated with reconstructed routes. This approach continuously measures cruising for parking, allowing the evaluation of dynamic parking pricing and other smart parking interventions. Large-scale pilot tests will be deployed to evaluate this approach.\n",

Here, we intend to explore the viability of in-situ KA sensors for application on BMDS hit-to-kill interceptors. In particular, we intend to (i) continue exploration of the physical environment within interceptor structures during the very early stages of impact using first-principles physics-based codes covering the relevant engagement phase space of interest (e.g. closing speed, strike angle, target type, etc.), (ii) engineer a notional KA sensor design for homeland defense interceptors, and (iii) conduct component-level testing for promising KA sensor types to demonstrate the approach.",

ESRD impairs physiological systems and functions, and is associated with disability, high morbidity and mortality. Hemodialysis is prescribed for the majority of individuals in the final stages of renal failure. Minimizing the loss of nutrients and improving dialysis delivery (length, frequency, and location) enables individuals with ESRD to feel better, have more energy, work more, and engage in activities in their communities. Project investigators use surface chemistry and material science techniques to develop an advanced dialysate regeneration system able to remove a broad spectrum of uremic toxins while minimizing the loss of nutrients such as amino acids, vitamins, and essential ions. Technical objectives include: (1) performing scale-up production of the components of the advanced dialysate regeneration system (DRS-2); (2) designing and constructing the prototype module (cartridge) to house the DRS-2; (3) proving the safety and efficacy of the DRS-2 in vitro; (4) performing overall efficacy and quality tests of the DRS-2 using spent dialysate; and (5) evaluating and summarizing Phase II processes and results.\n",
