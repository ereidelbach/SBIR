        "abstract": "Since the first NAVSTAR GPS satellite was launched over 35 years ago, GPS has grown into one of the most important and widespread technologies used by modern military systems. These modern systems rely heavily on conventional GPS signals for position, navigation, and timing (PNT) functions and these mission-critical systems could be rendered inaccurate or inoperable if even a portion of the impinging GPS signals are lost. To combat loss of GPS signals, especially in environments where conventional GPS signals are disadvantaged by geography, the military has begun to use GPS pseudo-satellites (pseudolites) to augment the ability of military GPS receivers to reliably generate accurate location and heading solutions. During a successful Phase I, FIRST RF developed innovative antenna concepts, optimized performance, and validated simulations with hardware measurements to demonstrate tailored antenna solutions for both terrestrial and UAS platforms. In close collaboration with Army and industry partners, FIRST will refine and mature these antenna technologies during the proposed Phase II to deliver platform tailored solutions to provide unprecedented GPS augmentation services.",

Currently, follower vehicles in the convoy rely either on GPS breadcrumbs from the lead vehicle, or rely on sensing the location of its predecessor and following its path. However, GPS availability and accuracy oftentimes cause the former solution to fail, and accumulated errors in tracking and control in long convoys can cause the latter solution to fail. In Phase I, Robotic Researchs CLICS system overcame these problems by (1) fusing generic inter-vehicle sensing updates from any sensor that can provide relevant information, (2) sharing inter-vehicle sensing and navigation sensing information with the entire convoy, and (3) solving for an optimal path to follow using the shared sensor information.",

In practice, however, these gains have not been realized, largely due to the accompanying high development costs due to the need for multiple code bases to take advantage of the various chips and their variants.  The proposed project addresses these issues from both sustainability and in providing the particular computational capability needed by the defense community in the area of plasma modeling by both fluid and particle-in-cell methods.  Phase I prototyped communication with devices, developed algorithms for fluid dynamics and particle-in-cell methods, and developed flexible patterns that support multiple chip architectures at minimal cost.  Phase II will build on these results to deliver a flexible computational application able to compute across both the CPU and any number of devices, with runtime detection and automatic determination of the best algorithm, to switch automatically between fluid and particle algorithms as the collisionality changes, and to be developed by a migration path so that capability is not lost.

These cavities will rotate the hadron bunches at the interaction point to produce more effective collisions. To get the high gradients needed to meet the needs of the LHC main ring, superconducting RF has been chosen for these cavities. In collaboration with CERN and the US LHC Accelerator Research Program LARP), Niowave is currently building advanced versions of two crab cavity designs: the double quarter- wave designed at Brookhaven National Lab and the RF dipole design created at Old Dominion University. The current development plan involves installing cryomodules with crab cavities at the SPS ring at CERN for testing followed by installation into the main LHC ring. One of the main challenges in moving from the ring test in the Super Proton Synchrotron SPS) at CERN to operation in the main LHC ring is improvement of the higher-order-mode HOM) damping in the two cavity designs. Both cavities were designed with HOM impedances in mind, and the full performance can only be reached with a set of HOM couplers. HOM coupler designs have already been proposed for the two advanced cavity designs, and the cavities themselves, under construction at Niowave, include ports for HOM dampers. Further, a significant amount of progress has already been made on designs of antenna-based dampers to meet the needs of the SPS ring test. This fast track SBIR project will develop HOM couplers for the RF dipole crab cavity, which has been designed to allow waveguide dampers. The incorporation of waveguide elements can greatly increase the HOM power handling and will perform over a broad frequency range. The SBIR project will design and fabricate the first damping structures that meet the requirements for installation of crab-cavity cryomodules in the LHC main ring. This work will necessarily involve breakthrough R&amp;D on the part of Niowave and its collaborators, as crab cavities with HOM damping have never been successfully implemented in a hadron ring, much less one as demanding as the LHC.",

        "abstract": "A variety of organic and inorganic contaminants originating from municipal, agricultural, and industrial wastewater sources are being found at increasing frequency in the Nation\u2019s natural and drinking water supplies. These \u201cemerging contaminants\u201d include pharmaceuticals, antibiotics, steroids/hormones, flame retardants, perfluorinated compounds, personal care products, and herbicides/pesticides. While the concentrations of these emerging contaminants, is very low, the effects on human and aquatic health of persistent exposure to these compounds are not well understood and a source of concern. Existing technologies that remove these contaminants have high capital and operating costs, thereby limiting their use in drinking water production.\nA high-flux, fouling-resistant nanofiltration membrane that rejects these emerging contaminants while simultaneously addressing conventional drinking water treatment requirements is being developed in the proposed program. The membrane produces water at five to ten times the throughput of conventional nanofiltration membranes, facilitating operation at significantly reduced feed pressures with fewer membrane elements. The lower energy consumption and reduced capital costs enables low-emerging contaminant, nanofiltration-quality, drinking water to be produced at as little as 67% of the cost of current membrane technologies.\nThe Phase I program demonstrated the high water productivity and fouling resistance of the composite membrane structure in a subscale demonstration. The Phase II program will refine the membrane structure, scale-up membrane fabrication, produce intermediate-scale membrane elements, and demonstrate long-term membrane element operation on surface water sources.\nThe market for nanofiltration systems is currently estimated to be $0.4 billion and growing at a compound annual growth rate of 16%, primarily due to a rising demand for potable water, reduced freshwater sources, environmental restrictions on industrial and municipal wastewater discharges, and increased demand for water reuse. Although water and waste water treatment accounts for three quarters of the current nanofiltration market, nanofiltration is also being used with greater frequency in food and beverage, chemical and petrochemical, pharmaceutical and biomedical, metalworking, agriculture, textiles, and solid waste management markets.",

        "abstract": "Environmental Fuel Research, LLC (EFR-LLC), has demonstrated the technical feasibility of separating fats, oils, and greases (FOG) from grease trap waste (GTW) and converting FOG to biodiesel that can meet ASTM specifications. GTW is a dirty and low-value waste from the food service industry that is high in FOG and currently is treated as a liability. The EFR-LLC process uses a bubble column reactor with acid catalysts that simultaneously react FOG to crude biodiesel, remove by-product water, and facilitate reduction in sulfur content. With bubble column reactor technology proven, the peripheral pre- and-post conversion technologies now need adequate testing as proposed in this Phase II SBIR project. For the Phase II project, EFR-LLC proposes to partner with the Delaware County Regional Water Quality Control Authority (DELCORA) \u2013 a local wastewater treatment facility. DELCORA operates a grease receiving and grease concentration process that removes trash and partially dewaters GTW prior to incineration. Because DELCORA receives GTW from most of the regional waste grease collection companies, DELCORA is an ideal partner for process development and a potential customer for a full scale FOG-biodiesel process. The proposed pilot process at DELCORA will separate 50-100 gallons of FOG from 500 gallons of concentrated grease and convert the FOG to biodiesel. The pilot process will be used to evaluate and optimize several stages of the process including the reactor system, pretreatment and purification. Reducing the sulfur content of FOG-biodiesel is recognized by the industry as a critical limitation; Phase I results show that vacuum distillation can reduce sulfur content to meet the 15 PPM ASTM specifications; although optimizing the purification process during Phase II is critical to improving overall yields. The proposed FOG-biodiesel process has several environmental benefits including reducing the amount of GTW that is incinerated or landfilled, reducing the management intensity of waste greases, producing a valuable fuel that can substitute for petroleum-diesel, and reduced life cycle emissions of greenhouse gases and criteria pollutants. The improved environmental performance of the FOG-biodiesel process will be evaluated using operational performance of the pilot process through refinement of the life cycle assessment model developed in the Phase I. At the conclusion of the Phase II process, EFR-LLC will have a design of a full-scale GTW-FOG-biodiesel process that can be sold to potential customers in the grease collection and wastewater management businesses.",

        "abstract": "A uniquely qualified team consisting of ETSVP-JV, LLC a small business joint venture, and subcontractor RTI International, are commercializing an innovative reactive nanofiber filtration media for controlling PM2.5 and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Materials developed for the Department of Defense to protect troops from chemical and biological agents are the foundation for next generation filter media for control of Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs). For this Phase II project effort our team proposes to conduct pilot-scale demonstration and full- scale demonstration of novel dual stage reactive nanofiber filtration media that significantly enhances combined PM and HAP baghouse control capabilities over current state-of-the-art.\n\nThe reactive nanofiber filtration media is a composite comprised of: polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) felt, a nanoscale reactive coating, and a nanofiber membrane on a nonwoven support. The nanofiber membrane has a fiber size distribution controlled to below 200 nm and a unique three-dimensional structure. This unique nanofiber structure provides enhanced particle collection per air flow resistance compared to conventional and even competing nanofiber filtration media. The reactive nanoscale coating can be applied to the felt or the felt and the nanofibers. Unlike conventional approaches that have to incorporate reactive particles into a fiber matrix, the reactive coating is deposited conformally onto the fibers and uniformly throughout the entire volume of the filter media. The structure is laminated together to form a robust composite aimed at removing both PM and VOCs. In Phase I we demonstrated PM removal to emissions below 0.00004 gr/dscf and a Mullen burst strength of 633 psi. The MIT flex endurance was measured as more than 259,900 flexes in the warp direction and more than 100,700 in the fill direction. Reactive materials deposited onto the felt media reduced a concentrated gas mixture of benzene, hexane, 1,3 butadiene, and acrolein to less than a few ppm\u2019s of each VOC.\n\nFor Phase II, our project team proposes to mature the technology to demonstration of commercial-scale production. We will first mature the integrated fiber material at the bench-scale and finalize attachment of the catalyst chemistry. After successful testing at the bench-scale, we will move to developing pilot-scale sized materials. Testing at commercial-scale will complete the Phase II technical portion. Commercial-scale production will involve producing amounts of media that can be used in a large commercial baghouse unit. Once the reactive nanofiber filtration media is produced, the materials will be tested in the field at a large utility provider.",

        "abstract": "Patterns of electricity generation and consumption in the United States have rapidly changed over the past decade and are forecasted to continue doing so in coming decades. On the supply side, increasing generation from renewable sources has raised concerns about the ability of the electrical grid to stay stable given renewables\u2019 intermittent and distributed nature, and has increased calls for new low-cost demand response (DR) capacity that can be added to grid operators\u2019 arsenal of demand management tools. On the demand-side, consumption from behavior-driven miscellaneous electrical loads in commercial buildings is projected to increase dramatically, from 18% of electricity in commercial buildings in 2001 to as much as 38% in 2035. This has left facility managers and policy experts uncertain of how to keep electricity consumption and peak demand, and their associated costs, in check as occupants, rather than facility managers, increasingly hold primary influence over electricity usage and consumption patterns.\nThe project team, which includes original members of the Oberlin College P3 (People, Prosperity and the Planet) team, will begin by completing development of and testing novel, low-cost software tools that allows off-the-shelf, multi-colored, internet-connect LEDs such as the Philips Hue and the LIFX to be transformed into \u201cBuilding Orbs\u201d that can (a) reduce electricity use in commercial buildings by providing ambient color-based feedback to building occupants (b) tap the demand response potential of behavior-driven electric loads through visual messaging during demand response events and (c) engage building occupants in reducing peak electricity demand and associated utility bill costs through visual messaging by enabling behavior-based peak demand management. Built on BuildingOS - Lucid\u2019s robust cloud-based operating system for commercial building - the resulting software will allow building managers to turn LED light bulbs into Building Orbs in a matter of minutes. A proof of concept for transforming off-the-shelf internet-connected LED light bulbs into Building Orbs was established during our SBIR Phase I research, which in turn built off of work done under our Phase I and Phase II P3 awards.\nIn the second part of the project, our team will conduct a rigorous field study and pilot of Building Orbs in approximately 75 to 150 buildings to allow us to analyze their effectiveness. Culling pilot buildings from Lucid customers will allow us to save significant costs and time.\nUpon completion of the project, Building Orbs will be immediately available to commercial buildings that purchase a subscription to BuildingOS.",

        "abstract": "Every year, a significant amount of money is lost due to atmospheric attack of steel parts. A convenient and effective way for corrosion protection is coating the unalloyed steel with a thin layer of zinc (Zn) metal by galvanizing.\n\nPickling is an essential step of this process to ensure high quality surface of steel for further processing. In this process, acid is used to remove scale from the surface containing oxides. When the acid concentration in the pickling solution decreases by 75-85% (by weight), the bath is dumped because the efficiency of pickling decreases with increasing content of dissolved metal. This dumping has a grave environmental impact such as high concentration of metals and acids in wastewater, and there is a genuine need to develop zinc coatings with an environmentally-friendly process that can replace the galvanizing pickling lines and the alkaline or acidic degreasing step prior to pickling.\n\nAdditionally, this technology reduces the formation of zinc fumes which evolve from maintenance of a molten zinc bath as well as eliminating the formation of dross, waste iron-zinc alloy that is formed in the sheet galvanizing process. MesoCoat proposes developing zinc coatings having excellent corrosion resistance using their R&D100 award-winning CermaClad\u2122 process, which uses a high-density infrared lamp to fuse a uniform layer of metal onto metal surfaces.\n\nThe innovation marries breakthrough nanocomposite materials technology with breakthrough low impact, cost- effective, high-rate light fusion application technology. The high power density and large area nature of the fusion system enables these claddings to be applied at high rates. Furthermore, metal cladding eliminates the use and disposal of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). Extending the life of steel parts through these advanced coatings by CermaCladTM will cut back on the need for new steel production to replace those products hence reducing associated carbon emissions.\n\nMain tasks involved are design and construction of a continuous foil and sheet coating rig, development of coating parameters, metallurgical characterization, performance evaluation and reporting. Successful application of these coatings can be applicable for corrosion protection of steel parts such as rebar, bridge decks, shipping, shipbuilding, hydroelectric, power generation, refineries, pipelines, railroads, grid transmission towers, oil/gas production and architecture.",

        "abstract": "Precision Combustion, Inc. (PCI) is developing a regenerable high efficiency filter technology for direct removal of gaseous pollutants such as VOCs and CO2 from indoor air. In addition to controllably improving indoor air quality (IAQ), the direct removal of these pollutants will reduce the requirement for building ventilation with outdoor make-up air currently used to dilute the concentration of indoor contaminants. This will enable significant energy cost savings and reduce global warming load as significantly less temperature and humidity-controlled outdoor make-up air will be required.\nThis innovative air filter technology combines PCI\u2019s novel Microlith\u00ae support elements with sorbent nanomaterials that can be tailored to capture and later desorb a variety of targeted gaseous pollutants. Adapting and improving upon space station cabin atmosphere revitalization technology, Microlith\u00ae adsorbers are smaller, lighter and use less power than existing technologies such as pellets and monoliths. The technology also offers the benefits of low pressure drop, rapid in-situ regeneration, high filter media utilization, longer filter service life, design modularity, and sorbent media flexibility. These features support a system offering reliably high indoor air quality at a lower lifecycle cost than is achieved with disposable filter-based systems, and in a form factor suitable for plug and play installation within building HVAC systems.\nIn Phase I, a bench-scale, proof-of-concept air filter media was developed and examined, and operating conditions were identified and optimized. We demonstrate the ability to effectively remove a wide spectrum of gaseous pollutants and chemical contaminants, including typical indoor VOCs and CO2. The filter was thermally stable and maintained >90% adsorption activity following exposures to contaminants in ambient air for repeated adsorption-desorption cycles. Regeneration can use a direct resistive approach, resulting in a quick and low power regeneration. Low pressure drop across the filter was demonstrated. During Phase II, PCI will further develop and advance the air filter technology targeting specific building applications and developing appropriate system prototypes for field demonstration. This includes air filter scale-up design, sizing, and manufacturing per targeted building requirements. In completing Phase II, PCI will produce multiple air filter system prototypes for evaluation at independent facilities or customer sites. Target early entry markets include buildings and facilities where air quality is a concern, filter replacements create a maintenance burden, and large volumes of makeup-air results in energy inefficiency. The approach offers a cost-saving route to improve indoor air quality in industrial and commercial buildings, and potentially in homes.",

        "abstract": "The overall goal of this Project is to develop an innovative inexpensive optical technology and rugged and portable instrumentation for highly sensitive, selective, continuous measurement of atmospheric ammonia for air pollution monitoring. Environmental studies have proven that ammonia presents a significant environmental hazard; therefore, accurate monitoring and control of NH3 concentration is required in order to maintain appropriate air quality levels. Atmospheric ammonia contributes directly and indirectly to acidification, eutrophication, human health and climate change. For air pollution monitoring, the ammonia concentration level of interest is in the parts-per-billion (ppb) range.  This application also demands portability, low power draw, and continuous monitoring capability since long term measurements in remote locations are often needed.\n\nThe Phase I research has demonstrated ammonia measurement precision and detection limit of 1 ppb with signal averaging of 12 s, fast response time (10\u201330 s) to small step changes in ammonia mole fraction over a wide range of ammonia concentration levels, and high selectivity of ammonia detection. Long-term measurements provide evidence that the method is characterized by high long- term stability (about 1 ppb at low-ppb ammonia levels), which will result in reduced calibration requirements for the Phase II prototype and commercial instrument. Ammonia measurement dynamic range exceeding 5 orders of magnitude has been demonstrated. The Phase II prototype system design is outlined. Incorporation of compact, custom designed analog and digital electronics will make the instrument portable, rugged and easy to operate. The instrument will be capable of remote data logging. Estimated power draw of < 25 W including the long range wireless modem) will allow operating the sensor with a moderately sized solar power supply.\n\nThe Phase I research has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed ammonia measurement technology. In Phase II, a compact self-contained prototype instrument will be built, calibrated and extensively field-tested both in-house and at selected facilities. The obtained results provide a solid basis for development, construction, and field testing of the prototype ammonia sensor in Phase II.  Successful demonstration of this technology in Phase II will provide the foundation needed to proceed with Phase III commercialization. Potential applications include environmental monitoring, emission control and breath analysis as a medical diagnostic tool.",

        "abstract": "The United States produces significant quantities of waste materials that are discarded. These wastes include organic components of municipal solid waste (MSW), biosolids from wastewater treatment plants and agricultural wastes. The release of these materials and their byproducts into the environment can have serious consequences, such as pollution of ground and surface water resources and spread of disease. Current technologies to covert waste materials into fuels are typically limited by poor conversion efficiencies, the requirement for significant inputs and controls to sustain the conversion process, and the low cost of the produced fuel (e.g. biogas). Consequently, implementation and maintenance of these systems often require significant monetary subsidies.\n\nSustainable Bioproducts (SB) has developed a breakthrough low-cost, simple, and scalable microbial process for conversion of waste feedstocks such as organic MSW to high-value oils, which may be sold for production of biodiesel, biolubricants, or other industrial (e.g. paints) and consumer products (e.g. soaps). Our process is based on a novel fungal strain obtained from Yellowstone National Park that is capable of converting waste feedstocks to oils at significantly higher yields and rates compared to other studied microorganisms. Importantly, the oil is relatively easy to extract compared to other oil-producing organisms.\n\nPhase I work concentrated on optimizing our process for MSW and results showed better than expected conversion yields of 60 gallons oil per metric tonne feedstock. Current market trends indicate that SB oils sold for biodiesel will be profitable using the three-year average price. SB oil will generate approximately\n$2.15 in net profit/gallon with available tax subsidies. SB is planning to develop high-oleic acid oils, which have a market value of up to $10 per gallon and are in high demand for industrial applications such as biolubricants, metalworking, and hydraulic fluids. Techno-economic analysis shows that Sustainable Bioproducts will generate at least $3.30 in net profit per gallon for these high-oleic oils. Furthermore, our process will decrease greenhouse gas emissions and the environmental pollution associated with the use of petroleum based products. The goal of our proposed Phase II work is to advance our oil conversion process utilizing MSW to larger-scale pilot systems. The specific objectives will be to: (1) scale-up our process with MSW to 100 liter bioreactors, (2) optimize harvesting and oil extraction methods, (3) determine oil properties using ASTM methods (e.g. viscosity), and (4) generate engineering process flow models with detailed techno-economic analysis for commercial systems.",

The Stationary Wide-Angle Concentrator (SWAC) PV system will provides the missing link that is required for wide-scale adoption of concentrator systems. It achieves high solar concentration (500x) over a wide range of incident angles in a flat stationary panel that needs no mechanical tracking or control system.\nThe design, enabled by microscale manufacturing, uses a novel self-tracking optical system in which a thermally-reactive fluidic system automatically and internally adjusts the concentrator to maintain peak concentration without mechanical movement of the module. No additional control electronics or system maintenance is required. Such self-tracking concentrators can significantly increase the power output of solar power modules by allowing them to use high-efficiency photovoltaic cells and concentrating optics without incurring the additional costs of precision trackers and specialized mounting hardware. The concentrator itself is designed to be extremely low-cost due to low material usage, wide manufacturing tolerances, and compatibility with high-speed manufacturing. This design can potentially disrupt the PV industry by allowing high efficiency concentrator panels to outperform conventional silicon in environments with high direct solar resource.",

Titanium has a much higher strength-to-weight ratio and greater intrinsic flexibility than steel, reducing the load imposed on other portions of the arresting gear system. Leveraging advancements in titanium alloy development, coatings, and lubrication, we demonstrated in Phase I using scaled cable prototypes that Erigos titanium design should exceed the Navys requirements at a 64% the weight of the current steel purchase cable. The increased cost of titanium is expected to be offset by the extended service life that reduces (1) the downtime required for cable replacement, (2) manning requirements, (3) shipboard storage of purchase cables, and (4) supply chain costs. In the Base Phase of Phase II, Erigo will fabricate larger diameter titanium cables than in Phase I.

        "abstract": "To address the Army need for a semi-active laser missile tracker that can lock onto a coded illuminator signal and ignore background noise such as sunlight, Luminit, LLC, proposes to continue development on the Compound Eye Laser Missile Seeker (CELMS). The CELMS is a compound eye device, based on the eye of a bee, with a number of independent lenses in a square array. Each individual lens is coupled to a light guide; each quadrant of the missiles field of regard relays the light from its quadrant to one substrate guided wave-based hologram (SGWH). Luminits proprietary SGWH filters the light in a fashion that removes the background and passes the signal which, in turn, is converted to a voltage by a photodetector and custom electronics. This voltage is further processed into guidance signals for the missile. In Phase I, Luminit designed the CELMS and fabricated a proof-of-concept prototype that demonstrated tracking a week laser signal in the presence of strong sunlight. In Phase II, we plan to develop the CELMS into a complete engineering prototype that will be the basis of a production version of CELMS to be finalized during Phase III.",

Two broad classes of irradiators account  for  essentially  all  the  radioactive  material  of  concern  \u2013  blood  irradiators  and  research irradiators.  Stellarray has other work under way for the development of blood irradiators using novel flat panel  x-ray  sources.   While there are a number  of research  applications  in which  alternative irradiators, based on 60Co sources or x-ray tubes, are being used, there remains a persistent preference for cesium-based systems.   Two of the main research applications in which cesium systems are used are whole body small animal irradiation for cancer and pharmaceuticals  research and cell and other type of sample irradiation for a very broad range of biomedical research needs.  These users require systems which are compact, affordable and reliable.  In some cases, a high dose rate is required.   In others, a precise and uniform dose distribution is essential.  Irradiators using point source x-ray tubes have been unable to address many of these needs.  Both the technical and product configuration requirements are therefore more challenging than is the case with blood irradiators. Stellarray proposes the development and deployment of three versions of a modular, addressable research irradiator MARI) based on the company\u2019s previous development of flat panel x- ray  sources  FPXS),  including  a  digitally  addressable  x-ray  source  DAXS). FPXS panels are designed for highly uniform flux emission  across a broad surface and sustained  operation  at high power levels.  The design of all three systems will be modular, in that sources incorporating their own high voltage power supply and insulating oil can be plugged into the irradiator. The first version will be a bench-top system incorporating pairs of FPXS, with each able to deliver dose rates of 25 Gy/min at 160 kVp, for fast, uniform irradiation of small animals and other larger subjects. The second will be a larger, more highly-shielded orthovoltage system capable of delivering x-ray energies up to 350 kV, for further increases in depth dose uniformity and approximation of isotope energies.  The third will be a small, digital version in which x-ray pixels can be addressed to emit x-ray flux to precise spots on the micro-titer plates e.g. 96-well plate) commonly used in biomedical research.\n\nMARI can become a substantial business since it has been designed with user needs clearly in mind. The first two versions will be an efficient, convenient choice for the irradiation of small animals and large samples, while the digital version should be very popular since it will enable irradiation research to use the vast infrastructure for micro-titer laboratory automation.   MARI will be priced attractively for a reasonable cost of ownership.   The use of the right source will also make MARI systems highly reliable, so they can displace isotope irradiators.\n\"\n",

This is all done utilizing a single machine and therefore the eventual manufacturing of the bridges will provide an approach that reduces human touch.

        "abstract": "Environmental awareness has become an increasingly important issue for military training facilities. Given the nature of military training activities, it is crucial for training facility managers to understand the relationships among repeated contaminant release, contaminant migration, and available mitigation techniques. Current technologies used to assess the impact of contaminants do not consider contaminant migration characteristics, such as infiltration and surface runoff, as information sources to determine the correct timing of remediation techniques. They also do not assess the tradeoffs associated with contaminant release over time and cost. By understanding these factors and relationships, facility managers will be better able to minimize environmental damage at training facilities, collaborate more effectively with the facilitys Environmental Control Office (ECO) or other relevant organizations, and understand the consequences of prolonged mitigation, such as rising mitigation costs and equipment use constraints in certain training areas. Based on a successful Phase I feasibility demonstration, we propose to develop and evaluate a system for Contamination and Lasting Effects Analysis for Negative Substances and Elements (CLEANSE). CLEANSE provides workflows that address facility managers tasks and decision making, supports reasoning about environmental effects by providing straightforward access to expert knowledge and model results, and supports reasoning about mitigation strategies.",

These tools do not typically offer the desired chemical information on molecular timescales. Molecular Vista, Inc. (MVI) will develop a tip-enhanced ultrafast time-resolved optical spectral imaging microscope, which extends the performance of the current state-of-the-art TERS (tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy) capability from imaging only molecules with high Raman cross-sections to a larger array of molecules with much smaller Raman cross-sections. The goal is to develop a user-friendly hybrid AFM that provides both ultrafast time-resolved chemical information and topography with molecular-level spatial resolution to aid basic science in diverse fields. The proposed instrument will be based on heterodyne detection of stimulated tip-enhanced Raman scattering (HS-TERS). In Phase I portion of the Fast Track, MVI will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technique with continuous wave (CW) lasers. In year 1 of Phase II, the technique will be demonstrated with picosecond lasers at University of California, Irvine (our Research Institution collaborator) while HS-TERS based on CW lasers is commercialized by Molecular Vista. In year 2 of Phase II, time-resolved femtosecond HS-TERS will be demonstrated at UC Irvine and commercialized at MVI. The rapid pace of commercial development is due to the synergy the proposed HS-TERS instrument shares with the company\u2019s existing products. The instruments unique capability will allow it to be effectively marketed to niche research market (ultrafast spectroscopy, single molecule spectroscopy, etc.) creating a quick revenue stream for the company. Additionally, the enhanced signal-to-noise will allow the tool to be robust and fast enough for industrial metrology applications that were heretofore impractical to address. Key Words: tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, hybrid optical atomic force microscope, time-resolved nanoscopy Summary for Members of Congress: Researchers in diverse scientific fields are in need of a microscope that can resolve single chemical events in real space and time. Molecular Vista, Inc. plans to develop a new tool that allows scientists to visualize molecular events with unprecedented time and spatial resolution.\"",

Likewise, high-performance computing (HPC) and data centers are increasingly implementing optical fiber as the preferred interconnect media. Fiber to the premises (FTTP) dramatically increases the connection speeds available to computer users compared with copper interconnect technology, but implementing FTTP on a large scale is costly because it requires installation of new optical-fiber cables over the \"\"last links\"\" from existing optical fiber cables to individual user premises. There is a need for revolutionary fiber termination and splice technology to reduce cost and simplify field installation for massive deployment of optical network and computer interconnect infrastructure.\nnanoPrecision Products Inc. (nPP) uses a metallic clamshell ferrule design with stamped features manufactured to sub-micron tolerances with nPP\u2019s unique manufacturing technology. These features provide retention of the cable jacket and strength member, precise alignment of the fiber cores and eliminate the need for epoxy. Fiber laser welding is used to fasten the two ferrule halves after placement of the fiber. The metal ferrule and elimination of epoxy now permits the development of novel techniques (e.g. laser polishing) to eliminate end face surface defects and increase the durability and repeatability of interconnects. The stamped clamshell ferrule approach will provide a very low-loss mechanical splice for single-fiber and multi-fiber cables, with a simplified means of cable restoration and retention.\nDuring Phase I, nPP will (1) experimentally test innovative methods to polish fibers and set fiber protrusion in metallic ferrules and (2) design a stampable splice connector using nPP\u2019s clamshell approach. During Phase II, nPP will (3) develop a low-cost factory process to terminate single-fiber and multi-fiber metallic ferrules, (4) test and evaluate cables produced with innovative factory termination processes, (5) demonstrate stamped metallic splice components for single-fiber and multi-fiber cabling, (6) develop field-installable process to join the two halves of stamped metallic splice connector, and (7) test and evaluate fiber-optic cables joined with new splice. The factory termination processes developed in this program will provide extremely low loss field fiber termination and splices and show that optical fiber can be as easy to use as copper wire.\nKey Words: precision manufacturing, mechanical optical fiber splice, diode laser welding, laser end face polishing, field installation\nCongressional Summary\nMassive deployment of a national fiber optic infrastructure requires a domestic manufacturing capability for fiber optic termini and novel fiber optic field installation technologies and related tools for the field installation technician. nPP will domestically manufacture fiber termination ferrules and will investigate innovative laser and materials based solutions to enable field technicians to be trained to install optical fiber as easily as the installation of copper wire.\"\n",

        "abstract": "The Aircraft Carrier Tactical Support Center (CV-TSC) performs acoustic detection and feature extraction on passive sonobuoy sensors. Algorithms are needed to associate multiple frequency components originating from a contact, exploit signature content to improve associations across sensors and over time, and enable fusion of the characterized sonar tracks across the sonobuoy field or with radar or other non-acoustic sources. Recently, the submarine Advanced Processor Build (APB) program developed Single Sensor Association (SSA) functionality that combines all detection sources on a sensor into a single bearing-plus-frequency attribute report. Composite detections were then provided to a Multi-Sensor Association (MSA) algorithm to identify associations across sensors. SSA and MSA were independently tested and transitioned into the APB-11 baseline. Venator Solutions proposes to extend the SSA and MSA functionality to CV-TSC sonobuoys, adapting to the unique characteristics of the sonobuoy sensor. We propose extensions to the acoustic characterization to enable (a) improved SSA associations, (b) joint exploitation of acoustic association and kinematic likelihoods to improve field level fusion, and (c) evidential reasoning on acoustic and kinematic states to infer contact mode, gross behavior, and eventually contact classification. We cast the fusion process as a Probabilistic Graphical Model to motivate PGM-based evidential reasoning.",

        "abstract": "For complex systems such as high-powered multi-function phased array radars, immediate maintenance (i.e., failed elements are detected, localized, and replaced immediately) is rarely adopted because the single item failure rate is relatively high (daily in certain very large arrays) and frequent maintenance degrades radar system availability. The current practice is cyclic or delayed maintenance which results in decreased operational availability. Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), which provides an estimate of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a component, and system as a whole, offers the potential to improve system availability while reducing maintenance cost. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a Reliability Analysis-enhanced Prediction System (RAPS) for phased array radar health management. In this project we intend to conduct systematic component and system level prognostics to predict future operational impact. Also, currently reliability information is not incorporated in maintenance procedure. We plan to enhance and develop algorithms to provide the estimates for remaining useful life at the both component level and system level with confidence bounds.",

Defects in crystalline diamond have demonstrated excellent single photon properties with g^(2)(0) < 0.02. Our diamond nano-crystal will produce single photons in the near-visible transparency windows. By coupling a single nano-crystal to an optical micro-cavity in the strong-Purcell regime, the linewidth of the single-photon emission can be narrowed to 1 GHz with emission jitter of ~ 100 ps, enabling unconditionally secure, free-space quantum communication. In the Phase I program, PSI demonstrated a cavity-emitter design that is capable of producing high-data rate, narrow-emission linewidth single photons, and characterized the emitters that will be used in the system. In the Phase II program, PSI will develop a prototype on-demand single photon source capable of transmitting data at > 1e6 bits per second that will enable rapid, secure key generation for free-space quantum key distribution.; BENEFIT: Quantum communication promises an unconditionally secure method for information transfer. True single photon sources are necessary to assure security and can operate more than 10x faster than attenuated laser pulses. Military, financial, medical and other institutions with sensitive data will benefit from practical improvements to quantum communications links. PSI envisions ending Phase II with a production-ready SPS prototype and envisions producing complete SPS units to sell independently and as partner products to our atomic line filters (ALFs). The micro-cavity and rapid polarization rotator technologies that will be advanced as part of this effort will also benefit sensing and classical communication application areas.",

In Phase II, the propellant formulation will be optimized beginning with small scale tests measuring burning rates, safety, mechanical properties, and aging performance. The optimized propellant will be scaled up and tested in analog rocket motors to provide performance characterization under realistic operating conditions.

        "abstract": "NAVAIR PMAs are motivated by substantial maintenance cost savings to switch aircraft paints from matte to glossy. Yet NAVAIR must confidently weigh these major cost savings against possibly serious survivability penalties from sun glints. To definitively answer these survivability trades, we propose our GLint Assessment with SPIRITS (GLASS) Toolset. Our Phase 1 lab-validated findings indicate a SPIRITS-only modeling approach as sufficient for matte and semi-gloss paints, whereas glossy paints require our hybrid approach using SPIRITS+Zemax. Consequently, NAVAIR retains its investment in SPIRITS, and our hybrid approach avoids signature model development by exploiting the complementary strengths of widely-used SPIRITS and Zemax. Our Phase 2 Base effort will first implement and further validate our GLASS Toolset framework. We will assimilate additional CH-53K candidate paints, using the measurement and model-fitting procedures we validated in Phase 1. We will lab-validate 3D object sun glint and combined specular|diffuse solar signature predictions employing a CAD-machined pole target surrogate. Finally we will apply our built-out GLASS Toolset to quantify candidate paint detectability trades for the CH-53K, using its high-fidelity CAD geometry representation. Our Phase 2 Option effort will package, deliver, and train NAVAIR on our GLASS Toolset to enable them to confirm and extend our findings.",

We propose a novel simulation survey technique based on forward ray tracing which will greatly increase the possible space of vehicle, sun and observer positions for this trade study. Forward ray traces essentially calculate the signature in all view directions simultaneously in an extremely fast and efficient manner. Forward ray traces are also superior to other imaging techniques at identifying strong specular glints. We will employ a modern signature code with highly accurate glint modeling, a forward ray trace capability, and standard visual detection algorithms such as VIDEM in order to quantify the effect of paint gloss on aircraft detectability through simulational studies. We will also determine the best paint schemes to mitigate visible sun glints. We will employ validated BRDF fits and DHR tables for several paints of interest and CAD models of CH-53 and possibly other aircraft. A secondary goal is to improve BRDF fitting routines for the Pleskot (16 Parameter) BRDF model, which shows promise for producing superior fits while enforcing rigorous energy conservation.",

In Phase II a prototype radar will be built and tested which meets the performance specifications and the limited SWaP profile. At ARTEMIS we will make use of our decades of experience in radar design and manufacture in building a rugged, pod-mount radar system which can be used on the Shadow 200 and similar aircraft. At Ka-band, the radar will have four channels and make use of space-time adaptive processing (STAP) for GMTI detection of moving targets, particularly dismounts. Also, very high resolution Ka-band SAR imagery will be available for target detection and identification, as well as coherent change detection. At L-band, a very different view of the world is provided with the advantages of a long-wavelength sensor with a wide swath and fully polarimetric capabilities.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Unwanted RFI is a growing concern due to the ever expanding RF world around us. Not only are the number of RFI sources increasing, so too is the frequency usage across the RF spectrum. As a result, RF systems, like the AFSCN, are expected to become more susceptible to disruptions in coverage and service. Additionally, these systems must maintain a small RF footprint and not contribute to the problem either.  Two approaches are proposed to rectify the situation. The first solution employs an RF absorber to minimize AFSCN antenna sidelobe levels, and hence, block unwanted stray signals. The second solution utilizes a feed having agile, variable beamwidth to improve satellite search time and link, with minimal RFI on transmission and reception. Both solutions are retrofits to the existing AFSCN antenna, and as such, are cost effective.  The proposed program uses detailed theoretical RF models to define the properties, shape, and location of the RF absorber, as well as the illumination characteristics required of the feed for variable AFSCN antenna beamwidth. Novel low profile, structural, absorber and agile, reconfigurable RF surface technologies, will be designed, fabricated and tested to demonstrate their performance and feasibility as applied to the AFSCN antenna.  BENEFIT:RF absorber technologies are important, cost effective enablers well beyond just reflector antenna RFI mitigation. In fact, RF absorber technologies are currently employed by a wide assortment of applications and platforms. Unfortunately, their applicability is often limited by their extreme thickness and lack of structural integrity. Thus, the development of an absorber that is conformal, low profile, structural, and lightweight, is especially attractive in many instances. The frequency selective nature of this technology is quite suitable for highly populated and diverse RF environments because performance can be specially tailored to accommodate requirements. Of course the ability to customize their performance in a retrofit-able package presents an affordable option to costly RF system upgrades.     Reconfigurable surfaces can also support applications beyond just reflector feed augmentation. In fact they can be used to retrofit a variety of antennas already in existence. As such, the technology can provide very affordable alternatives to replacing entire antenna systems. Their reconfigurable nature not only offers variable beamforming capability, but also wider operational RF bandwidths. Additionally, because reconfigurable surfaces are essentially filters, they can be employed as EMI shields. Additionally, reconfigurable surfaces are not only limited to solving EMI issues. In particular they can be used to improve the radar signature of an RF system as well. Generally, where past solutions have been static, as is the case with traditional FSS approaches, reconfigurable RF surfaces provide a dynamically adaptable solution that can accommodate a wide range of RF requirements with improved RF performance.",

While existing part-task training (PTT) is sufficient when practicing simple procedural tasks (for example, deploying a sonobuoy), P-8A missions rely on communication among onboard crew and coordination with other platforms (such as organizing ASW with nearby submarines and ships). Crew interaction and coordination training is a significant deficiency within the current PTT system.SoarTech has designed and constructed a proof-of-concept capability that augments the P-8A PTT with intelligent, speech-activated role player agents.

        "abstract": "In this Phase II SBIR program, QuesTek Innovations, a leader in the field of integrated computational materials engineering (ICME), proposes to design and develop new aluminum alloys tailored for the unique processing conditions and challenges of Additive Manufacturing (AM) processing. QuesTek is uniquely suited to rapidly designing new aluminum alloys specifically optimized for AM processing using its advanced Materials by Design stage-gate alloy development process, which is based upon computationally-implemented mechanistic models to predict process-structure and structure-property relationships. QuesTek is partnering with Bell Helicopter to define material property objectives and processing constraints for helicopter drive system gear box components, and Stratasys Direct Manufacturing (SDM, formerly Harvest Technologies, and a leader in DMLS technologies). QuesTeks partnership provides a close partnership between material designer (QuesTek), AM manufacturer (SDM) and OEM user (Bell). During the Phase I, QuesTek designed a series of new alloys using computational models to target critical design parameters, and fabricated a down-selected concept into powder for DMLS experimentation and coupon-scale evaluation. QuesTeks new alloy demonstrated feasibility of optimizing a new chemistry for AM processing. In Phase II, detailed alloy designs will be executed to yield an alloy that satisfies the total design criteria, and scale evaluation to component-level demonstration.",

        "abstract": "The Navy has made significant investment in the design, development, and deployment of net-centric information systems that provide critical support to fleet operations. Unfortunately, adverse operational conditions affect the availability and performance of distributed information systems. Since their current systems situation awareness is inadequate, system operators, administrators, and managers cannot adapt to current and predicted conditions to maximize mission readiness and minimize downtime. These users require real-time alerting systems that provide tripwires that identify operator behaviors, emergent conditions, or reduction in available resources that influence the effectiveness of operations. Having successfully demonstrated the feasibility under a Phase I SBIR effort, Charles River Analytics is pleased to propose a Phase II effort to develop and evaluate a Distributed Analysis Tool for Enterprise Monitoring (DATEM). DATEM is a distributed monitoring and alerting system that sets tripwires to detect deviations in operator and system behaviors that are important to mission success. DATEM uses non-invasive monitoring tools to gather, extract, aggregate, summarize, and reason about this system data in the context of the current mission. DATEM uses probabilistic models to deal with uncertain, missing, and erroneous data in tripwires that alert operators, administrator, managers, and commanders of system conditions that may threaten mission readiness.",

Such cyber elements comprise an important part of the DoDs military readiness and the loss or degradation of such elements would reduce key advantages in communication, intelligence, and organization. Despite heavy investments in security and cyber defense, the sheer ubiquity and interconnectedness of DoD equipment leave open the possibility of intrusion through a myriad of means including advanced persistent threats (APTs). Such threats take many forms, including Trojans, back-doors in embedded systems, worms, spear-phishing, and viruses, all of which could prove detrimental to the war fighter if not discovered. As part of our work we have demonstrated several novel ideas for detecting APTs based upon modern ideas in space-time signal processing, multiple hypothesis testing, and robust principal component analysis. In particular, previous results by Numerica have proven especially pertinent to APT detection since these algorithms have been demonstrated to scale to millions of data streams, can fuse data from a variety of input types, and have quite advantageous sparsity properties for visualization and analytics.",

Current state of the art acceleration compensated oscillators are 100-350 cubic centimeters (cc), use 3 W of power and achieve a worst case acceleration sensitivity of 0.02 parts per billion per G (ppb/G). The LPG-OCXO will target a 17 cc size, 0.15 W power and 0.02-0.001 ppb/G acceleration sensitivity. This level of acceleration insensitivity will make it insensitive to the effects of vibration in almost all aircrafts and ground vehicles. Its dramatic size and power reduction will be enabled by three technologies: (i) a micromachined vibration isolators system; (ii) careful selection of electronic components including the accelerometer required for low frequency vibration compensation and (iii) a low power ovenized crystal technology. The acceleration insensitivity target will be achieved through optimization of the vibration isolator design and the acceleration compensation electronics.",

By augmenting ground-penetrating radar (GPR) with SIMSS, metal and low metal mine detection, command wire, pressure plate detection, and explosive cache detection will be significantly improved. The novel approach attains high performance and low cost by co-designing and integrating the high efficiency RF current source with a high-power transmit (Tx) loop, including a differential receiver (Rx) loop and circuit, and optimizing back-end signal generation and processing. This scalable approach accommodates a range of loop sizes, can be incorporated into a larger array, and is realizable as a dismount system. Increased standoff while minimizing electric field and resulting propagating wave allows for more sensitive human-safe detection applications as well as data disruption systems including camera capture denial and memory device erasing.

Predicting the exact fatigue life is a difficult process and fatigue life prediction based on crack length measurements can be grossly inaccurate mainly because the appearance of these cracks typically occurs very late in fatigue life. Thus, to improve remaining useful life prediction of structural components the study of microfeatures called damage precursors is critical. During Phase I program Luna has demonstrated the feasibility of a portable system for nonlinear measurements on aircraft components and for prediction of the remaining useful life. The inspection system is capable of classifying fatigue life of aluminum components for Army maintainers with 95% confidence intervals in steps of 10% of remaining useful life. The primary objective of the Phase II program is to develop an effective and efficient system to provide accurate and reliable information for the remaining useful life metallic aircraft components found in propulsion systems. Phase II effort will include prototyping the fatigue inspection system to maximize performance and capability, while focusing on minimizing cost, weight, size and meet the portability goal.",

Technicians spend thousands of hours finding and recovering fragments, measuring position in three dimensions, then cleaning and weighing each one. Inspecting a single bundle can take 30 hours, at $100/hour. Post-test data collection can exceed $500,000. Using old, undersized on hand equipment during Phase I, ZKxKZ and teammate Leidos demonstrated quantitative 3-D X-ray technology can automate location and characterization of fragments buried in blocks of Celotex. In Phase II, with modern hardware and software optimized for this application, a new system will be constructed that reduces bundle inspection time by 60X, while generating reports on fragment dimension, 3-D location, mass, and material in real time. Because the X-ray system finds all fragments, while current manual methods often miss the smallest, the SBIR system produces more accurate results, about 60 times faster, at a fraction of the cost. Phase II will complete full-scale development of all hardware and software needed for the Phase III commercial system, culminating by inspecting post-test fiberboard bundles provided by the Army. ROI on the final hardware/software system is expected in 10 or fewer arena tests.",

This OORDWG is considered wideband because it will have the ability to generate PNT signals in the existing GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and Beidou (Compass) bands, plus nearly anything in between.  We have leveraged the most current technologies in signal combining methods, adding innovative enhancements that show potential to either reduce the SWaP of the entire GPS payload or increase the performance of the satellite constellation for the end user.  The OORDWG will be able to be reprogrammed on-orbit and will support cryptography external to the waveform generator, but for expandabilitys sake, it will also be able to support cryptography within the reprogrammable boundary.    The Wideband PNT ORDWG has several unique features that bring together the latest software-defined radio technology and high performance radiation-hardened electronics.    BENEFIT:  PNT is a technology that will never disappear.  For the foreseeable future, all PNT technologies are based off of GPS technology with only minor modifications at most.  This implies that the OORDWG will be at the core of PNT satellites for a very long time.  Additionally, due to the power of the architecture, assuming that all performance metrics are equivalent or better, the OORDWG technology will supplant all traditional waveform generators.  The core technology of the OORDWG can also be implemented in a non-rad-hard platform and be used as a ground-based PNT simulator for any waveform.    Additional applications include more general-purpose signal generation for spacecraft including being employed as a functional block within an RF exciter.

MOST was developed to provide secure integration of commercial MDs into DoD business systems satisfying Information Assurance (IA) requirements. MOST is based on POC-developed, proven technology for protection of information in transit and at rest on commercial MDs (such as smartphones and tablet PCs) and removable storage media. In Phase I, POC conclusively demonstrated the feasibility of the MOST through requirements analysis, security mechanism/software and prototype development, and testing. POC demonstrated the MOST prototype systems capability to provide secure integration of iOS- and Android-based MDs into AFW-WEBS products and services utilizing Common Access Card (CAC) authentication. With further development in Phase II, a technology readiness level (TRL)-6 prototype capable of securely accessing AFW-WEBs services over the NIPRNet environment and executing the AFW-WEBs mobile app on commercial MDs will be developed and demonstrated.  BENEFIT:  Military applications of MOST will include missions that require accessing data residing on mobile devices and missions when a connection to the network is not always available. POCs MOST technology can be incorporated by the Air Force into mobile handheld devices as an efficient means to access DoD systems and Web services. The potential commercial applications of MOST include protecting information systems and sensitive data, sealing borders, and securing airlines, all of which will benefit first responders, law enforcement agencies, scientific and government agencies, and the general public. Commercial applications of MOST will also include public transportation, loyalty card programs, gaming, and toll road payment.

This paradigm suffers from certain drawbacks that, until recently, have been without resolve. First, the central update server paradigm requires redundant network communications as each machine negotiates its own connection to the server and downloads the updates individually.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: This woman-owned, disadvantaged, and HubZone-certified small business is proposes OPTIMUS (Optimized Planning Through Iterative Mission Updates and Synthesis), a standalone system that addresses specific problems faced by Air Force Planners and Force Providers with regard to OPLAN Maintenance and Consequence Management: (1) OPTIMUS simplifies the force selection process by eliminating the need to cross-reference multiple force readiness systems when finding forces to satisfy OPLAN requirements. We do this through a process of consolidating data from several systems and presenting it to the user in a simple, intuitive manner. (2) Making changes to force assignment can lead to a ripple-effect in other OPLANs. With OPTIMUS, a Planner or Force Provider may overcome this dilemma using the Planning Workspace which acts as a sandbox for previewing any side effects caused by the current changes. This feature can drastically save time by catching problems early before being saved and propagating into other OPLANs. (3) Our Notification System gives Planners and Force Providers a visual cue when force related data has changed within one of their OPLANs. Based on this work we also derive a comprehensive enterprise architecture for readiness reporting and planning systems.; BENEFIT: OPTIMUS helps automate what are today manual and mundane tasks. It will notify force providers and planners when force data has changed versus routinely investigating each OPLAN to inspect the forces simplifies the process of determining OPLAN viability and reducing the time needed for OPLAN maintenance. The military application is for use by the Force Provider, Air Staff. The COMAFOR (AOC & AFFOR Staff) determine the Aerospace requirements for the Combatant Commanders OPLAN submission. The Air Staff then has the task of resourcing the OPLAN and keeping it resourced, which involves mundane manual work today that OPTIMUS will automate by providing notifications when OPLANs break and then providing a useful servant for the Air Staff to explore allocation changes that will fill the OPLAN requirements and view the ripple effect on other plans. OPTIMUS also has commercial application in similar problems of allocating resources to requirements in plans, such as in logistics.",

        "abstract": "It is not likely that an autonomous system can be programmed with all the information it requires to perform every mission or every variation of every contingency within the near future.  One way to address this issue is to provide user-friendly means to teach or program a robot to add to its autonomous capability.   This proposal focuses on the physical aspects of the robot performance, manipulation and mobility, and the combination of the two, whole-body manipulation.1  Optimally, one would teach a robot as one would teach a human how to perform a physical task. Since this would be an initial entry into intuitive user friendly methods to teach a robot to perform complex physical acts, it is advisable to start with a virtual representation or simulation that lay the foundation for the interface and programming syntax that would describe the physical actions of the robot.2  Programming a robot to use a new tool provides a good example where teaching will prove beneficial.  There are issues with teaching proper grasp of the tool, and the proper pose that would allow the robot to use the tool effectively and apply forces that would not damage the object(s) the tool is acting upon, the tool, or the robot. Thus, before the issues of the human interface are addressed, the basic issues of control for a dynamic multi-body system must be solved in manner that can be represented as a form that can be programmed into a robot.2,3      Focus should be placed first on the development of a software architecture that encompasses and integrates task and motion planning for whole body manipulation.   The software should have the ability to program a robot to perform physical tasks through a virtual environment capable of modeling dynamics and physical contact/interaction without the need for a user such as a Soldier to write a C-level program.  However, the programming constructs or subroutines created by this architecture to operate the robot must be accessible and usable in common programming languages such as C/C++ and Python as open architecture libraries and subroutines. The newly learned behavior must be of a structure that the robot can incorporate it into its existing control programming and implement it autonomously.  It is expected that in order to implement the virtual environment model of the robot which would include descriptions of its physical configurations, actuators, and sensors, highly trained and educated personnel may be needed. The virtual model should be of a fidelity that allows control for a dynamic multi-body system to be developed.  However, once the detailed model is implemented in the virtual environment, the software should provide an interface that allows a user such as a Soldier to interact with and program a robot through the virtual environment to perform a physical task such as grasping or repetitive tasks such as sweeping for mines and IEDs, and trenching for wires.     A secondary focus should be to develop an open software architecture that can be built upon and evolve through time that will allow DoD, Universities, and private industry to collaborate as a software development community on this problem. Open architecture efforts such as ROS should serve as an example. There should be interfaces for well-established speech recognition and vision libraries such as OpenCV.  It is expected that the architecture will allow for future advancements to be added.  For example there are different methodologies for teaching how to recognize a physical object. 4 The open software architecture should have the proper interface to allow object and feature recognition packages/algorithms to be added and updated.",

        "abstract": "Big data challenges across Department of Defense (DOD) domains are increasingly problematic for tactical level decision making.  Data collections in the open source and military channels are growing at such a staggering rate that it exceeds our ability to store and manage, perform computation and analysis, and maintain data security [1, 2].  Indeed, one author refers to the inability to handle big data as the new  helplessness age [1], a reaction to the inability of information processing algorithms to rapidly extract key elements of information to aid decision making in time constrained environments.  Architectural limitations are a major constraint to discovering knowledge from big data stores that represent complex combinations of many data types [3].  Due to the exponential increase in data, combined with the limitations in processing capability, it is unlikely that Warfighters operating in uncertain and unfamiliar cultural environments will benefit from knowledge discovery capabilities any time soon.  To reduce vulnerability and risk for Warfighters from unknown threats, new and innovative approaches are needed for data collection, processing, and user interface designs.  Promising approaches in this space include data streams [4], interactive exploration and hypothesis testing of data [5], and temporal segmentation of large text corpora [6].      Addressing data stream computation is recognition that tactical decisions require a very small subset of all data available in military databases and that valuable data may often be separate from the traditional hard sciences approach to persistent collection and quantitative analysis [5].  In data stream processing, data arrives in continuous, high-volume, fast and time-varying streams [4].  Clustering, classification, and association algorithms may be useful for mining data streams, but transferring results over a wireless network with limited bandwidth could prove challenging for tactical units [4].    Interactive exploration and hypothesis testing of data streams could serve to filter large amounts of information for specific tactical knowledge requirements.  Frequently, Warfighters dont know the right questions to ask and have very limited opportunities to explore options for potential outcomes.  Bio-inspired applications for interface design and collaboration in a visual domain could improve interface designs.  Biological features that might be adapted to interfaces could include autonomy, scalability, adaptability, and robustness [7], each designed to detect data patterns, identify anomalies, and extract knowledge from enormous volumes of data.  The key component of achieving success in this particular problem area is to ensure that computer and social scientists work closely together [1] in order to develop sufficiently robust algorithms with greater reliance on reasoning that allow a domain-relevant interpretation of actionable patterns of behavior and meaning for informed decision making [2].      Temporal segmentation of large text corpora may provide a method by which data may be filtered at tactical levels for rapid processing and knowledge extraction.  Using text open sources (e.g., newspapers, blogs, Tweets, Facebook posts) would provide Warfighters with near-real time insight into semantic tones of localized text [6].  The potential value of this approach would be to allow users to infer a timeline of factors correlated with ideas identified from analysis of public discussion in text corpora.      The challenges with this topic are storage and management of big data, which may contribute to an inability to validate and qualify each data item. Also, careful design of systems is necessary to match user needs and the technologies used for analytics and visual display of information.  In addition, accessing very large quantities of semi- or unstructured data is problematic and limited by available storage applications and hardware. Finally, user needs must be supported by computational processes, with these expressed in ways that are consistent with the larger social system in which the user operates. Frequently, user studies concentrate on the micro-system of the individual user and fail to consider the wider range of opportunities, challenges, and constraints.    The current topic seeks to address those challenges by focusing on a new and innovative data collection/storage/processing method that can reduce noise in large data while keeping relevant data streams for processing.  It also will explore interactive user interface designs that allow temporal segmentation, or other useful algorithms, which should consider bio-inspired applications.  Finally, placing the user within the larger social system for developing filtering and visual methods will provide a unitary perspective for knowledge discovery and dissemination.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Aircraft damage resulting from environmental exposure and fluid leaks accounts for a major portion of the costs associated with aircraft repairs and can lead to reduced availability and higher maintenance man hours.  The ability to identify contaminant exposure within airframes and inform maintenance personnel of leaks, corrosive environments, and chemical contamination in difficult to access areas will allow for enhanced condition based maintenance to reduce sustainment costs and increase aircraft availability.  In order to provide the Air Force with increased visibility into airframe contamination, Luna proposes to develop and deploy a wireless network of intelligent sensors for real time characterization of environmental exposure coupled with next generation aircraft maintenance tracking tools for an end-to-end solution.  The system will provide actionable information to aircraft maintainers by combining Lunas mature, ultra-low power, wireless sensing platform with the ICARR-3D point of maintenance corrosion management tool pioneered by development partner Mercer Engineering Research Center.  The Phase II effort will focus on finalizing system design, validating system performance, and performing safety-of-flight qualification testing.  A technology integration plan will be finalized during the Phase II effort, and the program will culminate in a leak and contaminant detection system suitable for aircraft installation and flight testing.BENEFIT:Corrosion and contaminant related damage costs the military and commercial aircraft operators billions of dollars each year in associated inspection and maintenance.  The system developed under this effort will allow maintainers to locate contamination issues within an airframe in a timely manner and focus their efforts on correcting these conditions, rather than identifying leaks and more extensive damage at scheduled inspection intervals.  By identifying contamination when it occurs, labor and costs to remediate the contamination and effect repairs will be reduced and aircraft availability will increase.  Furthermore, a system that identifies the level, location, and type of contamination will allow maintainers to identify faults associated with leaks, broken seals, and other component failures that degrade aircraft safety and performance.  The benefits gained by both military and commercial aircraft operators will allow for increased asset availability and reliability with minimal upfront installation investments.",

        "abstract": "This proposal describes the design and manufacture of large modulating retro-reflectors (MRR) using Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) based optical modulators. In the proposed MRR device, a micromachined deformable mirror will serve as one facet of a corner cube retro-reflector which will allow intensity modulation of the retro-reflected beam. A characteristic of the MEMS device is that it can be made to act as a normal plane mirror, or it can be deformed using fast, low-power, electrostatic actuation. As part of the MRR, the device maximizes light intensity returned toward the source when the MEMS mirror is planar, and minimizes it when the MEMS mirror is deformed. As a result, the return beam intensity is modulated.The main challenge of the proposed work in development of the MEMS modulators is to scale up the size by a factor of 6 while maintaining good optical quality and modulation performance. To achieve the desired MRR optical performance thicker substrates will be used and custom MEMS foundry tooling will be utilized.The technical objectives are to (1) develop a fabrication process for the manufacture of MEMS modulators for use in MRRs with apertures of 38mm and 76mm, and (2) assemble and test the MRR devices.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Software applications within any large-scale enterprise environment rarely, if ever, live in isolation. System users require access to enterprise functions regardless of the actual system in which that functionality may exist. Therefore, such distributed systems need to be connected into an integrated solution. The consistency of the data throughout this integration process is paramount as it leads directly to issues of data quality and trustworthiness across the enterprise. Within the Logistics Enterprise of the USAF there exists a need for a management system that provides a core, foundational approach to capturing, analyzing, and correcting exceptions and other errors. This system must be robust, service-oriented, and should be based on accepted enterprise standards. It should be extensible, able to handle errors from a wide variety of sources and able to encapsulate many types of errors with different properties. The Praeses team has implemented a prototype solution called Logistics Error Management Analysis and Reporting System (LEMARS) in Phase I of this SBIR designed to identify, resolve, report and manage system errors. The proposed Phase II effort will include development of LEMARS into a solution suitable for use by the USAF.  BENEFIT:  The primary benefit of LEMARS will be to provide a technology neutral, low-risk, robust, cost-effective solution for the management of errors and corrective actions in a complex, heterogeneous systems environment. Secondary benefits include ability to integrate disparate systems, manage business process workflows and perform event analytics.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The advancements to NASA&apos;s Vehicle Sketch Pad (OpenVSP 3.0) completed in 2014 evolved the software into a useful parametric graphics tool for serious aerospace design and analysis. ESAero&apos;s Phase I effort built off of the momentum gained from these advancements by providing a selection of features that complemented the newly available capabilities, such as additional visualization tools, component models, parameter links, and a parasite drag tool. The goal of this Phase II proposal is to build on the successes of the Phase I effort and take large steps to increase OpenVSP&apos;s utility as a conceptual and preliminary design tool. Phase II will tackle several large tasks that will elevate OpenVSP to an entirely new level. These tasks address long-held desires from industry, such as conformal components, and further promote OpenVSP&apos;s integration into the aircraft design workflow by fostering more analysis tools and exportability to third-party programs? such work includes the exciting tasks of building a new aerodynamics package and allowing OpenVSP models to be opened in drawing tools like AutoCAD. By keeping the software open source, OpenVSP 3.0 and the proposed upgrades will serve as an industry-wide standard parametric geometry tool.BENEFIT:OpenVSP is offered as open source software that can be downloaded by anybody, free of charge, from the OpenVSP website (www.openvsp.org). As such, the software can be used throughout the aerospace community, including academia, commercial and military industry, and government, while bypassing restrictive and/or cumbersome policies regarding software purchases. As the program becomes more capable and user friendly, it will establish itself as the industry standard for rapid conceptual design configuration software. The recent NRA-funded developments, which were released as OpenVSP 3.0 in 2014, support a smooth transition from early conceptual design to late preliminary design by enabling (among many other features ) CAD exportability and multi-fidelity analysis capability. The proposed effort will introduce or upgrade features that support the tool&apos;s evolution towards an intuitive, semi-automatic 3-D parametric graphics and MDAO program. The addition of analysis tools for induced drag, transonic drag rise, and wave drag will introduce a great deal of insight into one&apos;s conceptual or preliminary model without needing to rely on complex analyses in other tools that often require high-fidelity meshes and more computation time. Similar benefits will be yielded from the addition of a basic static stability analysis capability, allowing the user to predict trim drag and obtain basic stability derivatives, all within the simplicity of OpenVSP. Compatibility with more third-party software tools will permit such tasks as easily working with OpenVSP models in 2D drawing programs and even predicting radar cross sections. Developing the capability to save groups of parameters will save users time by allowing them to quickly choose between multiple configurations for the same model (e.g., gear down, stretched fuselage, folded wing, etc.) rather than reset each parameter one at a time. Additional support for structural modeling will be granted, while a blended wing capability will be added to allow for even more exotic concepts in OpenVSP. The long-held industry desire for conformal parts in OpenVSP will be answered, allowing users to easily build fuel tank models that conform to wings or fuselage space, for example. A file converter for *.vsp to *.vsp3 will at last allow users to open their older OpenVSP models in the significantly-upgraded OpenVSP 3.0, saving the hours of time it would take to rebuild the models. Lastly, incredible usefulness will be gleaned from the continuation of the Phase I component and advanced link libraries, which will expand the already invaluable libraries of fighter components and parameter links to all types of aircraft.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  As mission-based applications are deployed in the cloud, they are subject to resource constraints and environmental factors that drive their migration from instance to instance, possibly resulting in deployment on common hardware that may or may not be subverted or be hosting insecure applications.  Existing cloud security services such as firewalls, anti-exfiltration services, and malware/virus protection are reactive in nature and do not adequately address adversaries that may have already subverted the cloud infrastructure and may be in a position to exfiltrate data-at-rest or in-transit or reverse engineering applications on virtual machines (VMs) deployed or migrated to that area of the cloud.   This project, Application Protected Execution (APEx), is prototyping a suite of security services to address these challenges through multiple layers of defense for cloud infrastructure. These services include the startup and monitoring of secure out-of-band memory areas for each VM, the use of obfuscated IO services that protect data-in-transit, the use of encrypted file systems to protect data-at-rest and services that provide application obfuscation to thwart reverse engineering attempts.  The APEx prototype builds on a successful proof-of-concept implementation of APEx services that have been shown to be robust against attacks while experiencing little impact in application performance.     BENEFIT:  The anticipated benefits of the APEx SaaS solution are that it provides layered defense services that thwart data exfiltration and reverse engineering attempts by adversaries that gain access to the cloud infrastructure. As such it provides robust security against attempts made by external hackers who break into the infrastructure through networks, malicious insiders with physical access to the infrastructure, or other adversaries that may gain access to malware or supply chain-based back doors. The APEx prototype is anticipated to be resilient against over 99.5% over attacks while impacting run-time performance of applications by no more than 10%.   Commercially, the APEx will be provided as a Software as a Service solution to available to both consumers of cloud infrastructure and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) providers. Consumers will be able to buy a downloadable subscription to APEx for use on their VMs. Likewise, our plan is to also work with IaaS and PaaS infrastructure providers to license our software to them for use by their user base when standing up their environments on the cloud. In pursuit of these endeavors, RAM Laboratories has started working with IBM and their SoftLayer cloud solution to assist us in testing, benchmarking, transitioning and eventually distributing APEx for use in their cloud offerings.",

The software may be subject to malicious insiders, external threats and supply chain threats that access systems through poor software hygiene or the presence of zero-day vulnerabilities that the vendor is not aware of. While an array of software assurance tools have been developed that audit code at the source code or static binary level, existing tools do not perform dynamic binary analysis with source code checking to assist developers, nor do they provide a drill-down into software libraries to assist supply chain management in gaining a compliance assessment for the entire software solution. \n\nTo address these shortfalls, this project extends the research and development of RAM Laboratories' Real-Time Application Security Analyzer (RASAR) tool. RASAR currently detects and characterizes security vulnerabilities (including zero-day vulnerabilities) in both under development and 3rd party software through source code analysis and dynamic binary instrumentation. This project will add capabilities to the tool suite that prioritize the vulnerabilities as defined by Common Weakness Enumeration, correlate identified binary vulnerabilities with both vulnerabilities found in the Common Vulnerability Exposure database and available source code flaws, and provide a compliance dashboard that tracks and reports supply chain issues for the user. Additionally, audit results will be visualized by the user through the use of a compliance dashboard. The resulting tool will be integrated within the Software Assurance Marketplace.",

Combining semantic logic-based and math-based techniques provides an advanced technology platform that intelligence analysts can use for manipulation of large-scale graphs, both in terms of their categorical metadata as well as statistical characteristics surrounding weighted relationships, trust, and provenance/pedigree. Pattern of life analysis is broadly categorized as entity-centric, micro-POL and the broader regional, country-wide or topic-specific analysis of macro-POL. The computational outputs of these POL analyses are driven to a user-friendly semantic wiki, where humans can easily interact with the data and effectively represent and track POL activities of various types. The intuitive wiki platform allows users to deal with basic entity types (persons, organizations, times, locations, etc.) and meta-POL areas of interest (regions, countries or topics) thereby shielding them from the complex graph heuristics being performed under the hood. POLIS is built within a scalable component-based platform enabling operations with multiple users and applications running at cloud-scale.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In this effort, we develop a light-weight type I hypervisor, called SecureVirt. Compared with existing hypervisors, SecureVirt has a reduced attack surface and small code base, and supports live virtual machine (VM) migration. SecureVirt can securely isolate the virtual machines (VMs) running on the same platform and prevent a malicious VM from escaping its security boundary. The SecureVirt architecture follows the Microkernel design principle and defense in depth strategy, which significantly reduces the attack surface of SecureVirt and meanwhile enables live VM migration. Moreover, SecureVirt adopts a static CPU core and memory allocation approach to further simplify its functions and reduce its code size. We developed a preliminary SecureVirt prototype and conducted extensive experiments to test it in phase I effort. The experimental results in Phase I demonstrate the feasibility of the SecureVirt architecture. In Phase II effort, we will continue our Phase I work by adding more new functions. Specifically, we will implement VM migration support to allow a VM to migrate to different platforms. Finally, the proposed techniques are integrated into a prototype implementation.  BENEFIT:  The proposed hypervisor architecture, SecureVirt, provides a feasible solution for cloud computing environment. The architecture and techniques can be applied to a broad range of military scenarios that involve sensitive information protection including war-time command and control, real-time surveillance network, homeland security, etc. Other potential commercial applications include software industry, banking, law enforcement agency and various civil applications. In essence, the ideas, methods and products resulting from this effort will be applicable to the applications where trusted computing base is needed. The market is quite large and still developing due to the development of computer and software industry. The aggregated commercial market size is estimated to be $963.4 Million or more.  SecureVirt has significant commercial potential for applications such as cloud computing, information security, and trusted computing.  End users of SecureVirt include cloud computing infrastructure service providers (Amazon, Rackspace) to protect VMs running on their cloud computing infrastructure; embedded system and mobile device vendors (Northrop Grumman information system, Samsung) to improve the resilience and reliability of their systems; security tool providers such as (Symantec, McAfee, SourceFire) to detect and analyze malware.",

Reducing overall Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) of military ECUs is complicated by the transient, yet predictable, nature of the thermal demand profile over the course of a typical daily usage cycle, where cooling capacity must currently be set to match the daily peak load.  This need for cooling unit exess-capacity creates trickle-down effects of increasing installed power generation requirements and logistic transport burdens. ECU capacity right-sizing can help meet Operational Energy Strategy requirements for improved net energy efficiency, but will demand significant changes to ECU design.    Thermal Energy Storage (TES) has been shown to be effective in load-leveling the daily cooling profile for fixed facilities, providing reductions in net energy consumption in some cases due to free cooling [2], as well as reduced compressor cycling, more steady cooling, and reduced peak power requirements [3,4]. However, because of the compositional variability in cooled facilities in forward operating environments, implementing TES would require directly integrating the technology within mobile ECUs, a task which has received only cursory attention in the literature and would require optimization of overall size and weight in addition to reducing energy usage.  Solid-liquid Phase Change Materials (PCMs) present one high-density TES option for cooling systems and environmental control [5,6], yet challenges remain in material selection, heat exchanger topology and integration strategy to maximize operational benefit.    This SBIR program seeks to develop a PCM-based solution to enhance the performance of an existing ECU in the 9-18k BTUH range, addressing concerns of system energy density, material compatibility, and failure modes due to repeated thermal cycling. Offeror is expected to propose a phase change TES component that can be integrated into an existing ECU for the purpose of off-peak load leveling or demand reduction, with a target energy usage reduction of 5-10% over an average daily cycle, assuming no more than an 25F diurnal temperature variation. Unit should still be able to provide rated cooling capacity under worse case conditions in a deployed environment (design condition 125F ambient, 90F indoor dry bulb, 75F indoor wet bulb) for a period of at least 2 hours during daily peak demand period. Specification of PCM type, integration point (on refrigerant or air-side flow paths), storage temperature, and storage heat exchanger design are left up to the offeror, however those decisions and the associated impact on overall system size, weight and performance should be justified through thermodynamic analysis and system/component modeling.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The current state-of-the-art for heat exchanger (HEX) analysis and design relies on analytical approaches which are difficult to scale and highly empirical, thus making the ability to optimize advanced heat transfer devices improbable without comprehensive characterization efforts. The design standard for predicting heat exchanger performance is a set of empirical data developed more than 50 years ago by Kays and London. While this is an extensive set of data and has been useful for heat exchanger designs, it is applicable for point designs and does not provide an approach for extrapolating into new design spaces. HEXDesign provides a novel approach for accurately characterizing and scaling new HEX designs to facilitate timely trade studies of potential concepts and accelerate the typical timeframe from concept initiation to finished product. Scaling effects included in HEXDesign account for geometry, configuration, installation effects, materials, working fluids, and manufacturing. The proposed effort addresses thermal modeling requirements for HEXDesign, including improved I/O options, improved complex modeling capabilities, additional insight into execution errors, and additional options for defining heat transfer coefficients. These updates to HEXDesign will allow the software to be used to model complex heat exchangers within system modeling environments, such as Phoenix Integrations ModelCenter software.  BENEFIT:  HEXDesign provides the enabling technology, in the form of a computer tool, to design optimized heat exchangers for thermal management systems. It is a commercially marketable software package focused on meeting the thermal challenges facing air, ground, and space transportation in the 21st Century. HEXDesign provides customers with a user-friendly design optimization tool that may be applied in the design of heat exchangers for thermal management systems. HEXDesign provides SPIRITECH with a two-fold commercial market. First, this code may be marketed as an engineering tool to other aerospace and non-aerospace companies. Second, it provides SPIRITECH with an efficient engineering tool enabling it to develop high performance thermal management systems. As an analysis tool, it will be used by SPIRITECH in the development of cooled components and thermal management systems for commercial aerospace markets. Potential customers in this field include both military and commercial customers. Military customers include Air Force, Navy, Army, NASA and DARPA. Commercial customers include aircraft, propulsion, automotive, and power generation companies, as well as any company that uses heat exchangers to cool components.",

Marketed commercially as the EYE-5xx series, the systems provide real-time actionable intelligence to operational forces using airborne hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and multispectral imaging (MSI) sensors. In addition, ACT developed an airborne power supply and image processing unit for use with the turrets to provide a fully integrated system solution that provides real-time spectral processing and target identification in the size, weight and power (SWaP) required for deployment on the RQ-21A STUAS. The turreted, modular, multi-mission system (TUMMS) enables the user to select from a suite of EYE-5xx gimbals and quickly install the payload that best satisfies the specific mission requirements. One purpose of the current effort is to conduct demonstrations of TUMMS to provide visibility of system capabilities to operational forces. Another purpose is to expand the capabilities of TUMMS by capitalizing on its modular nature to quickly add features and missions, such as; adding a target designation capability; further maturation of the wide area mapping and imagery (WAMI) functionality; and the ability to support third-party turrets with complementary electronic and/or optical capabilities. Lastly, ACT will develop next-generation designs to reduce the SWaP of TUMMS to increase flight duration and/or allow for inclusion of multiple simultaneous payloads.",

Scanigo implements an Ontology-Based Information Extraction (OBIE) methodology that significantly reduces the amount of information presented to the analysts, based on computed relevance, information overload is reduced by orders-of-magnitude while passing relevant information. Scanigo has been in use supporting real-world disaster since 2012 with results of less than 1% reduction of the total data to actionable information, relevant to the domain. The purpose of this Phase II is to significantly improve Scanigo's modularity, adaptability and performance. In addition, to demonstrate utility for use-cases that supports FEMA's emergency response operations. Planned improvements include: additional data sources; componentization; NoSQL database migration; knowledge extraction; ontology learning; ontology management; and cloud deployment. The primary purpose of componentization is to support various integration opportunities that already have a social media monitoring or analysis platform. For example, the OBIE pipeline that reduces social media streams in real-time based on relevance can be integrated into existing data flow architectures. The common theme of the planned improvements is scale. Componentization will allow Scanigo to scale to other integration opportunities. The ontology improvements will allow Scanigo to scale to other domains. Implementing ontology learning and management allows end users to perform their own domain customization, scaling to other domains. And finally, the performance improvements and a cloud deployment will allow Scanigo to scale to a global market.",

        "abstract": "Decisions made at concept design have profound impacts on total life cycle cost. The industry trend is to apply automated software tools during concept design so larger numbers of alternatives can be evaluated and optimal, feasible solutions identified. Current ship concept design software tools lack the ability to synthesize physical layouts for shipboard distribution systems. Without sized and located distribution system models, it is not possible to fully validate the feasibility of the concept design and accurately estimate cost, weight, survivability, and other performance parameters. The problem is acute for ship cooling distribution systems because integrated electrical power systems and high-energy defense/combat weapons systems planned for future ships will require several times more thermal management. This gap can be eliminated by creating software tools to automatically generate detailed 3D models of ship distribution systems during concept design.Anchor Technology Inc. has developed innovative technology which can solve this problem, directly synthesizing, routing and analyzing distribution networks. The new technology will reduce costs associated with concept, preliminary and detail ship design, as well as total lifecycle costs.

Unfortunately, these hexavalent chromates are carcinogens, and their use and disposal is strictly regulated.  An ideal aircraft fuel tank coating would provide effective corrosion protection without the use of chromates.  In this SBIR project TDA will develop a chromate free, room temperature curing fuel tank coating using novel corrosion inhibitor additives.  TDA has developed a new class of corrosion inhibiting materials that can dramatically increase the corrosion protection performance. In the Phase I project we worked a major coating manufacturer to incorporate our corrosion inhibitors into a modified AMS-C-27725 fuel tank coating resin system.  The Phase I feasibility study demonstrated that TDAs novel corrosion inhibitors provided effective corrosion protection in ASTM B117 salt fog studies without changing the physical properties of the original coating. In the Phase II we will optimize the coating and inhibitor package to provide a coating whose protections equals that of the current system, but that contains no chromate and meets the requirement of the AMS-C-27725.  BENEFIT:  The chromate free polyurethane fuel tank coatings are applicable to commercial as well as military aircraft.  Further, the non-chromated corrosion inhibitor additives developed in this project can be used in military and commercial primers and coatings wherever corrosion protection is required.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Increasing emphasis on affordability of military systems has led to a number of advances in airframe production. For example, high speed machining (HSM) has made it possible to fabricate thin structures that provide improved performance. However, near-surface plastic strains induced by HSM or surface treatments can lead to excessive component distortion such that the component requires reshaping, resulting in additional cost. In other cases, surface treatments are applied specifically to reach a target distorted shape. In Phase I a novel approach for developing a reliable analytical procedure was investigated and a successful validation experiment indicated that the Phase I prototype reshaping software tool represented a significant step forward toward the final goal of the project: to optimize machining and surface treatment processes for complex components such that a target deformation can be achieved with quantified uncertainty. The Phase II effort will focus on further development of the prototype software tool in order to demonstrate its use in an operational environment. ESRD will collaborate with The Boeing Company to refine requirements and demonstrate the predictive performance of this software tool on a typical aerospace component. This system should lead to substantial cost savings in the manufacturing of metallic aerospace components.  BENEFIT:  The vehicle for commercialization of the new technological capabilities will be ESRD's software product StressCheck which is already being used by major aerospace OEMs, primarily for special applications and detailed analysis at the subcomponent and component levels. It provides the infrastructure necessary for supporting hierarchic modeling and solution verification procedures. The key to successful commercialization is the development of metrics that demonstrate not only the new technological capabilities but also the substantial economic benefits in terms of cost reductions derived from enabling designers to model design alternatives without having to perform extensive testing of prototypes. The economic benefit is known: Boeing has expressed that it expects substantial savings to be realized in manufacturing of unitized structures with this new technology.  The primary market for the technical capabilities to be developed is both military and commercial aircraft manufacturers. This includes the major OEMs and their suppliers. In the Phase I project The Boeing Company provided ESRD with a Letter of Support for developing the technology and Boeing is continuing its involvement as a subcontractor for Phase II, and as such, the initial commercialization will be within Boeing. As complex unitized components are becoming more common in the aerospace industry the need becomes greater for a virtual distortion modeling system, and there should be extensive need within other aerospace OEMs as well for a software tool that enhances reliability and reduces the cost of complex components. Substantial market opportunities also exist in automotive, shipbuilding, and other industries that perform surface treatments on metallic components.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Modern electronic and opto-electronic devices are predicated on controlled deposition and patterning of functional material layers (e.g. semiconductors, conductors, and dielectrics). Vacuum epitaxy and chemical vapor deposition, in conjunction with lithographic methods, have dominated the manufacture of these systems. While these techniques are well-established and routinely deliver reliable and excellent performance, they are expensive to operate and maintain and are relegated to the processing of rigid, planar substrates. New integrated optics and photonics technologies stand to benefit from transitioning the successes of vacuum thin film deposition and lithographic patterning to a mass-producible, conformable optoelectronic device manufacturing platform. Critical to this transformation will be the ability to use low-cost conventional printing technologies to pattern precursors of active-layer materials (e.g. semiconductors with high refractive indices) onto a variety of substrates and subsequently consolidate the precursors into photonic circuit components (waveguides, splitters, modulators, amplifiers, filters) and electro-optical devices (energy harvesting devices, conformal antennas, infrared emitter, sensor arrays, etc.). To enable high-throughput, low-cost manufacturing of photonic circuitry, Nanohmics, Inc., working in collaboration with industrial and academic partners, have formulated a class of high-refractive-index-material inks and developed methods for in-line, direct-write printing and consolidation of the inks into photonic circuit components on large-area, continuous webs.  BENEFIT:  The proposed method form factor is amenable to a number of distributed sensor network applications including chemical- monitoring, where Nanohmics has identified a current unmet need in the industrial safety monitoring market. In addition to the possibility of producing a printed, conformal chemical sensor measurement device, the inks and sintering techniques developed under this program will enable a large number of other optically-active elements including arrayed waveguide gratings, printed microemitters and detectors, photonic crystals, lasing elements, and other gas- and liquid-phase optical sensors.

Such structures are needed by DRS Technologies, a major DoD manufacturer of NVGs and other infrared products. They can be used in the DRS high density vertically integrated photodiode (HDVIP) process to fabricate 640x480 format, 12 micron pitch and 1280x960 format, 6 micron pitch FPA products for many applications.",

        "abstract": "The proposed effort will result in an \"universal\" fan noise cancellation system for use with high performance fans used extensively in defense applications including auxiliary power unit (APU) applications.  Fans are a critical noise source that impact the audible detection range of the platform.  The importance of the fan noise for detection continues to increase as other technology improvements such as fuel cells and signature reduction technologies impact APU noise levels.  Successful development of a prototype active noise cancellation system for fans has the potential to make a significant improvement  in audible detection range reduction, further enabling mission execution.  The concept system includes both sensors and cancellation sources that are integrated into the fan and fan shroud.  This yields an active fan noise cancellation system that is self contained and can be integrated into a fan design with minimal effort and with negligible impact on flow performance.  The estimated cost and weight burden are comparable with less effective passive noise reduction solutions.",

Of course, our ability to model the physics of heavy trucks [3] is quite mature as well.  To address the challenge of developing the STE, we will provide our autonomy algorithms as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).      The focus of this topic is: 1) to build an environment that mirrors actual test data to provide a departure point for Monte Carlo simulations. 2) research the failure modes for autonomy algorithms within the capabilities of current sensor models and 3) simulate the corner cases that would exercise these failure modes.    This topic is not focused on improving physics-based simulation of heavy trucks or building better sensor models.  Neither do we seek to develop new algorithms for autonomous behavior, but rather to leverage existing GFE autonomy algorithms to study the open research question of how we can test these algorithms in simulation, and certify that they are safe to the fullest extent possible within current simulation environments.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Weather, intelligence, communications, PNT...are all capabilities we have brought to the fight from the space domain and are relied upon in virtually any and every military operation.  Mr. Michael Donley, Former Secretary of the Air Force.  The modern warfighter requires freedom of action in space, and when necessary, defeats adversary efforts that interfere or attack US or allied space systems.  Freedom of action in space is enabled by Space Situational Awareness (SSA).  As space continues to become more congested and contested, our ability to identify and mitigate man-made and natural threats to space assets becomes increasingly difficult.  Applying the same resources to a larger data set delays the ability to make informed decisions.  With current capabilities, performing an in-depth characterization (ex. mission payload assessment) can take weeks to months, especially if the object is non-cooperative.  Timely and effective resident space object (RSO) characterization is a challenge, and requires advanced data processing techniques.  A critical first need is the ability to detect and identify photometric signature changes due to potential RSO changes (e.g., stability, material), and correlate these observed changes to potential behavior changes. To meet this technology need, ExoAnalytic Solutions proposes to mature Autonomous Characterization Algorithms for Change Detection and Characterization (ACDC).    ACDC is significant because it utilizes cutting edge algorithms rooted in Missile Defense, anchored by a global telescope network producing millions of real-time correlated observations each month.  The result is a capability to robustly assess state change detection and improve object correlation.  BENEFIT:  ACDC provides several key contributions to DOD.  Most importantly, ACDC will provide the JSpOC with needed Threat Identifications and Warnings to accomplish its mission, as called out in the latest JMS Increment 3 RFI.  The ACDC effort includes the development of a characterization and correlation framework for determining the resources necessary to properly characterize space objects.  This framework can be used by JSpOC on current and future systems, and can incorporate government or additional industry algorithms.  ACDCs technical approach, the algorithms and infrastructure that will be developed, and lessons learned can all be leveraged to further applied research and technology development for threat indication and warning in the ISR domain as well.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  A planned upgrade of the US nuclear arsenal will involve the replacement of aging arming and firing systems with FPGA and ASIC-based electronics.  Due to the increased complexity of these electronics, a need exists for highly rigorous design verification that can be performed to assure the safety and reliability of these systems. The ECI solution consists of maintaining a well-documented linkage between requirements and fielded components and assuring the component designs meet the requirements through innovative methods of model checking.  In order to check that the design-under-test has matched functionality of a golden reference model based on the original requirements, ECI will continue development of two separate methodologies for checking models adhere to specified requirements.  The first of these methodologies is the REVEAL Requirements verification tool which provides a structured framework to link high-level requirements to evidence that supports the fulfillment of those requirements.  This evidence is comprised of derived requirements from the high-level requirements, model source code, and model-checking code.  The second methodology is verification through formal methods of model checking and examination of the entire state space.  This will consist of performing real-time logic checking along with highly structured fault-injection permutations for continued safe operation in adverse conditions.  BENEFIT:  There is growing need for assured microelectronics as failures in weapon systems could have far-reaching consequences jeopardizing the success of a mission, the welfare of our nation and in the case of a nuclear accident, human life altogether.  Microelectronics can experience faults and subsequent failures due to a variety of reasons including poor design, manufacturing deficiencies, and out-of-spec physical conditions.  Design strategies and methods need to be improved to not only exhibit correct design functionality, but to also assure that if faults do occur, the system will not enter an unsafe state.  Verification process flows will be developed for this effort which will give the Air Force and its Primes a systematic method to screen for failure modes that lead to unsafe states.  With REVEAL, failures in manufactured circuits will be traced back to faults that may occur in its functionality, which will save time and money by assuring safe and rugged designs before manufacturing.  We envision applications of REVEAL within the DoD, NNSA, and market areas where an utmost level of safety is required from factory machinery, and aviation and automotive electronics.",

        "abstract": "Complex skin defects, including burns and trauma, represent a major medical problem affecting both military and civilian populations. In recent military engagements, burns account for approximately 5% of combat casualties. Furthermore, approximately 1.25 million Americans each year require medical attention for complex skin defects, with 50,000 people hospitalized for burns and 13,000 requiring skin grafts. With severe skin injuries, disruption of the epidermal permeability barrier and skin loss must be addressed promptly to prevent life-threatening complications. However, restoration of fully functional skin requires regeneration of the interfollicular epidermis, the cutaneous appendages, and the underlying vascularized dermis. Currently, no therapeutic approach addresses both the immediate need for wound coverage and the ultimate goal of autologous skin tissue regeneration. To address this unmet need, we have proposed a therapeutic approach which combines the advantages of a next generation bioengineered skin substitute with the benefits of autologous tissue micrografting to 1) recapitulate the normal barrier function of intact human skin, 2) reduce time to wound closure, 3) speed wound revascularization, and 4) deliver autologous tissue for skin regeneration with functional and cosmetic restoration. To make this treatment option availability to patients, independent clinical evaluation and FDA approval are required to commercialize these technologies.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  For the F-35 program, the installation and inspection of Eddie-Bolt assemblies is challenging in some aircraft locations, requires significant manual labor, and dramatically impacts system affordability.  After installation, the fastener is inspected multiple times to ensure proper nut swaging and thread protrusion length.  Creares novel solution to combine the installation and inspection steps for Eddie-Bolt installations is our Smart Installation System (SIS).  Our SIS enables the operator to install, inspect, and record inspection data in a single step, and it dramatically reduces the cost of Eddie-Bolt installations across the military aircraft.  During the Phase I project, we: demonstrated that our SIS maintains the ease-of-use and accessibility of the current tools; established that the SIS enables the operator to install, inspect, and record inspection data in a single step; and integrated our proof-of-concept SIS with the most challenging tool geometry significantly reducing the technical risk of our approach.  During the Phase II project, we will: develop a preliminary specification; design the SIS prototype; fabricate the SIS prototypes and complete functional, performance, and on-site testing; refine the system design; develop a tool certification plan; and develop a production plan that will enable the rapid transition of our SIS to the production floor.  BENEFIT:  Proper fastener installation is a fundamental manufacturing process used in everyday construction and military systems.  The ability to safely, efficiently, and conveniently join two parts together using fasteners that are installed to critical specifications is common in a wide variety of commercial and military products.  The commercial applications of our innovation include large-scale manufacturing, automotive, construction, and the commercial aerospace industries.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In this proposed project, a novel framework will be further developed and demonstrated to link physics-based simulations of non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methods with probabilistic fracture mechanics (PFM) analysis to support rapid qualification of advanced materials processes such as additive manufacturing (AM). In particular, the X-ray and CT simulation software XRSIM and SimCT will be linked with the PFM software DARWIN and the general-purpose probabilistic analysis software NESSUS to create a virtual reliability environment (VRE). XRSIM/SimCT will be used to determine full-field, location-specific POD curves for significant manufacturing defects that DARWIN will incorporate in predictions of fracture risk for the component in service.  A prototype framework was successfully developed and demonstrated in a Phase I project. In the proposed Phase II project, the computer programs XRSIM/SimCT and DARWIN/NESSUS and their interfaces will be enhanced to substantially improve automation and efficiency of the computations, in support of improved efficiency for physical inspection plans and improved reliability for the component. Model credibility will be established through revision and execution of the verification and validation plan developed in Phase I. The integrated VRE, which will have broad applicability beyond AM, will be licensed commercially.  BENEFIT:  AM processes promise a long list of benefits to both legacy systems (low cost low volume parts) and new program development (lower cost prototypes early in the design cycle), but without a way to qualify parts in a highly variable piece to piece manufacturing process there is no way to trust the product.  The VRE proposed here will provide a major step forward in establishing quality and hence usability in AM parts. However, the VRE isnt just tied to AM processes, but can accept process input from any other manufacturing method (either model or empirically generated).  This provides a much broader list of potential applications and benefits. Specific cost savings to additive manufacturing users will come from a reduction in the number of rejected parts.  When a virtual inspection is performed, lots of virtual parts can be scrapped at first.  As the process is adjusted the number of virtual part rejections reaches an acceptable level.  If the model has been properly calibrated and verified/validated, this will lead to fewer scrapped parts.  The cost reduction is directly proportional to the reduction in rejected parts.  There is also a significant design cycle time savings to be had in identifying the best process parameters needed for an optimized design, allowing for a faster response time to engineering changes and requirements. The ability to inexpensively get POD information, as provided from this projects VRE, is a huge cost savings for industry and the ability to target or zone inspections based on accurate POD and DT probabilities is a risk reducer as well.  Just being able to examine an existing inspection for adequacy has huge advantages. The broader manufacturing perspective, massive investments are currently being made across the board in ICME methods for improved simulation of materials development and manufacturing processes. These simulation systems will all eventually need to carry through to address component reliability if they truly support the cradle-to-grave design, manufacturing, and life management system. Any defect-sensitive and safety-critical application will need to address NDE and POD considerations as well as fracture risk. Lastly, the proposed project will result in significant enhancements to commercially mature software and the creation of an integrated VRE that will also be licensed commercially.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to create a medical device capable of rapidly guiding treatment to stop bleeding in trauma patients. Trauma can affect the body's ability to form clots to stop bleeding. Of the more than 2 million severe cases of trauma in the U.S., approximately one third will develop a condition: trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), which increases mortality 4-fold. TIC can be corrected; however, current tests to identify TIC take too long to effectively guide treatment. This leads to sub-optimal care and increased mortality and morbidity. The current standard-of-care to correct TIC is the transfusion of blood products. A patient should only be transfused if necessary because unnecessary transfusions can lead to complications resulting in longer hospital stays and even death. A rapid assay that can evaluate a trauma patient's coagulation status can help guide treatment of their injuries, resulting in improved standard-of-care that can both save lives and healthcare dollars. Yearly trauma rates unfortunately remain stable, and with an addressable market of more than $400M per year in the U.S., the commercial impact for such an assay is significant. The proposed project is to develop a rapid assay that provides an individualized assessment of a trauma patient's coagulation status. A significant subset of trauma patients develop impairment to the normal coagulation process as a result of their injuries. Current assays to identify this impairment take too long to effectively guide treatment. Therefore, successful completion of this project will yield a disposable microfluidic card (microcard) that has multiple advantages over current assays, which are slow and non-specific. The microcard will measure clot characteristics currently used by emergency room physicians to guide treatment, but will do so in less than five minutes. This is a critical feature as it quickly guides treatment, meaning that there is time for re-evaluation to determine if treatment is effective. The microcard will also include on-board positive and negative controls that indicate a patient?s individual coagulation profile. This will result in personalized and more accurate treatments that can reduce complications and mortality. The rapid and specific microcard assay will significantly improve care of injured patients while conserving resources and time, ultimately saving money for the U.S. healthcare system.",

        "abstract": "Bioassays employed to evaluate the diverse range of biomarkers associated with organ injury are time-consuming, costly and require multiple instruments/testing formats to reach a diagnosis (i.e. fluorescence-based capture, ELISAs, PCR, etc.). Individually, these platforms are incapable of predicting the onset of irreversible organ tissue injury (e.g. kidney, liver, heart and lung). If a single multiplexed screening bioassay could be fabricated to assess multiple, pre-clinical biomarkers that are predictive indicators of systemic toxicity, it would significantly reduce the complexity, expense and turnaround time associated with injured soldier diagnostics.  One barrier to transitioning microarray technology into multiplex medicinal diagnostics has been the limitations imposed by fluorescence/optical-based labeling and endpoint detection. To overcome these limitations, Nanohmics Inc., an early-stage biotechnology and sensor development company (Austin, TX), working in collaboration with commercial and University partners is proposing the continued development of a multiplexed diagnostic platform based on direct electrical detection of pre-clinical and eventually clinical toxicity biomarkers for predictive organ tissue injury.

This industry panel will be designed with a safety margin to satisfy flight worthiness requirements. In the second stage, the proposed effort will include pre- and post-test simulation and validation of a panel with significantly greater aerothermoelastic response in order to test the tools for design at substantially lower structural margins.

        "abstract": "Future hypersonic vehicles will be required to fly extended, long term trajectories where the bodies must exhibit high lift-to-drag (L/D) ratios. The need for reduced drag means that the nosetips and leading edges must have small radii, shallow wedge angles, and be erosion resistant. Desirable dimensions include a nose radius on the order of 0.040 inch and a wedge half angle of about 3. This radius is an order of magnitude finer than the existing state of the art. Existing carbon-carbons and ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) made with commercial carbon yarns (2K and 3K tows) result in nosetips and leading edges with radii of 0.5 inch or greater. Fine radii also create operational problems because aerodynamic heat loads increase as the radius decreases. This means that high L/D nosetips and leading edges will be exposed to high temperatures in an oxidizing environment for long periods of time. Thus in order to maintain a sharp radius the nosetips and leading edges must be erosion resistant and able to withstand significant thermal stresses. Thus the problem is to develop low erosion, thermal stress resistant ceramic matrix composites at a geometric scale that is an order of magnitude finer than the existing state of the art.In order to solve this problem Materials Research & Design (MR&D) proposes to develop fine braided tungsten (W) wire CMCs that meet the goals for fine geometry, low erosion, and thermal stress resistance. The proposed effort builds upon past successful collaborations between MR&D and two other businesses. Specifically DE Technologies (DET) and MR&D have designed, analyzed, developed and demonstrated high strength tungsten reinforced braided composites for severe impact applications. Additionally MR&D has supported Exothermics in the development of manufacturing methods to densify chopped W/HfN composites for high temperature erosion resistant CMCs. The proposed Phase II program will bring this team together to design, analyze, fabricate, and characterize fine braided W/HfN CMC leading edges. MR&D will manage the program, analyze the response of the CMC to a hypersonic trajectory, and design braid architectures that will survive the conditions. DET will braid both representative leading edge preforms and additional preforms for densification and characterization. Exothermics will densify the braided tungsten preforms using their process of hafnium slurry infiltration followed by nitridation and HIPping. Braided W/HfN billets will be characterized at SoRI for critical material properties including thermal conductivity, thermal expansion, and high temperature strength.",

        "abstract": "The benefits of greater power and efficiency are offered by using turbochargers and superchargers for small UAS propulsion systems which including rotary, piston, and other developing engines.  Present day UASs suffer performance losses upon takeoff and at altitude.  Therefore, the need for improved, light weight turbo and superchargers which eliminate the use of oil lubrication for the bearing system is needed.  Furthermore, current UAS systems are experiencing durability issues with turbochargers due to oil coking.  Light weight forced induction systems with improved bearing and lubrication circuits are sought for the 50 to 150 HP UAS class.    The bearing systems in turbochargers and superchargers are normally oil-fed from the engine oiling system.  The bearings in these systems run in an extremely harsh environment and are subjected to axial, radial and thermal loads that limit the life of the turbocharger system and can cause failures during important mission sorties.  The elimination of the pressurized oil bearing system would greatly enhance reliability and durability and decreases losses of aircraft that are employing turbochargers and superchargers.  There are a number of engines that could use turbocharger technology but some do not have pressurized oiling systems.  Even systems that have pressurized oiling systems suffer from pumping losses due to the oiling system having to supply oil to the turbocharger and supercharger. Additionally, when operating at high angles of attack, the pressurized oil systems may not provide adequate lubrication for the bearing systems.  Having a system that optimizes the ability to place the turbocharger or supercharger in airframe positions that are not possible with a pressurized oiling system is a must.     Lastly, the forced induction system should be light weight and reliable.  The weight should less than 5% of the overall engine system.",

During the SBIR Phase II, PaxVax will cGMP manufacture clinical Ad4/Ad7 vaccines with processes and assays developed under the SBIR I. PaxVax will produce Ad4/Ad7 cGMP master viral seeds (MVS) with plaque-purified and amplified pre-MVS, bulk drug substances (BDS), and final drug products (FDP), and subsequently release these products for clinical trials. The produced Ad4/Ad7 FDP will also be placed on a stability program as required to support the trials.

Advanced noninvasive testing with high sensitivity and specificity is needed to detect specific organ injury particularly at early stages. Current techniques such as PCR, MS, absorption-based assays, ELISA and microfluidic-Luminex, cannot meet such requirements. To address this issue, Luna is developing enhanced surface plasmon resonance imaging based diagnostic technology to detect all predictive biomarkers for organ injuries. It incorporates protein and aptamer arrays for detection of each biomarker with LoD as low as few pg/mL, used in a fieldable detection system. During the three-phase program, Luna has developed a proposed multiplexed assay and demonstrated its feasibility through detecting two  organ injury biomarkers at pg/mL concentration in Phase I. During Phase II, the assay kit will be further optimized, prototyped and validated with clinical relevance, followed by transitioning to manufacturing and commercialization for dual applications in Phase III. The project will result in a diagnostic product that will determine whether a patient have organ injury, thereby allowing the possibility to take early curative intervention.",

        "abstract": "The recent military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have led to increased incidence of cognitive symptoms associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol and substance abuse, mood and anxiety disorders, and chronic pain. Neurocognitive impairment negatively affects the functional performance and daily life of service members so that consistent assessment is necessary at many levels. Unfortunately, existing neurocognitive assessment tests that are sensitive to cognitive dysfunction of various origins are often time-consuming and require trained personnel to administer properly. Creare proposes to develop, test, validate, and commercialize a mobile, self administered neurocognitive assessment battery (SANAB) that probes the core neurocognitive domains including verbal learning and memory, visual memory, (sustained) attention, executive function, processing speed, and language. State-of-the-art speech recognition algorithms allow for verbal responses by the user for self-assessment and navigation. As a result, patients with motor skill impairment will be able to self-administer the test battery more easily. During the first phase of this SBIR project, Creare has demonstrated the feasibility of our proposed SANAB with a verbal memory task that uses speech recognition to interpret the response of the user with sufficient accuracy to enable likely identification of cognitive impairment.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:This proposal presents tasks leading to an integrated flight test of a structural health monitoring (SHM) system to monitor damage in the C-5 aircraft material with minimal manual intervention. During Phase I, MDC focused on the design of a sensor hardware for SHM that makes use of a distributed infrastructure.  The original Phase II effort focused on the fabrication and testing of a prototype of this SHM infrastructure.  During this Phase II extension, MDC seeks to mature, integrate and test this SHM system on the C-5.  Tasks will focus on sensor placement optimization, algorithm calibration for these locations, a probability of detection assessment, airworthiness assessment, and an integration exercise.  This work will follow the appropriate MIL standards, including 810G, 461G and 1823A. Finally, the program will end in an integrated flight test demonstration to include multiple different sensing technologies and a ground station with user interface.  The goal of the project is to be in a position to be able to conform to ASIP standards at the conclusion to be used as an alternative means of compliance for conventional NDI methods.BENEFIT:Once successfully demonstrated through a Phase II effort, there exists a broad commercial market for this SHM method.  One of the key success factors for this technology is its versatility; the ability not only to be integrated into new applications, but to be retrofitted into an existing asset designs. The continuum crack gauge could be applied to composite or metallic structure, be used to find new damage, track existing damage growth, or be applied as part of a bonded repair to check effectiveness in crack arrest. Initial relevant markets would include DoD fixed-wing aircraft, but the technology could easily proliferate into any DoD asset, ranging from rotorcraft to ships and ground vehicles, to aid in condition based maintenance. Once demonstrated in defense applications, comparable commercial opportunities exist, particularly for aircraft and potentially buildings and civil infrastructure once the production cost has been driven low enough.  MDC will work through strategic partners to license the technology for production and deployment.",

Inert projectiles offer significant logistical and safety advantages over conventional chemical propellants or explosive ordnances. The launch conditions of future hypersonic projectiles will put extreme mechanical and aerothermal loads on the projectile nosetip. These conditions combined with the high-density requirements present a significant materials challenge. No economical monolithic component is projected to survive the extreme conditions immediately after projectile launch, followed by less severe conditions during flight to target. The objective of a Phase II effort is to further the development of multi-layered nosetip concepts. This concept is based on a dense W core with outermost sacrificial layer that is intended to dissipate absorbed thermal energy from aerothermal loading, thereby limiting steep thermal gradients in the underlying refractory material(s). The team of Plasma Processes, MR&D and St. Croix Research will seek to build on Phase I efforts by optimizing materials selection, thermo-structural models, nosetip geometries, and fabrication techniques. At the conclusion of the base Phase II effort, nosetip specimens will be fabricated for testing in relevant arc jet environments.

        "abstract": "The inability to effectively share intelligence products is at best hindering warfighter ability and at worst unnecessarily putting them in harms way. DCGS-A intelligence producing nodes must be able to securely and seamlessly share intelligence with Special Operation Forces and other DCGS communities. ISR products containing actionable intelligence are isolated preventing others from making effective use of them. Additionally, current manual processes for security classification and verification cannot keep up with the flow of information. As a result, products can be miss-marked, over classified or contain out of date security markings. This severely impacts sharing of information with joint and coalition partners. Securboration is developing the DIB Product Redaction capability (Pro-Dact), an innovative tool for redacting and filtering DDMS metacards and the intelligence products they reference. Pro-Dact will leverage existing Army redaction services combined with innovative Securboration technology to automatically redact/filter and assist with correct security metadata marking.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The ultimate goal of this SBIR is to provide the Air Force and more specifically, the Distributed Mission Operations  Space (DMO-S) community, with a way to connect the DMO Network to multiple AFSPC simulated operational environments to support DMO-S exercise activities.  Sonalysts plans to develop a DMO to Standard Space Trainer (SST) Gateway to integrate each SST plug-in to support DMO-S global exercises.  The Phase II will build upon the Phase I proof-of-concept software and produce a Phase II DS Gateway prototype to fulfill AFRLs requirements.  The Sonalysts team will produce a prototype of the proposed solution, perform testing in a representative end-user environment, and perform a feasibility review of the system design.  Upon completion of the project, Sonalysts will produce a Final Report documenting the research and deliver the prototype software and associated documentation detailed in the deliverables section in Volume 2.  BENEFIT:  To enable a unified and interconnected view between DMO and SST environments mandates the need for tools and technologies that homogenize data elements.  This is same barrier being tackled by framework research conducted in the areas of Enterprise Application Integration (EAI), Model Driven Interoperability (MDI), Model Driven Engineering (MDE), and Model Driven Message Interoperability (MDMI).  One aspect of each of these fields of research is the interchange or loose coupling of information.  Ongoing research and this proposed gateway-translator seek to exploit a fusion of abstract representations of syntax, semantics, and rules.  In each of the approaches, the context or semantics (includes the actual data-value) of the data elements within a communication protocols structure provides the more significant factors influencing the message translation (e.g., selection) and transformation processes.  To that end, an overarching design goal of the proposed gateway-translator is to semantically unify communications by acting as the go-between or broker between DMO and SST-based simulations.   By using configurable semantics to focus on the organization of and action upon data elements, this knowledge aids in determining the appropriate transformation of structure and value. Additionally, while prototyping such a middleware strategy, the approach must consider performance impacts due to the additional determination, translation, and transformation overhead (e.g., processing time and memory).  A successful Phase II effort will provide a foundation upon which the Phase II prototype can transition to a Phase III production system.  Upon successful completion of Phase II, Sonalysts plans on commercializing this technology into DoD programs like Concurrent Test, Training, and Operations (CTTO), Distributed Multi-Echelon Training System (DMETS), and Command and Control/Battle Management Communications (C2BMC) by demonstrating the feasibility of the Gateway concept across available systems within the DMON and large defense prime contractors.  Concurrently, Sonalysts will focus our marketing efforts with the respective Air Force, Navy, and Army exercise programs.",

        "abstract": "This topic addresses the problem of robustly commanding and controlling unmanned ground vehicles operating in complex, unstructured environments. Current approaches to this task rely on dense scene reconstruction from a variety of sensor data such as LIDAR and video imagery. Scene representations are then relayed to a remote human operator who provides commands at varying levels of supervisory control (intelligent teleoperation).    Challenges arise in scenarios where the available communication link allows only low bandwidth data transmission and/or exhibits high latency.  In such scenarios, bandwidth limitations prevent rich scene representations from being transmitted from the vehicle to the operator in a timely manner.  In addition, high latency may have a destabilizing effect, causing commands issued by the operator to lead to unsafe actions by the vehicle.  This effect is exacerbated as the frequency of command inputs increases.    Novel frameworks, and associated algorithms, are required to enable robust operations of autonomous unmanned ground vehicles operating in complex, unstructured environments, over a low-bandwidth, high latency communication link. Such approaches would provide an operator with sufficient information to make timely command and control decisions, even in harsh communication scenarios. They would also provide contingency-based assurance of system safety in the absence of timely command and control decisions. In addition, other functional relationships such as sensor costs need to be addressed since these costs are generally proportional to the level of autonomy or intelligence.     Approaches to this problem may emphasize perception, vehicle control, or some combination of the two. In the perception domain, approaches to intelligent data compression and minimal scene representation are desired [1]. Such approaches may condense raw sensor data into compact, human-recognizable primitives that can be efficiently transmitted over low-bandwidth communication links. These methods may be optimized for particular contexts (e.g. urban operations) to enable improved data compression, and they may also dynamically vary scene representation richness or complexity depending on available bandwidth.     In the control domain, contingency-based control algorithms that ensure vehicle safety in the absence of operator inputs, or when provided with unsafe command inputs (perhaps due to the effects of latency) are desired. Again, such approaches may be optimized for particular contexts to enable improved performance. Methods that act as vehicle co-pilots, which both ensure vehicle safety and attempt to predict operator intent, would be particularly useful [2].    The output of this work is software that would be integrated with an existing autonomous vehicle(s) to yield measureable improvements in safety and operational speed compared to a baseline system, for the low-bandwidth, high-latency scenarios of interest.

Further, conventional thermal batteries require activation via the firing of an explosive squib, the reliability of which is of common concern.  In response to the need for TDACS energy storage systems with increased performance and reliability as compared to thermal batteries, Solid Power proposes to continue efforts in Phase I towards the development of an all solid-state battery that possesses substantially high specific energy, low self-discharge, rechargeability and form-factor flexibility.  Further, unlike conventional thermal batteries Solid Powers solid-state rechargeable batteries do not require activation thereby reducing system complexity (i.e., cost) and improving system reliability.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the creation of commercial viability for 3-D printing unique ceramic structures by transforming 3-D printing of advanced ceramics into mass-production additive manufacturing. This will be a new capability for the US. The 3-D structures being considered can't be easily made with traditional manufacturing techniques but have significant advantages over traditionally manufactured geometries. If 3-D printed structures could be manufactured economically, the societal impact could be tremendous ranging from creation of hundreds of US manufacturing jobs to reduction in CO2 emissions. Commercially viable products that can improve existing markets and enable new markets are realistic expectations. Structures for improved filtration, catalytic production of clean fuels, H2 reformers, emission controls for stationary fuel cells, and CO2 sequestration have been inspired by Other Equipment Manufacturers and are already being jointly developed as a result of Phase I progress. Interestingly, these products and more could be produced from the same product lines just by changing a computer program. This great efficiency of infrastructure is a fortunate trait of additive manufacturing. In short, this project will position Robocasting Enterprises as a US exporter into world-wide markets for economic and societal benefit. This project is based on foundational technology called robocasting for 3-D printing ceramic materials. Robocasting is an additive technique demonstrated to be useful for rapid fabrication of ceramics into advanced lattice structures for enhanced filtration and catalytic performance. However, robocast products have been largely limited to products with dimensions less than 2 inches because of problems related to cracking. The goal of this project is to make additive manufacturing much more commercially viable for ceramics by: (a) overcoming the technical challenges for robocasting large ceramic parts and; (b) designing and implementing a scaled-up manufacturing line commercially competitive with traditional manufacturing processes and production from low-wage countries. To achieve these goals; materials, processes, and equipment improvements are required. Developments will include: 1) material innovations to reduce cracking in large ceramic bodies; 2) processing innovations to reduce cracking in large ceramic bodies; 3) equipment and automation innovations to increase production rates. At the end of Phase II it is anticipated that rapid manufacturing of large (i.e., 5-10 inch) advanced ceramic lattice structures will be demonstrated to be commercially viable and penetration into several markets will be significant. The technology will be perfectly poised for investment from larger companies and Phase III growth.",

        "abstract": "Rainbow Organic Farms Co., DBA Good Natured Family Farms, proposes to establish The Good Natured Food Campus - a local food aggregator, wholesale distributor and value-added facility of locally-grown food from small/mid-sized farms, to be located in the heart of the Northside Regeneration Plan Community in North St. Louis, MO.The Food Campus will address the fresh-food needs of a vulnerable population in an impoverished food desert, and incentivize local small and mid-sized farmers to grow and sell more products locally - thereby strengthening the sustainability of the local farming community.The City of St Louis is ranked as one of the nation&#39;s leading areas in critical food shortage - it is nearly impossible for the underserved community of North St. Louis to access local, healthy, and affordable food; 25.7% of households with children are struggling with food security and hunger issues daily.On the other hand, in 2010, Missouri ranked second in the country for number of farms (108,000). However, the availability of locally produced fresh foods in Missouri is limited due to the lack of production of fresh market fruit and vegetables and a scarcity of facilities able to clean, process, repack, and market fresh foods. Another compelling reason for the unavailability of locally produced fresh foods in Missouri is that local food producers face market-access challenges, such as:SupplyMost farmers don&#39;t grow enough to consistently or adequately supply larger distribution channelsMost farmers are unable to compete with agri-businessInsuranceMost farmers can&#39;t afford to meet costly liability requirements of food merchandising and food service purchasersPackagingRequirements often too costly and sometimes too difficult to meet on a small farm or at a small enterpriseLogisticsShipping to many customers is not efficient or economicalThe Good Natured Food Campus, along with the recruitment and mentoring of local farmers into a large Farmer Alliance network will help to negate these obstacles and would enable even the smaller farmers to participate in selling their products. Local small/mid-sized farmers will have increased income through new revenue streams through membership in the Farmers Alliance.The Farmers Alliance will enable farmers to consolidate sales, packing and transportation, incur lower risks with higher profits - and will become GAP Certified (Good Agricultural Practices) which will enable them to pursue sales to large grocers. GAP Certification is a requirement of grocers, but many farmers are in the dark on how to proceed with this program. The Food Campus and the Farmers Alliance will mentor farmers to get them up to speed to meet the GAP requirements, ensure food safety, and promote and encourage sustainability of local farm enterprises.The outcome of including more farmers in the Good Natured Family Farms Alliance is increased income for sustainable farms, increased land value, beginner farmers joining the farming industry, and local, fresh food availability will thwart natural and man-made disasters. Growth in the local foods industry could support more young people who stay on the farm - or come back to the farm after college - to carry on the family business.The vulnerable, underserved population in the inner-city of North St. Louis is the other targeted audience group that the Food Campus will assist. This area is impoverished and lacks any resource for fresh, local food. The Food Campus will be established in the middle of this area and will focus on wholesale food distribution and EBT food programs that will help stretch the food dollar of the families who rely on food assistance. Missouri Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) is the method by which households receive and use Food Stamp benefits. According to the USDA, the percentage of EBT users in St. Louis City is 36%, compared to 14.3% of Americans nationwide who relied on food stamps in March, 2011.The Food Campus will build strategic community",

In addition to substantially reducing the CSWAP, enhanced capability of electronic steering will also be added to the module by including GaN phase shifter MMICs in-line with the power amplifiers.

High power, superconducting electron linear accelerators represent a new method of producing highly focused electron beams (Ebeams). These instruments have exciting applications in the area of free electron lasers and directed energy weapons, but are costly and currently only useful in small, highly-specialized markets. Using these high energy Ebeams for materials processing opens up additional markets for these instruments and in turn lower their manufacturing costs. In Phase I, Mainstream identified several materials processes that could be uniquely improved by the use of Ebeam treatment. In an initial Phase II, a new type of superconducting electron linear accelerator was procured in order to demonstrate the economical production of diamond copper composite heat spreaders. This subsequent Phase II will enable this Ebeam to also be demonstrated in the fabrication of copper indium gallium selenide nanocrystal films for advanced solar cells. Additionally, this Phase II will facilitate the commissioning of an advanced manufacturing facility at Mainstream, with the Ebeam as the centerpiece. The resulting Ebeam facility will establish a marketplace for these highly specialized Ebeams as well as produce several exciting new materials at the pilot-scale with both military and commercial applications.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  This proposal is aimed at the development of an electrical conductor that is lighter weight and has  two- to three-times higher current carrying ability per weight when compared to rated copper (Cu) or aluminum (Al) wires for Air force applications. Our approach will be to generate a carbon nanotube/Cu composite using a metallized carbon nanotube forest. We will explore carbon nanotube forests grown on substrates and later removed. The carbon nanotubes will be fabricated into a paper where the carbon nanotubes will be aligned. The carbon nanotube paper will then be metalized by electroplating process to form carbon nanotube wire and strip composites. The composites will then be tested for conductivity and ampacity. The objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of a carbon nanotube/Cu composite which will target the best combined conductor properties for Air Force (AF) applications, combining high electrical current per weight, electrical conductivity, flexibility, mechanical strength, and stability using a scalable and affordable fabrication method.  BENEFIT:  The results of this work can lead to the development of high ampacity conductors for Air Force applications, in particular, lightweight electric wires and cables, but the work can be applicable to much larger capacity conductors (for large power transport) as well as much smaller capacity, for electronics applications. For the Air force needs, the key aspects are in size and weight reductions in the final aircraft, leading to fuel saving and efficiency. The other commercial applications are electrical wiring for the Power Industry (transformers, fault current limiters, generators, and motors), and Transportation (ships, trains, and automobiles).",

The tool set combines dynamic test tools (test management, test suite quality measurement, automated test generation) and static program analysis tools (code compliance checking, tools that find program flaws and vulnerabilities, automated code summarization, and automated checking of the consistency of code and requirements). These tools can operate standalone, but ANTSS also integrates them with the SysML modeling layer that underpins requirements management and modeling tools. A centralized location for all requirements, test results, and analysis results enables easy assessment and reporting of the thoroughness of requirements and their validation. The project will use many existing, openly available tools directly, will enhance others, and will incorporate current research in some areas (automated test generation, function summarization, and consistency checking). The ANTSS framework will be implemented as command-line tools and in the Eclipse IDE. The overall goal is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of code understanding and verification by automating processes that are either mundane or require detailed analysis, serving as an assistant to human review and system understanding.BENEFIT:The ANTSS project will improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of software verification and validation, both for independent V&V of already built software and during conventional software development projects.

Furthermore tools that measure test suite quality, check software compliance with programming language style and restrictions, or find program vulnerabilities or potential safety flaws will be integrated with one another. Finally, ANTSS will include state-of-the-art techniques for software summarization, checking consistency of code and formal requirements, and automated test generation. These technologies will assist the human reviewer by providing detailed logical analysis of software in a way that complements human insight and understanding.  ANTSS will be commercialized using GrammaTech?s standard product development processes and personnel, as has been done for other successful research transitions in the past.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  A program to build, test, and demonstrate an air-to-ground free-space optical communications (FSOC) system is proposed. The program is targeted toward the need to transmit surveillance and other data from tactical airborne platforms to the ground. Current data capabilities in this area are limited by either satcom availability/expense or by TCDL data rates and bandwidth allocation issues. The program pairs existing FSOC terminals with existing airborne and ground gimbals. RF and beacon cueing will be used for rapid acquisition. No major new hardware or software elements will be developed. Any new such elements will be for system and network configuration, gimbal mounting of the optical antenna and cueing hardware, aircraft installation, and test support. The program will demonstrate that FSOC hardware and software is now mature enough to support broad fielding of affordable FSOC downlink systems with no high-risk or high-dollar development efforts required. The program includes a flight test to demonstrate acquisition, tracking, and data transfer in a realistic operating environment. Performance data will be collected, analyzed, and reported as deliverable to the project.  BENEFIT:  An air-to-ground FSOC system provides a real-time data off-load path for a large range of sensor platforms, including the deployment of multi-sensor payloads for wide-area persistent surveillance. Such a multi-sensor airborne system would have many high-value applications, including security, emergency response, search and rescue, reconnaissance, and crime-scene investigation. Security applications, for instance, include event security (sporting events, parades, inaugurations, public marches and protests), border and coastal patrol, and port and harbor security. Emergency response applications include situational monitoring and assessment of areas affected by terrorist events, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, and large-scale fires. Any application that uses airborne sensors now could potentially benefit from the increase in sensor coverage offered by the system. Along those lines, potential customers include all the military branches, border patrol, coast guard, and port security agencies, FEMA and its international equivalents, and state and local law enforcement agencies. As the system maturity increases and prices fall, news gathering agencies might also be potential customers.",

Over a five-year period, the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) will prohibit the sale of a majority of existing log wood based hydronic heaters that are used for central heating. As large consumers of wood heat, small and midsize farms are adversely affected by these stricter regulations, significantly more expensive appliances, and the diminished number of products available. Bridging from a successful Phase 1 program where the SBIR Technology reduced particulate matter measured in g/hr by 75 percent, the Phase 2 research program will remove the artificial boundaries of the controlled laboratory environment where the technology was exposed to a fraction of the variables seen in a rural, real-world environment. The Phase 2 research will monitor the real-time performance of the SBIR technology in an environment that will expose it to the full spectrum of unknowns - i.e. operating conditions, fuel quality, demand situation(s), and installation - enabling the research team to more fully evaluate the viability, the impact on cost or maintenance of the appliance, and propose improvements to the technology based on its true operating environment. The project aligns with the current and future EPA mandate to reduce wood smoke in rural markets, while preserving the freedom for rural and farm operators to use the readily available log wood fuel source to heat their homes and businesses.",

By providing expanded and enhanced data acquisition capability, significantly reduced turnaround time, and streamlined operation for the end user, MSIs AWCS technology will improve the current arena testing process significantly. Arena tests are performed to gain realistic knowledge of the unique damage mechanisms of different warheads, which are due to the synergistic blast and fragment effects that result when a warhead has been detonated. Arena test data of a broader scope yet with increased detail and sufficient accuracy, when applied effectively in an iterative warhead design process, will engender greater warhead efficacy and will reduce the collateral damage potential of the warheads. Once the AWCS technology has been developed appropriately and has been implemented, the advantages which will be gained over the present state-of-the-art in warhead characterization will lead to greater overall economy, higher throughput, and increased overall accuracy for the warhead characterizations which will be accomplished in the future.",

In order to have humans collaborate effectively with autonomous systems, improved interfaces and interaction techniques, and frameworks of interaction must be developed that allow for a common perception of the goals, constraints, resources, and other variables relevant to the teams overarching objective.  Tools that allow for improved transparency into the machines reasoning, human-machine interfaces that allow for more natural and flexible interaction and shared decision making, and information/decision frameworks that provide cognitively matched human-machine situational awareness would all support more effective and trusted human-machine teaming.  Development of better measures of human trust or measures of the accuracy of shared human-machine perception would also facilitate improved teaming.",

        "abstract": "Military Environmental Control Units (ECUs) are one of the greatest consumers of electric energy in forward operating bases (FOBs). Microchannel condensers have replaced tube-fin coils in both military ECUs and commercial air conditioners to improve system efficiency. Flow into the condenser is single-phase superheated vapor and therefore uniform flow distribution through multiple parallel microchannel arrays is easily achieved. Manufacturers are interested in exploiting the same benefits by replacing the tube-fin evaporator coil with a microchannel heat exchanger. However, flow into the evaporator is a saturated mixture of liquid and vapor refrigerant, typically at a thermodynamic quality of 0.1  0.4, and therefore two-phase flow distribution through a multitude of parallel microchannels can be very non-uniform.In this proposal, Mainstream presents a solution to achieve uniform two-phase distribution in a microchannel evaporator. Proof of concept was demonstrated in Phase I, and refinement of the technology and integration into existing military products will occur in Phase II.",

To overcome these limitations, we propose to develop and demonstrate a high-throughput, non-invasive, microfluidic stem cell analyzer to enable a rapid isolation of high-quality stem cell products from clinically relevant samples. Our technology enables significant improvements in processing time, automation, cell integrity, and logistical burden and cost, and opens a new possibility for interaoperative therapeutics. In the initial effort, key technology components were successfully developed. Device design, microfabrication, and experimental test were all undertaken to demonstrate microfluidic cell sorting and impedance characterization of stem cell differentiation, which markedly enhances TRL of the technology. This proposed effort will focus along two directions. First, a novel cell sorter will be developed to address challenges associated with clinical samples, such as large volume, high cell contents, target cell rarity, etc. Design optimization, fabrication refinement, and experimental characterization will be carried out to establish feasibility of the non-culture based stem cell isolation. Second, the sorter will be integrated with COTS component technologies for automated operation to improve GMP-readiness of the technology. The functionality of stem cell isolation will be extensively demonstrated using various pre-clinical samples, e.g., bone marrow, adipose, skin etc. A multi-disciplinary team with experience in all aspects of the proposed effort including microfluidics, stem cell bioengineering, regenerative medicine, and systems engineering has been assembled to ensure successful completion of project milestones.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Maintaining the efficacy of military plans is difficult, yet critical. A plan may become irrelevant because the world has diverged from the plans assumptions; if there are changes to many related plans, they may become incoherent, unable to generate well-synchronized and coordinated operations. The Adaptive Planning process partly addresses this problem through cyclical, collaborative plan review and maintenance. However, to fully address this problem, the military needs a highly-automated and effective system that continuously maintains living plans in response to rapidly changing conditions. Charles River Analytics proposes to implement and evaluate a system for plan Coherence and Relevance Monitoring and Adjustment (CARMA) to provide an affordable, open, and extensible solution to help generate and maintain living plans. To create this system, we will develop: (1) a sophisticated catalog that represents plan elements (e.g., goals, assets, terrain) and their relationships (e.g., supported, supporting, and collateral) across time and space; (2) monitoring and analysis algorithms that can automatically guide Warfighters to adapt plans to changes that threaten plan coherence or relevance; and (3) an information extraction and routing service that grounds the living plan process in accurate, complete, and timely information.  BENEFIT:  The research performed under this effort will have immediate benefit to the Air Operations Center Weapon System (AOC WS) across multiple regional and functional AOCs. Specifically, it will increase the productivity of current planners as it allows them to attend to the most significant implications of changes in the operating environment, thereby increasing plan quality as planners spend more time thinking creatively and collaboratively. It will also improve force effectiveness as forces will go into battle with plans that achieve effective unity of effort. These benefits will apply across air, maritime, ground, and space domains. This research will also enhance our commercial AgentWorks software development kit for deploying hybrid computational reasoning into an enterprise.",

Triton systems working with key suppliers and subject matter experts is developing an innovative screen which can be electro-optically modulated in reflectance over an 11:1 range. In Phase I, key requirements were verified for optical characteristics, compatibility with night vision optics, speed and temperature range of operation. In Phase II a full scale prototype adaptive dome will be constructed, tested and delivered to AFRL for evaluation..  BENEFIT:Immersive simulation training is increasingly deployed throughout DOD and as part of a rapidly growing worldwide commercial training industry.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The structural design community regard materials models as fixed inputs to a finite element-based design process, using materials lookup tables to provide data from experimental and/or simulations performed by others. However the accuracy of multiscale materials modeling has improved significantly over the last few decades, yet these simulations have seen little application in structural design. The project will change the paradigm by which structural design tools in finite element modeling operate by providing an interface to materials simulations, extending them to make use of simulation data, and adding support for location specific properties in single parts. These tools will enable designs that make use of materials science and engineering (processing, microstructure and performance) in the finite element model, independently triggering simulations as required, providing a smart caching strategy, to facilitate pervasive solutions that accommodate a range of structural materials. These tools will enable more efficient designs that leverage the latest advances in materials engineering, giving designers the ability to seamlessly draw on the most accurate information at every stage of design, validation and production. Integrated approaches using existing commercial tools will result structural designs making the best use of material properties.  BENEFIT:  The proposed work will offer commercial applications across many sectors, including manufacturers of aerospace components, medical devices, and automotive parts. Currently, these manufacturers are limited by their ability to design precision parts, resulting in inefficient design and use of expensive techniques for entire parts. The proposed work directly addresses this issue, and would result in a paradigm shift, from whole-part design based on standard material properties tables to the use of actual variables in dynamic, active material design The open-source framework will enable designers to move beyond materials as fixed design inputs to active variables that can be manipulated as part of the structural design process, ultimately leading to structural design driving the materials requirements. With the ability to explore material properties and compositions, and adjust parameters to accommodate specific requirements, designers will able to use these insights to improve designs. Examples of such modifications are increases to part life, or reductions in weight without compromising the structural integrity of the part.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop and commercialize novel high-performance green composites for the exterior building materials market. These materials can address a $30 billion market opportunity with broad applications in many industries, including construction, automotive, defense, energy infrastructure, etc. This phase II effort will focus on developing exterior building materials with an estimated commercial potential of $882 million over the next five years. In addition, this new class of sustainable composites will provide multiple broader impacts including 1) significant weight and cost reductions to enable their use in structural components and fuel efficient vehicles; 2) improved water and ultraviolet (UV) resistance over conventional materials for green buildings that optimize the indoor environmental quality with lower maintenance costs; 3) stronger building materials and safer vehicle panels due to the high vibration damping and impact resistance of these composites; 4) the use of renewable resources for sustainable materials production to achieve energy and environmental efficiency; and 5) potential LEED credits and/or tax rebates to end users. The technical goal of this Phase II program is to determine full-scale production parameters, performance specifications, and quality control procedures for lightweight and high strength natural fiber composites to prepare for commercialization of these products for exterior building materials use. Two prototype products have been successfully developed through the Phase I effort to address the high cost and low durability of current building materials (e.g. plywood, fiber cement board) in these markets. The specific technical objectives of this program include determining the flexural rigidity of the composites through modeling and experimental work, optimizing product performance and cost, determining full-scale production parameters and quality control procedures, and conducting service life characterization of the final products. The technical results of this program will enable the production of a new class of green composites to create sustainable building materials, and provide a stronger value proposition to end users in the exterior building market.",

        "abstract": "DoD is currently using active sensors (LADAR and RADAR) to support terrain following to avoid enemy RADAR. Digital Elevation Maps are also used but the associated inaccuracies limit the minimum safe operating altitude to greater than 500 ft. DoD applications require 100% passive, day/night obstacle detection and avoidance for the use of UAS operating in combat arenas. The meet these requirements, OKSI (teaming with Georgia Institute of Technology) is developing the Stereo Obstacle Avoidance Rig (SOAR).SOAR utilizes a single forward-looking camera combined with real-time Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms to produce 3D visualizations of the terrain. The 3D information is converted to a point cloud and fed to the obstacle avoidance and route planning software that autonomously maneuvers to avoid obstacles while maintaining low al-titude and arriving at the desired destination. The ultimate goal of the SOAR program is to develop robust hardware and algorithms for low light, passive terrain sensing. The SOAR system will provide the Navy, other DoD agencies, and even consumers with a solution for real-time obstacle avoidance for large and small airborne platforms.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II proposal will design and develop a reactive nanofiber based heating, ventilation, and airconditioning (HVAC) air filter to capture corrosion inducing particulate matter (PM) and dissolved ions present in coastal region air.  Nanoparticle-polymer will be combined to produce high surface area reactive nanofiber filtermedia.  The performance of media will be tailored by controlling fiber diameter, porosity of the media, pore size, and nanoparticle type and loading.  The filtermedia will be characterized for its filtration performance, resistance to airflow, dust holding capacity, and ion exchange capacity.  The filter media will be used to assemble prototype high surface area mini-pleat filter.  The filter will be tested per American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), Underwriters Laboratory (UL) and Mil-Spec Standards.  Successful filter design will be tested at test sites to study corrosion, energy, and overall cost reduction.  The filter will remove solid particulates and dissolved salt ions from air stream and provide cleaner air under extreme environment.  The corrosion inducing salt PM will be removed via mechanical filtration and dissolved salt ions via reactive ion exchange chemistry.  Filtration performance, airflow resistance, dust loading, and ion exchange capacity of filter along with energy use and labor cost will allow us to determine life cycle cost of innovative filters in operational environment.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Building upon its successful effort to identify grain structures in titanium alloys, in Phase II, TRI/Austin will use a combination of highly focused polyvinylidene floride (PVDF) ultrasonic (UT) transducers and high gain amplifiers to perform ultrasonic backscattering measurements to identify signals corresponding to the grain structure in commercially pure Ti and Ti-6Al-4V. TRI/Austin will partner with the Advanced Manufacturing Center at the University of Texas at Austin to fabricate highly characterized pure Ti and Ti-6Al-4V specimens containing specially designed and tailored microstructures. Additionally, Dr. Paul Panetta of Applied Research Associates, Inc. will leverage previous work on grain sizing in Ni superalloys to provide consulting on backscatter measurements in Ti. TRI will use its customized UT facilities to perform backscatter attenuation, fast Fourier transform, and phase-to-peak measurements and analyses to identify the microstructures and construct attenuation vs. grain size curves for the Ti alloys. Additionally, the TRI team will investigate the abilities of the UT system to identify different crystal orientations and structures, as identified in the specimens using scanning electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction. The effort will culminate in the fabrication of a prototype UT system that will demonstrate inspection capabilities on a component/part of the sponsors choice.  BENEFIT:  Ultrasonic systems, such as the one proposed in this work are non-contacting, safe, and are a widely adopted means to perform non-destructive inspections in many industries. The ability to be able to inspect a component and quantify the grains on the surface (including the size, shape, micro-texturing, etc.) is invaluable to the end user of the component. In the case of the Air Force, the proposed technology will assist in ensuring better part quality, tighter controls on the inspection intervals and life predictions, and better supplier and manufacturing controls. Additionally, quantified C-scan images and datasets will fit neatly into the Air Forces Digital Twin initiatives to digitize inspection records, CAD files, repairs, etc associated with each individual airframe. This technology is also capable of supporting Air Force sustainment efforts through the scanning of disassembled components that are periodically inspected in the depots. Other potential adopters of this technology would include any military branch operating jet engine aircraft.     Industry has also expended effort in such a UT technology capability. Raw material manufacturers are pushing the boundaries of metallurgy by making materials containing larger and larger grain sizes to increase the structural properties of these materials. Relationships do not exist to provide a means of comparing the UT signal from the inspection of Ti parts to the grain size. This relationship is very important, because if the grains grow excessively large, the reflected UT signal will continue to increase and potentially reach the same level as that of a void, inclusion, or other defect, rendering the material un-inspect-able, meaning it cannot be quality certified for sale or use. This is important not only to the aerospace industry, but to others such as semiconductor manufacturers where the grain size and a lack of a presence of voids are key to the usability of the part.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to advance the state of knowledge and industrial practice toward cleaner, cheaper, greener steel and stainless steel. The project will focus on the production of iron, part of a $1.1 trillion annual market worldwide, and ferrochromium, a $2.2 billion worldwide annual market. Molten oxide electrolysis with an inert anode has been demonstrated at the laboratory scale to produce low-carbon iron and ferroalloys, which are the basis of many high-performance steels. The current low-carbon metals sell at a premium. Published cost models show that both the capital and operating cost of MOE will be lower than competing technologies already in the marketplace. MOE can also reduce the environmental impact of producing these metals, even with today's electricity, and can produce even greater improvements with renewable energy. In summary, MOE will produce primary metals of higher quality at a lower cost and with lower environmental impact than current methods. The objective of this Phase II research project is to develop a cheaper, more energy efficient route to production of important metals including iron and ferrochromium. Economical separation of these metals from their ores by molten oxide electrolysis (MOE) is enabled by the recent invention of an inert anode material. The essential next step in understanding the behavior of the new inert anode in MOE is longer-duration testing than was possible in the laboratory cell. This test can only be achieved at a larger scale. The models and testing on surrogate systems in Phase I have shown the way to provide this long-duration testing in Phase II. These tests will point the way toward industrial-scale production of iron and ferrochromium by MOE.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project derives from the fact that increasing the reliability and robustness of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) will directly increase their adoption in real world applications. CPS technology is directly applicable to a broad range of sectors, including utility grids, smart buildings, manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, etc. These sectors account for more than $32.3 trillion in economic activity, with the potential to grow to $82 trillion by 2025 - about one half of the global economy. CPSs are thus critical to the national interest in areas such as manufacturing competitiveness, defense, health care, energy production and usage, and disaster monitoring and recovery. Due to the increasing reliance on CPSs in the future, system defects could have drastic consequences. The proposed technology could significantly improve reliability of CPSs by catching defects before they result in significant loss, outages, or failures. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop an efficient remote monitoring and diagnostic software system to detect and diagnose software defects in cyber-physical systems (CPSs). CPSs have the potential to bring about a revolution in efficiency, robustness, and safety in application domains such as smart utility grids and smart healthcare. To unleash their potential, CPSs must themselves be robust. However, despite state-of-the-art testing, software defects currently do escape into deployed CPSs. Current state-of-practice monitoring and diagnostic systems cannot improve the situation as they were not designed with the constraints of CPSs in mind, which include real-time execution, unreliable links, and resource constrained processors. The proposed technology is aimed at creating a software system capable of monitoring embedded nodes in CPSs for anomalies and providing detailed execution information to quickly diagnose the software defects responsible for any anomalies. The proposed work extends the company&#39;s extensive research in efficient collection of information for diagnosing software defects. The company expects to create a monitoring and diagnostic software system for CPSs and demonstrate its effectiveness on existing software defects in CPSs.\n",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enhance global food security. Aquaculture is the fastest growing agroindustry while the world fisheries catch has leveled out. Consequently, half of all seafood consumed today is farmed. Unfortunately, at least 30% of fish feed is derived from forage fish, the anchovy and sardine-types at the base of the food chain. With demand for forage fish growing while wild populations remain level at best, the price of fish meal and oil (FM&0) climbs by 15% yearly. Clearly, dependence on FM&O is unsustainable. For fish farmers to thrive without abusing the oceanic ecosystem, substitutes are essential. One solution is to use vegetable-based ingredients such as wheat and soy, but these lack vital omega-3 fatty acids. Another is to turn to the insect world, especially by culturing ecofriendly black soldier fly larvae (BSFL). The larvae are fed seafood residuals mixed with marine kelp and/or microalgae so that the natural omega-3 passes through. The larvae are dried and separated into FM&O-like meal and oil. The overarching question is: can this be accomplished competitively? Apparently it is possible, but a 2-year pilot plant is required to prove the practicality. The proposed project will not only demonstrate that very large volumes of BSFL can be cultured using omega-3 loaded wastes and algae, but that substitute fish feeds that are palatable, stimulate growth and confer health are feasible. This is best achieved by simultaneously conducting feeding trials with a variety of species, including isolated bottom dwellers such as black sea bass and, alternatively, schooling pelagic creatures such as California yellowtail. Observing degrees of palatability is straight forward. But as with any cuisine there are numerous ways to enhance the offering: live, dried or pelletized and, if the latter, unit size, moisture content and even some surface additive that confers a natural taste ? perhaps crab-like for black sea bass and squid-like for California yellowtail. Such refinements grant significant economic margins by virtue of better survival rates, shorter time in the tanks and less costly ingredients. At this local level, both the farmer and the consumer benefit while globally these gains can favorably impact food security, especially with marine species that only require saltwater, with recirculating system that discharge little or no waste and, of course, with substitute foodstuff derived from waste bio-remediated by flies.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is providing better attractants for the Asian Citrus Psyllid, Diaphorina citri. The attractants can be combined with control products such as Spinosad to generate improved bait-and-kill stations. D. citri vectors greening disease and is the most serious pest faced by the US citrus industry. The psyllid has severely affected Florida citrus production, and has spread to Texas and California, where citrus is a billion-dollar industry with a history dating back to the 19th century. However, current control approaches lack effective attractants for use in bait-and-kill stations and traps. The approach described uses rational design to isolate compounds that bind to critical psyllid chemosensory proteins, and then identifies thosecompounds capable of attracting psyllids. These novel attractants can then be incorporated into bait-and-kill stations containing a control product such as Spinosad. This project incorporates several innovative platform technologies comprising a high throughput assay system for rapidly identifying molecules that interact with insect chemosensory proteins. The project also involves the development of a novel bait-and-kill station intended specifically to attract D. citri to a control agent capable of limiting psyllid populations.The broader impacts of this project are platform technologies applicable to the development of control products for insect pest species of economic, agricultural, or medicinal significance. A bait-and-kill station enhanced with a highly efficient attractant will provide crucial psyllid population control, and no commercial psyllid attractant currently exists. There is thus a serious need by the US citrus industry for such a product.",

Standard four-gas detectors are grossly inadequate not only in terms of the limited information they can provide, but also due to severe operational and reliability problems as well as high operational and maintenance costs. \nWe will develop the detector by combining patent-pending chip-scale gas sensor technology with a low-cost PM detector module, resulting in an integrated solution for environmental threat monitoring. This microscale gas sensor technology relies on a nanophotocatalysts surface functionalization technique which allows for the detection of host of gases. Utilizing only a few sensor chips, small detectors capable of simultaneously monitoring multiple gases will be realized. These chip-scale microsensors are produced using highly-scalable microfabrication methods similar to those used in production of electronic integrated circuits, which are ideally-suited for low-cost mass-manufacturing. In addition, N5 will refine the sensor designs, introduce additional on-chip components for reliable field-operation, develop a robust manufacturing process, demonstrate the reliability metrics of these sensors, and develop three complete working prototype detectors. We will conduct field-testing of the completed handheld systems through various collaborations to gain insights into the operational, reliability, and maintenance issues, and explore strategies for seamless integration with the next-generation of incident command response and decision support systems.",

These modernized stages could require a Roll Control System (RCS) to be compatible with the existing MM III guidance set. During the SBIR Phase II program Valley Tech Systems will design, fabricate and test the new thruster technology that fills the technical gap for a detachable, affordable, sustainable RCS to be used on these modernized SRM stages.  BENEFIT:  Over the past several years Valley Tech Systems has developed advanced controllable solid propulsion technology that is directly applicable to a modernized GBSD MM III SRM stage Roll Control System design. Our Phase I SBIR program focused on applying these technologies to a long duration RCS thruster. The successful Phase I program featured RCS requirements analyses, conceptual RCS/Thruster design and successful hot fire testing of the thruster material technology. The result is a new thruster design that fills the technical gap for the next generation MMII booster RCS.

This device utilizes POC-developed components, COTS components, and new software applications. The innovation in highly-integrated packaging of electronics and secure communications and interoperability will enable SIWAP to add a uniform and consistent Iridium capability to various AFW sensors, and to make data more available to field users. In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of SIWAP by collecting data from a Kestrel weather device and demonstrating that the collected data appeared in the AFW enterprise. In Phase II, POC plans to develop the hardware to a higher TRL level, subject it to field testing and evaluation, and demonstrate the retrieval of local weather data and alerts. The developed software application running on a networked server will transmit simulated local weather data and alerts to the fielded hardware.; BENEFIT: Developing SIWAP as proposed to fulfill the AFWA requirements and produce it for use by the military will benefit our nations warfighters by giving them greater access to up-to-date weather data in regions where data was not previously available through the AFW enterprise. As a result, more accurate weather data will provide a critical resource for military operations. In the past, lives of warfighters have been lost in accidents such as helicopter crashes caused by a lack of accurate weather data. The benefits of having better weather data available from more areas on the ground, especially remote areas, will carry over to the private sector where business consists largely of the travel and transport industries, which can be affected by the weather. Travel and transport routes on land, sea, and air can be made more efficient and safer by knowing the weather conditions.",

In addition, the technology developed in this project could be utilized in other healthcare treatments such as skin and wound disinfection, decontamination of teeth and gums (oral hygiene), and the sterilization of medical instruments and implanted devices. Fungal nail infection rates are growing at an estimated 7% annually following both the general aging of the population and the rise in the incidence of diabetes. 50% of elderly over the age of 70 and 30% of all diabetics are affected. For many people, their infected nails are painful and embarrassing. Worst of all, diabetics with fungal nail infections are at increased risk for foot ulcerations, gangrene, and amputation. 38 million Americans suffer from nail fungal infections and spend over $3 billion dollars each year on treatments that are ineffective and sometimes unsafe. People suffering with nail fungal infections express widespread dissatisfaction with the limited success, side effects, high cost and inconvenience of current treatments. The proposed project will complete prototype development of a novel, safe, and effective treatment option for onychomycosis (nail fungal infection). The medical device will allow a doctor to fumigate the infected nail with gas because gas can penetrate the nail and kill the fungus where all other treatments cannot reach. The human toe nail lacks a blood supply to deliver optimal immune system protection to fight off fungal infections. This project will develop a device that converts the air above the surface of the toe nail into the same gases used by the immune system to fight infection. Hence, the gas treatment would safely mimic the normal blood supply of anti-microbial chemicals. This SBIR project will reduce technical development risks, improve the device usability by doctors, and establish the manufacturability of the device. Device prototypes will be validated in the laboratory and with users (Podiatrists). The clinical-ready prototypes developed during this project will be used in future clinical trials that will prove the efficacy and safety of the device needed to sell the product. The device promises to fulfill the unmet medical need for a safe and effective treatment option for the millions of Americans suffering with fungal infected nails.",

This innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding by leveraging the power of high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to provide a pathogen identification and surveillance tool with demonstrated efficacy against known and unknown infectious agents. This platform is fast, sensitive, and cost-effective, and can be used for any animal sample to detect virtually all possible microbes even microbes that have never before been characterized. Hundreds of samples can be rapidly screened without relying upon known genetic/genomic data of microbes. The global molecular diagnostics market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 14% from 2012 to 2017, with infectious disease testing being the leading application at 26% share, therefore the commercial opportunity of this project is vast.

In addition, this proposal seeks to develop a basal informatics infrastructure that together with sample preparation improvements will be conducive of scalable, high-throughput analysis of several samples. Current diagnostic methods rely on what is already known about target microbe genetics, and provide limited information in the form of presence/absence of a known target sequence. The SBIR Phase I was instrumental to lowering the technical risks associated with a high-throughput unbiased pathogen detection platform based on DNA sequencing and Bayesian statistics. In the pursue of standardizing and validating our metagenomics pathogen identification platform, this project proposes to: 1) improve viral detection capabilities and accuracy, 2) develop new functionalities, and 3) incorporate Phase I and Phase II advances into an integrated in-house web-accessible interface.",

Advancing the understanding of the role and function of tactile sensing in perception and manipulation is also essential if robots are to behave like humans. Studies have demonstrated that humans who cannot feel due to permanent disease or temporary anesthesia perform poorly in fine manipulation tasks (similar to even the best robotic systems without touch). The research proposed in this project is the next step to bring tactile sensing and sensory-motor intelligence to the next generation of robotics. The successful demonstration of a tactile sensor with perceptual similarity to the human fingertip would mark substantial progress in the field of telemanipulation, bringing the world one step closer to remote haptic perception. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to develop the world's first standard of human tactile perception. It has been proposed that tactile recognition presents a more difficult problem than vision and hearing, requiring not only intelligent sensory processing, but also intelligent algorithms to select and control movements, which have a tremendous influence on what is sensed. Artificial sensors that mimic the mechanical properties and sensitivity of the human fingertip have not existed until recently.

Limiting analysis to structured data ignores the massive amount of information in reports, memos, articles, and other written documents. Workers require information on past work and ongoing projects, best practices, current events and competitor and customer activities. However, companies with thousands of workers have millions of documents. It is prohibitively expensive to index them manually so that they can be found, analyzed and acted on. Moreover, overloaded workers do not have the time or training required to take on the task. The problem is exacerbated by mergers and acquisitions. In addition, over years, it is common for companies to accumulate large numbers of duplicate and out-of-date documents that workers do not take the time to rationalize and delete. The result is inflated storage costs and reduced productivity as workers struggle to find the relevant, up-to-date information. Inconsistent information governance also puts organizations at risk - litigation (retaining documents without legal or business value), safety (using out-of-date process safety management procedures) and operational (not leveraging best practices and lessons learned across the enterprise and beyond). This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the problem that text documents - especially those internal to an organization - are very difficult to locate and analyze unless they are classified and tagged. But manual classification and tagging are too expensive and inconsistent for large collections. Large companies store many millions of documents. And there is even more relevant information on the Web. The objective of the proposed research to is to provide software assistants that classify documents into pre-specified categories, add tags to describe what each document is about, and the entities named in the documents (e.g., oilfields). The assistants identify relevant documents and help people to learn of new developments by sending alerts when new documents of interest appear on the web or in the company's computers. The primary technical result will be a suite of software assistants that companies can adopt singly or as an ensemble to help manage information sustainably. These assistants build upon the proposed research to develop and integrate novel approaches to unsupervised machine learning, concept identification, and ontology construction. They will enable companies to overcome major problems, including overload, finding relevant, up-to-date information, analyzing unstructured information, and identifying unneeded documents for elimination.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development and commercialization of a new technology for non-invasive preclinical imaging. This platform technology will be used in studies of disease or in in drug development. The project will further develop and validate an imaging platform based on three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound, which is a low cost, high-throughput alternative to existing whole-body imaging modalities, and will provide more sensitivity and field of view than current two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound approaches. The technology developed will reduce costs of whole-body preclinical imaging, and enable access to this technology to smaller research organizations. Increased availability of a low-cost imaging tool for preclinical disease and drug development studies could accelerate progress in improving human health while reducing cost burdens on life science labs. The proposed project addresses the problem that 2D ultrasound is a preferred imaging modality in preclinical studies due to the adequate resolution, high throughput, and low cost; however, it suffers from user variability and inadequate field of view. The research objectives will be to continue the development and validation of a 3D ultrasound system which overcomes challenges of user variability and inadequate field of view. Specific technical goals will be to improve both the hardware and software of the system for increased throughput, integrating the system components into a cohesive customer-facing product, and calibrating and validating the system for its intended preclinical imaging application. Expected results will be a novel technology ? an automated 3D preclinical ultrasound system, which will substantially improve the performance and capabilities of preclinical ultrasound imaging, yet will retain the low-cost and high throughput characteristics of ultrasound imaging. This new technology will fill a need present in nearly every academic research institution as well as pharmaceutical and contract research organizations worldwide.",

This project presents a security verification software suite that detects security vulnerabilities in electronic hardware designs. Current state-of-the-art methods for detecting security vulnerabilities in hardware designs are very informal, consisting of security teams searching for these vulnerabilities through manual code review and committee discussion. This has already been shown to be ineffective in obtaining adequate security coverage, with security vulnerabilities remaining undetected and exploitable by malicious entities. With the unprecedented growth in the number of connected devices being developed for the Internet-of-Things (IoT), the number of security vulnerabilities will increase dramatically. The broader societal impact of this SBIR Phase II project is the increased security of computing systems, leading to more effective management of personal information and increased data privacy. The commercial impact is a unique software offering to semiconductor companies to help detect and prevent security vulnerabilities that could be used to compromise an IoT device. This greatly reduces the resources necessary to achieve high security coverage and eliminates long-term liabilities that can debilitate an entire company. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the technical development of a software suite for verifying security properties of hardware designs. The technology improves on the current methods in semiconductor companies that use manual audits in attempts to find security vulnerabilities in chip designs. It provides a systematic platform for verifying the security properties specified by the security teams on the actual hardware within these companies. This greatly improves the security coverage while reducing the time spent performing security audits. This SBIR Phase II project will develop the features requested directly by customers and perform the essential R&D efforts of the company's underlying information flow analysis technology in order to adequately solve customers' problems. The end result of this Phase II project will be a commercial grade product fit to detect and resolve security issues in modern electronic hardware designs.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the automated manufacture of lightweight high-strength carbon fiber composite materials. Experts agree that composite manufacturers must lead innovations in sustainability, price reduction, and cycle-time reduction to meet end-market needs. The innovations proposed in this project, coupled with Vistex Composites' cutting edge Specialized Elastomeric Tooling process, directly address these needs by significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in composites manufacturing equipment. The prevailing motivation for short automated cycles is posed by the automotive industry, where lightweighting delivers major benefits for fuel consumption but where current processes cannot affordably and quickly produce carbon fiber automotive parts in large numbers. The equipment innovations proposed will not only enhance the automotive market but will have substantial commercial value across all composite markets as they allow the manufacture of equivalent quality products, faster, with less waste, significant energy savings, and at lower cost. Furthermore, the proposed automated process will enable Vistex in its aggressive path towards not only broader adoption of its Specialized Elastomeric Tooling process technology but also broader adoption of composite materials. This will directly drive manufacturing job creation, for Vistex and its customers, as composites displace foreign produced goods. This project addresses the design, fabrication, and analysis of an automated composite manufacturing cell using Vistex's patented Specialized Elastomeric Tooling process as the central technology. The standard composite manufacturing process, the autoclave, has long cycle times (hours), requires significant manual labor, and is expensive. Vistex's proposed manufacturing cell addresses these concerns. In the proposal manufacturing cell will be designed and fabricated to make a composite product using Specialized Elastomeric Tooling but where parts (1) can be moved rapidly and accurately using automation, (2) rapidly cured using Specialized Elastomeric Tooling, and (3) rapidly ejected/removed from the tooling, all while creating an equivalent or superior product to with significant cycle time savings over the industry's standard autoclave process. Through the use of material testing, cost analysis, and other metrics, each stage of the proposed manufacturing cell will be benchmarked against industry standard processes. The anticipated result will be a prototype turnkey rapid automated manufacturing cell and commercially usable products for project partners.",

        "abstract": "Distributed visual surveillance has a major role in the future of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs).  Distributed visual surveillance refers to the use of cameras networked over a wide area to continually collect and process sensor data to recognize and classify objects in the environment.  Analyzed data will inform unmanned decision-making and fleet management to optimize a transportation system.  Sensors and camera systems mounted on UGVs will augment stationary surveillance hardware.  An area of interest for this research is data fusion, co-operative multi-sensor tracking methods, and distributed processing.  Also of interest is the reconciliation, classification, and prioritization of data; storage and accurate retrieval of archival references; and the selection of an appropriate action/response to the data.        Although there are many potential sensors that can be used in distributed surveillance, in this topic we are focusing on visual (and perhaps infrared) imaging sensors whose cost, reliability, and availability makes transition to the field or commercialization much more likely. Communications bandwidth is and will remain a limited resource.  Even with video compression technologies, there is insufficient bandwidth to upload all video and high-resolution still images from all network nodes.  Artifacts due to heavy video compression would degrade most analysis applications and viewing all the data would overwhelm analysts.  Local processing is therefore preferable to central processing to extract actionable information from the sensor data and to plan UGV position adjustments.  An individual node can determine whether or not there has been a significant change in the situation that would warrant transmitting a package of sensor-level data.     The scenario to be addressed in this topic is that a small fleet of 10-15 UGVs deployed at a CONUS installation in order to safely transport personnel, on-demand, from various point around one building one-third mile sharing pedestrian sidewalk, across an uncontrolled four-lane roadway, through a busy parking lot to another building on the installation.  Vehicles will operate at speeds from 3mph (in mixed pedestrian traffic) up to potentially 25mph which is the limit for Neighbourhood Electric Vehicles.  Vehicles must recognize and respond appropriately to pedestrians, unconnected vehicles, and other environmental objects.  Approximately 12 networked cameras fixed across along the route and around the test site will provide visual coverage of the area.  Sensors will have a priori visual background data and UGV location will be known (landmarks, GPS positioning, etc.) enabling temporal differential or background subtraction to locate objects.  Capabilities desired for the UGV include ODOA, correct positioning and speed regulation with respect to moving and stationary objects, coordinated and optimized system-wide responses across the fleet, data collection and/or communications, and extracting actionable information from the sensor stream.  Information of interest includes detection and behaviour analysis of humans and vehicles, analysis of traffic patterns, and identification of suspicious activities or behaviors.  The intended platform is an electric vehicle with size on the order of 500-600 Kg (roughly golf-cart sized).  The platform is expected to manage its own energy usage and recharge itself, wirelessly, so energy efficient algorithms are of interest. UGV platform and payload development, including sensors and communications, are outside the scope of this topic.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Busek Co. Inc. proposes to develop a high power, low-mass Hall effect thruster.  The baseline thruster is sized at nominally 8kW power level.  A specific feature to be implemented includes the use of SmCo permanent magnets.  The goal of the effort is to reduce thruster specific mass to 60%.    In Phase I Busek evaluated an existing permanent magnet thruster to develop the theoretical and experimental underpinnings of the full power design.  Following the experimental effort Busek prepared the detailed engineering design of the thruster designated BHT-8000-PM.  The thruster design was supported by magnetic modeling, lifetime predications, and thermal and structural analysis.  In Phase II Busek will perform functional, performance and plume testing of the prototype thruster.  Using the lessons learned from the prototype thruster development, Busek will design, build and environmentally and performance test an advanced version of the thruster with a center-mounted cathode to raise the maturity level to TRL 6.     BENEFIT:  The DoD has recently begun an effort to understand the potential of high-power EP for national assets such as AEHF, GPS, WGS, SBIRS, and reconnaissance satellites.  Equipping assets with full EP for both orbit transfer and station keeping would allow dual-manifest launches and LEO injections in the majority of cases, saving hundreds of millions of dollars across constellations.  In the case of the Space Missile Command (SMC) fleet, EP would allow dual-manifest LEO launches to occur, saving ~15% of the fleet-wide budget which includes the procurement, launch, and operation.   The commercial industry is already transitioning to all-electric satellites to perform both orbit raising and station keeping.   These include domestic satellite manufacturers Boeing (presently operating L-3 ion engines), Lockheed-Martin, Orbital Sciences and Space Systems/Loral,  Between 2020 and 2022, 45 satellite orders are expected to launch having payload power at or near 14 kW, with 18 of these at or above 14 kW.  This trend of higher power coincides with advancements in solar array technologies.  Present state of the art arrays average 40 W/kg, whereas next generation arrays performance >10 W/kg.",

        "abstract": "Solid state RF and millimeter wave weapons systems require substantial power to operate. Pure solid state systems have limited energy density and require charging over the typical use cycle. The directed energy system must be compact enough to mount on a vehicle such as a HMMWV, a small trailer or a structure such as found within an embassy compound. Current power systems are much too large and heavy to meet the requirements of the system; therefore a higher power density solution is required. Candent Technologies is proposing a microturbine based power generation system, designed to provide up to 250 kW on a continuous basis, ready to use at any time with no limitations of on/off time or duty cycle that could render the system unavailable at a critical moment. The system consists of a small, single shaft gas turbine directly driving a high speed permanent magnet alternator at constant speed, with rectified output providing DC power. The turbine is fitted with a waste heat recovery system (recuperator), which results in fuel efficiency better than similar power diesels. This proposed system will have one fourth of the weight and one third the volume of equivalent diesel systems.",

        "abstract": "Demand for locally grown, farm-raised fish is rising as the public becomes increasingly aware of the health benefits of eating safe, nutritional seafood. For the past decade or more, aquaculture has been the fastest growing segment of agriculture, providing consumers with a healthy product that is produced utilizing sustainable methods. To meet this increasing demand for locally grown seafood, indoor intensiveRecirculating Aquaculture Systems(RAS) provide a controlled, bio-secure, growing environment and year-round production of safe, high quality, farm raised fish.Currently, indoor aquaculture systems are based primarily on the use of expensive fiberglass tanks. The required high initial capital investment proves to be a significant barrier to entering the market. New, more affordable technology is needed. The overreaching objective of our Phase I research was to bring to commercial viability a well-engineered, robust, low-cost, culture production system that optimizes RAS operating conditions. This new approach is called the mixed-cell raceway.Due to the success of Phase I, and the experience gained during the design and construction of the RAS system, the next logical step is to provide this information/guidance to other small farmers, thus increasing supply while enabling suppliers. Phase II of this project will offer innovative technology through afranchise package, along with manuals, consulting support, collective buying, and product marketing, to those interested in entering the aquaculture industry affordably and with reduced risk. Numerous aquaculture start-up ventures have failed due to a lack of experience and support, as well as high opertaing costs/low profit margins. Afranchisescenario, incorporating the mixed-cell raceway, has the potential to reduce the learning curve and minimize such failures. As a result, the aquaculture industry will be poised to expand nationwide, as small farms capitalize on this emerging market.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Global Technology Connection, Inc., in collaboration with its academic and industrial partners proposes to develop a hierarchical 3-tier fault tolerant architecture to improve aircraft reliability, safety, and availability.  The hierarchical system will support autonomous decisions for aircraft mission modification, trajectory planning, and controller reconfiguration.  The architecture includes a Fault-Adaptive Control Technology (FACT) that continuously monitors for faults/failures and reconfigures low-level controllers using an active model approach in order to maintain stable control over the aircraft.   The diagnostic and prognostic methodology will fuse health information at the aircraft component, subsystem, and system levels in order to improve the accuracy and reliability of the health assessment.  Fault and failure information is sent to all levels of the architecture to support control reconfiguration at different levels.  Based on the current aircraft health state, a mission modification module determines the appropriate top-level control actions such as modifying sequence of mission tasks and switching between different objectives (extend life / maintain control).   A reasoning module is used to select the appropriate mission based upon past mission modification success and failure experiences.  At the mid-level, the control problem is defined and solved.  Objective function parameters, constraints, estimated dynamic parameters, etc. are used to define the problem depending on the application and the solution is found using the appropriate algorithm (stored offline solutions can also be used).  For example, a path planner is often used at the mid-level to generate appropriate aircraft trajectories based on selected mission, environmental conditions, and current and predicted health states.  A working prototype will be implemented and tested on a relevant aircraft system using the FEATS design process developed in Phase I.  The technology will be transitioned to commercial applications in Phase III to both military and civilian aircraft applications as a framework package along with design process and test tools.  This technology supports the U.S. Air Forces integrity programs such as MECSIP, PSIP, AVIP, ASIP, and CSSIP for the long term sustainability of military aircraft fleets.BENEFIT:The fault tolerant system, Fault Evaluation, Adaptation, and Tolerant System (FEATS), will provide improved reliability, safety, sustainability, and availability for manned and unmanned aircraft systems.  The system can handle not only a single fault/failure, but multiple aircraft faults/failures from various aircraft subsystems and components.  FEATS will provide reliable autonomous decision making in the presence of aircraft fault/failures to increase the chances of mission success and prevention of vehicle loss.    There is huge commercial potential for this type of system in aircraft, ship and ground autonomous systems to detect and predict failures and provide on-line compensation for failed systems.  NASAs unmanned landing systems, commercial aircraft, automobiles, automated manufacturing, etc. could also benefit from this technology.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a new natural means of treating diseases of fruit orchards and crops as an alternative to antibiotic use. Over 90% of the world's antibiotic use in agriculture is primarily to control fire blight, a disease that kills fruit trees. Fire blight has emerged as the most devastating disease of apple and pear trees worldwide. Growers apply streptomycin or oxytetracycline multiple times during bloom and following plant injuries to prevent the growth of the causative agent of fire blight, Erwinia amylovora (Ea). Resistant Ea strains have been isolated, and are expected to impact the human food chain. The proposed technology will replace these antibiotics with the microscopic predators of bacteria, slime molds, which are benign to humans, animals, and plants. These bacterial predators represent a new proprietary biocontrol approach. The proposed project will focus on reducing orchard carriage of Ea, and the general approach should be extensible to treating agricultural infections of other species of bacterial pathogens. Ultimately, this innovation will contribute to increased public health by providing safer alternatives to existing antibiotics and disinfectants. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project proposes a novel approach to treating fire blight, a pathogenic disease affecting pome fruits caused by E. amylovora, and tomato canker caused by C. michiganensis. Both pathogens form biofilms connected to their virulence in plants. There is currently no treatment although the incidence of reoccurring infections by E. amylovora and C. michiganensis contribute to millions of dollars of losses in fruit production. Antibiotics and disinfectants typically kill only growing cells. This approach consumes growing, dormant, or biofilm-enmeshed bacteria. Inclusion of biofilms as targets will help to identify a means to solve some of the most intractable infections known. The research objectives of this Phase II SBIR proposal are to: 1) Screen Dictyostelid (Dicty) isolates in vitro for biocontrol capabilities for orchards and decontamination of plants/equipment, 2) test efficacy of Dicty candidates en planta, and 3) design methods for spore production and packaging. For commercial applications, the goal is to use probiotic bacteria to amplify Dicty and produce spores. For spore preservation and dispersal, the plan is to use methods proven to be successful and safe for other biocides. Natural biocides products will be developed for agricultural research and to treat pathogenic outbreaks in fruit and vegetable crops.",

While ITO meets current requirements for conductivity and transparency, it is easily damaged and has deposition techniques that are incompatible with depot conditions.  Current on-site repair of minor defects involve the application of a flexible conductive patch material with a pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA), but these patches tend to peel off with continued exposure to the high speed winds, abrasives/impacts, moisture, and temperatures associated with flight conditions. Eclipse Energy Systems, Inc. (Eclipse) proposes tailoring its proprietary transparent electrical conductor (TEC) for use in the repair of damaged aircraft canopy coatings via the fabrication of a conductive patch. Eclipse TEC is an optically tailorable thin film coating system that possesses metal-like conductivity with glass-like transparency in the visible region.  An edge sealing process with optically clear adhesive can protect the seams of the patch from curling and peeling off during the rigors of flight, providing a more durable repair, reducing maintenance costs and increasing operational readiness.  BENEFIT:  IDTechEx, a market analysis firm, has indicated that the market for transparent conducting film and glass will reach $6.3 B by 2024. Replacements for ITO are expected to reach $690 M by 2016. This market is expected to top $1.8 B by 2024. Our initial primary customers would be the US Military for use on aircraft canopies.

        "abstract": "We propose to add ultra-wide-band (UWB) wireless connectivity to a wearable, battery powered, finger-worn ultrasound probe and system (under development through a separate contract) capable of performing the FAST exam for use in the battlefield. UWB is particular suited to medical defense needs on the battlefield as the wireless transmission is undetectable, uses low power and has high bandwidth for video transmission. Starix, Inc. (Irvine, CA) will serve as a subcontractor and the project will utilize their ultra-wideband (UWB) technology to incorporate wireless connectivity of the beamformer and transducer system to connect and display images on a SMART device such as an Android-based miniature display or NETT warrior platform. Providing wireless connectivity to an existing field monitor or smart phone untethers the medic and minimizes the footprint and weight of the ultrasound system. The wearable wireless finger-worn probe will bring ultrasound capability to the front line, enabling rapid triage and effective diagnosis to guide immediate treatment prior to transport, which will reduce battlefield mortality. The compact wearable form of the probe and system puts minimal burden on the medic and allows the exam to be performed under all circumstances including on solders wearing body armor.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In this Phase II effort, FIRST RF proposes a pragmatic approach targeting small UAS systems but easily scalable to meet the demands of any platform. Small tactical aircraft have drag constraints but have challenges of extremely tight payload restrictions, limited internal space and available power. For these platforms, FIRST RF proposes a low profile, multi-band antenna requiring no internal volume and capable of supporting both existing and emerging datalink needs. The approach offers combined advantages of enabling multi-band communication, enhancing datalink range, and extending mission endurance through reduced drag. Simulation and analysis during the Phase I have paved the way for the Phase II proving the design validity of this approach. During the Phase II, two prototype units will be produced for demonstration.  BENEFIT:  Efficient multiband communications for small tactical airborne platforms will provide advantages by supporting seamless distribution of high quality ISR data directly to the warfighter even in environments with denied or nonexistent communication infrastructure.  Low profile antenna solutions that support this mission are an enabling technology that extend time on station and improved link ranges.  Commercial and dual-use applications are also present for disaster relief operations where communications infrastructure has been damaged and the ability to immediately establish high quality distribution of information can be invaluable.  The CHEESE antenna system will support expanding capabilities in tactical radio systems that currently integrate diversity receiver and transmitter architectures.  Future radio architectures utilizing the CHEESE antenna system will be able to support MIMO waveforms and beamforming.  These future technology enhancements will greatly improve the range, data rates and A/J performance of tactical data link systems.  Recent FIRST RF product releases, field demonstration and testing of diversity aperture combining, MIMO and beamforming technology will be enabled on small UAV platforms with the CHEESE antenna system.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The U.S. Air Force (USAF) and the aerospace industry have a critical need for reliable harsh-environment sensors that can deliver real-time monitoring in a turbine engine environment. During Phase I, Environetix confirmed that most harsh environment technologies that rely on wired sensors or complicated wireless hybrid systems have their reliability compromised by the wires or the connection complexity. Also as part of the Phase I effort, Environetix leveraged its extensive experience in high temperature sensor materials, devices, packaging, and data acquisition, to verify through thermal cycling and maximum temperature tests up to 1000C in laboratory furnaces that the core of its patented technology, the prototype wireless surface acoustic wave (SAW) langasite (LGS) temperature sensor presents stability comparable or better than the thermocouples used as reference. During the Phase II period, Environetix will partner with Pratt & Whitney (P&W), and further improve sensor/antenna connections and packaging in order to validate the wireless LGS SAW sensor technology in P&W laboratories for TRL 4 confirmation, followed by tests in a P&W turbine engine test cell for TRL 6 validation. The Phase II results will allow Environetix and P&W to establish a roadmap for the wireless SAW Environetixs sensor technology commercialization.  BENEFIT:  Environetixs harsh-environment wireless battery-free small-profile sensors capable of reaching temperatures over 1000C (1830oF) will have a major impact on the aerospace industry by providing the following benefits in turbine engine monitoring: (i) Reliable operation for several thousands of hours or more, and easily reaching the minimum 4,000 hrs operation in hot sections for test cell applications; (ii) Validation of engine modeling and operational conditions by wirelessly monitoring engine conditions at locations not possible by other sensor technologies; (iii) Verification of integrity of seals, shrouds, and other critical engine locations, due to both small size and wireless sensor operation: (iv) Removal of wires to deliver the required sensing information, thus saving significant costs in manpower (sensor installation in the turbine), reduced weight, and simultaneously improving performance and reliability, since wires are a well-known cause of sensor early failure; and (v) Through more reliable temperature monitoring, provide better engine performance, improved fuel efficiency, and increased power at reduced engine operation (or flight) costs. The wireless SAW sensor technology also has many commercial applications in other sectors such a power generation, oil/gas exploration, manufacturing process control, and other high temperature harsh environment processes.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Enhanced Modeling and Analysis of embedded real-time systems is vital to prevent late stage architecture changes, which can be costly from program risk and cost perspectives. System designers use various standards for modeling, including UML and SysML with MARTE augmentations, with supporting tools. These do not integrate well with specialized tools - e.g., for schedulability, performance and failure analysis - due to semantic mismatch of the models, non-standard data exchange mechanisms, and broad general-purpose modeling standards that can be difficult to interpret and apply for individual domain analysis needs. We propose to investigate and design nForge, a workbench that will include (a) mechanisms for project-specific customization/ enforcement of data semantics and translations, suitable for domain-specific modeling, (b) open, scalable and customizable data interchange framework, and (c) automated change propagation and alert generation upon design violations. nForge will support UML and SysML with MARTE augmentations, and integrate with widely used design modeling tools. Demonstrations of feasibility and scalability will be conducted in the context of performance analysis for a DoD avionics challenge problem, in collaboration with an industry partner with access to rich program-scale datasets. The approach will be applicable to other design analysis - e.g., communication and failure analysis.; BENEFIT: Defense and aerospace programs will benefit from an open, scalable and automated means of integrating system design models with domain-specific analysis tools and methods. Facilitating early stage design analysis through such standard means will save significant amount of late stage rework and will eliminate program risks. Software-intensive cyber-physical systems in telecom, automotive, industrial controls, consumer products, wearable electronics and medial devices markets will also benefit from a scalable solution that can work across the range - from small, embedded systems to large system-of-systems.",

        "abstract": "This effort is to develop a fast responding, light weight, direct injection system to operate within the fuels ignition delay time for UAS/UGS application.  These systems must be applicable to engines that are 200 HP or less, either reciprocating or rotary. A technical challenge associated with the conversion of gasoline engines to heavy fuel (JP-8) is the avoidance of knock.  An approach used to avoid knock is to operate within the fuels ignition delay time; hence to employ direct combustion chamber injection.      The challenges of the reciprocating engine are to avoid end gas knock (auto ignition occurring in the end gas after spark) and to inject the fuel very late into the cycle.  The challenges for the rotary engine are atomization and the avoidance of wall quenching due to its combustion chamber shape.  Delaying the injection process causes higher pressure rise rates which can exceed the engines design capabilities.  An injection system that offers fast response and multiple injections per cycle may alleviate excessive pressure rise and the avoidance of knock.     Good combustion control eliminates many durability issues from overloading, shock, and combustion deposits.  The shape of the combustion trace can be tailored through multiple injection pulses and combustion deposits can be controlled with better atomization and fuel patterns.  Hence an injection system that offers fine atomization, fast response, and multiple injections per cycle is needed.  System components are to include injectors, high pressure supply pump (1000 bar min), feed pump and controller with harness.",

The approach described is comprehensive and supports platform and network infrastructure, secure application development and testing, as well as production, system maintenance and activity logging and tracking. The framework is based on maintaining total application security and encrypting all aspects of open communication within the network and the application execution space. Properly constructed, a cloud based application can reduce costs and improve security by limiting the exposed network footprint and insuring network vulnerabilities are suitably patched. A pathfinder application is used to demonstrate these reduced maintenance costs in a secure environment. This proposal will describe the process of protecting and maintaining program security in application space.  BENEFIT:  The security of applications in a shared cloud is not just a challenge for the DoD. The cloud will provide economies of scale for a large number of commercial enterprises, provided they are able to insure the security of their programs.There is a significant opportunity to transition this framework to users of the commercial cloud and to improve application trust and security infrastructure of cloud providers.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop a novel platform technology: a high-torque electrostatic motor (EM). This readily scalable platform machine technology can provide any desired torque or power rating necessary along with increased energy accessibility and reduced energy/operating costs compared to traditional steel-copper-magnet based motors. Instead of using permanent magnets or wire coil mechanisms, this motor exploits electrostatic forces between closely spaced, conductive metal plates to create an electric field, with shaft-torque capabilities far beyond those of conventional machines. By allowing industry more efficient operations, resources will be freed for continued innovation, spurring economic growth. This EM uses domestically-sourced materials like aluminum, steel, and plastic instead of rare earth elements like neodymium, dysprosium, or samarium used in traditional motors, thus reducing both dependence on foreign supply chains of rare earths and market volatility. EMs will be lighter-weight and less expensive to produce than traditional motors. Value is offered to numerous commercial markets, including electric/hybrid-electric cars, industrial automation, renewable energy (wind turbines), and machines operating in extreme environments (aerospace or down-hole drilling) through lower materials costs, increased reliability, higher efficiencies at low speed, and reduced weight. The Small Business Innovation Research Project (SBIR) Phase 2 project will expand understanding of electrostatic machinery, including operational principles, design principles, and strengths/weaknesses of this novel platform technology. This represents the first significant breakthrough in motor/machine technology in almost 150 years. Previously, electrostatic technology had few applications due to a limited body of knowledge, despite occasional study throughout the last century. This was primarily due to technological limitations (low capacitance, the necessity of vacuum used as an insulating medium), whose solution required knowledge spanning multiple technical fields (electric field theory, chemistry, mechanical engineering, material science, and power electronic controls). By addressing these technological limitations in P-I, this project already expanded the body of pertinent engineering and physics knowledge. This P-II project offers opportunities for additional study ranging far beyond those currently envisioned. For example, optimizing electrostatic/mechatronic systems such as sophisticated electrostatic drive systems will likely involve the use of highly-engineered materials (metamaterials and composites); next-generation 3D multiphysics simulation platforms to simultaneously solve fluid dynamic, electrostatic, and thermal behaviors; and development of chemical synthesis processes to maximize electrostatic force production. Advanced manufacturing technologies will likely emerge, leading to possibilities including injection molding or 3D printing of a machine.",

More specifically, the commercial production of structurally-well-defined (precise) polyolefins, including stereoblock polypropylene (sbPP) thermoplastic elastomers, as replacements for technologically inferior polyolefins in adhesive and additives markets will serve to capitalize on the increasingly advantaged position of inexpensive propylene in the North America. The development of new technologies, such as LCCTP, will help the U.S. to regain its position as a world-leader in the discovery and commercialization of new polyolefin-based materials, and thereby, contribute to the future health and growth of the U.S. economy. The objectives of the proposed Phase II research project are to address the needs for new commercial polymers against a back-drop of ever increasing consumer demand, a sluggish industrial response, and a limited pool of chemical feedstocks possessing high price and supply volatility from which they can be manufactured. The current project will seek to develop commercially-viable processes based on a living coordinative chain transfer polymerization (LCCTP) technology to provide a broad range of structurally-well-defined polyolefins that possess with superior properties relative to existing products. By conducting an in-depth investigation of polymerization catalyst structure / property relationships, the project will seek to optimize catalyst activity and thermal stability. In concert with scale-up process development, this catalyst optimization will lead to reduced material and processing costs, and a product portfolio of competitively-priced polyolefins with superior performance characteristics. Validation of an optimized scale-up process will be achieved through the ton-scale production of stereoblock polypropylene (sbPP) thermoplastic elastomers, for adhesive and additive markets, and low molecular weight proprietary oils, for cosmetics, lubricants, and adhesives markets. The anticipated result is that commercially relevant (> 1 kiloton) volumes of sbPP thermoplastic elastomers and proprietary oils can be manufactured as technologically and commercially viable products.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project studies the problem of how to engage students in STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) education through game-based learning in a Virtual Robotics computer game. In the game, students design, assemble and train virtual walking robots to compete against their peer robots to secure a seat on a virtual mission to Mars. The project analyses the effects of competition and collaboration on the learning and retention of key robotic control concepts. The project will produce a low-cost educational computer game, where far more U.S. middle schools and high schools students can learn about biomechanics, math, physics and computer algorithms through a robotic simulation game than is possible with current robot hardware approaches. The product provides the American educational system a solution to quickly engage students in STEM who might otherwise turn away. STEM field professions can lead to high paying jobs, which in turn can improve productivity and the economic landscape for America. The project's education technology innovation is a cloud-based robot evolution game engine where students acting as a crowd can evolve the behavior of walking bi-pedal robots. The evolution of robot behavior happens on three levels: 1) the micro scale where an individual or small group of students evolves singular robot behaviors, 2) the mid-scale where groups exchange individual behaviors to form a behavior sequence to meet game level challenges. (For example, link a sequence of behaviors to stand, walk, jump, and turn to clear a section of obstacles and reach the prize goal), 3) the macro scale where the community evolves a cumulative set of behaviors through re-use and adoption of most efficient behaviors, discarding failed behaviors and creating new game level challenges. In particular, this project studies how individual and group learning is affected by adjusting the reward incentive, competitive motivation, novelty and surprise, and challenge level difficulty. During competition, the game gathers data regarding level of student learning and robot performance to answer two specific questions: a) do students learn more through small group or large group collaboration/competition, and b) are the students more engaged in small or large scale crowd-sourced environments.",

Even when signs are posted, the public probably does not clearly understand the danger. It would be more informative if the public were ale to maps of the location, speed, and direction of coastal currents. Ocean safety officials are using various methods to inform the public of these dangers but at this time they do not have an easy way to map out the location, speed, and direction of coastal currents. New sensors are needed to address this need.   The goal of this Phase 2 project is to develop camera systems which will measure the location, speed, and direction of coastal currents. Three approaches will be developed including a cell phone application, a single camera system, and a stereo camera system.

These propellant formulations provide high thrust with minimal burning rate temperature sensitivity. These coatings ensure that thermally stable, long service life composite propellant formulations behave like the advanced plateau burning rate double base propellants used in CAD/PADs. The proposed Phase II effort will further develop and refine this technology, demonstrate the technology across a wide range of pressures, temperatures, and aging conditions, achieve an interim hazard classification, and scale production. This capability will be transitioned to the DoD by licensing to a company such as Aerojet for mass production.

        "abstract": "Strong, sustainable rural communities are essential to creating an economy \"built to last that rewards hard work and responsibility.\"1 These communities supply our food, fiber, and energy, safeguard our natural resources, and are essential in the development of science and innovation. What do communities need to stay economically healthy in order to provide these goods and services? According to a Kauffman Foundation Study, they need a vibrant entrepreneurial culture. Net job growth occurs in the U.S. economy only through startup firms.2Supporting entrepreneurship in rural communities requires finding ways to enable better access to capital, particularly early stage and equity capital and non-traditional (non-bank), sources of financing. A report issued by the Federal Reserve Bank says, accessing equity capital may be the most important hurdle hindering rural entrepreneurship. The Local Crowd, LLC has created a crowdfunding platform and incubator that can overcome that hurdle by bringing together the essential ingredients for alternative capital formation and entrepreneurial growth in rural communities. The TLC model enables businesses and organizations to raise funds online with a robust educational system to help them do it right. TLC also provides strong support to communities, enabling them to effectively launch the locally-branded platform, and create an ecosystem of local investment.Phase I research proved the feasibility of The Local Crowd incubator by piloting it in two Wyoming communities. The Phase II research project, \"Enhancing Rural Access to Capital Through Development of a Local Crowdfunding Incubator,\" will validate the effectiveness of our crowdfunding model by field-testing it in up to 30 rural communities around the United States. The research plan includes three technical objectives: 1. Demonstrate the effective design and functionality of the TLC 2.0 crowdfunding software through development of the software interface, and educational software, 2. Validate the effective implementation of The Local Crowd crowdfunding model through field-testing in rural communities, and 3. Demonstrate the positive impact of The Local Crowd crowdfunding model on the socio-economic vitality of rural communities.Anticipated Results and Potential Commercial ApplicationsThe Local Crowd, LLC has designed an innovative crowdfunding tool that rural communities can use to break down the barriers to capital access for their residents. The crowdfunding industry is growing and dynamic, with the global crowdfunding economy growing to over $5.1B in 2013. By 2025, the global crowdfunding market could reach more than 1.8 times the global venture capital industry today.3The potential post applications for TLC can be expanded far beyond its core target market, which are rural communities across the United States. Its innovative emphasis on community host training and education, and focus on the grassroots support of its community residents will enable its rapid growth among rural communities across the U.S., and strong potential for expansion to rural communities in other countries. TLC&#39;s platform offers a unique local-based perspective. We expect our unique features will differentiate TLC from other crowdfunding platforms long into the future. The innovation inherent in our technology is that it is a model that is \"hardwired\" into rural communities and focused on rural needs. It is intended as a turnkey solution, providing everything a rural community needs to immediately start a local crowdfunding program and incubate a successful crowdfunding culture.1www.whitehouse.gov, (2012).

Upper limb loss can be treated with myoelectric prostheses, but such devices require intensive training to effectively operate. The need to concentrate and continuously react during training often takes amputees many months, with the result that many patients abandon use of the prosthesis. In the Phase I effort, Design Interactive, Inc. developed the ADAPT-MP tool, which consists of a mobile practitioner portal to support multiple-patient monitoring, a mobile, game-based patient tool with wireless EMG sensors to support training, and a secure server for data communication between the practitioner and patient systems.  In the 24 month Phase II effort, with partner Hanger Prosthetics, we plan to extend the Phase I efforts by implementing a usability analysis, developing additional training modules and a fully functional provider portal, and performing clinical trials to determine the effectiveness of the novel training tool.  We will assess prosthesis use compliance, skillfulness of use, quality of life and return to work/duty. Finally, the partnership with Hanger Prosthetics will be leveraged to develop and review the production and licensing plan to ensure the system transitions to a variety of markets.",

Therefore, the approach is inefficient for cw laser and would require very large equipment. BBO is presently the only viable NLO crystal for conversion to DUV and has an especially large walk-off angle of >4. The proposed approach will overcome the current limitations and problems of the technology, using: A Nd:YAG 946 nm pump laser designed as a diode pumped crystal fiber waveguide (CFW), modeled to result in close to theoretical beam quality and efficiency for quasi-three-level system.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to reduce cost and loss of productivity due to bacteriophage (phage) contamination in fermentation of dairy and other products. Bacteriophage contamination is the leading cause of failure in fermentation processes used in the food and pharmaceutical industries. The risk of phage contamination in food fermentation processes, particularly in the dairy industry, is significantly enhanced due to a large diversity of suppliers of both the raw ingredient (milk) and the necessary microbial cultures. The current and emerging analytical technologies cannot rapidly detect phages in food materials such as milk. Thus, the combination of the risk of contamination, and the lack of rapid detection methods, results in a significant economic loss for the dairy industry. Early detection of phage contamination will permit early intervention in the fermentation process, which will lead to significant cost savings. In addition, the test could be extended to other food areas, pharmaceutical production, and biochemical production. The SBIR project addresses the need for rapid detection of phage contamination in a fermentation process through a novel photonic platform. The platform combines nanophotonics, microfluidics, and electrophoresis, and is based on discoveries made at University of California - Davis. The system is focused on the manipulation of charged phages with electrophoresis, and their accelerated amplification in bacteria. In addition, the system uses electrophoretic capture of phages into a nanophotonic crystal to achieve highly sensitive detection of the target phages. The salient features of the platform are: a) High-throughput, fast trapping of phages; b) excellent sensitivity and large dynamic range for quantification of phage concentration; and c) scalable design that can be produced at low cost.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project will fund the development of collaborative writing software designed specifically for children ages 14 and under. Producing well-crafted explanatory and argumentative writing using evidence, required in the study of Science and other STEM disciplines, is a challenging task for many students, and teachers often lack the resources, tools, experience and/or opportunities to integrate this kind of writing into everyday instruction. This project will provide a platform where elementary and middle school students can read, conduct research, take notes, make decisions, debate how to structure pieces of writing, and write collaboratively, with multiple students contributing to a single document in real time. Developers will help teachers to infuse best writing practices into their instruction by embedding multiple curriculum units into the software and providing professional development support. This integrated, collaborative learning environment enables students to learn critical skills required by the Common Core State Standards, to prepare for new standardized tests being given online, and importantly, to acquire the 21st century literacy proficiency necessary to succeed in higher education and careers. In preliminary testing with a prototype product, this software has been shown to improve writing skills, especially for struggling learners. There is no other software like this currently available to deliver a single-platform, comprehensive, literacy learning environment for elementary and middle school children. This project is a cloud-based, real-time collaborative platform for reading, research, writing, and publishing student work. It integrates multiple programs to work together seamlessly and with stability, even in classrooms with weak or intermittent Internet access. Engineers created proprietary plug-ins to enable a text-only collaborative program to work with HTML rich text and images, allowing users to select and copy text and images from eBooks and websites and paste them into a collaborative note-taking space or document with synchronous participation of all members of the group. In addition, every user is identified by a color so the teacher can see what each contributed to the project. Students can hear narrated eBooks read aloud (using pre-existing, proprietary software), using the information they are gathering to write collaboratively, in real time. By compacting the size of programming strings, project engineers are enabling multiple groups to use the program at the same time without exhausting server capacity. Phase II research will integrate robust curriculum and teacher support features and maximize the product's impact for students in low-proficiency schools. The project team will test features during a six-week in-school intervention, adapting on the fly to ensure effectiveness and ease of use. The innovative power of the project lies in the elegant sum of its parts.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: ASTM standards exist currently to characterize various combustion characteristics of flammable chemicals such as flammability limits, flash point, minimum ignition energy, and auto ignition temperature. There are no such well-accepted characterization protocols for hot surface ignition temperature measurements. This is partly due to a large variation in the (i) test setups used in the literature for hot surface ignition testing, (ii) definitions employed for HSIT and (iii) parameters perceived to govern HSIT. We propose the development of a technology that combines a unique small scale hot surface ignition apparatus with a physics based model to determine the HSIT of aviation fluids accounting key processes such as liquid injection, spray formation, thermal behavior of hot plate, turbulence, heat transfer, mixing of vapors and air, and ignition. The unique design of this apparatus and the measurement protocol generate accurate and reproducible hot surface ignition temperatures of flammable liquids in general, and aviation fluids such as jet fuels and hydraulic fluids in particular. The deliverables include the ignition apparatus and a hot surface ignition model to extend the results to other hot surfaces, fuel injection and environmental conditions.; BENEFIT: The proposed innovation fills a key void, namely the lack of an accurate and efficient technique to characterize the HSIT of aircraft and automotive fluids. Successful development and implementation of this technology is expected to significantly reduce the burden of ignition testing and improve the safety of aircraft.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In order to diagnose flaws accurately with commercial non-destructive inspection (NDI) techniques in composite parts for repair and re-qualification decisions, calibration data using known references is imperative for NDI instrument optimization prior to their NDI. A set of these calibration standards usable interchangeably with NDI systems, such as pulse-echo ultrasound, or PE-UT, infrared thermography (IRT) and shearography, are required.     Our Phase-I results on engineered defects in solid-core carbon fiber laminates with two types of flaws (i) delamination and (ii) impact damage were shown to be detectable under both IRT and PE-UT. We have, thus, demonstrated interchangeable feasibility under 2 modalities in candidate composites.    In this Phase-II, Innoveyda proposes to further develop a composite standards kit for NDI instrumentation calibration.  The proposed kit will include engineered (i) delamination (ii) impact damage and (iii) fatigue loading induced damage; comprising at least two material constituent combinations.  The deliverable kit shall be characterized with all possible NDI modalities. In addition to NDI with PE-UT and IRT, Phase II candidates will also undergo shearography. In addition to standard reporting, Phase-II deliverables include all NDI data accompanying a Composite Calibration Standards kit delivered to an Air Logistics Center, demonstrating its interchangeable use under three NDI modalities.    BENEFIT:  Our technology will have both military and civilian applications in composites NDI to improve reliability and safety. While the military applications are evident from its development and the above discussion, its non-military transportation applications include: commercial aircraft NDI, spacecraft NDI, and ground transportation systems NDI for trains as well as ultra-lightweight automobiles, such as from Tesla.  The role of using our technology for NDI systems calibration prior to performing NDI on an unknown composite is expected to increase the probability of detection of damage. In addition there are several other areas where enhancement in composites integrity by accurate NDI is desired.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will be to greatly enhance the capabilities of printed electronics via high performance conductive materials. This will be accomplished by the development and commercialization of novel silver and copper ink chemistries that are used in a number of device applications ranging from display bezels and interconnects, to high performance OLED electrodes, to ink specifically developed for high speed printing and smart packaging applications. The commercial impact of such developments will be the significant adoption and use of printed electronics material palettes across multiple consumer electronic device platforms. This will ultimately lead to more efficient device manufacture with a simultaneous improvement in performance. The printed electronics market is rapidly growing with progress hinging on fundamental material improvements. The objectives of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate scalability of reactive silver ink chemistries, formulations for productization standards, and development of reactive copper ink chemistries. The reactive silver ink chemistry has begun to receive significant traction with customers. This program plans to achieve scalability of this high performance ink by novel purification of silver salts to achieve a high conductivity at large scales with industrially relevant processes. Next the inks will need to adhere to specific productization standards. This includes modifications of the chemistry for various printing processes ranging from low viscosity (10 cPs) up to high viscosities for high-volume printing techniques (1000 cPs and higher). Also, modifications to the chemistry for various testing criteria such as adhesion, abrasion, and environmental tests such as humidity and heat cycling will be made. Finally, reactive copper chemistries will be further developed. Copper inks that can be processed thermally in the ambient environment represent both a significant challenge as well as a vast opportunity in the printed electronics market. We have developed novel chemistries based on various low molecular weight reducing agents and short-chain surfactants that both reduce the copper quickly under thermal cycling while protecting the surface from oxidation.",

Our compact, ruggedized Broadband On Aircraft-multi (BOAm) transceivers will interface Ethernet enabled systems directly to existing aircraft wiring.  BOAm transceivers leverage state of the art commercial Power Line Communications (PLC) technology to reliably send and receive Ethernet data from additional BOAm units at other locations on the platform.  The ultra-wideband, low power PLC signals are conducted over the existing wiring creating a reliable digital network.  The BOAm unit can use up to four (4) PLC channels to maximize the bandwidth throughout the platform.  Two (2) or more BOAm units can provide up to 750Mbps of throughput, without requiring the costly installation of new wiring, and without interfering with existing aircraft systems.  Early prototypes have already been demonstrated in the lab, as well as on an A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft using up to four (4) communication channels: 1553-A bus, 1553-B bus, AC power bus, and DC power bus.  In Phase II, we will develop, qualify, and demonstrate through flight testing, fully ruggedized BOAm transceivers providing an easy-to-implement, high bandwidth network over only the existing wiring in a legacy platform.  BENEFIT:  The Intercommunication Data Rate (IDR) of legacy aircraft is a limiting factor for transferring data throughout the platform.  Future planned capabilities, such as the Advanced Tactical Data Link (ATDL) and state-of-the-art digital targeting pods like the Northrop Grumman Gen-IV LITENING pod, require a significant increase in IDR.  The high cost and extended depot times required to install network infrastructure will inhibit the acceptance of new, beneficial technologies by the respective program offices.  This development program will provide an easy-to-install, high bandwidth networking system that uses the existing wiring in the platform.  Broadband On Aircraft-multi (BOAm) transceivers are compact, lightweight, ruggedized Line Replaceable Units (LRU) that interface Ethernet-enabled equipment directly to the platform wiring such as the MIL-STD-1553 data bus, or the AC or DC power busses.  Data rates approaching Gigabit speeds are possible.  This system will directly benefit the program offices by enabling cost-effective modernization of legacy assets.        Commercial applications include inexpensive capability upgrades to commercial aircraft like passenger entertainment and internet access, as well as safety improvements such as enabling wingtip cameras that can help prevent collisions during taxing at busy airports  all without adding new wiring and weight.  Other possible applications include enhancements for large trucks or construction equipment such as backup cameras, proximity sensors, or load monitoring. BOAm transceivers will easily add network capabilities anywhere there is power available on a platform.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Our vision of a new development paradigm moves software performance analysis from an isolated set of tools that require laborious manual transfer of information among design and analysis tools to an integrated framework in which independent tools share information automatically and seamlessly. This framework provides true automated capability for analyzing the performance of system architectures and designs enabling developers to use decision support data-quickly and economically-during early stages of development. The framework supports the plug and play addition of tools thus making it easily expandable as new design methods, analysis techniques, and other support tools are desired. The current approach to development is an engineering problem that requires fixing performance problems after they occur resulting in unplanned expense and time. Our vision is an innovative solution that enables developers to build performance into their cyberphysical systems design. Phase I work addressed technical challenges in the automated transformation of architecture and design specifications into analysis models. Phase II proposes to create prototypes that implement the key steps in the automated transformation from MDE design models to performance models, and their solution and thus take a significant step toward our vision of the future. The prototypes will establish the validity of our approach.  BENEFIT:  Developers of real-time embedded and other software systems are moving to Model Driven Engineering using the Unified Modeling Language to define new systems. When developers create models of their software before building it, there is a significant opportunity to provide performance predictions for design and implementation options that they can use to select options that meet performance requirements. This will increase the likelihood that systems will meet their performance requirements upon delivery rather than fail initially and require extensive re-work to correct problems.     By automating the translation of software designs to performance models, this framework eliminates the need for laborious and error-prone manual translation. This means that performance defects can be detected and corrected early in the development process when they are easier and less costly to repair. Automated translation of designs to performance models also makes it possible to keep the performance models and design synchronized as the software evolves.    It is time to make available to developers proper tools, that are easy to use, to prevent performance problems, particularly for real-time embedded systems software where a performance failure can have disastrous consequences. Phase I resolved technical barriers to automated translation of design to performance models. Phase II will resolve technical implementation issues and develop prototypes that provides the foundation for one or more Phase III commercial products that could be developed relatively quickly and marketed to both the DoD and commercial clients.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Michigan Aerospace Corporation (MAC) and Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) propose to design an airborne system for characterizing long range profiles of the state of optical turbulence in the atmosphere. This system will exploit GTRIs differential image motion (DIM) LIDAR technique for measuring profiles of the refractive index structure characteristic as well as scintillation analysis to perform angle of arrival anemometry to determine the transverse components of velocity. This will further enable MAC to estimate the temporal anisoplanatism. MAC will additionally study the impact of adding a Fabry Perot Interferometer to improve the atmospheric turbulence estimates.  During the Phase 1 project, MAC and GTRI explored the development of a ranged hybrid system operating at a wavelength of 355nm consisting of the GTRI Differential Image Motion (DIM) LIDAR to estimate turbulence parameters and MACs ranged Fabry-Perot based LIDAR to extract wind, temperature and density in an effort to improve the characterization of turbulence.  During this Phase 2 project, we plan to provide a demonstration of the novel ranged DIM LIDAR technique for atmospheric turbulence measurements using an existing mobile LIDAR unit built by MAC.  BENEFIT:  The combination of Differential Image Motion with additional atmospheric measurements addresses a need in the evaluation of EO sensor technologies.  Both ground-based and airborne versions of the system will provide benefits to test and measurement communities that must characterize atmospheric optical turbulence.  In addition, the ability to measure cross-range velocity can be helpful to other applications, such as clear air turbulence detection, measurements of winds at rocket launch sites, precision air drop, and ordnance delivery, among other applications.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Reliability of weapon systems through periods of storage dormancy has long been a significant concern to military organizations. The trend in missile systems over previous decades has been toward greater sophistication, complexity, and longer periods of dormancy while in transportation and storage. Consideration of these makes assessment and prediction of missile reliability increasingly relevant to tactical outcomes, as many missile components are susceptible to environmental degradation in uncontrolled storage, handling and transportation conditions. To achieve better maintenance and repair planning, supply chain upgrades and system modifications, Air Force requires methods to accurately predict wear-out of dormant missile line replaceable units in the absence of remedial action. Thus, the objective of the proposed work is to develop validated, accurate prediction models, algorithms and software to assess and predict reliabilities of dormant aging cruise missile systems based on limited prior line replaceable unit maintenance and test data. In Phase I TRI/Austin developed preliminary statistical methodologies to estimate LRU reliabilities and prospective algorithms to predict future maintenance requirements. In Phase II these will be further tested and validated for predictive capabilities, and partnering with ReliaSoft to develop software and database to automate predictive processes for Air Force maintenance personnel and supply chain managers.  BENEFIT:  Accurate predictions of line replaceable unit wear-out allow better maintenance and repair planning, supply chain upgrades and system modifications. Commercial availability of the product to be developed from the proposed work will allow reliability assessments of aging dormant systems based on a deficient availability of maintenance or repair data, a common issue in industry. The continued reliance on older systems past their design life, or in permanent or semi-permanent storage, such as mothballed commercial aircraft, manufacturing machinery, and electronics, could benefit from algorithms such as this, allowing informed decisions regarding investments in continued repair and storage costs to be based on quantitative estimates of future system reliability.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Large format lithium-ion batteries with ineffective cell isolation are potentially hazardous when exposed to conditions such as crush, overcharge, discharge, high temperature and internal short circuit. The recent Boeing incidents and similar incidents in the automotive industry underscore the importance of current research into the root causes and safety hazards associated with such batteries.  In the event of cell failure, propagation of heat can occur, from a defective/damaged cell to the surrounding ones in a battery pack leading to a domino-effect and resulting in extensive thermal runaway. Such safety concerns can impede the combat capability of critical platforms like Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). To address this need, ADA Technologies, Inc. (ADA) has successfully implemented and demonstrated the feasibility of an effective, passive thermal isolation technology (during the recently concluded Phase I SBIR effort) that holds tremendous potential as a drop-in safety implementation for JSF energy storage devices, among others. In the proposed Phase II project, the efficacy of ADAs multi-layer thermal isolation materials (in the prevention of cell-to-cell thermal and deflagration-generated projectile communication) will be demonstrated in a JSF-relevant article, in partnership with a leading battery manufacturer for the US Air Force (AF).  BENEFIT:  Thermal runaway is one of the biggest issues hampering safe operation of large-format Li-ion packs this is exemplified by the fires on Boeing 787s in the recent past, as well as several UPS/FedEx cargo airplane fires. Hence, the proposed technology, which mitigates thermal runaway/escalation risks in the event of abnormal cell operation, will play a significant role in enabling next-generation AF, Navy, JSF and commercial air vehicle applications. In addition, ADA foresees near-term applications in battery backs for ground vehicles (both military and commercial uses) as well as commercial airliners. For example, next-generation hybrid vehicles for the Armed Forces seek safe, reliable operation and such thermal management/isolation technologies for cells in large-format battery packs is imperative to meet mission needs and ensure safety for our troops. The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) acknowledges that although significant progress has been made in the development of chemistries for high-voltage/high-energy batteries, the missing developmental area in the space of large-format high power batteries is internal, cell-level thermal management.  Examples include shipboard munitions and communication applications, where the utilization of large-format batteries is inevitable.  In addition, far-reaching effects of this technology include alleviating regulatory concerns in the foreseeable future, such as safety requirements for storage/transport of large battery shipment (in UPS, FedEx air cargo bays etc.). New and evolving regulations expected to be incorporated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) are expected to emphasize on improved thermal isolation of failed cells and battery systems, to minimize catastrophic events.",

Robotic\nResearch's goal for the future is to have 3D printers installed at various Hobby and Electronic stores which will also stock non-printable electrical\ncomponents. Commercial users would log onto the SAARP Store from home, select a design, develop a custom design, print it at a local store, and\nretrieve the model and non-printable parts. Some users even have a 3D printer at home. In this case the non-printable parts can by shipped directly to\nthem. Crowdsourcing will grow the SAARP Library greatly increasing its worth. The second part of the SAARP CRPP effort is to continue providing\ndesigns for the First Responders. Robotic Research will continue to provide inexpensive, easy to use, highly customizable robots to the First Responders\nat JIFXs events. At these events, many First Responder group Leads evaluate technologies to procure and provide to the men and women who need\nthese devices.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to increase the efficiency of domestic oil production. Using current methods, the oil industry is able to extract only 5% of the known hydrocarbon from shale formation. This represents more than $500B of potential oil and gas that cannot be economically produced for the US economy. The aim is to increase the efficiency of oil production by providing novel subsurface information to improve operational decision making. The resulting value increase for a producer can be up to $1M per well. In addition, it is possible to significantly reduce the environmental impact of the hydraulic fracturing process, which is currently only 50% efficient. By providing novel subsurface data for the industry, this information can reduce environmental impact by saving up to 45B gallons of fresh water and 1M rail cars of mined sand. Furthermore, the analysis of subsurface microbiomes is a rich area for new academic knowledge. Over 80% of the microbial strains identified in Phase I have never been documented in public references. This work not only provides economic and social value, but also expands scientific knowledge. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to use next-generation microbiome analyses to increase the efficiency of domestic oil production. The research objective is to analyze the subsurface hydrocarbon microbiome to characterize hydrocarbon reservoirs and leverage this new data source to increase current efficiency rates. The goal is to analyze 50 producing wells in the Southwestern US, and develop statistical models linking microbial profiles to key reservoir properties that can increase production efficiencies. The analytical method employed will utilize technology stemming from over $20 million in government funding to the University of Colorado used to create bioinformatics software known as \"QIIME.\" The QIIME technology has been extensively tested in analyzing and modeling the human microbiome, but has never been applied to the subsurface hydrocarbon microbiome prior to the Phase I work. By combining advances in cloud computing, DNA sequencing, and novel software analytics, this project will demonstrate that these microbial communities correlate to meaningful production parameters for the oil and gas industry. In so doing, the project will demonstrate at pilot scale that this new information source can be utilized as a novel, non-invasive, low-cost reservoir characterization tool that allows the industry to maximize hydrocarbon production while minimizing environmental impact.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project develops novel adaptive techniques for web-based learning materials, and creates Algebra and Statistics content using those techniques. College textbooks and homework are being replaced with web-based learning materials that are highly-interactive, involving animations, learning questions, and auto-generated auto-graded homework/quiz exercises. The project develops those exercises to adjust (adapt) to the learner's performance as well as to the learner's preferences, providing a novel structured form of adaptivity that maximizes learning efficiency while reducing student anxiety, in contrast to many other proposed adaptive techniques. The project creates new content for the topics of Algebra and for Statistics, two critical subjects with which many college students struggle. The result will be greater success (and less failure) in Algebra and Statistics courses by young college students, leading to more graduates in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields, which contribute greatly to the nation's productivity and competitiveness. The techniques can be applied to many other STEM and non-STEM subjects, and for learning beyond college courses too. This SBIR Phase II project develops novel adaptive techniques for web-based learning materials, called structured student-guided adaptive (SSGA) techniques. In contrast to some recent adaptive commercial products, SSGA preserves the ability of an instructor to maintain a structured path through the material, which is critical for keeping students in synch with lecture/discussion sessions, for enabling students to study with classmates, and more. Adaptivity comes in several forms, including auto-generating successively-harder problems based on correct completion of earlier problems, with explanations and source material carefully integrated to ensure students learn underlying concepts. Also, the adaptivity is in part guided by the student, who can choose to start with simpler or harder problems, or can auto-generate self-quizzes based on performance, selected material, and more. In contrast with other products, student-guided adaptivity gives students appropriate control over their learning, yielding a sense of empowerment and reducing anxiety that can inhibit learning. The project builds the authoring platform necessary to support SSGA material creation, building upon a previously-developed authoring framework for interactive web material. The project also creates new material for college algebra and statistics courses, whose high attrition rates can be reduced by replacing traditional textbooks/homework with SSGA material.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a new microscope that integrates biodynamic imaging with conventional phase contrast microscopy for use in drug development and other research applications. Accurately capturing the signatures of three-dimensional biological systems provides more realistic measures of drug efficacy and response heterogeneity - two critical aspects of the drug-development process that help find the right drug doses and combinations to kill cancer cells with minimal toxic side effects. This tool will extract functional information at greater tissue depths than conventional microscopies by using cellular motions inside living tissue. The motion is detected by reflected light that carries with it important information about the action of drugs inside 3D tissue, allowing drug evaluations in heterogeneous three-dimensional tissues systems, and providing new insights for pharmaceutical development. This SBIR Phase II project provides a tool capable of extracting high-content information from inside three-dimensional living tissue culture and tumor biopsies. It extracts this functional information at greater tissue depths than conventional microscopies by using Doppler tags on light scattered from intracellular motions inside living tissue. These novel Doppler tags carry phenotypic profiling information about the action of drugs inside 3D tissue, allowing drug evaluations in heterogeneous three-dimensional tissues and providing new insights for pharmaceutical development and therapeutics. The project goals are to construct a new type of microscope based on the detection of cellular motions, and to integrate the microscope with a software platform that is easy to use by customers. Upon completion of this Phase II, a commercial biodynamic microscope product will be ready for value-added resale of leading microscopes to life sciences customers.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will explore the applicability of a Gabor-domain optical coherence microscopy (GD-OCM) instrument to image and evaluate optical materials as part of the manufacturing process. The immediate broader impact of this project is to effectively provide both qualitative and quantitative information about product quality in manufacturing, with an initial focus on contact lens manufacturing. Providing high-speed, industrial, micrometer-level resolution in all three dimensions, GD-OCM enables contact lens manufacturers to replace multiple inspection steps with a single measurement done automatically, reducing the opportunity for damaging the samples and human error, and ultimately leading to increased productivity and yield. The resulting improvements in contact lens performance and extended wear effects are poised to have a positive impact on a significant percentage of the population. Recent evaluations of GD-OCM have indicated its ability to provide a new wealth of characterization methods for quality control of various materials that are otherwise impossible to characterize nondestructively, including gradient refractive index polymers, glass and layered structures. Additionally, GD-OCM will enable new advances in a wide variety of scientific fields via its capability to non-invasively optically section samples of a variety of material types. The objective of this Phase II project is to establish the effectiveness of the emerging GD-OCM technology for nondestructive on-line metrology of contact lenses in manufacturing. Quality control and detection of product-significant defects, and a corresponding increase in production yield, represent the value proposition for the introduction of GD-OCM instrumentation into the contact lens production environment. The project will result in two major outcomes: 1) implementation of a robust production-environment instrument to effectively provide micrometer-level resolution in all three dimensions and quantification of yield-relevant contact lens quality metrics not previously available in a single instrument; and 2) demonstration of the technology for inspection in a production environment to rapidly and accurately monitor defects and quantify contact lens quality using product relevant metrics. This nondestructive, on-line optical inspection system can have significant impact not only on the process control and thereby yield of contact lenses, but also in manufacturing of layered materials in general, including polymers, plastics, and glass. Longer-term, the technology offers new paths for tissue imaging, guided surgery, and monitoring of eye disease.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is an online, game-based program to improve the leadership skills of individuals in science, education, the military, government, and industry. Leadership skills are key to innovation, efficiency, and effectiveness in all organizations. The program being developed is built on a proven leadership model and converts that traditional model into a role-playing game. The empirically tested model consists of three basic strategies and six practices that expand leaders' perspectives and enhance their problem-solving skills. The program uses a futuristic narrative, 3D-animated multimedia, and challenging leadership dilemmas to engage learners, who play the role of a novice world leader. The program provides instruction in leadership, and then learners apply their new leadership skills to build an alliance among warring factions and collectively solve a global problem. A series of game quests test learners' understanding, and they receive immediate feedback on all decisions and actions. Learners communicate through social media tools with other players and, at the end, participate in a virtual synchronous debriefing exercise with peers and trained facilitators to ensure full comprehension. An administrative dashboard provides real-time performance data. The game is scalable, accessible, and designed for repeat playability. The most profound innovation of this project is that it conceptualizes, designs, and develops a system of game mechanics and algorithms that mimic the facilitator-led human aspect of a research-based, face-to-face model of leadership training. This design entails building out a backend system as an artificial intelligence tool designed to guide users engaging with instructional materials, anticipate player actions, make recommendations on actions and anticipated actions, and provide feedback similar to guidance an on-site facilitator would provide. Furthermore, the game logic supports multiple paths to success, with some paths being more efficient, optimal, elegant, or otherwise more appropriate choices. The game logic and technical design are built to reflect problem solving and leadership in the real world, which is largely based on open-ended decision making. The game mechanics and related backend technology are designed to support open-ended decision-making, thus making game play both more engaging and authentic for players. A final innovation is the linking of an asynchronous online video game learning experience with virtual facilitator-led synchronous debriefing, which can be done on a worldwide scale. The program will be tested as a global collaboration exercise with both high school students and corporate leaders.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project represents a revolutionary advance in adaptive educational technology systems by using data collected from previous exercises to automatically generate hints and feedback for students. This work addresses the SBIR Educational Technologies and Applications subtopic EA5 - Learning and Assessment by making adaptive learning widely available and by providing tools to assess student performance in order to make interventions as early as possible and help students succeed. While it is well known that adaptive Computer Based Training (CBT) is more efficient and more effective, it has traditionally been cost prohibitive to produce in most domains. By leveraging the latest research in Big Data analytics and Educational Data Mining (EDM), this project will produce adaptive capabilities automatically, dramatically reducing the costs of producing more effective training and making such training widely available. The core customers for this technology will be providers of training systems. This includes publishing organizations, developers of software tools for education, and providers of corporate and government training. Institutions that are struggling to educate students, particularly across STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, will be able to use this technology in their existing teaching systems and thus improve student engagement and performance. The final outcome of this project will be an integrated set of software tools that collect data from existing computer/web based training software, and automatically generate adaptive capabilities to create a personalized learning environment for students. It does this by using novel EDM and machine learning techniques to build and organize student and problem models that improve over time as more data is collected. It also provides for the tracking of student progress on specific concepts or skills (knowledge tracing), allowing for easy assessment at any point in time. The system also dynamically selects the students' next problems to maximize student learning and minimize time needed to master a set of skills (problem selection). For complex multi-step problems, this system will provide context-specific, just-in-time hints to help students as they learn. The final product will include data adapters that allow developers of existing software to seamlessly connect with this system. Finally, a main differentiator of this system is the transparent process of data curation and the related visualization tools that expose the problem- and student-model generation process. This combination of human input and machine learning will provide researchers, developers, and educators tools to explore student data and allow for new insights into how students learn.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is focused on the continued development of biologically grown masonry units as a commercially-viable and sustainable alternative to traditional fired masonry materials. This product is grown in ambient temperatures utilizing a natural calcium carbonate cement formation induced by a urease-producing microorganism. The Phase II project will focus on material testing and further optimization and cost reduction of biocement products, with the intention of demonstrating pilot manufacturing and rapid commercialization via licensee manufacturers. Using biologic products and fermentation procedures developed in the Phase I effort, improvements will be made to scale up manufacturing and reduce cost in the manufacturing process. The commercial potential of this technology is critically dependent on achieving cost and performance parity, if not superiority, with traditional materials. Each year, 1.23 trillion fired bricks are produced globally for use in construction, resulting in over 800 million tons of carbon emissions. The societal impacts of this research would include a dramatic reduction in these emissions, as well as a corresponding reduction in industrial by-product waste. This project will enhance the technological understanding for commercial viability and test data including durability and physical performance. Technical objectives for this effort include evaluation of the resulting biocement masonry products through rigorous American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) testing methods, reduction of raw material costs through continued optimization, creation of in-house production capability for the requisite biologic product, and the creation and testing of a manufacturing process suitable for transition to licensees. Main focus areas of the Phase II project include rigorous material testing for physical performance, weathering and durability, in-house production of robust raw material constituents, and commercial testing coupled with pilot manufacturing. Rigorous ASTM testing methods will be done at two accredited labs, and labor requirements will be reduced via the adoption of lean automation in the production process. Additionally, the utilization of existing material handing manufacturing equipment at licensee facilities, where possible, will be evaluated. Expected project results will include a comprehensive statistical analysis of multiple physical samples, as well as a corresponding failure analysis. Additional expected deliverables include the successful commission of in-house pilot scale manufacturing for biocement constituents as a simplified additive to be used by commercial partners and licensees.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project proposes to discover digital methods to personalize reading instruction such that students understand more when they read, retain knowledge, and build lasting skills. The academic research on reading supports the claim that active reading strategies that incorporate quality instruction can benefit students. However, instruction is usually not personalized to meet the needs of specific students, and even when an educator works 1:1 with a student they can only interpret a limited number of signals from a student to help guide instruction. The objective of the project is to take in several inputs when students read digitally and investigate whether personalized reading instruction can effectively be created and delivered such that students get extra help when they struggle and are challenged when they can succeed on their own. Two-thirds of students in the U.S. are struggling readers; they cannot understand the main idea when they read. These students are four times more likely to drop out of school. People who read critically have more success in school, obtain high quality jobs, and are able to contribute more to expand social resources. Researchers and educators have been trying to solve the \"reading gap\" for decades, but only now does the technology exist to make this possible. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to use unique machine learning techniques to personalize reading instruction. The algorithms to personalize instruction will ensure that extra help, or scaffolding, is allocated to the students who need it, and removed when they no longer need it or when it threatens to become a crutch. This approach is different than other machine learning algorithms, which are built to minimize the overall error or maximize the overall reward. However, what is required for personalized reading instruction is different. The algorithm must learn how much to help a student not so they perform better with help, but so they perform better without it because the goal is for students to become better readers in the long term, not become reliant on scaffolding to read. The objective of the research is to fully develop and commercialize this personalized reading system and will involve data science, application development, and content authoring.",

In addition to hurricane forecasting, the data will have general oceanographic applications, and the dropsonde can be fitted with a dissolved oxygen sensor that may be used to map areas of hypoxia, with application to fisheries and the fishing industry. In Phase II, Boston Engineering will design, test and refine MASED prototypes, and will demonstrate operation under actual conditions.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Each day, enormous amounts of information are generated, and the rate at which this happens continues to increase.  Much of the information is unstructured text, which is exceptionally difficult to use. The challenge of exploiting high volume unstructured text is especially significant for military, government and private sector analysts. To actually perform analysis within narrow operational deadlines, analysts first need to identify relevant information against a background of high levels of noise.     In the Building Open-domain Semantic Search (BOSS) project, we are building a next-generation semantic search capability that efficiently labels and indexes all concepts expressed in unstructured text. By using raw data to develop a model of possible concepts, BOSS can easily adapt to many domains and languages. With BOSS-based indexed concepts, users can search for the ideas they are interested in, rather than being restricted to keywords, which can be ambiguous and do not uniquely identify relevant concepts. In addition to indexing concepts, BOSS also structures data, identifying entities, events and the relations between them. Our goal in Phase II of this effort is to refine and operationalize this concept-based retrieval technology developed in Phase I and to deliver this capability to our customers.  BENEFIT:  Military, government and private sector analysts must work with and process an overwhelming amount of unstructured text, and the rate at which that text is produced is increasing. Current information extraction (IE) and information retrieval (IR) tools are insufficient for modern analysis needs because they are either too restricted to specific tasks or too broad to produce analysis-ready results.   In the Building Open-domain Semantic Search (BOSS) proposal, we describe a next-generation semantic search tool. This tool retrieves concepts, not keywords, from unstructured text. Searching over concepts retrieves more relevant information while limiting the amount of irrelevant information. This is because, unlike keywords, concepts can uniquely identify the many different forms of an idea an analyst is looking for without requiring complex handmade queries. Retrieved text will be semantically structured so that it identifies relationships between the events, entities and ideas discussed. These analysis-ready results will dramatically reduce the time analysts spend reading and filtering text. Finally, user modeling tailors search results to maximize user-specific relevance. By the end of Phase II, we will have built a high-TRL, operational-quality concept retrieval system that will allow analysts to more thoroughly exploit text from any genre or domain.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Simulations supporting Close Air Support (CAS) training and the Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) training are laborious to configure and expensive to manage with live personnel, which results in training that is limited in scope. For example, current simulations, like the Indirect Fire Forward Observer Trainer (I-FACT), require numerous observer/controllers to participate as White Force players in the simulation, driving up the manpower cost of conducting JTAC training. To fulfill the roles, communications, and behaviors of White Force participants in simulation-based training environments, we conducted a Phase I effort to design and demonstrate a full-scope Constructive Logic and Behavior Engine for Efficient and Responsive Training (COLBERT). In Phase I, we successfully established the feasibility of our approach by providing a graphical development and run-time environment to construct and execute CAS-related behavior models. COLBERT integrated our in-house, intelligent agent platform AgentWorks with the popular video game engine Unity, and included experience management tools that support Trainers across the multiple phases of training development. Based on the successful completion of Phase I, we propose a Phase II effort to design, develop, and evaluate COLBERT. In Phase II, we will deliver an initial set of simulation-based tools to support JTAC training. BENEFIT: COLBERT will provide immediate and tangible benefits to training developers by supporting effective and cost-efficient training across a wide range of domains and simulation environments, including the Joint Terminal Attack Controller Training Rehearsal System being developed at AFRL. COLBERT will also provide considerable benefit for other simulation-based training, including flight and space maintenance simulation training. In addition, we plan to enhance our user-friendly agent development environment, AgentWorks, with training capabilities that will increase its appeal in both the simulation-based training and entertainment (e.g., video games) markets.",

If the results of the studies proposed in this application support our Phase I findings that phage biocontrol is effective in significantly reducing larval shellfish mortalities, then we will have a strong basis for moving forward with a Phase III SBIR project and product commercialization. The main thrusts of a Phase III proposal will be to further scale-up phage production for commercial distribution and to complete the process of obtaining regulatory approvals for marketing VTP-200. At the end of Phase III, it is anticipated that a new product will be commercially available to fight V. tubiashii and V. coralliilyticus contamination in hatcheries to significantly reduce shellfish mortalities. This new technological development is expected to increase productivity of the hatcheries and reduce interruptions in supply of shellfish seed for commercial shellfish growers. Ultimately, it will provide a more steady supply of shellfish to the consumer.",

        "abstract": "Soilless growth mediums widely used throughout the horticultural industry are either synthetic in origin, or require synthetic chemicals and energy-intensive processing. Ecovative&#39;s biomaterial aims to displace these non-renewable, energy-intensive, materials using its product consisting of a self-assembling, moldable mass of fungal mycelium. Mycelium act as a biological resin, binding together domestic agricultural lignocellulosic waste, providing the foundation of a 100% bio-based, home biodegradable soilless growth medium. Fungal soilless grow medium has three distinct competitive advantages over the current state of the art (SOTA): it is low cost, uses waste streams as its primary inputs, and is completely biodegradable after use.Having successfully completed a Phase I grant examining the material characteristics of the medium, (optimal substrate(s), density, and particle size) we are now able to address scaling this technology. Recent testing indicated that the product is within reach of all key metrics, enabling this technology as market-ready. Scaled manufacturing of this product will necessitate constructing custom equipment to facilitate rapid and reproducible handling and treatment of each unit sold. In addition, we will assess and finalize the optimization of all relevant growth and post treatment parameters for production implementation. Achieving these technical objectives will guarantee that we are bringing a product to market a product that maximizes performance while minimizing cost and environmental impact.The absorbent mycological composite technology aims to provide a new technology that enhances food production by developing an improved, and sustainable production system through a biological manufacturing technology as well as providing a green alternative to the current synthetic materials in agricultural use. This biotechnology gives American agriculture a value-add product for current domestic waste streams, it reduces their dependence on foreign oil, and provides the industry with a biotechnology product that can be exported to support global agriculture, continuing to give the sector a positive trade balance in the US economy. Ecovative&#39;s biomaterial is experiencing market pull from international agricultural firms, which could further exports of US agricultural byproducts that are transformed in this revolutionary manufacturing process. Development completed in Phase I will directly inform the material samples supplied to a collaborating leader in the agricultural industry for pilot trials. The success of this project will derive from Ecovative&#39;s capacity to leverage its low embodied energy manufacturing, and mycelium-based intellectual property portfolio and expertise in commercializing low-cost, high-performance, compostable biomaterials.",

        "abstract": "Numerous ground-test and wind-tunnel facilities are used extensively to make surface measurements of and to characterize the forces and moments encountered by aeronautics test articles. Quantitative results in these test environments are required to validate the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools that are used to extrapolate wind-tunnel data toward realistic flight conditions and hardware.  The development of fast instrumentation and measurement capabilities that can readily be integrated into the extreme conditions present under such test conditions is one of several major technological challenges associated with the design, building, and operation of these complex test environments.  Among the host of physical quantities, accurate mapping of velocity flow fields remains a significant yet essential challenge in these facilities.  In addition, spatially and temporally resolved measurements of other flow parameters, such as gas density, pressure, temperature, and species mixing fractions, are of paramount importance to characterize fully the fluid dynamics.  Unfortunately, the widely available current suite of flow-field probes exhibit varying degrees of intrusiveness, requiring either the physical placement of probes inside the test facility or the introduction of foreign particles or gas-phase species into the flow field.  Thus, the development and application of non-invasive flow-field diagnostic probe techniques is of principal importance in these environments.  This proposal expands upon our successful Phase-I results and offers an integrated package of truly cutting-edge, multidimensional, seedless velocimetry and flow diagnostics for ground-test facilities.  The concepts and ideas proposed range from proof-of-principle demonstration of novel methodologies using kHz-rate femtosecond (10-15 sec) and 100-kHz-rate burst-mode picosecond (10-12 s) duration laser sources to measurements in realistic tunnel conditions expected in the current solicitation.",

The overall goal of RAFT is to provide objectivity and actionable equivalence for system of system (SoS) owners through cost effective, automated and maximally correct simulation functional verification. The technical goal of RAFT is to create accurate high-level behavioral abstractions of a simulation that can be automatically compared to provide measures of functional equivalence and can be stored, disseminated and depicted as standard model based system engineering representations (MBSE). It fills an existing gap in modeling and simulation (M&S) functional verification and validation (V&V) technology and tools, like the unified modeling language (UML) and systems modeling language (SysML), addressing a shortfall in automated tools to descriptively and rapidly support the verification of functional behavior of models and model data. It is directed at simulation stakeholders who want rapid, coarse grained visibility of a models functional behavior, reducing V&V complexity, cost, and increasing reliability and correctness of the models. Rapid verification is critical to weapons systems as their models expected fidelity, resolution and behaviors must be reliable during test events.

        "abstract": "Successful use of energy dense torrefied biomass to produce drop-in coal replacement fuel has proved difficult for two reasons: 1) overheating of dies during densification, and 2) inability to produce water-resistant pellets. As a result, most torrefaction companies use a binder to reduce the die friction and/or to make densified product water resistant. Also, the majority of torrefaction companies use clean wood chips or sawdust as feedstock, adding to production costs. In Phase I research HM3 Energy had encouraging results producing sturdy, somewhat water-resistant briquettes on commercial densification equipment with batch-torrefied juniper forest waste. Die temperature control was tested and an inexpensive post-conditioning process that doesn&#39;t use binders was implemented. The briquettes performed well in 6&#39; drop tests after 24-hour water soaks.Economical and reliable torrefaction and densification are key to commercial briquette production. We have designed a bigger 500 lbs./hour mass flow torrefier for easy scale up. It will be installed at a new demonstration facility with other key pieces of commercial size or easily scalable commercial design. During Phase II we will link together these key parts of our technology: torrefaction, densification and post-densification conditioning into one continuous operation to determine effects on torrefier residence time and temperature, die temperature control and post-densification conditioning, to consistently produce truly hard and water resistant briquettes. The briquettes will be test burned at a pulverized coal combustion facility which models the operation of large pulverized coal power plants. We will also determine uniform hot gas distribution across the bed for scale up of the torrefier to 2 tons/hour. Success could lead to significant production cost savings necessary to make torrefied biomass a viable drop-in coal replacement fuel.",

        "abstract": "Sorghum is a drought- and heat-tolerant crop that can help meet global needs for food, feed, and fuel. However, sorghum lags behind other crops in making progress in breeding for increased yield and improved traits. Heartland Plant Innovations is developing a robust system for producing and utilizing Sorghum Doubled Haploids (SDHs), a non-transgenic approach that greatly accelerates plant breeding. DH breeding systems are widely used in crops such as corn, but totally lacking for sorghum. Developing a SDH production system will offer a quicker route to new, improved hybrids with increased yields for farmers. In Phase I, HPI discovered a Haploid Inducing Pollinator (HIP1) that induces formation of viable haploid seeds in diverse lines of sorghum. Working with collaborators, HPI will use HIP1 to develop and implement an efficient pilot scale SDH system for breeding and genetics. This will be accomplished through research and development focused on the following objectives: 1) Confirm and characterize haploid-inducing pollinators identified during Phase I, determine the genetic basis for haploid induction by these lines and improve their performance; 2) Plan and execute a 2nd year of field trials to expand the hunt for useful pollinators; 3) Develop and integrate components of a commercial SDH breeding system, including seed sorting and chromosome doubling; 4) Develop a plan for marketing HPI&#39;s SDH breeding system to customers.Sorghum breeders who are working to deliver new inbreds and hybrids to farmers would greatly benefit from incorporating SDH lines into their programs. SDH lines could be used to accelerate traditional breeding, or to rapidly introgress high-value traits for resistance to diseases, insects or abiotic stress. Success with the proposed sorghum DH research will permit expansion of HPI&#39;s customer base to include sorghum breeders around the world. HPI expects to market production of SDHs on demand, or to partner with others in making DH technology available for customers to use.",

        "abstract": "The Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service describe cheatgrass as \"the invader that won the West\". This highly invasive annual grass is present or dominant on some 100 million acres in the Great Basin and Intermountain West and land managers estimate its spread is increasing by 12-14% annually. Cheatgrass (and its annual bromegrass relatives) are a principal driving force behind epidemic wildfires occurring with much greater frequency and magnitude across the region and is largely responsible for the rapid decline of the sagebrush-steppe ecosystem; one of the nation&#39;s largest. This vast area of the Western U.S encompasses much of the nation&#39;s forest and grazing land resources and is home to more than 350 species of birds and mammals, all of which are dependent on the habitat and health of this ecosystem, widely considered to be on the verge of collapse. Cheatgrass is also predicted to be the invasive grass species most likely to expand its range with climate change to the detriment of native rangeland and forests. Losses of grazing lands, forest products, recreational opportunities, and other ecosystem services due to cheatgrass invasion total in the billions of dollars annually. Cheatgrass impacted lands become more susceptible to erosion, causing increased sedimentation in the region&#39;s fragile water systems. The cost of controlling cheatgrass, resultant fires, and subsequent land reclamation efforts is enormous. Controlof cheatgrass and reclamation efforts with native speciesare often ephemeral and ultimately ineffective. Traditional control methods rely heavily on the repeated use of synthetic herbicides. In this Phase IIprojectWestscape proposes an integrative novel approach thatwould provideland managers with the ability to treat cheatgrass-infested landsprior to emergence and establishment of the invasivespecieswith a naturally-occurring OMRI-listed product, while simultaneously enhancing the competiveness and sustainabilityof native species. In its Phase II work, Westscape (in conjunction with its two strategic partners) will refine the processes and technologies demonstrated in its Phase I project to produce two products for the target market;the firstproductwill be used as a one time, pre-emergent treatment of cheatgrass-infested lands that will suppress the germination and establishment of the invasive speciesanda companion product consistingof native seeds coated witha proprietary polymericformulation that will provide a competitive advantage to the native species. Westscape will establish field trials at three locations to demonstrate the efficacy of the products including a USDA-NRCS supervisedtrial that will provide independent data and testing,andfacilitate outreach and contact with target markets. If the primary goals of the proposed researchare met, these products wouldrepresent a paradigm shift in how cheatgrass-infested lands are controlled and revegetated with native species. If successful, acceptance of this proposed technology and processes by public and private land managers could result in substantial cost-savings to the public in terms of improved ecological services and recreational opportunities, improved grazing and forest lands, reduction in wildfire damage and expense of control, reduction of impacts on affected communities, and a reduction in the use of synthetics herbicides.",

        "abstract": "This research effort seeks to develop a non-toxic and biobased solution to the biofouling problem through the development of novel soy-based polymers that release biofouling when exposed to visible light.Biofouling, the unwanted growth of biological organisms on underwater surfaces, has long been recognized as a major problem for commercial aquaculture. Biofouling dramatically increases labor costs, reduces the value of product, and can harm cultured species. Fouling clogs gear, stops water flow and food delivery, can complete with culture organisms for food or space, and can directly affect the growth and survival of cultured organisms As a result, considerable physical and economic effort is directed toward the prevention and control of biofouling at culture facilities. Cleaning of gear and use of toxic coatings are the primary methods employed by the industry to maintain biofouling-free surfaces. Time and energy expended to keep gear clean taxes aquaculturalists consuming as much as 30% of labor costs and contributing 15% to operational costs. Non-toxic solutions to the biofouling problem that prevent growth for 12 months, are compatible with aquaculture gear, and are affordable do not exist.Phase I research demonstrated the feasibility us using soy-based polymers as photoactive release coatings for biofouling control. These polymers are engineered to react with visible light and release biofouling by the gradual breakdown of the surface binder resin catalyzed by the photochemical generation of peroxides for polymer scission. Phase II research seeks to optimize soy-based photoactive release coatings (SPRC) for use on aquaculture gear, confirm non-toxic claims, demonstrate long-life antifouling at aquaculture operations in different regions of the United States, and conduct demonstration projects with industry partners.Improved production efficiencies for the US aquaculture industry are needed as the cost of production continues to increase, while market prices remain the same or, as experienced more recently, have decreased due to increased competition on a global scale. The proposed non-toxic approach to prevent biofouling of aquaculture gear will improve production efficiency, and thus increase competitiveness of aquaculture in the United States. Eliminating costs associated with cleaning or changing gear used for growing shellfish and finfish by application of the proposed non-toxic antifouling technology will increase profitability of these farms. Improved animal health will result from clean nets and cages through better flow of nutrients and waste products. Most importantly, this research will provide a safe and cost-effective alternative to copper; the primary antifouling agent relied upon globally for farming finfish.Potential commercial applications for the proposed non-toxic biofouling release coating include netting used for fish farming (barrier and market), cages and bags used for oyster farming, lantern nets used for scallop farming, buoys and lines used for mussel and algae farming, barrier nets and bags used for clam farming, floating upweller systems (FLUPSY), fishing nets and traps, oceanographic equipment, and boat hulls.",

The resulting capabilities will be improved data analysis and human-cyber-physical system interaction. Prior experience and new research has already shown that ECIs innovative tools suite will be clearly adaptive to knowledge discovery, integration algorithms, hypothesis generation, and visualization algorithms.  The DoD has increasingly emphasized automation of tasks that have been performed historically by humans, including data analysis. However, the area of human-cyber-physical system interaction is one which has proven difficult, but also important to the DoDs continued success. The cyber-physical systems are highly complex, resulting in complicated data output and providing a significant obstacle to human analysts understanding of these systems.

Measurements that are capable of informing climate science require extremely high precision.

        "abstract": "Combustion Research and Flow Technology, Inc. (CRAFT Tech) and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) have teamed up to provide DTRA with an innovative approach to develop new combined effects explosives (CEX) formulations. CEX represent a class of recently-developed aluminized explosives seeking to provide the performance of both (i) high-energy explosives and (ii) high-blast explosives in a single explosive fill. Given the critical role played by fast aluminum (and other metallic additives) reactions in the very early stages of CEX detonation and the strong sensitivity of CEX performance to variations in CEX ingredients, the development of a validated high-fidelity CEX design tool capable of accounting for size effects and finite-rate chemistry effects is proposed. This approach combines advanced modeling capabilities and time-resolved small-scale testing in order to identify and tune the dominant design variables leading to an optimal CEX formulation. By relying on validated first-principles numerical simulations that describe detonation, anaerobic reaction and aerobic reaction, the proposed CEX design tool is capable of providing a level of understanding of the complex detonation event that is not attainable with currently available simplified modeling approaches.",

        "abstract": "The Armed Forces have a clear need for unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) that can autonomously accompany a soldier or vehicle during maneuvers through complex environments. Such UGVs will help solve logistical problems such as individual soldiers needing to transport more equipment and supplies than they can carry in a backpack. While various semi-autonomous leader-follower prototypes have been developed in recent years, current systems remain unreliable, cumbersome, and unable to adapt, trading off an operators physical burden for an increased cognitive workload, and eroding the operators trust in the system. The team of Charles River Analytics and 5D Robotics proposes to develop a Multi-modal Interface for Natural Operator Teaming with Autonomous Robots (MINOTAUR). MINOTAUR fuses multiple proven leader-tracking and robot control technologies to provide a natural and reliable hands-free soldier-machine interface (SMI) for soldiers operating in challenging environments. In particular, the system fuses state-of-the-art camera (EO/IR), 2D LIDAR, and ultra-wide band (UWB) beacon based leader-following technologies to eliminate typical failure modes in leader following solutions. The system fuses context cues with inputs from multiple control modalities (e.g., voice and gesture commands) to infer the operators intent in ambiguous situations and provide an appropriate level of robot feedback.",

Compared to existing IQIs and methods, the new approaches will more comprehensively, automatically and objectively measure the image quality by measuring more aspects and providing quantitative measures with one exposure.  Limitations of existing methods include a subjective, work-intensive and thereby inconsistent, determination of image quality, and an inability to comprehensively measure image quality of every radiographic exposure due to the inordinate person-power that is necessary.  The Phase II project will involve fabrication and testing of the new IQIs, and development, testing and deployment of the first software product.  A comprehensive and self-contained version of the software product will be developed and deployed at testbed sites, including the Boeing facility.  A commercial product line that includes the IQIs and software will be developed in Phase III.  BENEFIT:  For military aircraft the new methods, IQI's and software will eliminate subjectivity and inconsistencies in radiograph image quality verifications. They will enable the capability to measure image quality of radiographs as a routine procedure during the inspection protocol, and potentially so with every radiograph exposure. A market  exists for providing the IQI's and software to military and commercial aircraft manufacturers, their suppliers, their customers and many other industries that use CR for NDT.",

        "abstract": "Crude Sulfated Turpentine (CST) is a by-product of the Kraft wood pulping process, and its derivatives (e.g., terpenes such as alpha pinene) are used as fragrances in commercial products ranging from cosmetics to detergents. They can also be, and are, catalytically transformed into valuable chemicals by hydrogenation, oxidation and isomerization reactions. However, turpentine and its derivatives contain small but significant quantities of sulfur, which degrades the potency of the pinenes used as fragrances. Sulfur is also a highly potent catalyst poison that deactivates the precious metal and metal oxide catalysts used in the conversion processes. Hence there is need to remove sulfur from CST and pinene fractions in order to convert CST a waste stream from paper mills into a value added product.TDA isdeveloping a new, high capacity, regenerable sorbent to remove sulfur species from alpha pinene, and potentially from other terpene derivatives as well so that they can beconverted into value added chemicals.In this SBIR Phase II project, we will scale-up both the sorbent preparation methods develope din Phase I and demonstrate the sorbent&#39;s performance in an integrated system to assess the full capabilities of the desulfurizer and to turn the concept into a practical device.

        "abstract": "It is understood that an autonomous unmanned air, ground, or sea vehicles can incur a near infinite decision space that is difficult to capture completely in extensive simulation. The response of these vehicles to untrained environments can potentially have unintended consequences to adversely affect safety. This is of particular concern when these vehicles are considered for collaborative manned/unmanned teaming missions. For such systems, a run time verification engine may be developed to ensure the safety of human life by constraining the output of the autonomous algorithm to guarantee actions are correct, interpretable, and recoverable. The autonomous algorithm combined with the failsafe mechanism is intended to improve the robustness of autonomous systems to unknown environments and unexpected events. However, if such a failsafe/recovery mechanism existed, what evaluation systems are available to test their viability and robustness The intent of this solicitation is to develop a verification method to examine the robustness of a run time safety algorithm.     The first objective is to examine the techniques presented in [1][2] and apply them to an autonomous unmanned vehicle model that includes a learning trajectory generation algorithm. The techniques in [1] present a method to protect the behavior of an adaptive / learning function. The techniques in [2][3] present methods to analyze the robustness of the implemented safety algorithm.  Due to the dependence of autonomous systems on historical state data, current simulation environments require the need for extensive run times to reach a potential unintended operating region. Additionally, as a greater quantity of information is fused and utilized by the autonomous algorithm to make decisions, gradual, unintended data streams may induce state conditions that may cause an unsafe or unpredictable response.  A key capability must be to rapidly re-stimulate the system to an untrained, unintended, or erroneous operating state in order to assess the robustness of the run time safety algorithm.     The verification algorithm must implement:      A method to introduce specific logical or run time operating states that induce an algorithm failure.     A mechanism for recording and initializing systems to specific states.     An interface control description that emulates real world sensor outputs to be provided to the system under test.

This is expected to spur widespread adoption of solid state lighting which, according to the US Department of Energy, could result in electricity savings equal to the output of 44 gigawatt power plants by 2027. The price for LEDs is slowing adoption. LEDs don't typically need to be better; they need to be cheaper. This project could directly address this adoption problem by lowering the cost of making LEDs by eliminating one of the most expensive steps in the LED production process. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the technical problems in Gallium Nitride (GaN) based light emitting diodes (LEDs), namely using traditional buffer layers to grow GaN on non-GaN substrates. Traditional approaches are typically expensive and result in crystalline defects because the buffer materials used are non-ductile crystalline structures which very effectively propagate, rather than annihilate, defects. This project develops a new substrate made with a patented crystalline metal and process that will let the manufacturers spend less time and effort to get the same or even better LED crystalline quality than they can achieve today. Low cost growth techniques are used and to reduce defects in GaN LEDs and to improve the dollar per kilolumen cost to performance metric.",

The developed error-correction solutions will enable flash-memory-based devices to have higher capacities, higher reliability, and faster speeds at lower power while driving down the cost. This will have a major impact on mobile computing capabilities and enterprise storage by improving the efficiency and reliability of data centers, servers, and mission-critical storage that incorporate flash memories. Improved enterprise storage boosts the efficiency and growth of IT businesses, e-commerce, and financial trade. The solutions will also enable reduced power consumption and heat dissipation leading to greener systems. The benefits of the error-correction solutions are also applicable to the hard disk drive and communications industries. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and validate novel low-density parity-check (LDPC)-based error-correction for flash memory-based solid state drives (SSDs). SSDs are rapidly being deployed for both enterprise and consumer storage due to their fast speeds, low power, and low heat dissipation. But they bring numerous technical challenges stemming from the fact that reducing flash memory cell sizes leads to an unavoidable degradation in the reliability. With a trend of increasing die density to enable higher storage capacities, the industry is swiftly moving towards adopting LDPC codes to provide more powerful error-correction. However existing LDPC solutions use complex post-processing and multiple reads to bring down the error rates to the desired levels which lowers the read speeds, making them unattractive for future SSDs. Novel binary LDPC-based solutions will be developed for a range of parameters, and validated in hardware. The design method will be extended to develop new non-binary LDPC solutions which provide even greater reliability enhancements, leading to greater endurance in SSDs.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will reduce energy consumption in buildings and automobiles via 'smart' solar control window films. The effects of solar heating are frequently experienced on sunny warm days when the inside temperature of a car can exceed 130\u00b0F in minutes. The same solar heating that is such a nuisance in summer is very much desired in winter. The national problem is that buildings consume more than 41% of all energy produced (more than 50% directly for heating, cooling, and lighting) which leads to an estimated 2,236M metric tons of greenhouse gases. Additionally, 80% of buildings that exist today will exist in 20 years, many of which are inefficient and outdated. This necessitates a retrofittable smart solar control film. The consequence of installing smart solar control film is that the sun's warmth can be harnessed when it is needed and reflected away when it is unneeded. Installing these highly transparent films will have significant energy savings in space heating, cooling, and lighting. If smart solar control films are implemented, the Department of Energy estimates as much as 1.0 quadrillion BTUs ($10B in cost savings) can be saved annually. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on commercializing a family of doped nanoceramic materials that exhibit near-room temperature metal-to-insulator phase transitions. Slight changes to the composition of matter produce remarkably tunable thermochromic transitions over a broad range of temperatures, filling a key technological gap for their deployment as a smart solar control window film. No visible change occurs during the transition from the low-temperature/infrared transparent (insulating-like phase) to the high-temperature/infrared reflective (metal-like phase), and vice versa. The nanomaterials are also of sufficient stability, optical clarity, and compatible with commonly used polymers found in film. Phase II efforts address optimizing the composition of matter for peak performance and developing a unique in-line nanomanufacturing process compatible with scalable production and achieving more precise control. In order for these materials to perform correctly they need to be of the correct elemental composition and be in the form of nanoparticles of the correct size. The films will be optimized and then thoroughly tested in the laboratory and in the field for their performance, stability, optical clarity, and a wide variety of application-specific performance requirements.",

Current technologies are not poised to be able to meet the speed and stability needs of the projected growth in Internet data volumes and access speed requirements. These are currently growing well beyond a Moore's Law pace. Needed is a disruptive approach to optical switching that will allow data management to keep pace with market needs. Ability to delivery this essential capability will provide not only essential international leadership in internet services, but also avail companies involved in the innovation to make a substantial commercial impact directly for their shareholders and to those of their partners and affiliates. This Small Business Innovation Research phase II project is an effort to cross the chasm between fundamental new physics insights relating to the structure of matter and an aggressive approach to commercializing 'Semiconductors of Light' in an emerging market for high density optical interconnects priced for datacenters. Until recently, the only known photonic bandgap solids were photonic crystal structures consisting of regularly repeating, orderly lattices of dielectric materials. It was generally assumed that crystal order was essential to have photonic bandgaps. This longstanding assumption is now known to be false. New photonic bandgap structures, characterized by suppressed density fluctuations (hyperuniformity), include disordered structures that are isotropic. This means that light propagates the same way through the photonic solid independent of direction (which is impossible for a photonic crystal). While the layout of waveguides in conventional photonic crystal and quasi crystal photonic bandgap materials is tightly-constrained to follow characteristic crystal axes, the layout rules for hyper uniform disordered solid waveguides have no such fundamental constraints. The universal protocol and highly-efficient computational framework covering the full range of photonic crystal, quasi crystal , and hyper uniform disordered solid-based photonic bandgaps will be generalized to a broad class of critically important photonic components by the application of a powerful new gradient-free optimization methods.",

FRP rebar offers significant performance advantages when compared to uncoated steel rebar. These advantages include a sevenfold weight reduction, no corrosion - which in turn permits a 30% reduction in concrete usage (and a corresponding 15 billion ton reduction in CO2 emissions) - and equivalent tensile strength at smaller diameters compared to steel rebar products. FRP rebar is being produced but has limited market acceptance due to its high cost. The high-speed process to be developed in this project will allow price parity when compared to uncoated steel and enable a hundredfold improvement in process speeds compared to current FRP manufacturing. Combined, these improvements will allow entry to the $140 billion global market for steel rebar and allow mass market adoption of FRP rebar. Additionally, basalt mine waste will be explored and, where possible, utilized as a raw material for fiber production. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes job creation and environmental impacts. With implementation of this process up to 35 manufacturing jobs can be created immediately. The company's high speed process combines a thermoset resin and basalt fiber as primary reinforcements within the FRP composite. A consortium of pultruders has collectively organized the Fiber Reinforced Polymer Rebar Manufacturers Council and has developed FRP rebar into a viable product over the last 20 years, with a $1.2 billion market at present. Currently, no FRP rebar product is offered at price parity with uncoated steel rebar, and to reach this price parity a high speed process has been invented. This novel process will be optimized and further developed by the completion of this Phase II SBIR project. Basalt fiber, an emerging material with the potential to replace carbon and other fibers in a variety of applications will be brought into large-scale industrial usage with the completion of this project. The Phase I project permitted the determination of the performance characteristics of thermoset resins which have not been commonly used in pultrusion, enabling product validation.

Modern SWIR technology has existed for more than 40 years, but its expense has limited its use to the military and large corporations; this project is grounded in the belief that when everyone has access to SWIR technology, the benefits to society are exponential. SWIR image sensors have potential applications in food safety analysis (e.g., identifying harmful adulterated foods and revealing sub-surface flaws in produce), manufacturing (e.g., sorting), security (e.g., night vision), medical sensing (e.g., vein mapping and blood oxygenation monitoring), and the automotive field (e.g., night/inclement weather vision systems and for self-driving vehicles). A low-cost sensor will open the SWIR imaging market to players in these fields who have so far been shut out due to price. In addition, a low-cost, high-quality sensor will also make SWIR imaging directly available to the general public for the first time ever in the form of a SWIR camera smartphone add-on, establishing a new market for SWIR imaging. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will produce low-cost germanium (Ge)-based shortwave infrared (SWIR) image sensors with features superior to those of currently available SWIR sensors. The research objective is to resolve issues of resolution, power usage, size, and sensitivity that limit advancement in the SWIR imaging field. This project will address these problems by utilizing a unique Ge-based SWIR sensor structure. In addition, a monolithic method of integrating the image sensor material onto the Si readout integrated circuit will be pursued. This will enable precise alignment of the readout integrated circuit and the imaging device, which will lead to smaller pixel size and better resolution. Finally, issues of power use and sensitivity will be addressed through an innovative structure called Gate-controlled Charge Modulate Device. Research will focus on refining and improving the fabrication processes necessary to reliably produce low-cost, high-quality Ge-based SWIR image sensors.",

Each tool combines remotely-sensed, high-resolution digital elevation models and newly developed hydrologic algorithms with long standing soil-loss modeling principles. The results are two-dimensional, distributed soil loss predictions for sheet, rill, and ephemeral gully erosion. Agren has incorporated the RUSLER methodology and RUSLE2 modeling engine as the core technologies underlying their SoilCalculator tool. With an easy to use interface and intuitive, captivating map-based outputs, SoilCalculator has the potential to revolutionize soil conservation planning. However, long runtimes, excessive use of server resources, and computational issues with the legacy RUSLE2 modeling make it impossible to offer SoilCalculator as a commercially viable product.Progress made during Phase I SBIR indicates scaling SoilCalculator is technically feasible and attainable in the near-term. Code changes internal to the RUSLE2 model have reduced runtimes by 100. This, along with a prototype parallel computing architecture, shows promise to further increase computational efficiency and result in reliable, cost-effective simulations.The objective of Agren&#39;s Phase II work is to continue to overcome the technical and scientific limitations of offering a full-suite of erosion prediction services using the core science and modeling framework of RUSLE2. Research questions include:How are proposed modifications to the distributed SoilCalculator framework and RUSLER DLL related to scalability and compute time?Can these modifications result in a tool that meets end-user requirements for delivery via a cloud-based precision ag platform?Can UAV-collected photogrammetry yield elevation models compare to proven ground-collection methods for measuring small changes in ephemeral gullies?What is the relationship of EphGEE model results to measured values of sediment loss in ephemeral gullies in different geographic areas and under different management systems? How can EphGEE be configured to improve correlation with measured values?How can the RUSLER science and modeling framework be leveraged to create added saleable value for SoilCalculator?The proposed project expands the research, development and validation of models for distributed erosion modeling, which are substantial scientific improvements over existing modeling tools. These efforts will lead to transformational methods of conservation planning by delivering erosion prediction services commercially, through the private sector. If Agren is successful in overcoming the technical limitations to scaling SoilCalculator, they have commitment from a distribution partner to deliver SoilCalculator on over 40 million acres of U.S. cropland.",

        "abstract": "Fog harvesting from fog nets has been intensively investigated to utilize untapped fresh water resources. Atmospheric water like fog constitutes approximately 0.04% of the earth&#39;s fresh water. If fog is harnessed appropriately, it has a huge potential to alleviate fresh water shortages due to depleting watershed and groundwater resources NBD Nanotechnologies, Inc. is proposing a research program to commercialize a proprietary surface coating for fog net applications to exploit underused fresh water resources in fog-laden areas. The proposed coating consists of a proprietary blend of superhydrophobic coatings to which NBD has exclusive licensing rights, and uses a one-step dip process that is very amenable for mass-manufacturing and scale up. Also, an embedded drainage design and multi-layered fog nets can promote significant enhancement of water collection from the fog nets. During USDA SBIR Phase I, NBD has shown that by modifying the surface texture and chemistry of a fog net with a superhydrophobic coating, and optimizing the mesh structure, the fog collection efficiency of a system can be enhanced five-fold.Fog nets with enhanced water collection efficiency would provide an ecofriendly and low-cost solution towards reducing the strain on the fresh water supplies in drought-affected areas as well as providing an effective method of delivering water for onsite crop irrigation. If successfully implemented on a commercial scale, the enhanced fog harvesting abilities of the proposed fog nets will reduce the strain on watershed resources in drought afflicted regions, and provide a valuable source of fresh water in isolated rural communities.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports development of a nanoparticle characterization instrument that will fill the critical unmet need to rapidly and accurately measure the size and distribution of nanoparticles from 30 nanometers to 1 micron. Initially the technology will target two applications: protein aggregation in biopharmaceuticals, and nanoparticles in medicine (e.g., tumor-targeted drug delivery). The importance of nanoparticle analysis, however, goes well beyond therapeutics. Currently the market for nanoparticle analysis instrumentation across the life sciences is $5.6 billion, and there are increasing concerns about nanoparticles in consumer products such as food and cosmetics, as well as in drinking water, effluents, and the environment. A major challenge in understanding the health impacts of nanoparticles is simply in accurately and easily detecting their presence and size distribution. Additionally, improved nanoparticle instrumentation will enable new discoveries in biotechnology and environmental and health sciences. This challenge can be met by developing a practical method for counting and sizing submicron particles in polydisperse mixtures. NSF Phase I/IB funds supported development of a prototype instrument that detects individual nanoparticles and accurately measures their size, at very high count rates. This instrument has successfully demonstrated robust detection of individual particles as small as 60 nm in diameter at rates approaching 10,000 particles per second, and has already begun to deliver useful information to particle manufacturers in the pharmaceutical industry, with on-going measurements of actual customer samples. The Phase II support will considerably enhance the utility of this instrument by addressing several outstanding technical challenges; most significantly, by extending the range of detectable particles to span the full range from 30 nm to 1000 nm, and by further maximizing the range of measurable particle concentrations. In addition, the Phase II work will drive significant improvements in functionality and ease of use, driven by innovations in its control software. Finally, the instrument will be further validated using a wide variety of particle types relevant beyond the pharmaceutical space.",

An additional concept was proposed to compensate for the imperfection of the multiplexer system, such as filter roll-off and PA non-linearity, through the use of digital signal processing (DSP) techniques.

        "abstract": "The Haber-Bosch process, one of the most impactful developments in human history, has provided enough fertilizer to the world that it is estimated nearly half of the nitrogen found in our bodies originated in a Haber-Bosch chemical plant. However, this technological marvel comes at a price. On U.S. farms, 29% of energy consumed (directly and indirectly) is in the form of fertilizers, and these same fertilizers are the second largest contributor to green house gas emissions. This is because the Haber-Bosch process must operate at high pressures and high temperatures to convert highly inert nitrogen gas to fertilizer. In addition, to obtain hydrogen for the reaction, fossil fuel reforming is used, resulting in a high carbon foot print. The extreme conditions and pre- and post-processing steps combined with the low equilibrium conversion makes these facilities highly capital intensive, inefficient and polluting. More sustainable and economical ammonia production methods will be required to support growing world demand for fertilizer.One alternative approach is to use electricity to drive the ammonia production reaction, decreasing the need for high pressure and heat thereby decreasing the energy demand and making the process more efficient. This electrochemically driven process is compatible with the use of renewable electricity, eliminating CO2 emissions from the production step. A natural synergy exists in using wind power for fertilizer production. In the Plains and Upper Midwest, excess wind production capacity, transmission limitations, and high regional demand for N-fertilizers combine to create excellent economic drivers for this technology. In addition, because electrolysis technology is highly scalable, further reduction of emissions will be realized through the reduced need for ammonia transport. Products could be envisioned that support a range of small to mid-sized farms, or could be designed on a larger scale to distribute ammonia locally for multiple farms.Our team proposes development of an efficient solid state electrochemical process utilizing anion exchange membrane (AEM) technology, which can be optimized for use with distributed renewable energy sources. This AEM-based technology is ideal for ammonia synthesis because the membranes are not expected to readily react with ammonia, enable low-cost materials of construction, and they allow the utilization of a wider array of low-cost catalysts. Results from our Phase I work showed that our AEM-based electrochemical technology is uniquely capable of low temperature and low pressure ammonia generation at an efficiency which will match the energy requirements of the Haber-Bosch process. The team has extensive competencies in cell design, tailoring of membrane and catalyst properties, and balance of plant design and integration, providing a strong foundation for the proposed work.",

        "abstract": "Nationwide about 2.4 billion gallons of lubricants are consumed annually for automotive crankcase (about 58%), industrial processes, machine lubrication, mining, and others. About 1 billion gallons/yr is currently collected as waste oil, equivalent to1-1.5% of annual US crude oil import volume. Presently, about 9% of the collected used oil is re-refined at six facilities in US. The majority of this resource is currently burned as fuel. A report issued by the DOE in 2006 in response to The Energy Policy Act of 2005 Section 1838 highlights that the major impediment to expanding lube oil re-refining is investment costs required to design and construct new facilities for re-refining. According to the literature, about $40million in front end capital investment is required for a 30 million gallon per year (MGY) re-refining facility. This explains why the capital investment cost is listed as the primary impediment for expanding current re-refining capacity. Media and Process Technology Inc has been involved in the re-refining of waste oil using an innovative separation process which does not involve phase separation and hydrotreating as in the conventional technology. Thus, the re-refining facility can be designed and constructed in a small scale and modular operation without paying an economy of scale penalty. This not only reduces the front end capital investment per facility, but makes it uniquely suitable for regional re-refining operations to match waste oil supplies, as opposed to the conventional technology requiring a centralized operation to justify its large capital investment. A semi-works facility has been in operation for 9 months to demonstrate the innovative industrial membrane system we developed. About 50,000 gallons of re-refined has been produced and sold to blenders. In addition we have identified two dirty oils available in refineries which can benefit from our innovative membrane system. A lab feasibility study was performed to demonstrate its technical and economical viability.  We plan to expand our existing re-refining pilot operation to a semi-works facility to demonstrate the performance and economics of our upgraded re-refining process for petroleum-based waste oil. Then, we plan to establish the 1st regional re-refining center with our operational partner to showcase the technology and process and in parallel begin the deployment of the regional centers nationwide. Also we will pursue the commercialization of the applications involving two dirty oil streams. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits. Our re-refining technology could positively impact the national energy consumption profile via an economically driven approach, potentially resulting in a 4-10% reduction in crude oil imports and significant reduction in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Nationwide, waste oil re-refining with this technology is expected to create job opportunities. Further, the technology is readily exportable.",

        "abstract": "In order for Moores law (exponential growth of compute capability) to continue to hold, the bandwidths of interconnects will need to be increased by 10x or moreto well beyond 100Gbs. This represents a formidable challenge to Integrated Circuit (IC) manufacturers because higher frequency will exacerbate already strained power dissipation of traditional copper interconnects. As a result, server and networking equipment companies (IBM, CISCO, Lucent/Alcatel) are pushing the semiconductor industry toward investing in using light (photonics) to propagate information. We will improve the design productivity of silicon photonic IC components, which target Silicon on Insulator (SOI) manufacturing processes through the development of automation and modeling tools packaged with a set of pre-designed parametric silicon photonic IC passive building blocks (waveguides, couplers, resonators, modulators, and Y-junctions). The geometric parameters of these blocks can be modified and simulated to predict performance for a specific target SOI manufacturers process. The ability to accurately model and simulate specific instances is enabled by our unique three-dimensional physical modeling, multi-physics simulation and cluster computing capabilities. In Phase I, we laid down the groundwork for visualizing and analyzing staggered fields, which are common in electromagnetic simulations. In Phase II, we implemented conservative algorithms to compute line and area integrals of staggered fields; the same algorithms will be applied in Phase IIB to characterize silicon photonics components. The outcome of the work performed in Phase I and II will be applied to characterize optical components with unprecedented accuracy using an S-matrix formalism. The result will be that each optical component can then be integrated into a larger circuit using tools and processes similar to those currently employed in electronic integrated circuit design. Most silicon photonics design tool and manufacturing sourcing (e.g. Luceda and Phoenix Design) is done outside of the U.S., while the end use for this technology within big data companies (Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft) and their equipment suppliers (CISCO, IBM, Dell, HP, Oracle) are U.S. companies. We believe the automation of the key building blocks used to design and specify the manufacture of silicon photonic ICs will enable these US companies and their IC partners to accelerate their ability to design silicon photonic ICs.",

The development of such a system addresses the Navys requirement for a flexible and efficient high-power microwave (HPM) test capability system.In evaluating system performance, Metamagnetics Inc. will coordinate with Government and Industry partners. These synergistic activities will enable the development of a complete HPRF system with each performer contributing their unique expertise and capabilities.",

        "abstract": "HemoSonics LLC is developing an easy to use and easy to interpret diagnostic device to rapidly identify diffuse coagulopathies in order to guide proper and evidence-based interventions. The management of diffuse coagulopathies is extremely important in military medicine as these conditions represent a significant source of combat morbidity and mortality.    HemoSonics device is based on sonorheometry, an ultrasound-based technology that can measure dynamic changes in clot stiffness during the process of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Sonorheometry does not require moving mechanical parts and utilizes a self-contained consumable cartridge with embedded lyophilized reagents. This technology has significant advantages over competing viscoelastometric devices such as TEG and ROTEM; sonorheometry is faster and more sensitive than TEG and ROTEM, it is ease to operate and to interpret, and it is robust to environmental vibrations.    The overall goal of this proposal is to finalize the development of sonorheometry into a portable instrument that can be used in the expeditionary medicine environment. Based on the success of Phase I activities, the focus in this Phase II application will be to develop and validate an integrated prototype that is capable of performing automated SR measurements and assess its clinical utility in trauma.",

        "abstract": "The lateral flow (LF) or immunochromatographic (IC) test strip is a staple test format in the food safety testing arsenal. However, the sensitivity of LF assays is limited partly due to antibody affinity and partly due to the visual detection limit of colloidal gold or colored latex particles. Operational Technologies Corporation (OpTech) has developed hundreds of high affinity candidate DNA aptamers against foodborne pathogenic bacterial surface markers such as E. coli intimins (eae gene products), O157 LPS, Campylobacter and Salmonella surface proteins, Listeria flagellin proteins and Listeriolysin O (LLO) many of which it has patented, published and now sells on its website (www.OTCBiotech.com). In Phase 1, OpTech developed and screened longer (200 base) \"multivalent\" DNA aptamers containing several of its highest affinity aptamer sequences by ELISA-like (ELASA) microplate assay. These lengthier aptamers appear to have enhanced avidity and specificity versus the older 72 base aptamers in preliminary ELASA screening. OpTech developed the new 200 base aptamers with USDA SBIR funding against the \"Big 6\" non-O157 Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC) serogroups of lipopolysaccharides (LPS; O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, and O145) and has begun to incorporate these into LF strips having multiple detection lines per strip to help satisfy the new USDA requirement for \"Big 6\" non-O157 STEC detection.As a preliminary demonstration of how aptamer LF test strips could work, during Phase 1, OpTech screened a number of general botulinum toxin, Campylobacter, E. coli, Listeria, and Salmonella aptamer sandwich pairs in LF test strip formats using both colloidal gold and red quantum dots (Qdot 655). Promising aptamer pairs were identified for most of these analytes and the best studied E. coli system produced a limit of detection (LOD) of about 3,000 cells/test by colloidal gold and &lt; 300 cells by Qdot 655-aptamer-based LF visual tests under a UV light. This work was published by Bruno in the open access journal Pathogens 3:341-355, 2014. Due to this clear enhancement of sensitivity via the use of red Qdots and aptamers, OpTech wishes to fully develop a whole line of fluorescent Qdot-aptamer foodborne pathogen LF test strips for commercialization via direct sales and/or product licensing to larger companies. OpTech is currently working with a food safety industry consultant (www.XgeneX.com) to develop partnering relationships and/or licensing deals.The broader impacts of this SBIR project will include enhanced food safety for the public as well as better on-site decision making ability for food processing and packing facilities to decide if foods can be sold or should be discarded. In addition, aptamer-based fluorescent LF test strips can be developed to detect a broad array of clinical, veterinary, environmental pollutant or other analytes. Initially, food processors will be OpTech&#39;s main customers. However, the customer base could expand dramatically as OpTech moves fluorescent aptamer-LF test strip technology into the homeland security and medical arenas to detect chemical and biological terrorist threat agents, infectious diseases in hospitals, patient wounds or contaminated raw materials in pharmaceutical production facilities, etc.",

INTUIT will provide targeted support to novice and expert mission planners by adapting to unique operator, task, and mission needs, as well as fluidly exposing opportunities for advanced planning functionality when appropriate. Under the proposed Phase II INTUIT effort, we will first expand prior analyses and workflow models to characterize specific capabilities, tasks, and workflows of mission planners. We will then leverage these analyses and models to refine our design of INTUIT displays for mission planning activities. Finally, we will expand the breadth and depth of our current INTUIT prototype. We will use these prototypes to demonstrate and evaluate our approaches and deeply explore the complexities of mission planning across vehicles, operators, and mission contexts.",

(PSI) successfully developed a nonflammable ionic liquid (IL) based electrolyte that can be used as a drop in replacement in commercial cells for Air Force applications. The proposed program will continue to optimize the performance of this electrolyte and demonstrate the ability to construct safer Li-ion pouch and cylindrical cells. During Phase II, PSI will demonstrate that the electrolyte is nonflammable when integrated in a production style Li-ion cell used in US Air Force batteries. Pouch and cylindrical cells for the targeted Air Force application will be constructed with the optimized electrolyte. Abuse testing will demonstrate the improved safety offered on incorporation of the PSI electrolyte in a state of the art cell. Steady state and high rate discharge testing will be performed over the projected operating temperature range. This testing will demonstrate the PSI electrolyte enables stable cycling performance over the entire operating temperature range. PSI will also demonstrate that the cells with the PSI electrolyte deliver comparable rate performance to cells containing conventional, flammable electrolytes. Safer pouch and cylindrical Li-ion cells incorporating the PSI electrolyte will be delivered to the Air Force for independent evaluation.BENEFIT:With the rapid proliferation of electronic technology, safe, reliable energy storage and power delivery technologies are necessary. A significant concern with current batteries is the energetic reaction of carbonate based electrolytes on cell failure. Development of the proposed electrolyte could lead to safer cells for all applications. In particular, manned DoD and space missions need these batteries to prevent damage to personnel and high value equipment. Long-term the technology could be used in cell phones, electric vehicle batteries, laptops and power tools.",

        "abstract": "MATSYS proposes to develop and scale-up a processing technology to maximize the combustion efficiency of metal powders and enhance warhead blast performance. Metal powder particles are typically prepared by inert gas atomization and have very clean surfaces. These particles are then exposed to a controlled amount of oxygen to pacify the surface and enable safe handling. In some applications, these metallic powder particles are intended to participate in an exothermic reaction and release energy upon shock or impact loading. The existence of an oxide layer requires the heating of the particles to higher temperature to break this layer before the exothermic reaction can take place. The result is a delay in the reaction initiation and an incomplete reaction during a detonation event because of the higher temperature required for heating. Both of these factors contribute to a lower energy release than theoretical, and thus a loss of combustion efficiency. We plan to rejuvenate the metal powder particle surfaces, refine the grain size of the micron size metal particle to reduce the diffusion length and facilitate complete reaction, and consolidate the powder into bulk material to lock in its fine grain structure and make it stable over time and environmental exposure.",

What is needed is a system that can balance between these two, to maintain and rapidly navigate association data at multiple levels of detail, while avoiding information loss that occurs when too much or too little data is considered. This support must happen at operational tempo, correlating new data streams with historical archives to detect and track threats and develop situational awareness.Accordingly, we are developing MACE, a multi-modal association database management and analysis system implemented as a multi-level graph. In Phase I, we built a system design, and conducted a proof-of-concept demonstration to show that MACE will scale to operational data volumes. In Phase II, we will extend MACE to additional modes of data, improve entity resolution, and provide recommendations to ensure robust analysis. Using graph databases, we will achieve analytic and run-time performance successes where traditional databases fail.

The overall goal of the proposed work is to develop a modular and flexible flight management system in order to enable condition-aware flight. The RTS3A system incorporates multi-disciplinary, physics-based models and sensor suites to fully functionalize the flight environment of an aircraft with respect to its structural and propulsion capabilities, which allows for optimization of mission execution as well as condition based maintenance. Specifically, the aim is to develop a standalone package representing the RTS3A system incorporating an open architecture that that will ensure modularity and a high degree of flexibility in terms of subsystem interchangeability. This open architecture will establish standardized subsystem classification, interface protocols, data formatting and processing standards, and software design standards for a general condition-aware system. Initial implementation of the RTS3A system on current unmanned systems will be explored and a candidate platform for further development will be identified.BENEFIT:There are three main avenues that Aurora can pursue for commercialization of the RTS3A aircraft: Unmanned Military Aircraft, Manned Military Aircraft, and Commercial Aircraft. The unmanned military aircraft platform would most likely be the first avenue of approach for commercializing this technology. The RTS3A system is comprised of two major sections: the path planning algorithm and the subsystem prognostic health monitoring systems. The path planning algorithm is most applicable to unmanned systems, where the path planner can be used to inform the vehicle flight path. Optimizing the flight path based on real-time updated vehicle heath state constraints will result in risk reduction: maximum mission performance would be ensured given the current capabilities of the vehicle, as well as cost reduction: fuel savings by operating the vehicle at the most efficient operating conditions. For manned flight, the prognostic health monitoring algorithms are of more interest, although the benefits herein are also applicable to unmanned aircraft. The data of the actual state of the various subsystems can be used to inform maintenance schedules, allowing for longer time intervals between vehicle overhauls, and additionally can potentially pinpoint problem areas with higher than normal levels of degradation to further inform the focus of maintenance activities. This will result in additional cost savings over the lifetime of the vehicle, as well as a running history of the subsystem conditions which will give better estimates of remaining useful life.",

However, existing MBP languages are deterministic and do not model uncertainties that influence the systems behavior. We propose to develop Probabilistic Model-Based Programming Techniques for Prediction, Analysis and Control (PROMPT). PROMPT will provide probabilistic extensions to SysML, enabling that to enable the representation of uncertainties in both the structure and the behaviors of a complex system, as well as interactions between the structure and behaviors. PROMPT will provide inference services for predicting the behavior of a system under uncertainty and estimating the current state of the system from noisy sensors. These inference services will be used to predict performance and analyze models at design time and to control a cyber-physical system at runtime based on probabilistic beliefs about the state of the system. PROMPT will be applied to and evaluated on a significant cyber-physical system such as an unmanned undersea vehicle.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Corrosion is a serious problem affecting the longevity, safety, durability, and affordability of military and commercial aircraft. Despite strict implementation of MIL and ASTM standards for aircraft Outer Mold Line (OML) coatings, corrosion is frequently observed during maintenance partly due to inadequate testing methods representing an in-service environmental exposure; hence, advanced tools are required for more accurate and realistic assessment of these coatings. A programmable accelerated environmental test system that can simulate on-service aircraft exposure of salt-fog, temperature, UV, and corrosive gases can provide immense value to the aircraft industry. Systems & Materials Research Corporation (SMRC) proposes to design and build a programmable chamber that can simulate a realistic environmental exposure of aircraft coatings on representative test coupons. The chamber will use an IR flash thermography technique to monitor corrosion without interrupting the test in progress. The Phase I SBIR effort demonstrated a scaled down prototype of the chamber with software functionality. The Phase II program will focus on developing a full-scale prototype and user-friendly software to control the entire system. The outcome of this effort will be a better assessment tool to qualify aircraft coatings for safe, durable, long-term, and sustainable aircraft operation.  BENEFIT:  An advanced environmental chamber will provide a necessary tool to Air Force to evaluate next generation coatings. Additionally, SMRCs chamber will provide in-situ corrosion analysis capability to its users by capturing IR images to study corrosion growth mechanisms. Such a system should be able to detect small corrosion pits underneath a coating and allow experts to study its propagation mechanism. If successful, SMRCs system will be able to provide users with an ability to change environmental parameters such as humidity, salt concentration, temperature, UV exposure, and gas concentration to conduct a comprehensive design of experiments and continuously monitor corrosion via IR flash thermography. Additionally, the chamber will be able to incorporate existing and newly developed mechanical test fixtures and additional testing capability.",

        "abstract": "Quorum sensing (QS) allows bacterial populations to coordinate gene expression in a cell density dependent manner and plays a significant role in the onset of pathogenesis and biofilm development. In many Gram-negative bacteria, QS is mediated by signaling molecules called N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs). We recently identified an AHL acylase from P. syringae which can enzymatically degrade and inactivate the AHLs used by phytopathogens. Similarly, during the Phase I project, we discovered a new AHL acylase from a closely-related pseudomonad. Our technological innovation is the use of these AHL acylases to degrade the AHL signals of bacterial phytopathogens and reduce plant disease. Our research objectives for the Phase II project will be to continue to advance our technologies by evaluating their efficacy in field trials. We will increase the production scale of heterologous protein and then evaluate formulations of exogenous acylase. We will also further develop our biocontrol strains and plants that constitutively produce AHL acylases. QS is a nonessential cellular process and so, unlike existing antibiotics that target indispensible functions, the targeted degradation of QS signals will exert significantly reduced selective pressure on plant pathogens and slow resistance development. The enzymatic degradation of QS signals will be environmentally friendly and will be advantageous over existing disease management strategies.",

A systems approach is required to provide 10 m accuracy to warfighters in real-time.

These algorithms will dramatically reduce centroiding errors and produce unprecedented attitude knowledge accuracy. The attitude filters can incorporate nontraditional measurements from various attitude-dependent sources onboard the spacecraft, such as the communication system, for improved robustness and accuracy. Optical gyros enable a high bandwidth control system which can acquire multiple targets in one pass. GPS-based orbit determination is enhanced with two-way ranging from the communication system to reduce navigation error. The pointing system uses PSS ultra-low-jitter reaction wheels for high pointing accuracy and to reduce image smear. The technology in this system, which was developed by and is unique to Princeton Satellite Systems, will provide ground location accuracy of better than 10 m in a nanosatellite-class package.

The Kestrel computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code will provide high-fidelity data for the construction of PBROMs that retain the accuracy of the parent model but enable analysis over the entire range of flight operations at a fraction of the computational overhead. Integration of the PBROM technology into Kestrel will provide the greater DoD engineering community access to tools that assist in the development of aerodynamic models for stability and control analyses and more general design and analysis of military aircraft. The proposed project will develop user test cases for Kestrel involving an F-16 fighter aircraft with articulating control surfaces and an open-source-fighter (OSF) version of the aircraft. The parent CFD models are representative of production and early-development fighter aircraft models with 36 and 4.5 million cells in the grids, respectively. Corresponding PBROMs will be used demonstrate virtual flight tests of the aircraft and stability and control analyses.  BENEFIT:  The proposed software fits into the framework of the ``Digital Thread\" initiative at the Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) with the objective of a 25% reduction in the development cycle time for air vehicles, achieved by streamlining research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E). Achieving the goal will leverage innovative modeling and simulation (M&S) tools that improve all stages of the development cycle with fast and comprehensive early-concept evaluation, identification of optimal, targeted ground tests, and streamlined flight testing from first flight to initial operational capability. The primary customers will be government personnel and government contractors who use the Kestrel. Applications include support of new aircraft development from conceptual design trade studies to flight testing and aircraft certification, along with support of modifications to existing, enabling new mission roles in the existing military fleet. The proposed software is designed to make the engineering development process more reliable and efficient through accurate and faster analyses at each stage. The technology provides a framework that efficiently integrates M&S and T&E.",

Many proposed solutions are not practical from a manufacturing/cost perspective: too complex or add weight to the aircraft that is not justifiable. The requirements for aircraft noise are becoming more stringent with greater emphasis on improvements in performance efficiency and lower fuel consumption. CRG has demonstrated feasibility in implementing adaptive technologies into acoustic liners. The next step is to develop increased understanding at more relevant size scales to demonstrate repeatable liner control performance supported by more extensive acoustic testing runs to understand the initial shifting and increased suppression behaviors that have been observed. Automated cyclic testing of a given adaptive liner parameter will be executed on the order of hundreds of thousands of times to demonstrate the durability of the adaptive material for this application.

        "abstract": "Producers of solid and liquid biofuels need to reduce both capital and operating costs to achieve unsubsidized cost parity with fossil fuels. Many biomass feedstocks destined for conversion platforms must be dried, however, the capital cost for dryers is high due to long residence times and the operating cost is high due to system inefficiencies. Consistent and reliable operation of biomass dryers is problematic across emerging and rapidly expanding biofuel firms due to inexperience of operators and lack of knowledge about drying characteristics of their feedstocks. This project enables improvements in energy efficiency by developing a state-of-the-art model based model-predictive control technology utilizing per material process maps based on better understanding of the biophysics of moisture movement within biomass particles across a range of important species and sensor-based measurements of dryer operating parameters that affect drying energy crops, optimizing final moisture content, energy input, and capital costs. At the conclusion of our proposed project, we expect to validate the potential for significant energy savings through implementation of model based controls on moving bed dryers. Technology from this project should be easy to retrofit to existing dryers.The technologies resulting from this project can immediately be implemented in current biopower and solid biofuel gasification facilities as well as future second generation thermochemical biorefinery facilities. These technologies will likely reduce the capital by 30% and operating costs by 25% resulting in dramatic biofuels production cost reduction.",

        "abstract": "In this Phase II SBIR program, Tetramer Technologies will develop new, commercially attractive, thermoplastic optical polymers that have ultra-low scattering losses for use in diffraction-limited optical lenses. The value proposition to the customer using optical components made from Tetramer polymers will be decreased scattering of light transmitted through the polymer lens, resulting in smaller Airy disks and improved Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) in optical devices. Currently, the scattering loss found in commercially available sources of optical polymers, such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(styrene acrylonitrile) (SAN), is unacceptably high to the detriment of the imaging capabilities of optical devices such as night vision goggles. The Navys development of gradient refractive index (GRIN) polymer lenses offers drastic increases in focusing power and reductions to the weight of optical systems; however, this technology remains limited by the availability of optical polymers with satisfactory optical performance. Through the proposed research and commercialization activities, Tetramer aims to address the need for a domestic source of high performance optical polymers and enable the next generation of polymer optical components.",

Solar arrays can provide base power greatly reducing the need for logistical fuels, continuous battery recharging for warfighters on the move, and integrated power sources for remote, autonomous systems, e.g. UAVs. To be effective, solar arrays must be lightweight, flexible, and provide high power density. Flexible solar arrays based on thin film photovoltaics have been fielded for some military applications, but their usefulness has been limited by their low efficiency. Si panels have attained efficiencies as high as 22% but but are made of glass and Al. Flexible amorphous Si or polycrystalline CIGS panels are less than 15% efficient. Higher efficiency, flexible solar cells have been demonstrated for space applications, but their cost has hindered terrestrial applications.

The worldwide food animal industry, anchored by research and new product innovation in the US, produces high quality proteins that are part of a healthy diet and an essential food source for human populations worldwide. Diseases that affect food animals threaten the safety and quantity of this protein source. LARAD was established to apply proprietary virus-like-particle (VLP) technology to the development of vaccines and diagnostics for food animal diseases. VLPs are structurally analogous to viruses but they do not contain any genetic material; they are essentially empty protein shells. In this Phase II application we have targeted three animal diseases where vaccines have become ineffective due to mutations that have lead to antigenic drift in the viruses; two are poultry diseases caused by infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) and avian reovirus (ARV) and the third is a disease of fish caused by infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV). All three viruses cause economically devastating diseases. The LARAD VLP technology, developed by the Co-PD at The Ohio State University and exclusively licensed by LARAD, is innovative because it allows us to produce vaccines that easily keep pace with mutating viruses. At the end of this Phase II project we expect to have our IBDV-VLP platform licensed by the CVB and two more VLP vaccine products ready for Phase III commercialization. Sales from our IBDV-VLP platform vaccine and funds from our vaccine company partners will be used to commercialize the ARV/IBDV-VLP and IPNV-VLP vaccines",

Applied Sciences, Inc. has developed a single-step sprayable, advanced abrasion protection coating to address these needs.  Nanocomposites feature reinforcement at the molecular level which can far exceed the physical properties of two-phase composite systems.  ASI intends to continue the development of advanced abrasion resistant polymeric coatings featuring carbon nanofibers (CNF).  The TRL and MRL of the CNF-coatings will each be elevated to at least 6 in the Phase II program through collaborative research, development, and testing.  Scalability studies, commercialization activities, and quality control protocol will be addressed in this effort.  The resulting CNF-enhanced coating product will increase the service life of the composite component on the aircraft, protect the composite component from additional damage, as well as reduce the maintenance time and cost.

The market for LED phosphors in 2012 was roughly $500 million and is expected to reach $1.2 billion by 2016. The 20% improvement in the packaged LED efficiency will also trigger a cascade of tangible impacts at the end-product system level such as using fewer LEDs, increasing efficacy (lumens per watt) and mobile device battery life, reducing electronic driver complexity, reducing heat, a thinner form factor, and a far more brilliant color gamut. The anticipated results from this grant will satisfy the 2020 goals for down-converting materials laid out in the U.S. Department of Energy's 2013 Multi-Year Program Plan, bringing these efficacy and efficiency goals and standards to market four years ahead of schedule. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to further develop a novel and proprietary phosphor material system for use in phosphor-converted light-emitting diode (pcLED) applications that will improve pcLED efficacy up to 20%. In display backlighting, 20-40% of the light emitted by the state-of-the-art phosphors miss the sweet spot of the display's color filters resulting in unused light and wasted energy. Similarly, in general lighting approximately 15% of the emitted light falls outside the visible spectrum, again resulting in wasted energy. The technology developed is a phosphor material utilizing a novel chemistry that exhibits a narrow light emission spectrum to increase LED brightness and energy efficiency by 10-20% in display backlighting and up to 15% in general lighting applications. Prototype materials have been synthesized that exhibit a narrow emission peak at target wavelengths, and the next steps include optimization and characterization of the most effective compositions. The anticipated results of this project are narrow-band phosphor materials that exhibit performance and reliability characteristics commensurate with industry standards.",

The integrated probes will be implemented and tested in AFRL rigs. Automated software will be developed for processing the acquired high-speed data. The Phase-II goals will be accomplished through five key technical objectives: (1) Design and build a fully integrated immersion probe, backscatter probe, and imaging probe for measurements at AFRL test rigs. (2) Assess available absorption spectroscopy methods and wavelengths to maximize the range of conditions that can be measured using the immersion and backscatter probes. (3) Validate temperature and species concentration measurements for the immersion and backscatter probes using well-calibrated flame sources. (4) Perform single-port detections of localized temperature, H2O and CO/CO2 concentrations, high-speed flame images, and 2D fuel-air ratios in AFRL augmentor and combustor rigs. (5) Develop automated software to process the acquired high-speed data. The successful demonstration of aforementioned measurements in AFRL test articles using the developed fiber-based probes will allow the researcher to determine localized gas combustion in practical high-combustion facilities and provide useful high-speed diagnostics into unsteady combustion reaction characteristics.BENEFIT:The primary challenge for optical sensors (e.g., laser absorption spectroscopy and chemiluminescence imaging sensors) in practical augmentors and combustors is optical access. Presently, a general-purpose optical sensor is not a viable commercial product because most applications require customized optical access, particularly for high-temperature and/or highpressure combustion facilities. The research effort to develop three single-port fiber-optic spectroscopic and imaging probes will alleviate this deficiency; these probes will utilize a single common penetration into the test article and will be easily interchangeable, thereby enabling multiple diagnostics to be used at full performance in practical devices during a single measurement campaign. We anticipate that the novel three probes developed under this program will enable an array of new marketable products and technologies for real-time combustion measurements in practical gas-turbine engines. 1. Immediate benefits to Air Force test facilities and OEMs: The development outlined in this proposal will enable the optimization of intelligent control strategies through real-time sensing used to obtain understanding of high-speed time-evolving phenomena related to ignition, flame growth, and stability in high-pressure combustors. Potential applications for defense missions include the reduction of combustion instabilities, pollution reduction, and fuel and fuel additive studies that enhance the performance and facilitate the design of next-generation combustion and propulsion systems. Additionally, the toolkit developed under this SBIR project will be instrumental to fully investigate lean and ultra-lean combustion concepts in next generation fighter engines and hence will be an invaluable asset to U. S. Air Force. The proposed flexible compact probe systems should be applicable for nearly all combustion environments and as such will have broad commercial appeal covering most of the Government laboratories, engine companies (OEMs), and University etc. 2. Scientific discovery Better understanding of the fundamental behaviors of ignition, turbulent flame and flow interactions, thermoacoustic-driven combustion instabilities, flame chemistry, and flame propagation in practical combustors/augmentors promises a rich field of intellectually stimulating scientific challenges, which in turn can quickly result in revolutionary technologies for advanced gas turbine combustors and augmentors that provide societal benefits via higher propulsion efficiencies, reduced weight, low emissions, improved durability, increased ease of manufacturing, and decreased cost. 3. Economic security and prosperity: Issues such as combustion instabilities, low temperature combustion (LTC), and pollutant emissions have enormous effects on the overall performance of modern gas turbine engines. Even a slight improvement in propulsion efficiency coupled with a minor reduction of combustion instabilities and pollutant via the use of advanced fiber-optic measurements in practical test engines will have huge economic impacts when those improvements are implemented nation-wide. The successful development of these commercial products will help extend the global leadership of the US in R&D and manufacturing of engine technologies.",

When the device is exposed to a gas molecule that binds to the coating material the resulting mass change will be detected by the mass sensor. The chemical kinetics of the coatings will be engineered to selectively adsorb and desorb the target gases with sub-10 second response times. We will integrate a commercial particle counter with multiple mass sensors to measure all 12 gases specified in the solicitation. The mass sensors are small and thin (less than 10x10x1 mm) and light (less than 1 gram) and their readout electronics can fit on a standard pc board that is 3 in x 3 in x 0.2 in while consuming 700 mW of power allowing for 17 hours of continuous operation. Because of the extraordinarily small size of our sensor technology, we will be able to use ruggedized packaging to meet the drop test requirement, while still satisfying the target specifications for size, weight, battery life, cost, and response time.",

        "abstract": "Larger, taller wind turbines could significantly reduce the cost of wind energy and enable much broader deployment, but traditional tower designs cannot cost-effectively scale up due to the size constraints associated with road and rail transportation.  Wind turbine towers face a critical bottleneck in the form of the 14-foot diameter limit imposed by over-road transport.  With current designs, towers must be highly sub-optimized  using many tons of extra steel  and incur high shipping and permitting costs to reach even 80-100m heights.  Highly desirable taller towers  140m and higher  are infeasible with todays steel monopole technology.  The grant applicant has developed an innovative advanced manufacturing system that overcomes these transport limits with on-site production of wind turbine towers.  Tower production at the wind farm avoids the 14-foot height limit for trucking, allowing structurally optimized steel monopole towers to reach 140m+ hub-heights.  This will:  Increase the USs available wind resource by 2000 GW, Open large areas of the country to economical power generation from wind, Lower the levelized cost of energy from wind generation, reducing or eliminating the need for subsidies, Shift manufacturing from foreign factories to on-site operations in the US. The applicants manufacturing process is based on spiral welding, a system used for 50+ years to create large diameter welded steel cylinders for pipe and piling applications.  Unlike current tower production methods, spiral welding is a continuous, highly automated process that has been demonstrated to be cost effective for on-site production.  However, current spiral welding systems are only capable of producing straight pipe, not the tapered, variable wall-thickness structures required for steel monopole wind towers.  The applicants innovation enables this with a generalization of the spiral welding process that uses a patented material geometry to wrap constant-width steel sheets into a conical shape without in-plane material deformation. In Phase II, the applicant built and began testing a scaled prototype of a spiral welding system capable of producing wind turbine towers, and also began working with wind turbine OEMs, wind plant developers, wind plant installers, and component certifiers to implement full on-site operation.  Proposed Phase IIB work includes construction and testing of critical subsystems at the commercial scale.  This work will prove the feasibility of tapered spiral welding for 140m+ towers, and is an essential step toward commercial system implementation.",

During Phase II, Tetramer Technologies has developed new water vapor transport (WVT) membranes which significantly  outperformed  the  current  perfluorosulfonic  acid  (PFSA-Nafion)  and  other WVT membrane competitors at ~50% lower projected cost. Optimization of this new technology during Phase IIB, which will involve improved block copolymers, support structures, and IEC improvements will positively affect the fuel cell balance of plant efficiency and lower costs.\nThese new polymer structures also showed no detrimental anhydride formation at the higher (120oC) cathode inlet temperatures required by fuel cell OEMs.   This anhydride formation of conventional PSFA membranes has caused &gt;60% reduction of water vapor performance at 85oC cathode inlet temperatures, and at the much higher required stack temperatures anhydride formation will only accelerate.   Engineering an automotive fuel cell  system  to  compensate  for  such  significant  losses  would  be  complicated  and expensive  (in  addition  to  the  high  cost  of  the  PFSA  WVT  polymer),  since  a  larger humidifier would have to be built to compensate for this WVT variation. This variation could also affect the durability and cost of the proton exchange membrane (PEM) stack.  In addition to the power optimization, lower cost, and lower weight impacts afforded by a WVT system for fuel cell vehicles, these membranes are excellent enthalpy candidates for the high potential energy savings (~ 40%) achieved by conditioning air for the large HVAC market which currently uses billions of btus. The primary focus of the proposed Phase IIB research will be to take advantage of the new technologies discovered during the delayed Phase II development to increase the commercial value proposition by further lowering manufacturing cost, optimizing polymer molecular   architecture,   extending   durability,   and   performance   (which   will   further decrease  fuel  cell  engine  cost,  durability,  and  weight).  Additionally,  the  Phase  IIB research will include building of a commercial prototype humidification system by Dana Corporation (headquartered in Maumee, Ohio), which had worldwide sales of $6.6 billion in drive train components to the auto industry in 2014. The Phase IIB durability target will be 10% performance loss over a 500 hour accelerated test and 5000 hours over the operating life of the vehicle. We have strong support letters from Dana, GM, MTR, and Fumatech, providing significant in-kind product device testing and development cost with a goal of providing a prototype cathode humidifier for commercial vehicles and HVAC systems by 2018.  By 2022, an estimated 120,000 m2 of membrane will be needed from Tetramer.",

        "abstract": "Eden Park Illumination, Inc. is pursuing the development and commercialization of large arrays of microcavity plasmas capable of generating light in the vacuum ultraviolet and deep ultraviolet wavelength ranges (VUV and UVC espectively), but in a slim and flat form factor. Ultraviolet is well known to be efficient in enabling a number of chemical processes, and is particularly effective for disinfection. The ability of deep UV and VUV radiation to neutralize pathogens (bacteria, viruses, and cysts), drugs (hormone regulators), and organic chemicals of increasing concern in drinking water and water re-use is well-documented. The primary drawbacks of conventional UV light sources, however is their poor form factor and environmental concerns associated with their disposal (because of the use of mercury).  Microplasmas are mercury-free, non-equilibrium, low temperature plasma sources and they are characterized by high power loading (several hundreds of 100 kW/cm3) which enables them to excite gases and produce UV- generating excimer molecules efficiently. In addition to their compact (and flat!) form factor, they have other desirable attributes such as instant on-and-off, full dimmability, and low-sensitivity to the ambient temperature, all of which enable them to be efficient in various field applications when compared to their mercury-containing counterparts. In the Phase II program, we have successfully demonstrated flat UV lamps that are scalable (up to 12  12 square inches in surface area at present), flat, and have a slim form factor (total thickness less than ~ 6 mm).  Thanks to enhancement of the electric field strength in arrays of microcavities fabricated within the lamp, our lamps reliably produce radiant intensities above 110 mW/cm2, which is the highest value among commercially available lamps at 172 nm. Furthermore, the spatial uniformity of light emission across the lamp is extraordinary (&gt; 90 %). These lamps are currently being evaluated by a number of partners and customers. In parallel with our commercialization efforts, we propose to extend the UV lamp technology to the UVC wavelength range (207, 222 nm and 260 nm, in particular) which currently has the market share in UV industrial and applications.  We have already validated the technical feasibility and potential markets for these flat lamps, and it is our intention to develop products and a large-volume manufacturing process to accelerate entry into the marketplace. Ultraviolet light tiles capable of producing tens of mW/cm2 at 207, 222 and 260 nm from various gas emitters and phosphors will be developed, and a product with an active area of 1 square foot at these wavelengths will be commercialized for water treatment and other commercial UV applications (disinfection of surfaces, polymer curing, etc).",

These harsh environments include extreme temperatures (800-1800C), high pressures (500-1000 psi), and highly corrosive/erosive exposures. Consequently, it has been a challenge to develop sensors that can endure these harsh environments. Sporian Microsystems has previously developed a high-temperature sensor technology for power system applications based on the combination of high-temperature packaging and silicon carbide nitride (SiCN) based polymer derived ceramics (PDCs), which possess excellent mechanical and  electric  properties  at  high  temperatures  up  to  1800C.  Sporian  proposes  to  develop  alternative precursors, processes, packaging materials, and methods to extend the current operational capabilities of Sporians sensor technology beyond current limits to 1600-1800C. Sporian worked with energy system OEMs to identify and guide applications/implementations for the technology.  Innovative materials synthesis, micro-fabrication approaches, and new packaging materials/methods were developed and evaluated. Sporian refined and optimized ceramic sensor material formulations and micro-fabrication processes, including extensive mechanical property characterization and thermal stability testing, and increased the key materials thermal stability limit to 1600C. Ultra-high-temperature packaging and sensor design were developed, implemented, and lab tested up to 1800C.  Sporian prototype sensors and packaging hardware has been were successfully demonstrated in the DOE NETL Aerothermal Test Rig combustion environment (1100C, 30 hours), and additional testing (performance and reliability) for the remaining Phase II period is planned. Phase IIA will focus on further maturing the innovative ultra-high temperature  sensor  technology  beyond  current  limitations  through:  improving  polymer  synthesis  and handling processes to increase the stability limits from 1600oC to 1800oC; advancing key aspects of the Phase II packaging, emphasizing long term reliability; rigorous testing of full prototype systems (hardware and electronics), emphasizing reliability assessment/tests to promote post Phase IIA transition oriented activities; and full prototype system testing and demonstration within turbine OEM test systems.\n\nAdvanced sensing systems will be essential to achieving the cost and performance targets in advanced energy and power generation systems as well as aerospace propulsion systems. There is a significant market opportunity and the sensor technology could benefit coal gasifiers, gas turbines, advanced coal combustion systems, oxy-fuel combustion systems, and other critical or high maintenance equipment.  Generating asset OEMs, utilities, and end users will all stand to benefit from these high-efficiency, low emissions power systems.",

        "abstract": "Fuel cells have emerged as a promising new technology for meeting the Nations energy needs. Of the various types, solid oxide fuel cells offer environmentally clean, quiet and highly efficient electricity and heat generation from natural gas and other hydrocarbon fuels. In solid oxide fuel cell systems, cost remains the most significant barrier to widespread commercialization and to achieve the aggressive cost targets requires the use of common stainless steels whenever possible. However, without protective coatings,  air-facing  steel  surfaces  oxidize  and  volatilize  chromium that  poison  the  fuel  cell  stack. Similarly, air/exhaust heat exchangers must be designed to prevent high temperature corrosion and chromium volatilization.  The fuel facing metal surfaces also must be protected from catastrophic failure mechanisms related to oxidation (due to high steam content gas streams), and coking. In Phases 1 and 2, an aluminization coating tailored for the solid oxide fuel cell market was developed. The coating demonstrates excellent resistance to oxidation, chromium volatilization, and coking on a range of common stainless steels. Based on its demonstrated low cost and scalability, this coating technology could provide a cost break-through for solid oxide fuel cell developers, allowing them substitute conventional austenitic and ferritic stainless steel for nickel-based superalloys in applications where high temperature corrosion dominates material selection. In this Phase 2A project, barriers to customer acceptance of the coating technology will be removed through validation of coating lifetime performance in fuel cell stack and balance-of-plant demonstrations. The project will also continue to refine the down selected coating formulation to further improve coating stability for high temperature, highly aggressive environment applications. Outside of fuel cells the coating technology has broad applicability in other high-temperature industries such as power generation, coal gasification, natural gas processing, industrial biomass combustion], and chemical processing plants. Materials requirements are severe for these applications; components must be tolerant to long-term, high temperature exposure in harsh, corrosive environments.  Cost-effective corrosion protection, such as this coating technology would, therefore, be highly attractive, enabling the use of common steels.",

        "abstract": "The proposed program provides a new biomass conversion technology to produce FDCA, 2,5- furandicarboxylic acid, to replace hydrocarbon chemicals for production of commodity plasticizers and  polyester  polymers. Using current  prices,  FDCA  can  economically replace  phthalic  anhydride  and terephthalic acid, commodity chemicals used for production of large volume phthalate plasticizers and polyester polymers.  FDCA is derived from hexose sugars, with 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) as a key intermediate.  Commercial production of FDCA is currently hindered by poor selectivity for the catalytic dehydration of fructose using current catalysts and reaction pathways. The overall goal of the Phase IIA project is to accelerate completion of the commercialization of an innovative technology, Intensified Catalytic and Reactive Distillation, for highly selective production of FDCA from sucrose sugar.  Improved process intensification is achieved by: (1) utilization of reactive distillation to remove water generated by the reaction, thereby suppressing degradation reactions and increasing selectivity;  (2)  development  of  novel  catalysts  for  use  in  reactive  distillation  for  hexose dehydration with high selectivity; and (3) catalytic oxidation of HMF to FDCA at very high yield.\nThe ongoing Phase II program is successfully completing the research and development required to commercialize the novel technology for FDCA production at high selectivity.  The project has developed new catalysts, and a novel reaction system, which has successfully demonstrated fructose conversion to FDCA with greater than 90% selectivity. The novel technology  for  FDCA  production  provides exceptionally attractive economics, with an estimated payout time for a commercial plant investment of less than one year. In the Phase IIA program, research, development, scale up, and commercial validation studies will be completed to accelerate immediate commercialization of the new technology for FDCA production.  The catalysts, reaction system, and overall manufacturing process will be optimized to provide low cost, high quality FDCA product.  A pilot plant will be constructed and operated to validate the technology, provide design and scale up information for commercial production, and support market development activities.  \n\nFDCA produced by the new technology will find immediate application for production of non-phthalate bio-plasticizers for polyvinyl chloride, and the production of large volume polyester polymers for fibers, beverage bottles, and other products.  This will allow conversion of over 10 billion pounds per year  of  commodity chemical  production  from hydrocarbon  to  a  biomass  base,  resulting in reduced greenhouse gases from consumption from the alternative hydrocarbon use and improving long term U.S. competitiveness in global markets.",

        "abstract": "Novel, inline measurement techniques are needed to improve the quality and performance of new solar cells. Manufacturers today measure cell performance inline under white light conditions, but are unable to obtain the cell response as a function of wavelength without extensive offline testing. They are also unable to extract detailed spatial maps of full-spectrum spectral response. This information is fundamental to the device performance and, as device complexity increases it becomes even more important for successful process control, yield management, and module power optimization. This project helps to support the nations long-term energy goal of building higher performance, consistently robust solar devices at a lower cost to the end user. Our current phase II project involves developing the individual components needed for a new class of non-contact solar cell metrology, and will integrate them, by the end of phase II, into a fully functioning prototype at a major U.S. manufacturer. In phases I and II, we developed prototype non-contact sensors and integrated them with an advanced broadband light source. The light source has 64 colors, individually modulated, to simultaneously stimulate cell response from the ultraviolet to infrared.  The response is detected via Fourier analysis in one of three ways: 1) capacitive, non-contact sensors, 2) inductive non-contact sensors and 3) conventional metal contacts. The full-spectrum measurement is completed in one second, and thus is fast enough to be used as an inline process monitor. The non-contact methods show good correlation with the contacting method, and are able to detect subtle shifts in photoresponse long before the device is completed. The resulting system has been tested on both conventional and thin film cells, as well as high performance interdigitated back contact cells. Various sensor configurations were developed and used to measure as early as the emitter formation step, and as late as a fully encapsulated module. In phase IIB, we will develop a new luminescence imaging technique and combine it with the Fourier illumination system developed in phase II to achieve another &gt;1,000x speed improvement. The technique is based on PLE- Photoluminescence Excitation- and will allow high speed imaging of module spectral response both indoors and out. The expected commercial applications are: 1) outdoor module scanner for on-site failure analysis, 2) inline cell spectral sorting and process control, and 3) laboratory failure analysis to determine root cause power loss.",

VCSELs are highly reliable and capable of high temperature operation making them very well suited for ignition systems for automobile engines. In phase I a first version of the igniter was designed, built, and thoroughly tested at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) in a Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) engine. Based on the test results a full prototype will be developed in phase II that meets all the specifications required for successful demonstration and commercialization of the laser - igniter for the automobile engines. Laser ignition using microlasers will be one of the enabling technologies for the next generation of automotive engines that will have very high engine efficiencies and ultra-low NOx emissions. Moreover, this technology is likely to be a key player in the adaptation of alternate fuels, such as, natural gas, methanol, etc. Overall this technology is poised to substantially reduce our gasoline consumption and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. On account of its better performance under challenging and hard to ignite combustion conditions, laser ignition is gaining in popularity and acceptance in other fields of propulsion and energy conversion - engines used for stationary power generation, high-altitude gas turbines, hypersonic aircraft, and rocket ignition.

This project addresses two significant barriers for implementation of wireless technologies in nuclear power plants: 1) electromagnetic compatibility which refers to the ability of plant equipment to withstand wireless transmissions; and 2) coexistence which refers to the ability of various wireless devices to operate in the presence of one another. For electromagnetic compatibility, most equipment in nuclear power plants has not been tested for vulnerability to wireless transmissions. As for coexistence, there is currently no standard test method available to verify that wireless devices will function reliably when operating in close proximity to each other. This project will provide new equipment and technologies to resolve wireless electromagnetic compatibility and coexistence issues and facilitate widespread use of wireless technology in nuclear facilities. The feasibility of the Phase I project goal was established by testing nuclear power plant equipment for immunity to wireless signals and developing mitigation techniques, evaluating wireless coexistence, and designing a cognitive radio system to perform radiated immunity and wireless coexistence testing in nuclear power plants. This proposal offers a hands-on research and development project to build new equipment fir in-plant testing to establish objective exclusion distances for safe and widespread use of wireless devices in nuclear power plants.

Controlling emissions and increasing efficiencies are essential requirements in such future advanced power plants. Herein, next generation power systems require greater flexibility in their operations for meeting the higher efficiency and lower emissions conditions that are geared toward meeting consumer demand and adhering to increased regulatory standards, simultaneously. Devices that can accurately measure the solid flow rate of an operating gas-solid system would be of great aid for optimizing and controlling the combustion processes in advanced reactors. Presently, the availability of such devices, particularly at high temperatures, is very limited. In this Phase II effort, we will build a functional prototype of an Adaptive Electrical Capacitance Volume Tomography (AECVT) system for mass-flow gauging of solids circulating at high temperatures. The intrinsic high measuring speed of capacitance measuring technology and high resolution capability of AECVT technology will enable such mass flow measurements at 5% spatial resolution and 1 Hz temporal resolution. Simulation and preliminary measurement results have verified feasibility of the AECVT architecture, as documented in the attached final report of Phase I. Capacitance sensors exhibit favorable features of safety, flexibility, and suitability for scale-up applications that make them a favorable solution for industrial applications. Tasks in this Phase II will focus on optimizing sensors, electronic hardware, and feature extraction software for hot flow applications based on AECVT technology. Tasks are based on Logical progressions from past experience of developing imaging systems. Successful completion of this Phase II will provide a prototype of an AECVT system for hot temperature applications in harsh conditions reactors that can be extended to many energy-related applications. A logical progression from Phase I to Phase II is established in which Phase II efforts are focused on implementing designs developed on Phase I that proved feasible. The proposed system would also advance multi-phase flow research of hot systems by providing access to obscure locations of a flow system. It also has a very high potential of attracting commercial interests as the need for advanced instrumentation is imminent to address the increased sophistication of advanced power plants.

        "abstract": "Switching power amplifiers (SPAs) are typically built with insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) and have a wide variety of applications within the fusion science community, including feedback and control systems for dynamic plasma stabilization in tokamaks, inductive and arc plasma sources, radio frequency helicity and flux injection, RF plasma heating and current drive schemes, ion beam generation, and RF pre-ionizer systems. SiC MOSFETs offer many advantages over IGBTs including lower drive energy requirements, lower conduction and switching losses, and higher switching frequency capabilities. When comparing SiC and traditional silicon-based MOSFETs, SiC MOSFETs provide higher current carrying capability allowing for smaller package weights and sizes and lower operating temperature. Eagle Harbor Technologies (EHT) is proposing to design, construct, and test a SiC MOSFET-based full- bridge SPA. EHT will leverage the proprietary gate drive technology previously developed with the support of a DOE SBIR, which will enable fast, efficient switching in a compact form factor. EHT designed, built, and tested a SiC MOSFET-based SPA. The work began with SiC MOSFET device testing, which demonstrated the utility of the EHT proprietary gate drive for improving switching speed, quantified the energy lost per switching cycle, and characterized the maximum current per device. EHT produced a SiC MOSFET-based SPA printed circuit board, which was successfully tested into resistive, inductive, and resonant loads at high current and switching frequency. Working with the Helicity Injected Torus (HIT), EHT designed an upgrade to the HIT SPAs to be implemented in a Phase II program. In Year 1, EHT will design and build a second generation SiC MOSFET-based SPA using the lessons learned in the Phase I program. The SPA will be tested into resistive, inductive; plasma loads and demonstrates arbitrary pulse generation. In Year 2, EHT will completely replace the SPAs at HIT, which will more than double the switching frequency and increase the output current per SPA while lowering the parts cost per SPA. EHT will support the installation and testing at HIT while completing the documentation and commercialization effort.\n\nAn off-the-shelf SPA that is straightforward to use and integrates into experimental systems will benefit the fusion science community, which primarily develops power systems in house, thereby utilizing time and resources that could be used on plasma physics and fusion science research. Similar devices are used in other research areas including linear particle accelerator supplies, high voltage ion implantation supplies, RF cyclotron power supplies, high power pulse width modulation amplifiers, and high power trigger systems. Additionally, the EHT SiC MOSFET-based SPA will allow for new capabilities for etch and sputtering applications within the materials science and semiconductor processing communities.",

        "abstract": "In order to optimize the operating efficiency of transmission systems utilities must be able to quickly restore service after a failure.  Locating faults with current technologies can be a time consuming, skill and labor intensive process. Underground transmission systems are hidden from view and fault location can take sometimes days or weeks. Detecting and locating incipient faults prior to failure can permit intervention by the operator to prevent damage or unsafe condition and reduce cost. Branched overhead transmission systems in rural areas can be beyond the reach of accurate fault locating SCADA systems increasing time of location and repair. The proposed solution for these challenges will allow the operator to: Reduce time and skill level for fault location and repair  Expand the reach of quick and accurate fault responses in rural areas  Identify and correct incipient faults in transmission systems. To execute the above, USi intends - for pipe-type cable systems - to develop a partial discharge detection system for location of faults and incipient faults. Pipe-type cable represent more than 80% of transmission cable systems installed in the US. Additionally a fault location system using hydraulic transients will be developed for pipe-type cable systems. For overhead transmission systems expanded capabilities of the newly developed USi PD3 Power Donut sensor platform for fault location applications will be analyzed and a software application design will be provided. Design of test procedures for fault location will be provided as fault demonstrations in actual systems are not practical. USi is a leader in advanced diagnostics for underground and overhead transmission systems with over 30 years experience in the design, manufacture and field application of monitoring, rating, diagnostics and control systems.  USi has also successfully deployed worldwide the Power Donut system - a distributed dynamic line rating system for overhead lines. Successful implementation of the proposed systems has social, technical, and economic benefits to the U.S. The social benefit to the U.S. is the security and comfort that the public derives in knowing that the U.S. has the most technologically advanced electric power transmission grid. The technical benefit to the U.S. includes establishing a leadership role in the development of next-generation of fault locating devices delivering increased system availability and safety. The economic benefit to the U.S. is created through faster, more accurate fault location in both underground and overhead transmission systems to reduce unavailability of important transmission circuits. The availability of advanced sensors and systems will also enhance the United States competitive position into a market that is becoming increasingly dominated by foreign-based technologies.",

To address the challenge of providing clean fresh water to meet the earths growing population, new innovative solutions are required to desalinate water without using membranes. A new membraneless desalination system was developed based on capacitive deionization technology. A desalination reactor was designed that incorporated inexpensive carbon-based electrodes that were enhanced to give high capacitance. These material and reactor design enhancements were operated in the desalination mode as well as in the regeneration mode to recover some of the energy. A Phase I program demonstrated a new capacitive deionization cell design that can process high flow rates of brackish to seawater sources. Inexpensive carbon based electrodes were functionalized using low cost materials and methods to enhance the capacitance. Cells were developed and shown to desalinate water showing the merits of the electrode materials and reactor design. A mathematical model of the capacitance deionization cell was developed to help elucidate the desalination and regeneration operating modes. A Phase II program is focusing on optimizing the electrode capacitance, optimizing a mathematical model of the capacitive deionization reactor, scaling the cells to larger sizes, developing, and optimizing the cell manufacturing process, and producing a 400 gallon/day operational system that will process seawater to 500 ppm salinity levels.\n\nThis membraneless desalination system simplifies the operation and maintenance of the reactor by eliminating membrane fouling while helping to lower the operating costs for desalinating water. The initial market for this reactor is as an onsite water deionization system that can provide potable drinking water from ocean and brackish waters.",

        "abstract": "Most liquid high-level nuclear waste is currently being immobilized to a solid form as a borosilicate glass by vitrification. However, many nuclear wastes have complex and diverse chemical compositions that reduce their compatibility with borosilicate glass. The current baseline spent nuclear fuel reprocess generates secondary waste streams that generally include large amounts of MoO3 and noble metals that are poorly soluble in borosilicate glasses and thereby limit the waste loading. New waste forms as alternatives to borosilicate glass are being sought to increase the waste loading while retaining acceptable chemical durability and thus to decrease the total nuclear waste volume required for storage and disposal. The main goal of the SBIR Phase I and Phase II projects is to develop suitable iron phosphate-based compositions for vitrifying the MoO3-rich waste (Collins-CLT) generated from reprocessed spent nuclear fuel with greater waste loadings than can presently be achieved with borosilicate glass and while retaining chemical durability that meets or exceeds appropriate Department of Energy (DOE) standards. The Phase I research successfully produced an iron phosphate waste form containing 40 wt% of simulated Collins-CLT waste, and this waste form can be prepared at\n1300C. The product consistency test (PCT) response and the vapor hydration test (VHT) corrosion rate of this waste form (as-cast) meet current DOE chemical durability requirements. Structure-composition-property relationships in simplified Na-Fe-Mo-phosphate glasses were also studied to better understand the more complex waste-loaded glasses.\nPhase II activities will build on the Phase I accomplishments by optimizing the iron phosphate compositions and measuring useful thermal, electrical, and chemical properties of the iron phosphate waste forms for commercial-scale production. The Phase II work will also address the unanswered questions identified in Phase I, including the preferential molybdenum leach rate, the nature of the Mo-Fe redox reactions in glass melts, and the effects of melt redox on the waste form structure and chemical stability. Commercial-scale (60 kg) melting of a selected iron phosphate waste form in a cold crucible induction melter will be demonstrated.\n\nThe proposed research will produce chemically stable iron phosphate waste forms with increased radioactivity concentrations that will reduce by up to 50% the total nuclear waste volume from spent nuclear fuel needed for long-term storage and disposal. This would lead to considerable savings of time and money for the Nations effort to remediate nuclear waste especially that associated with the advanced domestic fuel cycle program.",

        "abstract": "The use of advanced ceramic materials for light water reactor fuel cladding is being investigated, in part due to increased safety margins over conventional metallic claddings.  In light of the Fukushima events, safety concerns have come to the forefront of public scrutiny of commercial nuclear generated power, spurring activity in this arena.  While the safety benefits of advanced ceramics are alone attractive, there are other desirable characteristics including the maintenance of strength and neutron (and thus power generation) efficiency which have their own benevolent cascades.  A deterrent, however,  is  the  current  cost  of  production  of  these  materials.    In the research quantities currently produced, ceramics are an order of magnitude more expensive than standard metallics on a per-length basis.  For commercial introduction, economy of scale alone cannot be expected to narrow this cost differential.  Decreasing the cost of production and establishing a uniform process that produces material of consistent quality will make advanced ceramics a more cost-competitive technology for fuel cladding. The reusable mandrel proposed in this project is an enabling technology for the fabrication of a full length 14-foot tube ceramic tube, which has to-date not been demonstrated.  Demonstrating this mandrel, its potential cost saving, and in-pile performance of material fabricated is an another incremental step addressing large-scale manufacturing challenges increasing the chances that advanced ceramic claddings can be introduced commercially. In Phase I, a number of small reusable mandrels were fabricated with the survivability of these items throughout the process of fabricating silicon carbide, and afterwards, was demonstrated.  The capability of re-use of these mandrels was suggested when it was shown that a silicon carbide layer could be successfully removed from an apparently undamaged mandrel.\n\nIf successful in Phase II, a mandrel technology will be demonstrated with the capability of producing 14-foot lengths of tubing, a major milestone, and enabling technology for the production of advanced ceramic cladding.  The technology of this product is not limited to any of the specific designs currently proposed, and is thus applicable for use with any of the expected ceramic fuel clad manufacturers.     The current market for cladding is over 150,000 linear feet annually for each light water nuclear reactor, with a fleet of over 300 reactors worldwide.  This reusable technology reduces the cost of production, and alone could be worth a minimum of $750,000 in cost reductions to the price of fuel annually for each reactor that adopts ceramics for their safety benefits.  Over the entire fleet, this is a considerable savings of over $33 million annually.",

        "abstract": "Ensuring safety and public acceptance of Geologic Carbon Sequestration (GCS), a preferred means of mitigating CO2 emissions from fossil-fueled plants, requires novel cost-effective tools and methods for monitoring, verifying, and accounting (MVA) to detect any CO2 leakage from sequestration reservoirs. A complementary need exists for the ability to monitor the progress of the injected CO2 plume and its preferred migration paths. Requisite tools include reliable long-term sensitive, autonomous and cost- effective measurements to detect, locate, and quantify the presence of migrating or escaping CO2. We are developing a laser-based sensor for permanently-installed, downhole CO2 measurements at GCS sites. This sensor is small and robust and versatile enough to be deployed in injection, monitor, and microhole wells (~1-3 dia.) to several thousand meters depth. The system employs a tunable laser beam transmitted via optical fiber to interrogate reservoir fluid in situ via a remote probe sensor head suspended downhole. The novel technology will supplement PSIs ground-level laser-based sensor prototype, demonstrated at the Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortiums (MGSC) Validation Field Project Site in Decatur, IL. In the Phase I program, proof of principle was established for overcoming the spectroscopic challenges of laser-based absorption measurements in the extremes of the downhole environment. Laboratory measurements of high pressure and temperature CO2 and brine supported the predicted CO2 detection capabilities. Discussions with industry helped provide a greater understanding of the application needs, as well as important engineering details for downhole sensor deployment. A top level design concept was also generated as a starting point for a Phase II prototype. The proposed Phase II project entails the sequential design and construction of an Alpha and Beta prototype sensor, the former to be tested in a high pressure, high temperature laboratory chamber, and the latter to be deployed down a monitor well at a GCS research site. These efforts will be supplemented by an analysis and testing of the sensor capability on enhanced oil recovery (EOR) downhole fluids. Finally, a final design and market strategy for a commercial prototype sensor will be designed.\n\nThis network of downhole sensors will provide (1) improved understanding of CO2 storage and transport processes, (2) continuous monitoring of migration of stored CO2, and (3) assurance of storage reservoir stability, including protection of neighboring property and aquifers. Commercial sensor sales are envisioned worldwide for geologic sequestration programs and research, oil and gas industry, deep seawater inorganic carbon characterization, and in monitoring supercritical carbon dioxide applications (solvent, refrigerant, sterilizer, reagent).",

        "abstract": "Dry cask storage systems (DCSS) are used to store spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants. Without a long term storage solution in place, storage for decades in casks may be required. High burnup fuel rods may become brittle over time presenting problems for eventual transport of the spent fuel from reactor sites to a central storage facility.  It is desired to passively determine the structural integrity of spent  fuel  assemblies  by  monitoring  conditions  inside  the  casks  including  temperatures,  pressures, corrosion products and radioactive decay elements. The presence of Kr-85, a high yield, long-life fission product gas, in the outer envelope of a dry storage cask is an indicator of a fuel rod cladding breach. RMD will investigate radiation detectors for monitoring beta particle emissions from Kr-85 radiation while inside storage casks. In particular, the design goal is to detect beta particles in the presence of strong background gamma rays. Diamond is a wide  band  gap  semiconductor  that  can  operate  at  elevated  temperatures  and  under  high  radiation conditions, and with intrinsic properties that enable high count rate detection. Detectors were fabricated from synthetic diamond samples, both polycrystalline and single crystal. Their  sensitivity  to  beta  particles  from  Kr-85  and  photons  (such  as  from  Cs-137)  were  measured. Operating a stack of two diamond detectors in coincidence was found to be an effective technique for discriminating between beta and gamma interactions. And most impressively, the diamond detectors were found to operate with low noise even at elevated temperatures. RMD will optimize the diamond devices and determine a final detector assembly. A significant effort will involve pushing the detector design to operate under harsher conditions, through more in-depth testing with collaborators, particularly under higher radiation conditions. From design and evaluation, RMD will initiate construction of complimentary electronics. Finally, there will be further outreach to specialists in the field who can ensure that the sensor is adaptable to plans for future waste storage (and other nuclear fuel cycle needs).\n\nIn addition to monitoring status of nuclear waste inside storage casks, non-destructive evaluation, particle physics and homeland security are also possible areas that would benefit from a rad hard beta particle detector, which could operate at elevated temperatures if need be. Bore hole logging is another high temperature detector application. Due to its high density of nuclei, diamond is promising for fast neutron detection. Diamond detectors are also well suited for tissue equivalent dosimeter applications.",

Past efforts have focused on either developing technologies to replace heavy steel components or using high-strength steels to reduce the amount of steel needed for the same load-bearing capacity. However, these techniques have proved problematic because the former requires expensive exotic materials and expensive factory retooling for manufacturers, while the latter involves using high strength steels that require expensive alloying elements or are brittle and unsuitable for automotive applications.  SFP Works has developed a novel heat treating process to create low-cost, very high-strength steel known as Flash Processing or Flash Bainite that uses a thermal cycle of less than 10 seconds to create a ductile and weldable steel well suited or the automotive industry. In this proposed effort, SFP Works will a) further develop SBIR Phase I proven methods by showing commercial feasibility of room temperature forming/stamping of Flash Bainite 1500MPa and b) create complete process parameterization and weld schedules for multiple Flash alloys for full scale commercialization leading to a weight/cost savings of 33-50% of the metal in a vehicle. In Phase I, SFP Works formed Flash Processed steel for automotive structural applications and conducted preliminary evaluations with an automotive OEM to determine the suitability of those parts for automotive applications. In the Phase II effort, SFP Works will define Flash processing specifications and characterize the resultant material in grades, compositions, and formats relevant to automotive applications. SFP Works will also conduct application trials, experiments, and evaluations with relevant automotive OEM and suppliers in order to validate characterization data.\n\nFlash Processed steel will provide Americans with lighter more fuel efficient vehicles that also perform as well, or better, in all passenger protection safety tests.

        "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (or 3D printing) is now becoming sufficiently accurate with a large range of materials for use in printing sensors needed universally in fusion energy research. Decreasing production cost and significantly lowering design time of energy subsystems would realize significant cost reduction for standard diagnostics commonly obtained through research grants. There is now a well-established set of plasma diagnostics  (see e.g. [1]), but remain one of the most expensive subsystems in any fusion system since for every system they have to be custom built,  and time for diagnostic development can sometimes pace the project.  Additive manufacturing (3D printing)  is developing rapidly, including open source designs.  These basic components can be printed for (in some cases) less than 1/100th costs of conventional manufacturing. In our DOE Phase I SBIR we have examined the impact that AM can have on plasma diagnostic cost by taking 15 separate diagnostics through an engineering design using Conventional Manufacturing (CM) techniques to determine costs of components and labor costs associated with getting the diagnostic to work as intended. With that information in hand, we set about optimizing the design to exploit the benefits of AM. The impact on cost is found to be in several areas. First, the cost of materials falls because AM parts can be manufactured without waste, and engineered to use less material than CM. Next, the cost of fabrication falls for AM parts relative to CM since the fabrication process can lead to the combination of multiple components as highly complex monoliths (which can be manufactured less expensively than separate unit components). We find that complexity comes at no additional cost (cooling channels for example can be built in to plasma-facing components at no extra cost). Costs associated with assembly are lower for AM because many components can be combined and printed as monoliths, thereby mitigating the need for e.g. alignment, or calibration.  Finally, the cost of engineering is impacted by exploiting AM design tools that allow standard components to be customized through web-interfaces. We find that concept design costs can also be impacted by scripting interfaces to the online engineering design tools. In Phase II, we will exploit advances in additive manufacturing technology for novel materials, multi- materials, and tolerances required for manufacture of most, if not all major diagnostic systems, continuing our design work, and optimizing designs of principle diagnostics for AM. As with Phase I, all designs will be made available for free to those who may wish to print up the diagnostic components themselves.  One principle issue with AM is the qualification of materials for use in the fusion environment, and so we will work to meet technical specifications of major fusion facilities. Our commercialization plan is to use AM to develop diagnostics, offering complete systems at substantially lower cost than conventional manufacturing. We will prove out the technology in fusion applications before servicing a wider scientific instrumentation market worldwide.",

        "abstract": "According to the World Nuclear Association, the U.S. is the largest producer of nuclear power worldwide. In fact, the U.S. provides over 30 percent of the worlds nuclear generation of electricity. Although few new reactors have been built in the past 30 years, the association anticipates that four to six reactors may be built by 2020. The first of the reactors will be built in response to 16 license applications, which have been completed since 2007, to build 24 additional nuclear reactors. Currently, both government and industry are working to accelerate approval for the construction and design of new nuclear energy plants. The U.S. nuclear industry has already achieved significant developments in the implementation of nuclear power plants due to advancements in refueling, maintenance, and safety systems at current power plants.   Meanwhile, changes in government policy, which have occurred since the late 1990s, have provided for noteworthy expansion in nuclear capacity. For example, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 evoked investment in electricity infrastructure such as nuclear power. Today, the importance of nuclear power in the U.S. is a geopolitical matter as much as it is an economic one. This is due to the notion that increasing the use of nuclear power reduces the U.S.s reliance on imported oil and gas. In order to design future systems and continue operational improvements at existing U.S. plants, advanced modeling, and simulation of nuclear power reactors is crucial. In this proposal, we will develop a full-featured open-source Cloud/Web-based simulation environment for nuclear energy advanced modeling and simulation.   Our approach simplifies the workflow, elevates the need for in-house computational science and engineering experts, and lowers the capital investments required for advanced modeling and simulation.  The Cloud/Web-based simulation environment simply guides end-users and developers through the advanced modeling and simulation lifecycle.  In addition to providing significantly improved, intuitive software, the environment offers reproducible workflows where the full path of data from input to final analyzed results can be saved, shared, and even published as supporting information. The work proposed here addresses current deficiencies for utilizing advanced modeling and simulation by building a flexible, open-source Cloud/Web-based simulation environment or framework that stresses interoperability and ease-of-use.  In particular, we are targeting nuclear energy, engineering, and manufacturing firms that can clearly benefit from this technology, given that we will make these tools easier to use, reduce the need for in house expertise, and reduce the overall capital costs of using advanced modeling and simulation.",

        "abstract": "The massive quantities of concrete used worldwide (estimated at 30 billion tons/yr), and the susceptibility of concrete to carbonation provide opportunities for chemical binding of significant quantities of carbon dioxide. The resulting carbonates can enhance the material properties of concrete by supplementing the binding effects of cement hydrates. Carbonation of concrete without tailoring its chemistry, however, lowers the pore solution alkalinity, and thus the long-term stability of cement hydrates and the oxide layer protecting reinforcing steel against corrosion. Beneficial CO2 sequestration in concrete also requires development of economical means of delivering carbon dioxide to induce timely and homogeneous carbonation reactions across the concrete volume. The main thrust of this project is to develop robust and commercially viable methods for chemical binding of large CO2 volumes in concrete while realizing balanced gains in material properties. These methods are compatible with the manufacturing process of cementitious materials and the prevalent concrete production and construction practices. They suit existing concrete chemistries, and can also stimulate longer-term transition to more sustainable chemistries. The project employs the inherent affinity of cementitious materials for carbonation to make direct use of flue gas, thus eliminating the need for costly CO2 separation. The Phase I project developed economical and scalable methods for delivering carbon dioxide to concrete in the form of carbonate anions incorporated into cementitious particles. This approach induces timely and homogeneous carbonation reactions which supplement hydration of cementitious materials for enhancing the structure and properties of concrete. Additives with complementary mechanisms of action were identified for enhancing the CO2 uptake, the beneficial carbonation reactions, and the long-term stability of cement hydrates and steel reinforcement in concrete. The compatibility of the technology with the conventional chemistry of concrete was demonstrated, and its enabling role towards transition to more sustainable chemistries was verified. Initial and life-cycle analyses validated the significant merits of the technology as a commercially viable approach to high-impact CO2 sequestration, and as an effective means of addressing critical needs relevant to the concrete-based infrastructure. The proposed Phase II project will: (i) adapt the technology for use with broader selections of raw materials and additives; (ii) devise refined chemistries for selective sorption of carbon dioxide from flue gas; (iii) thoroughly characterize the structure and properties of cementitious materials embodying carbonate anions, and concrete materials with integrated hydrate and carbonate binders; (iv) scale-up the process in an industrial manufacturing plant where cement and slag processing is accompanied with flue gas emission; (v) demonstrate the compatibility of cementitious materials embodying carbonate anions with industrial-scale concrete production and field construction; (vi) elaborate and model the mechanisms of CO2 sorption and the subsequent beneficial carbonation; and (vii) conduct refined initial and life-cycle analyses to further verify and quantify the benefits of the technology in terms of CO2 sequestration and emission control, energy and cost savings, and enhancing the longevity, efficiency and life-cycle economy of the concrete- based infrastructure. Cement and concrete industries have made commitments towards pilot-scale implementation and field evaluation of the technology.",

        "abstract": "Neutron radiography using the foil-film transfer method is currently employed for the quantitative evaluation of the geometric and compositional characteristics of nuclear fuel burn-up distribution, visualization of cracks and void formations, fuel location determination, pellet-clad and pellet-pellet gaps identification, and to understand the state of non-fuel component geometries.  Although this method is gamma insensitive and provides large area high spatial resolution radiographs, this process takes significant time to produce an image, which is impractical for neutron radiography and/or tomography.   A large area digital detector that can simultaneously provide high spatial resolution, rapid response, and can operate in a harsh radiation environment is needed to accomplish these tasks. We are developing a novel solid-state digital imaging detector based on neutron intercepting integrated circuit.   This detector offers high sensitivity to thermal neutrons, is insensitive to gamma radiation, has fast temporal response, is able to image highly-radioactive specimens with high spatial resolution, and can withstand intense mixed radiation environments.  Low cost modular design and easy scalability to realize very large active areas are its other attractive features. In Phase I, we established the feasibility of developing a solid-state neutron radiography detector through experimental  tests  conducted  at  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory and  at  Idaho  National  Laboratory.    The prototype detector demonstrated high efficiency to thermal neutrons, exceptional spatial resolution, insensitivity to gamma background from fuel specimens, and its ability to acquire images in minutes under realistic field conditions. The goal of the Phase II program is to develop a fully functional, large area digital neutron detector.  The IC readout circuitry, data acquisition hardware, and software will be developed.  The resulting prototype will be thoroughly characterized to demonstrate its sensitivity to neutrons, insensitivity to gamma radiation, high resolution imaging capability, and its ability to operate in a harsh radiation environment under field conditions. Technology commercialization activities will also be undertaken in parallel.\n\nThe proposed neutron detector applications include non-destructive testing, baggage scanning at entry ports, diffraction studies in support of research in medicine, energy, and transportation at facilities worldwide including at DOEs Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) and at the Los Alamos Neutron Scattering Center (LANCE).   The Department of Homeland Securitys (DHS), Department of Defenses (DOD), and DOEs future deployments of radiation detection portal monitors will benefit from the proposed development.",

        "abstract": "The primary barrier to widespread adoption of solid-state lighting is its high initial cost relative to other options  approximately two times more expensive than equivalent compact fluorescent lamps, and five times more expensive than equivalent downlight fixtures. The performance and cost of solid-state lighting driver circuitry, which comprises 15-20% of the cost of a commercial lamp, operates at a nominal efficiency of 84%, and is the lamps primary failure mode. This project addresses these problems using a novel, natively digital approach to safely distribute high voltage direct current power. Having the ability to differentiate human touch or a fault from normal electrical loads, the novel technology allows high voltage lighting power to be safely installed without conduit and with limited to no licensed electrician involvement.  It offers the benefits of safe, low cost installation associated with low voltage lighting systems but without the downside of limited power and lower efficiency. In Phase I of the project, the technology was shown to reduce the total cost of ownership of solid-state lighting systems by more than 35% by reducing installation cost, energy use, and lamp replacement costs. The technology was used to replace low efficiency solid-state lighting driver circuitry with a high efficiency, high reliability central power supply  improving power conversion efficiency from 84% to 90% -- and to demonstrate inline control of lighting fixtures.  In Phase II, the technology will be integrated into a commercial lighting fixture and certified as a Class 2 Power Limited Circuit, which will allow these fixtures to be installed without conduit and with limited licensed electrician involvement. The technology will be further optimized for commercial applications by improving the end-to-end conversion efficiency to 93% and by increasing the power capacity. The technology will be deployed in two commercial building pilots to assess the benefits along multiple dimensions (installation, reliability, efficiency, and controls integration). Solid-state lighting fixtures optimized to utilize the technology are targeted for deployment in large commercial buildings, such as offices, hospitals, and retail spaces.  Its high efficiency architecture directly reduces energy use and carbon dioxide emissions, and, by driving down the cost of solid-state lighting systems, it enables broad-based adoption of solid-state lighting technology. Ultimately, the technology can be used to form a multifunctional, direct current, in-building power grid that offers radical improvements in installation costs, reliability, efficiency, and adaptability to alternative energy sources, while providing embedded data capabilities for controls and mobile networking.",

        "abstract": "In liquid fueled combustion systems it is necessary for the fuel to vaporize prior to combustion. As a result, a method to quantify the amount of vapor that exists in the spray plume is desired in order to help understand the evaporation process.  Such results are also useful in validating detailed computer models of this same process.  Unfortunately, such a measurement is very difficult in practice due to the complex interaction of the spray droplets with any method applied. The objective of the proposed effort is to develop a robust diagnostic method to quantify the planar concentration of fuel vapor, fuel liquid, and gas phase temperature in a spray plume. The method proposed is to use multi-angular light extinction using collinear laser beams of specific wavelengths generated by tunable diode lasers. The wavelengths selected will allow differences in the absorbed light to be used to quantify fuel vapor, fuel liquid and gas temperature.  Laser extinction is a very robust reliable method and the use of differential absorption eliminates challenges with windows, droplets effects, and dense spray issues that tend to plaque laser sheet imaging methods typically used. In Phase I, laser absorption was successfully applied to determine fuel vapor concentration within a gasoline spray plume using existing lasers and available wavelengths.  Several wavelength pairs were evaluated for performance and some limitations were identified with the existing lasers. This led to identification of other available lasers/wavelengths that should be pursued to optimize the system performance in Phase II.  In addition, laser absorption was demonstrated for determining the gas phase temperature. A concept for doing these measurements simultaneously was developed which is straightforward. The framework for applying tomography (to generate planar images of the vapor and temperature fields) for multi-path, multi-wavelength TDLAS was established.  Initial coding was carried out to allow planar reconstruction of an asymmetric spray.  An initial opto-mechanical design (lasers, controllers, fiber optics, detectors) for a fully integrated system including the strategy to gather results from multiple angles was developed.  In addition, light scattering models were developed in MatLab to simulate and account for known wavelength dependent scattering when using multiple wavelengths. In Phase II, the wavelengths for optimum simultaneous probing for fuel vapor and temperature will be finalized and procured. This step will be done in conjunction with establishing the necessary temperature dependent spectroscopy of gasoline for these wavelengths along with consideration for any interfering species (e.g., water, carbon dioxide). The expected improved performance using these wavelengths will be verified in gasoline sprays under non-reacting and reacting conditions and at high pressure conditions. The initial opto-mechanical design developed in Phase I will be refined and optimized for the recommended wavelengths. The tomography framework will be further evolved to incorporate the finalized opto-mechanical design.  System software with an initial graphical user interface will be developed for a prototype instrument that will be assembled in Phase II.  The overall system will be sufficiently refined such that it can be used for trade show demonstrations as well as for demonstration at potential customer locations.  A number of OEM supporters have been identified and have provided letters indicating interesting in the instrument and allowing access to practical automotive research facilities with optical engines.  A major instrument vendor has indicated support for helping ERC evolve the prototype to a commercial product and to provide appropriate licensing options.\n\nThe proposed instrument fills a significant niche in the diagnostics market for spray characterization.  If successful this instrument will be of great interest to a wide range of OEMs and component suppliers for fuel injectors for many applications. The data generated can be used to gain insight into the fuel injection process and also provide important validation data for models.  With validated models, fuel injector and combustion designers can more efficiently develop higher efficiency, clean burning liquid fueled engines which will reduce fuel costs and reduce pollutant emissions.",

A significant amount of research has been devoted to developing new materials with increased capacity and performance. In order to minimize the cell weight, new cell design techniques are also required that minimize the mass fraction of the inactive components. The Phase II effort will build on the Phase I results and demonstrate the ability to construct cells offering a ~25% increase in cell energy density as compared to cells built with current components and techniques. Two improvements will be made to realize these gains. First, a novel anode current collector will reduce the inactive weight in the cell. Second, commercially available cathode materials offering higher capacity will be integrated together with an electrode formulation technique that maximizes the active material percentage. During the Phase I effort, a novel anode current collector and cathode coating/electrode formulation techniques were successfully demonstrated that enable the construction of lithium ion cells with increased energy density. Testing demonstrated the ability to increase the energy density while maintaining the cycle life required for use in electric vehicles. The objective of the Phase II effort is to scale-up the technologies demonstrated during Phase I so as to produce cells with higher energy density than achievable using conventional materials and techniques. Testing will demonstrate that these cells deliver the required cycling and rate performance required for use in electric vehicle applications. \n\nThe developed techniques will allow the design of cells offering higher energy densities at lower cost for all commercial applications.

        "abstract": "The electricity produced from fossil fuels is essential to the worlds prosperity and security.  On the other hand, increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration caused by the fossil fuel combustion are causing concerns regarding global warming.  Although there are several methods for separating CO2 from the flue gases at existing coal-fired power plants, all of them have significant drawbacks, including loss of efficiency and increased capital and operating costs that dramatically increase the cost of electricity. TDA Research, Inc. (TDA), in collaboration with Membrane Technology Research Corporation and the  University  of  California,  Irvine  are  developing  a  low  cost,  high  capacity  sorbent  that  will integrate into a membrane-sorbent hybrid post-combustion carbon capture system to remove CO2 from coal-fired power plant effluents. In Phase I, we optimized the sorbent to meet the needs of the application.  Our preliminary analysis results indicate the sorbent system operated in a concentration swing mode will have a significantly lower cost than an equivalent membrane system, increasing the economic viability of the carbon capture process.  Sorbent improvements also enabled lower oxygen transfer rates from the boiler air intake side to the flue gas side.  The process simulation suggested a plant efficiency of 29.74% for the hybrid system which is well above that can be achieved by the state-of-the-art amine scrubbing technology and the CO2 capture cost is estimated to be less than $42.2 per tonne on 2007 $ basis. In our Phase II work, we will work on further enhancing the CO2 capacity of the sorbent, while further reducing their oxygen affinity.   We will assess the impact of critical parameters at bench- scale and carry out adsorption/desorption cycles (a minimum of 10,000 cycle test).  We will then assess the performance of an integrated 2 to 5 scfm unit in the field using actual coal-derived flue gas.  We will carry out the process simulation work and evaluate the techno-economic viability of the new CO2 capture technology retrofit to the existing pulverized coal power plants using the methodology described in NETLs Carbon Capture and Sequestration Systems Analysis Guidelines.\n\nCO2 is a major greenhouse gas and the most dominant source for the anthropogenic CO2 emissions. It  is  a  by-product  of  the  combustion  of  fossil  fuels,  in  particular  burning  coal  for  generating electricity.   The proposed technology will provide a cost effective way to control CO2 emissions from the existing and new coal-fired power plants.

        "abstract": "In fusion plasmas, ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) and lower hybrid range of frequency (LHRF) power is anticipated to be a primary auxiliary heating and current drive sources in next step tokamak experiments like ITER.  From a technological perspective, several challenges remain including electrical breakdown and material compatibility with a nuclear environment. Copper has been the primary material used in present experiments due to its high thermal and electrical conductivity.  In a nuclear reactor, copper will be restricted to thin coatings due to material swelling from neutron bombardment and poor mechanical strength at high temperature expected in fusion reactors.   Recent experimental results suggest that high magnetic field or pulsed surface heating limits the attainable electric fields.  Copper alloys with higher tolerance to surface fatigue have indeed shown improvements.  The natural extension is to develop high strength and high melting temperature refractory metal coatings that are more tolerant to surface fatigue and compatible with nuclear environment.  Recent testing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has shown considerable promise for refractory metal coatings.  However, improvements in density and conductivity are needed.    During Phase I, innovative electrochemical forming (EL-Form) techniques have been developed that enable the deposition of dense, high purity, well-adhered refractory metal coatings on Inconel substrates.   Phase I testing has shown the EL-Form coatings are superior to the previous generation of ICRF refractory metal coatings.  During Phase II, the refractory metal coating techniques will be optimized and scaled for coating large antenna straps.  The optimized techniques will then be used to produce ICRF antennas that will be tested at MITs Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC).\n\nThe development of dense, well-bonded refractory metal coatings on Inconel substrates will enable the fabrication of ICRF antennas with improved breakdown resistance and performance. In addition, the same techniques used to produce these deposits on Inconel substrates can be used for other applications including aerospace, defense, propulsion, power generation, electrical contact and switch gear, semiconductor, crucibles, heat shields, x-ray targets, wear and corrosion protection coatings.",

However, only 0.65% of the worlds water resources are available as freshwater, and the demand on the worlds water reserves continues to increase, with the demand beginning to outpace the supply in many areas. A water-energy nexus is being reached that requires low-cost and low-energy solutions for various degrees of treated water Seawater and other saline water materials make up around 98% of the available water, representing an almost unlimited supply. The energy, cost, and maintenance to remove salts and other unwanted compounds, however, are barriers to widespread implementation of salt-to- freshwater facilities. These facilities most commonly use reverse osmosis (RO) systems. Because of the required high pressures and moving parts, these facilities consume much grid energy and require constant maintenance, leading to high capital and operational costs.

The solution is to create a contaminant-free, self-skinned puck from inexpensive powdered titanium and rapidly densify it into a solid near-net shape component that is over 99.9% porosity free using mass production techniques. The Phase I program demonstrated the ability to densify powdered titanium in a mold cavity to create near-net shapes using a powder pack. The powder pack is essentially a can that is filled with titanium powder and purged to remove gaseous contaminants. The powder pack is then placed in a mold with a complex geometry and processed into a solid component using thermal cycling to densify the material.

        "abstract": "Solar PV pricing has two primary components: hardware costs and soft costs. Hardware innovations, volume manufacturing and competition made significant effects on hardware pricing, but now hardware costs are plateaud and a fundamental change is needed to continue that downward pricing trend. While efforts continue to reduce soft and balance of system (BOS) costs, they too will plateau, especially with diverse components that require custom installations for virtually every site. eIQ believes that the industry must drive to standardized, integrated systems that offer plugnplay benefits. eIQ Energys parallel, HVDC (High Voltage DC) electronics offers to change that by taking the output of each module, regardless of its characteristics, and normalizing it to a high voltage DC buss that can be standardized regardless of the size, location, technology or end use. Each PV-module now becomes a known, independent power building block and by removing the co-dependence of modules and integrating the module and the electronics, standard building blocks can now be realized, leading to further integration and thereby reducing fixed and labor costs. Additionally, because the vBoost now adds current instead of voltage, 2x-3x more power can be transmitted over the same wire as a maximum series string configuration, leading to further cost reduction and installation simplification. The eIQ Energy patented technology works by taking the output of the PV-module, typically 20V to 120V, and boosts the voltage to between 320Vdc and 900Vdc. This voltage is determined by the part number and the HVDC buss requirements and is typically set by the inverter or the buss attached electronics such as battery storage. On the module side, the vBoost performs maximum power point tracking (MPPT) to ensure maximum energy extraction from the PV-module. In-circuit elements control the operation of the vBoost, including safety/remote disable, arc fault protection, and, data gathering and transmission. In Phase I, eIQ successfully developed new architecture that took the existing vBoost, encased in a large, aluminum box, and reduced it so that it can now fit within the junction box of the PV-module. Prototypes were made and tested and operate as designed. Cost targets demonstrated that the vBoost electronics are now 1/5th or so of their original cost. During Phase I, eIQ worked closely with key module manufacturers, customers and businesses to develop keen interest in the PV-module integrated vBoost and has received several letters of interest. During this time, eIQ also worked with an innovative module technology company that has developed a light weight, frameless PV-module ideal for eIQs technology. The vBoost technology is also perfect for integrating renewable energy into microgrids that operate on the emerging 380Vdc buss standard. The technology is also suitable in rural electrification, agriculture and military applications. In Phase II, eIQ will productize the vBoost. This will include optimizing the prototype design, developing the enclosure and interconnections, and working with key partners on commercialization. Once completed, the technology will be able to offer a truly plug and play solution that will standardize PV installations and reduce the BOS and other soft costs.",

        "abstract": "Even with the current expansion of rare earth mining in the US, Canada, and Australia, there is a gas in the supply chain where the ores and concentrates from these mines are converted into metals and alloys. A novel technology for extraction of metals that is cleaner, greener, and cheaper than incumbent technologies has been developed. Neodymium is a essential element for the powerful permanent magnets used wind turbines, electric vehicles, and other applications. However, neodymium is classified by the Department of Energy as critical due to insufficient and insecure supply, including a virtual monopoly by a few companies in China. Furthermore, incumbent technologies for producing metal from rare earth ores are inefficient, environmentally unfriendly, and unsustainable. The proposed solution is molten oxide electrolysis (MOE), which will produce neodymium metal and alloys from concentrates efficiently and cleanly. MOE involves fewer unit operations than incumbent process. MOE avoids producing polyfluorinated carbons (PFCs), dioxins, furans, and hydrofluoric acid and this also avoids the necessity of cleaning up these emissions. In addition to the advantages in safety and environmental protection, eliminating these steps saves energy, capital, and operating expense. The Phase I project addressed several critical technical risks: design of the supporting electrolyte, containment of the product, and thermal balance in the reactor. A proprietary electrolyte that will serve as a good starting point for optimization has been identifies through the use of computational thermodynamics and thermodynamic databases. A concept for containment of the product while minimizing contamination has been developed. Models for the thermal optimization of the reactor have been extended and applied to the proposed electrolyte system. An experimental run in pilot-scale reactor conducted, using a surrogate system that captures many of the key chemical and physical characteristics of the electrolyte to be used to produce neodymium in Phase II. In Phase II, the focus is applying the results of the Phase I to the successful production of neodymium. A pilot-scale cell will be modified as determined in the Phase I and operate with the electrolyte identified in Phase I to produce neodymium. The energy consumption, current efficiency, and production rate of neodymium will be measured as they were in the Phase I experiments with a surrogate system. The Phase II study will result in neodymium produced by MOE, details of the chemical profile of that product, and its cost and energy consumption, all measured experimentally. \n\nThe commercial applications and other benefits include safe, secure access to the materials needed for expanding the modern economy and increasing the deployment of the renewable energy, at lower cost in both economic and environmental terms. Diversity in the supply base may also help to defuse recent geopolitical tension over this critical material.",

        "abstract": "Inertial confinement fusion (ICF) offers to tap almost unlimited sources of inexpensive energy.  While ICF has been demonstrated at the Department of Energy (DOE) Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), its commercialization to inertial fusion energy (IFE) is impeded by the lack of an efficient and economical laser driver. Drivers for todays ICF facilities generate only a few pulses per day because of the waste heat deposited into the gain elements. To attain pulse frequencies of 10 to 20 Hz for commercial IFE, the drive laser must undergo revolutionary changes: 1) reduced waste heat, 2) new laser materials with high-thermal conductivity for efficient removal of residual heat, which are also producible in large sizes (~30 cm), 3) wall-plug efficiency ~20%, and 4) reduced driver size and cost. Aqwest is developing a new class of laser amplifiers known as the edge-pumped disk laser (EPDL). Results of our Phase I effort reported herein show that EPDL offers an efficient, modular, and economical approach to building high- pulse energy amplifiers scalable in a straightforward way to a full-size laser driver for IFE.  We showed that Yb:YAG- based EPDL amplifier for IFE offers offers superior wall-plug efficiency with comparably smaller and less costly pump diodes than recently considered alternatives. Scalability of the EPDL-based laser driver over a broad range of sizes was theoretically validated.  Based on these results, we prepared a concept design of the driver amplifier showing very compact and robust packaging. The Phase II project will build on these results to develop and test a laser amplifier module on a 1/25th of energy scale (1/5-th linear scale) in a configuration directly scalable to a full-size IFE amplifier.   This will experimentally validate the gas-cooled EPDL and its scalability. This module may serve as a prototype building block for a future development of a subscale 400-J drive laser at 20 Hz.  Other applications of the EPDL-based laser driver include laser acceleration of nuclear particles and research in high-density matter.  Funding of Phase II project will greatly advance the ICF maturity and its transition to commercial IFE for generation of electricity. EPDL also has major commercial applications ranging from laser material processing (cutting, welding, additive manufacturing), lidar, and lasercom for satellite communication.",

        "abstract": "Phase I of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project was conducted under Department of Energy&apos;s (DOE) Advanced Technologies for Nuclear Energy (NE) topic 19(b), entitled Advanced Technologies for the Fabrication, Characterization of Nuclear Reactor Fuel. Phase II preserves the two-pronged vision and goals outlined in Phase I. First, this project seeks to provide a technological answer to DOE-NE&apos;s needs, specifically in advancing the performance of accident tolerant fuel/cladding concepts in light water reactors (LWR) and TRISO fuel fabrication techniques. Second, this project will contribute to the advancement of the DOE-NE&apos;s long-term congressional mandate to enhance current reactor safety, reliability, and life, reduce nuclear proliferation risks, and improve the affordability of new nuclear reactors in part through more sustainable nuclear fuel cycles. The present proposal builds upon cross-cutting advances in the following fields: (i) additive manufacturing (AM), (ii) micro-electromechanical-systems (MEMS) design, (iii) micro- and nano-scale fabrication and (iv) ceramic matrix composites (CMCs). These advances are employed in the development of novel Silicon Carbide fiber (SiCf) rein- forced Silicon Carbide matrix (SiCm) CMC fuel structure. They allow the integration of the full functionality of TRISO fuel at a microscopic level encapsulated into SiC filaments, which are in turn embedded into a SiCm to form a fully integrated nuclear fuel and cladding structure. This innovation merges the functionality of TRISO fuels and cur- rent fuel rods into a single element. This novel fuel structure offers a passively safe, integral and energy efficient Silicon Carbide alternative to Zircalloy fuel rods assemblies in LWR with little change to reactor control architecture. The proposed fuel structure&apos;s elevated temperature capability and chemical inertness implies lower amounts of and easier to store generated nuclear waste. Finally, micro-encapsulation of fissile material into a CMC would make fissile material retrieval extremely difficult, thereby lowering the risk of nuclear proliferation. Phase I of this project successfully tested the feasibility of producing the basic elements of the proposed fiber-embed- ded structure. The following key steps were demonstrated: (1) full-density, beta-phase Silicon Carbide fibers with variable diameters and (2) direct-write of nanoporous carbon coatings to small sections of fibers. In the proposed Phase II, we intend to continue development of the concept; however given the nuclear regulatory requirements, completion and commercialization of a project of the proposed magnitude will not be feasible within the various constraints of a Phase II project. A sequential Phase II project will be necessary. The present project focus will address the issue of production scale-up of nuclear-technology bound SiC fibers. For a commercially viable fuel-in-fiber concept, the core SiC fibers must be manufacturable in large quantity at competitive prices. We will therefore devote 75% of the proposed effort on the goals of scaling up fabrication of nuclear- technology rated SiC fibers and characterizing CMC cladding tubes made using these fibers. The remaining 25% of the effort will focus on the implementation of the direct-write of coating microstructure with a surrogate material for nuclear fuel as well as neutronics and thermal modeling of the proposed fuel-in-fiber concept in a CMC fuel element.",

        "abstract": "Opportunities exists to use high pressure gas atomization (HPGA) to replace currently used, expensive  melt-spinning for making soft magnetic nanocomposite alloy powders containing high moment -CoFe phase.  The key to this development is to design advanced soft nanocomposite materials for small, lightweight vehicle power electronics, by using an innovative low cost HPGA approach to obtain high induction, high temperature soft magnetic nanocomposite materials that have low magnetostrictive coefficients and eddy current, and high operating temperature over conventional ones. The proposed project will (1) develop high permeability, large induction, low-loss (hysteretic/eddy current) soft magnetic nanocomposite materials containing high moment -CoFe, which are capable of operating at high temperatures and  high  frequencies; and  (b)  improve  mechanical properties and  corrosion resistance  of  these materials with weight reduction and magnetic performance enhancement at higher operating temperatures as a result of reduction in powder size, which can be achieved by lowing annealing temperature for crystallization process, because mixtures of amorphous and nanocrystalline powders can be directly obtained by HPGA as compared to the conventional melt-spinning process that forms amorphous ribbons. In this Phase I study, Aegis Technology has demosnttrated a novel class of   CoFe-based nanocomposite soft magnetic materials, and developed an innovative cost-effective approach to produce this class of  high permeability, large saturation, and induction, low-loss (hysteretic/eddy current) soft magnetic nanocomposite materials with high operating temperatures. The Phase I research covered material design, processing development, chracterization and protoyping, with an aim to identify the underlying technical issues that govern the fabrication and performance of this novel class of soft magnetic nanocomposites. In Phase II more detailed research toward product development will be carried out. The composition design and processing parameters will be further optimized to meet targeted magnetic performance at both room and elevated temperatures. A cost-effective fabrication process for the production of nanocomposite cores established in Phase I will be scaled up. Some typical prototypes of inductors will be designed, built and tested, which will pave the way for potential commercialization of proposed soft materials.\n\nThe successful development of the high permeability, high induction soft magnetic nanocompsoite materials with low-loss (hysteretic/eddy current) and high operating temperatures/frequencies will enable the production of high-efficiency small/lightweight passive inductor. This proposed soft magnetic nanocomposite will lay the foundation for next-generation small/lightweight passive inductors that would have much improved magnetic performance in both induction and application temperatures. Applications for these new magnets are expected to include electric power generation and distribution for use in electric drive vehicles, aircraft, space vehicles, and weapons power systems. Soft magnetic materials with the capabilities of high temperature and high frequency operation would enable simpler, more efficient designs for many military and commercial applications.",

        "abstract": "Due to the difficulty in developing credible opinions of value for solar assets, there is a disconnect between traditional mortgage lending which uses established appraisal methodologies and current solar lending efforts which are limited in their ability to utilize those same tried and true appraisal methodologies. This disconnect restricts the amount of capital available for the solar market even if a homeowner is willing and able to borrow the funds for the installation of\nsolar on their home. This is further evidenced in the average cost of capital for the residential PV system marketplace of 12.5%-nominal in 2012 vs. a comparable 1st mortgage rate of 3.66%-nominal. Residential solar PV assets are treated more like personal property for lending purposes instead of collateral for a low risk loan which can then be securitized. This limited access to capital and the higher cost of that capital leads to a slower adoption rate of solar in our local communities. This barrier in developing credible opinions of value can be eliminated through data collection efforts that result in the effective application of an economic pricing model, similar to what the automobile valuation guides have done for the automobile industry in allowing a lender to make a loan before the car is purchased. This will result in a verifiable solar asset value that lenders can confidently use as the collateral value for a loan.  By solving the collateral valuation issue, the marketplace can then provide greater access to capital and at a lower cost than is currently available. Developed and launched a solar valuation web application which enables the collection of site specific datasets on solar homes and commercial buildings from professional users Develop and launch a data hub application with site specific datasets and valuation algorithms. This includes mobile applications for tablet devices. We will also develop a solar valuation model for appraisers and other transaction process professionals.\n\nAppraisers, Lenders, Insurance Companies, Realtors, Green Raters, Credit Rating Agencies, Third Party Owners, and most importantly Homeowners can all benefit from a data collection effort that results in a transparent value for the solar asset that can be reliably and efficiently developed throughout the transaction process. Additionally, enabling the largest source of low cost capital which is in the mortgage marketplace will help enable the mass market adoption of solar across the country.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this work is to enable the Polaris technology platform to meet the needs of the nuclear materials accounting and control community. The current product, Polaris-H, can offer room- temperature high-resolution spectroscopy (1% FWHM at 662 keV) and omni-directional Compton imaging in a package that weighs less than 10 lbs with a 5 hour battery life. This capability makes the Polaris platform ideal to locate, quantify, and identify radiation sources and detect minor material diversions or changes in processes. However, there is a major limitation with the Polaris platform that was identified prior to the start of the phase I effort: at high count rates the quantitative analysis broke down due to high dead time and at dose rates above 100 mRem/hr the system could no longer form photopeaks. Through the phase I effort these issues were addressed to some extent, now a photopeak can be observed at dose rates as high as 1 Rem/hr.  However, through interactions with potential users, especially at DOE labs such as Savannah River National Lab, it became apparent that the dynamic range in the image was as significant an issue as quantitative analysis at high count rates. The problem is that in these facilities there are many sources of radiation and it is difficult to only interrogate one subsystem without interference from other radiation. Without the ability to reject all other sources it is difficult to detect low source activities or small activity changes in the subsystem of interest. The results from phase I are the basis for a plan forward to adapt the Polaris-H technology into a product called the Polaris-P (P is for probe).  In this product the CdZnTe crystal will be spatially separated from all the other electronics, including the readout boards and ADCs (analog-to-digital converters), so that it is possible to shield the CdZnTe crystal using a minimum amount of mass.  This will allow the user to narrow their field of view with a collimator and boost the dynamic range between the directions of interest and all other directions by more than an order of magnitude.  The Polaris-P will use a readout ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) developed by Brookhaven National Laboratory in order to further improve the quantitative analysis capability at high count rates. The Polaris-P will be handheld with a form factor similar to a power drill. The user will point the probe in the direction of the object of interest and measure until the system confirms that sufficient data has been collected. Drift in the system orientation over time will be corrected to enable handheld imaging. Tungsten shields will be sold with the probe and can be stacked to narrow the field of view to the user&apos;s desired extent. The result of these developments will be a product that has applications on material safety and security throughout the nuclear fuel cycle, with the strongest market in the commercial nuclear power sector.",

        "abstract": "To dramatically reduce CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants, and mitigate their impact on global climate change, DOE has called for technologies that can capture at least 90% of CO2 emissions from an existing coal-fired power plant with no more than a 35% increase in the cost of electricity. One process design approach with the potential to achieve these goals is through the use of advanced gas-liquid contacting devices which enable more efficient capture of CO2 with reduced process footprints. However, more cost-effective construction methods and rapid prototyping are needed to deploy these technologies and meet DOE goals.  3-D printing is an additive fabrication technique which can offer unprecedented advantages in accelerating the design cycles of gas-liquid contacting devices, minimize manufacturing costs, and expedite deployment timeline for CO2 capture in the field. Functional prototypes can be designed, fabricated, and tested within a frame of 24 hours. Because the design process is entirely software-based, devices can be parametrically varied so that effects of surface area, pressure drop, porosity, etc. can be easily understood and used to develop improved devices. The rapid and flexible feedback loop between design, fabrication and testing that can only be provided through 3-D printing will more quickly advance the performance and lower the costs of novel gas-liquid contacting devices for CO2 capture. Phase I work successfully established methods for printing, optimization, and testing of novel-gas liquid contacting devices.  An economic analysis was completed to demonstrate the long-term benefits and commercial viability of scaling this approach to CO2 capture process design.  Phase II work focuses on further optimization based on computational fluid dynamics to increase the efficiency of novel-gas liquid contacting devices and provide a cost effective solution for commercial applications.  A dual function mass and heat transfer packing media will be developed to incorporate heat transfer. \n \nThese advanced, low-cost gas-liquid contacting devices will provide highly efficient removal of CO2 (and other contaminants) from flue gas and natural gas, enabling the economical production of clean energy using conventional fuels while minimizing additional costs to the public. Additional applications of devices produced via 3-D printing will extend to many operations such as reactors and heat exchangers.",

Current modeling tools are limited to single rather than multiple effects, relatively low flow parameters, and/or simplified geometries. Databases to assist blanket design are incomplete or unavailable. There is an imminent need for more comprehensive physical treatment, reliable software solutions and for scientific and engineering analysis to improve the existing lead blanket concepts. We are developing a comprehensive predictive capability tool suitable for diverse liquid metal blanket applications, including: (a) high-performance computational tools based on multiple physical models, (b) scientific and engineering analysis of the important physical processes, which have not been addressed before, and (c) development of a design-oriented database for MHD flows.

The new software has shown great promise in solving the class of unsteady, finite magnetic Reynolds number MHD problems, which cannot be solved with most existing codes.\nIn Phase II we will advance and mature the induced field solver development started in phase-I, and integrate it in a suite of codes which address a wide range of MHD flows, heat and mass transfer of fusion interest.

        "abstract": "Power generation and transmission limits manifest themselves in the inability to respond to dynamic peak power demand. Load leveling can effectively support dynamic demand changes by having additional standby power generating capabilities. This is achieved by either having a generation and distribution infrastructure that matches the peak demand and it is operated under its full capacity or having additional power plants that can be brought online to provide additional power. These methods are economically costly because power generators are underutilized, likely operating at a lower efficiency point, or because power generating infrastructures are left unused for large portions of time. Grid-connected energy storage systems are intended to enhance performance and reliability of the utility infrastructure. By storing energy during off-peak power demand and releasing it during peak demand, grid-tied energy storage systems can effectively shift the dynamic power demand profile seen by the grid infrastructure.  There is currently a need to develop high efficiency power electronics to interface with grid-tied energy storage systems. Consequently, APEI is proposing to develop a high efficiency, high power density, modular (&gt;50 kW at &gt; 2  power density of state-of-the-art Si designs), high frequency  (&gt;  20  kHz;  100  kHz  target),  GaN-based  DC-DC  converter  with  &gt;  800  Vdc  output,  for interfacing with grid-level energy storage elements, such as batteries. A high frequency, GaN-based modular power topology will be designed to enable bi- directional power flow to support energy storage. One of the key benefits of high frequency operation is the significant reduction in size of the transformer used in the power conversion system. APEI has successfully  implemented  GaN-based  systems  capable  of  operating  in  the  MHz  range  while  still providing high efficiency. Smaller magnetic components result in an overall system cost reduction while delivering operational cost improvement through higher efficiency\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits: The United States consumed approximately 3,800 TWh of electricity in 2012. At such a massive level, even small increases in efficiency can have a prominent impact. Assuming that 30% of the yearly total is processed by power electronics at 85% efficiency, for every 1% average efficiency increase, there would be an annual cost savings of over $2 billion (at $0.15 per kWh) and a reduction of 25 billion lbm of CO2 emissions (assuming 1.77 lbm of CO2 per kWh) in the United States alone. The significance of efficiency is ever important as renewable sources such as wind, solar, and tidal energy become more prevalent.

        "abstract": "There is a need to further develop the internal combustion engine to increase its efficiency and reduce emissions. The DoE has correctly concluded that presently utilized ignition technology is a limiting factor in further improvements. DoE has specified certain performance targets which it believes will enable the development of the next generation of internal combustion engines. Knite agrees with DoEs position and believes its technology can be developed to meet and exceed the DoE performance specifications. Knites electromagnetically propelled plasma base ignition technology has demonstrated the ability to reliably meet the desired requirements however these results were achieved at 50 Bar (~725 psi) or below. By modulating the current intensity once it has established an ionized region, Knites team has been able to stabilize KSIs plasma over a broad range of pressures (US patent #7,467,612).  As a result, although actual benefits are very engine design specific, generally KSI can demonstrate the performance gains desired in Topic 7e except the 100 bar (~1450 psi) requirement. The subtopics requirement of reliable ignition at 100 Bar provided an interesting technological challenge because standard approaches for spark ignition encounter limitations/issues from very high system voltage requirements and very intense discharge arcs caused by the high pressure.  The 100 Bar capability will be especially beneficial in enabling engine designers to increase engine efficiency including taking full advantage of the properties of natural gas. In the SBIR Phase 1, Knites approach was to initially analyze KSIs characteristics at higher pressures to understand trends as operation exceeds 50 Bar and use a combination of solutions including changing material properties within the igniter (sparkplug) to reduce peak voltage requirements and alterations to the circuit output to optimize the discharge for high pressure to mitigate any adverse effects in order to achieve reliable and robust ignition capability through 100 Bar. In the Phase 1 SBIR, Knite established reliable operation at 100 bar (N2 equivalent) and gained an understanding the tradeoffs necessary to achieve this goal.  Knite determined that very high pressure operation of KSI is primarily achieved with tighter tolerances and additional materials processing within the igniter (sparkplug)  a minor cost penalty in production  with no anticipated performance penalty to as compared to the prior KSI design. In Phase 2, Knite intends to confirm KSIs performance benefits with the changes implemented in Phase 1 by preparing a test system and testing at an industry respected test facility to verify the benefits established in Phase 1 and establishing operating specifications for an engineering prototype.  Knite with then design and build an engineering prototype (TRL-6) and confirm the performance benefits of the engineering prototype at the same industry respected test facility.  Phase 2 will result in understanding of how KSI compares to other advanced ignition systems in both performance and product practicality.  A successful result will be a TRL-6 prototype with demonstrated performance benefit, meeting industrys goals and a clear product development path.",

        "abstract": "Reliable, cost-competitive thermal storage is critical to the growth of the concentrated solar power market. The proposed program focuses on a key component which impacts future trough systems, addressing chronic reliability problems, and providing a pathway to higher plant operating temperatures and resulting higher efficiency. Todays solar trough plants use synthetic oil heat transfer fluids which limit the power plant boiler temperature to 400C. When the heat transport oil is connected to a thermal salt energy storage system, this temperature is further reduced. The proposed program focuses on developing a rotary coupler for molten salt. With this rotary coupler, direct salt transport through the solar trough can be used, which eliminates the cost and complexity of heat transfer from oil to salt in the storage system. Molten salt has the potential to operate at considerably higher temperatures, from 500 to 650C, thereby significantly boosting the power plant efficiency. Based on the temperature ratio increase, this represents a roughly 10 percentage-point improvement in steam turbine efficiency. Working closely with the major solar trough manufacturers and plant operators, Brayton has identified the problems with todays rotating joints and performed a detailed characterization of this challenging environment. Working from concept through successful lab testing, Brayton has developed the product from idea to prototype over the course of Phase-I activities. Brayton has followed an aggressive product development path achieving all program goals, including the following accomplishments: 1. Rigorous analytical design and optimization of a novel product solution  2. Manufacturing process development, cost modeling, and capitalization planning. 3. Developed accelerated build, test, and quality assurance processes. 4. Conducted comprehensive laboratory tests, performed failure analysis, and validated life prediction models. 5. Successfully demonstrated 16,000 full diurnal (230 of rotation) cycles on early prototype Salt Couplers. Phase II will improve the flexible Salt Coupler design, perform rigorous laboratory accelerated life testing, and develop robust manufacturing processes for pilot production volumes. The resulting production prototypes will have upgraded functional capabilities including increased pressure and temperature capacity. In cooperation with our established partners, the project will also install up to six (6) field test units, likely operating at 500C in commercial solar trough plants. A third-party qualification plan with an industry-accepted testing laboratory will prepare the Salt Coupler for initial sales. Braytons Salt Coupler is an enabling technology for molten salt concentrating solar plants, and this Phase II SBIR will see it evolve from a functioning prototype to a viable, trusted, commercial product.",

        "abstract": "Development of an economically and environmentally attractive fusion energy source is the goal of the Fusion Energy Sciences program. One main approach for plasma heating and current drive in fusion devices is to use radio frequency (RF) waves. RF waves are used for heating and/or current drive in most magnetic plasma confinement devices, such as Tokamaks, Reversed Field Pinches, Stellarators and Mirror Machines, and are also used in industrial plasma sources. Numerical modeling of RF fields in both fusion and industrial plasma devices is a very important part of analysis of performance of such devices. FAR-TECH, Inc. will develop a new parallelized full wave radio frequency code to accurately model 3-D radio frequency fields in fusion and industrial plasma devices. Feasibility study of the proposed approach of solving wave equations was performed in Phase I. Feasibility was demonstrated for numerical calculation of the plasma conductivity kernel in 3-D configuration space. Feasibility was demonstrated for solving linear equations, obtained by discretization of the wave equations using the meshless formulation, by the Krylov subspace iterative methods or by efficient direct solvers. The goal in Phase II is to develop a new parallel full wave linear RF code, which will utilize the localized nature of plasma dielectric response to the RF field, use adaptive grid to better resolve resonances in plasma and antenna structures, and solve the formulated linear equations by iterative methods or efficient direct solvers. The commercial product will be a user friendly numerical tool with a graphical user interface, comprehensive post processing, and a user manual.\n\nThe code will be used: in the design, operation and performance assessment of radio frequency systems in existing and planned fusion devices, industrial radio frequency plasma devices, and electron cyclotron ion sources; in basic research on plasma waves.",

        "abstract": "Innovative, energy-savings lighting controls methods such as occupancy sensing, personal control, and daylighting have realized a market that is only a fraction of the potential lighting market.  With the increasing market penetration of solid-state lighting technology, there is an opportunity to re-invigorate the adoption of energy-savings lighting controls.  Along with the recent growth of solid-state lighting (SSL), there is a growing general understanding that optimal SSL control is obtained by replacing existing dimmers. Additionally, there is a growing tendency for the market to adopt controls that employ wireless technologies that allow the end user to control settings and energy-savings through the use of apps on personal devices. Missing, however, from all of the current wireless lighting solutions is the integration of energy-savings daylighting that can result in energy savings. Daylighting lighting control reduces lighting energy consumption by 25% to 60%. Pairing innovative daylighting with dimmable, solid-state lighting is the future of lighting energy savings.  The proposed RiteBrite system is the commercial embodiment of the digital daylighting dimmer (D3) that was proposed and demonstrated during Phase I.   The RiteBrite solid-state lighting control architecture is targeted to replace and/or augment traditional light switches, analog dimmers, and wireless controls with a smart SSL control system equipped with a modular remote consisting of a photosensor, state-of-the-art Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) RF communication, and a novel task-to-wall (TTW) sensing and control technology that enables energy savings via daylighting, in conjunction with personal control. TTW allows intensity control by sensing light changes at a distant (wall) location by using a combination of novel light modeling as well as intuitive and simple characterization of the installed SSL lights during the initial setup.  While overall illumination control was created in Phase I, in Phase II, the algorithm will be expanded to each component of light spectrum, red, green, and blue (RGB), to enable TTW to control both intensity and color. Development of color enabled TTW, which is able to address the nonlinear relationships of controlling color and intensity, will enable end users to more precisely control the quality and intensity of the light to both save energy and increase their lighting satisfaction. Phase II will take the technology from a breadboard to production in phases to meet and parallel current and developing market opportunities, including taking advantage of the growing technology development and market penetration of color controlled solid-state lighting.  The fundamental value proposition of the Phase II RiteBrite system is to provide the lighting right - deliver the right amount of light, with the right light quality, at the right time. The Phase I development led to a setup strategy that, instead of being based on the ambient light sensing capability of personal devices, is based on a very low-cost, modular, and accurate photosensor. Products built using the RiteBrite energy-savings lighting control technology will realize 25-60% energy savings via daylighting and 10-20% energy savings via personal dimming control.",

        "abstract": "Deep   geological disposal is a promising and widely accepted method for long-term disposal of nuclear waste, and the option of deep borehole disposal is considered an inherently safe method. The feasibility of the deep borehole option relies upon designing and constructing an effective seal within the borehole that ensures the waste package does not communicate through the borehole itself with the shallow subsurface and biosphere for thousands of years. Recent work has suggested that encapsulating the waste in melted rock will create a seal that is more reliable and lasts longer than conventional sealing materials, such as cement and bentonite. The  proposed project consists of designing a  remote, electrical rock  melt borehole sealing system and testing the  performance of the  system both  in a laboratory and  then with field  tests in an  underground environment (the Sanford Underground Research Facility [SURF]), which is  located at the former Homestake Gold  Mine  in  western South Dakota). Phase I of the project evaluated the overall feasibility of the rock melt sealing concept by incorporating laboratory testing and numerical modeling to develop a preliminary design of a downhole heater. Phase I also  estimated costs  for in  situ field  testing at the SURF and indicated that  the necessary field   evaluation  could   be  completed within  a  reasonable budget. The major tasks envisaged for the Phase II Work Plan consist of the following:  1.   Design and construct the initial prototype heater  2.   Perform laboratory-scale prototype testing  3.   Prepare the SURF field experiment site  4.   Perform field-scale rock melt testing within the SURF  5.   Conduct a mine-back investigation to access the borehole seal  6.   Design a full-scale heater for use in the deep borehole environment.  In   situ  melting experiments  performed at  the  SURF provide a  unique  opportunity  to evaluate the rock  melt seal  system in  a  deep  underground environment and perform a  mine- back  excavation and forensic analysis, which is necessary to build confidence in the system.\n\nThe  demonstration of a  successful design rock  melt borehole sealing system has  the  potential  to significantly contribute to the  U.S. Department of Energy Used  Fuel Disposition Campaign and  help  address an  issue of national (and international)  importance. Confidence in a more robust sealing method is expected to be advantageous for the consent-based approach to siting waste facilities.",

        "abstract": "Advancements are needed to improve and optimize the performance of existing and future nuclear power plants and nuclear power systems by developing and improving the reliability of advanced instrumentation. A need has been identified for an improved control rod position sensor for fault-free confirmation of control rod drive mechanism (CRDM) function, improving long term reliability, maximizing SCRAM reliability, and minimizing SCRAM disengaging time. The technical challenges of developing such a sensor are: insensitivity to particulates; small size; high reliability; and harsh environment operation, including very high temperatures (600C), high pressures (2200 PSIG), and irradiation. Sporian proposes to work with nuclear power system OEMs to develop such a small, high reliability, high temperature operable, control rod position sensor, based on leveraging Sporians past experience with high temperature sensors and packaging, and facilitative ceramic electronics packaging technologies. In Phase I, Sporian worked with OEMs to develop application suitable hardware and electronics, developed materials/fabrication process, and subsequently prototyped and experimentally evaluated/demonstrated prototype hardware and electronics in an application representative CRDM mockup, and at relevant neutron fluences. Based on the results of Phase I, the Phase II will include materials/process development, several rounds of full system prototyping, and rigorous lab scale testing (including neutron irradiation) focusing on types of testing that promote post Phase I transition-oriented activities.\n\nThe proposed sensor has the potential to improve public safety and reduce negative environmental impacts by assuring control rod position.  A high temperature Hall effect sensor could have a variety of additional applications for position sensing in fossil fuel, transportation and industrial applications.  For example, the sensor also has potential to provide blade tip timing and tachometric data for fossil fuel energy generation turbines.",

        "abstract": "Use of liquid lithium as a plasmafacing component for fusion reactors is ideal due to its low atomic number (Z=3) vs. tungsten (Z=74), keeping plasma hot with low radiative emission and minimal density depletion, and ability to flow over surfaces to remove hydrogen/impurities and keep a surface cool with bulk liquid flow and highheat transfer properties. The primary challenge is handling, control, and manipulation of liquid lithium, particularly controlling its wetting properties on surfaces to manage where the liquid metal will go and not go. This challenge is being addressed through this small business innovative research project to use laser based microtexturing to control how the liquid metal contacts the surface, its adhesion and wetting properties. By adjusting laser wavelength, pulse shape, duration and profile, different micro and nano textures can make the surface either super hydrophobic (liquid repelling) or super hydrophilic (liquid absorbing). This direct modification transforms only a thin (microns) layer of material leaving bulk properties intact. The laserbased processing approach is scalable for postprocessing on large surfaces and complex shapes needed for advanced fusion reactor development. Basic proofofconcept was demonstrated in Phase I by increasing the critical wetting temperature of lithium on stainless steel from 325C to 400C. In Phase II, the parameter space will explore in detail leading to a journal publication and science contribution to this emerging field. A prototype material texturing tool will be developed. A lithium PFC component will be designed and fabricated based on the selected Phase II laser texturing parameters for basic testing and future validation at a fusion facility. The primary benefit to the public will be commercialization of a new processing method and tool to engineer materials for superior interface heat transfer, fluid flow, and fluid safety properties. Two commercial applications have been identified that will be vetted and explored in Phase II.. The laser process is well suited for volume manufacturing and can be directly applied onto a prefabricated part or component prior to installation or use, such as a large area divertor plate.",

Health hazard assessment is essential to ensure that fielded equipment and occupational duties do not exceed human capabilities over short and long term exposures.  Hazard assessment encompasses determination of the hazard severity and hazard probability.  This effort is based on the desire to enhance health hazard assessment through the development of methodologies using injury criteria that can translate into hazard severity and probability.  The purpose of this Phase II effort is to develop a software shoulder injury risk and assessment tool based on the Phase I developed shoulder injury criteria and integrated anatomically-specific shoulder joint complex.  The tool will be validated for one and two handed push and pull using human subjects.

In total, corrosion cost the Department of Defense $23 billion annually and is the number one cost driver in military life-cycle costs. The effective monitoring of aircraft structural health is essential to maintaining safe operation, particularly as aircraft are retained for ever longer service periods. The early diagnosis of corrosion could minimize costs and promote mission readiness. In this project TDA will develop a new additive that contains a pH sensitive indicator that can be interrogated by a non-destructive method. This technique can detect changes in components at very low concentrations and will therefore alert military personnel to corrosion at the earliest onset. The additive is based on a carrier material that TDA has already demonstrated to be compatible with military specification coatings; in previous work we have incorporated it into paints in place of inert pigments with no adverse consequence to other paint properties. In the Phase I project we demonstrated the feasibility using this novel paint additive couple with a commercial non-destructive interrogation method to detect to changes in a coating.

        "abstract": "The significant gap in the healthcare services available to rural seniors is well supported by prior research. Frequently, rural seniors must travel long distances regardless of weather conditions to healthcare facilities. The senior&#39;s family members often worry about their loved ones and may not get accurate information regarding their health and behaviors, and falls, missed meds, and nutrition issues are often under-reported.Private Duty Nursing companies, Skilled Nursing companies, Outpatient Rehabilitation Providers, occupational therapy agencies and hospitals all struggle with how to serve rural seniors because they are dispersed over large geographies. The typical human-dominant model is costly and struggles to prevent healthcare incidents and readmissions from previous ER visits. This is a global problem, but the aging of America has raised the awareness within our nation.Existing solutions are expensive, do not automatically report what led up to the incident or situation, and are not designed to help prevent situations. Most require high-speed Internet services which is a mismatch given low coverage in most rural areas. Also, the lack of scalability and customization options drives the cost up and requires most seniors to buy more capability or service than they need.Rural-Health-Mate (RHM) is a system that helps rural seniors maintain their independence in their home through the use of unique and cost-effective remote monitoring and tele-health techniques. Unlike other approaches, RHM does not rely on high speed internet or video cameras with remote technicians.Current experimental remote monitoring systems focus on a specific illness or disease such as Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or diabetes. Instead, RHM addresses the top three major areas that cause rural seniors to result in extended and expensive hospitalizations: falls, medication non-adherence, and safety violations (such as leaving the stove on unattended, etc.).Also, current \"Smart home\" technology is focused on a younger audience that wishes to remotely scan their home, or remotely control lights or locks. The intelligence in RHM is focused on the rural senior, and therefore also collects data in the home through an intelligent network of sensors, vital sign appliances, and the senior&#39;s activity patterns. RHM uses a distributed intelligence model:- an in-home Control Center that collects sensor data and vital signs, and communicates with the individual on their TV, and- cloud computing that relays notifications and alerts to the proper personnel as well as providing a portal for coordinating care with family members, caregivers and healthcare providers.CreateAbility will build on the success of Phase I and complete the development in Phase II in preparation for full-scale commercialization in Phase III. Phase III will incorporate a nationwide business-to-Business (B2B) model, where CreateAbility&#39;s customers are the businesses that serve rural seniors. These include rehab services, skilled nursing, and private duty nursing companies.The basic methods and approaches that will be used to collect and inform the target audiences are:A. Confirm our findings from the Phase I pilot study using a series of focus groups, phone surveys and face-to-face meeting s with rural healthcare providers.Assistive Technology Partners will facilitate the focus groups using the Nominal Group Technique (NGT). The NGT approach guarantees that all members get an equal voice in the outcomes of the group&#39;s impression and voting on the importance of new features and functions.Phone surveys will be handled using a scripted tool to minimize variances of the responses. Face-to-face meetings with existing healthcare providers and support personnel to rural seniors will also be scripted, and yet still provide for the additional data that may be unique to each meeting.B.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The Hall thruster propulsion system consists of the thruster, cathode, propellant management system and the power processing electronics. The power processing unit (PPU) represents largest fraction of the system dry mass. In addition, the delivery time and cost of radiation hard electronics and issues regarding long-term pre-launch fuel storage make it difficult for electric propulsion systems to meet the operational needs of responsive space missions. In response to the Air Force need for satellites that are both operationally responsive to a launch command and operationally responsive to the warfighter on-orbit, Busek is purposing a paradigm shift from the traditional architecture of electric propulsion systems. The proposed system leverages our flight qualified low power Hall thruster technology. We propose to power the propulsion system using a single multifunctional power converter that has the potential to significantly reduce the PPU cost, mass, volume. We will also investigate the technical feasibility of a non-toxic iodine fueled thruster as a means of reducing the stored propellant tankage mass and volume. Iodine would be stored as a solid allowing pre-fueled long term storage of the propulsion system until a responsive space need arises. In Phase I we will conduct a comprehensive system design and mass optimization study supported by an experimental demonstration using a single multifunctional power converter to power the cathode and thruster. In Phase II we will design and build engineering prototypes of each subsystem and conduct a TRL 6 integrated system demonstration. At the conclusion of the program the integrated system will be delivered to AFRL for extended duration testing in facilities.BENEFIT:The AFRL IHPRPT Program is investing in the development of long life low power HET systems. A key technology identified in the Beyond IHPRPT study is an extremely long life, low mass variant of the BHT-200 and BHT-600 HET systems. The multi-functional converter concept is attractive for its reduction in overall propulsion system mass complexity and cost. Hall thrusters have also been identified as a key technology for NASAs vision of space exploration. NASA missions beyond Earth orbit can be enabled by the wide throttle range and broad Isp-thrust operation of Hall thrusters. A study conducted by the SMD ISPT Project in 2004 confirmed the significant potential of EP for space science missions, including orbiters about Pluto, Neptune, and Uranus; rendezvous/return with Kuiper Belt Objects and primitive bodies in the outer Solar System; and extensive surveys of major asteroid groups. Commercial satellite manufacturers; SS/L, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Orbital Sciences have all shown a strong interest in low power HET systems for primary propulsion on LEO spacecraft and station keeping on GEOSats.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  To address the Air Forces need for an open-system-architecture data transfer device (DTD), Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes an innovative approach that maintains compatibility with existing mission planning equipment (MPE) and aircraft data recording sources. This approach addresses MPE media obsolescence, while providing a solution compatible with legacy aircraft and lays the foundation for an option to execute a longer-term strategy that completes the avionics modernization of digital media and data recording systems throughout the USAF. In Phase I, POC investigated aircraft platforms identified by the USAF and analyzed each selected platform with its currently deployed Data Transfer Unit (DTU) and Data Transfer Device (DTD), focusing on the interfaces between the DTD media and the DTU. POC then proposed a form, fit, and function replacement for legacy DTUs. This novel technical approach for digital storage media, called Digital Aircraft Data Storage (DADS), requires no aircraft harness rewiring or Operational Flight Program modifications. In Phase II, POC developed a preliminary ruggedized design for DADS using a Government-provided data storage cartridge and targeted the F-15C/E aircraft for first implementation. In Phase II(e), POC will develop a detailed design of DADS and build three prototype units for evaluation testing.  BENEFIT:  DADS immediately addresses the Air Forces near-term critical obsolescence issues with current aircraft data transfer devices that are based on obsolete/aging technologies, such as PCMCIA and magnetic disks, by providing a digital media storage solution that is compatible with existing equipment and uses open-system standards.

The process is compatible with wafer-to-wafer, chip-to-wafer, and chip-to-chip processing, requires only modest capital investment, and can be performed with high yields at less cost and finer pitch compared to todays indium bump hybridization technologies. The process uses a combination of nanoparticle metal inks, inkjet-print deposition, and nanoimprint lithography technologies. In Phase I, the process was shown to achieve better than 4 micron pixel pitch electrical interconnects. In Phase II, a variety of metal nanoparticle inks, including gold, silver, tin, zinc, etc., will be developed and shown to be capable of being printed or otherwise solution-deposited into two-dimensional and three-dimensional electrical conductors. A process using inkjet deposition and nanolithography will be used to demonstrate reliable interconnects, over large areas on a better than five-micron pixel pitch.

The numerous and distinct challenges present at this level of amputation together with the dearth of clinicians with upper limb expertise capable of creating a functionally superior socket present a formidable threat to user acceptance and the ability to maximize the performance of the advanced arm of the future. In response to these challenges, we propose the creation of a Sensorized Imager Tool (SIT) that will guide the clinician, expert or novice, in the proper data acquisition, creation and fitment of a functionally superior interface capable of meeting and exceeding the demands of both the dexterous arm and its operator. The SIT will also be paired with a Sensorized Socket Tool (SST) paving the way for the worlds first smart interface capable of capturing and controlling the underlying skeletal structure of the target limb. Through a series of adaptive, reactive and predictive responses to internal and external stimuli the interface will maintain absolute comfort and safety while concurrently providing maximum performance ranging from casual civilian use to the extreme demands of todays and tomorrows warfighter.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The need for Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) to incorporate changing data sources will require an extension of the current technology to develop model inputs for the LCOM ATK models for each aircraft variant. In addition, the need to model a real world operational environment will also require a flexible and adaptable model building capability. This effort will significantly enhance LCOM ATK front-end capabilities in data preparation to ensure that JSF is able to meet the schedule and technical challenges to develop model inputs resulting in significant savings to the JSF program. FTI will incorporate diverse data sources into the front-end capability that exists only as a prototype and is being extended in this effort. These diverse data sources include Logistics Support Analysis (LSA) data from Lockheed Martins (LM) Aeros ATLAS database, as well as Joint Reliability Maintainability Evaluation Team (JRMET) Failure Reporting And Corrective Action Software (FRACAS) data. In this effort, FTI will also extend the automation of the import of JSF data into LCOM ATK models, as well enhance the capability to perform advanced analyses. This effort will demonstrate a computer program able to perform RAMS simulations representative of those performed under normal use conditions.BENEFIT:The technology will be included as an enhancement to LCOM ATK, and specifically a data import application that is part of the LCOM ATK suite, which was developed in an initial effort and will be extended during this Phase II CRP effort. The technology is expected to significantly improve performance as a result of this CRP effort in the preparation and analysis of LCOM ATK inputs, which is the leading time constraint in developing and performing LCOM analyses. Also, the enhanced input capabilities resulting from this CRP effort will provide a new, fully robust capability for automated generation of LCOM ATK inputs, which has only existed in part prior to this effort. Another benefit of improved LCOM analyses are greater reliability and cost savings for the Joint Strike Fighter system based on better, more informed decisions throughout the life cycle. The technology developed through this CRP effort provides enhancements to existing simulation capability (i.e., LCOM ATK), but also provides a software infrastructure to enable the import of data to build models from a variety of data sources.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:In this phase II effort we will commercialize the high speed, high power, modified uni-traveling carrier (MUTC) photodiodes (PDs). To this end, we will develop reliable packaging solutions for discrete PDs, PD arrays, balanced PDs and waveguide based PDs. We will also transition the chip fabrication process for continuous, high volume supply of quality MUTC PD chips. In the first six months of phase I work we successfully packaged two prototype PD modules, and demonstrated 22GHz 3dB bandwidth and ~20dBm RF output power at 20GHz based on a 34&#956;m-diameter diode. We have also started process development for MUTC PD chip fabrication with our own R&D funds. Based on phase I package design, we will package PD array and balanced PDs. We will also dramatically reduce the package SWaP using parallel-fed package architecture. We will collaborate with Prof. Campbell and his UVA group in developing flip-chip-comparable MUTC based waveguide PDs and diamond based chip-level integration. As a result, we will build a production family of MUTC high power PDs. We will also apply the PDs and PD modules that we developed in phase II work to related projects, such as high frequency RF generation and optical-feed phased antenna array.BENEFIT:The potential applications for high speed, high power MUTC PDs, PD array, balanced PD receiver and waveguide PDs are vast and could have a profound impact on our society. Today, as the high frequency microwave, millimeter wave and terahertz range are rapidly explored, photodiodes, especially ones with high output power, have become critical devices and indispensable ways of photonic link demodulation or high frequency signal generation. For example, generation of RF signal with enough power is very challenging, especially for very high frequency range, such as w-band. Among all the solutions, optical based methods that rely on high-frequency and high-power PDs are greatly favored due to their wide bandwidth and configurability. In addition, traditional photodiodes are made for detection of photonic input signal amplitude. A balanced PD receiver, however, is capable of detecting not only the signal amplitude, but also the phase information. As a result, a balanced PD detector is compatible with complex modulation formats such as DPSK and DQPSK. Today, as the high frequency microwave, millimeter wave and terahertz range are rapidly explored, photodiodes, especially ones with high output power and high linearity, have become critical devices and indispensable ways of photonic link demodulation or high frequency signal generation. For example, high power PD receivers have been investigated and applied for radio-on-fiber broadband wireless communications, which is propelled by the huge increase of data volume in recent years. According to Edholms law, the demand for point-to-point bandwidth in wireless short-range communications has doubled every 18 months over the last 25 years. It can be predicted that data rates of around 510Gb/s will be required in ten years. Tremendous market demands of high power PDs are expected by then. A list of potential applications of balanced high-power PD receiver includes: a) High frequency RF generation for spectroscopic applications including material detection and identification, imaging, tomography, cancer detection or genetic analysis. b) Millimeter wave wireless telecommunications. c) Long haul antenna remoting. d) Phased array antennas. e) Cable television. More specifically, PSI will commercialize the MUTC PD, PD array, balanced PD and waveguide PD to form a product family to cover high speed, high power photo detection up to 100GHz based on successful transition of the MUTC manufacturing processes and packaging process development. The commercialization process will be performed through the cooperation between PSI, UVA group and other industrial partners. PSI will seek and identify applications of high-frequency and high-power PDs in broadband phase array antennas and microwave photonic link system as a platform for multifunctional radar systems, where hundreds or thousands of PDs are required in a single system. To this end, packaged PD module with small size, light weight, low cost and easy-to-deploy interface not only represents an impressive leap forward in our technical capabilities but also a tremendous business opportunity.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Under this Phase II SBIR contract, Bridger Photonics and Montana State University-Spectrum Lab will design, build and deliver both a statistical scintillation tomographic system and a coherent tomographic wavefront sensor (CTWS). Both proposed systems meet the long term Air Force needs with respect to the full characterization of atmospheric turbulence along horizontal or slant paths. The statistical scintillation system will use tomographic methods to spatially resolve the turbulence statistics using sets of scintillation measurements. This system has utility as a general scientific device and will enable a deeper understating of atmospheric turbulence. The CTWS will use coherent digital holography images from diverse viewpoints of targets of opportunity and ultimately be an airborne system that will be deployed in operational environments. Unlike existing technologies, the CTWS will produce a 3D characterization of an instantaneous snapshot of the full volume of turbulence on operationally relevant timeframes without the use of retroreflective targets. This is an unprecedented capability and allows a variety of atmospheric parameters anywhere within the probed volume to be calculated from the index data including among others the atmospheric refractive index structure, the inner scale, the Fried parameter, as well as weather related parameters including wind speed. The CTWS system will be prototyped and flight tested in the Phase II effort.BENEFIT:The United States Air Force currently deploys and anticipates more widespread deployment of a variety of active electro-optical sensors and systems including laser altimeters, wind lidar, free-space optical communications, vibrometry, and coherent imaging sensors including synthetic aperture and holographic ladar imaging. The performance of all of these systems is impacted by atmospheric turbulence. Atmospheric turbulence has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally, but remains largely an intractable problem particularly in low altitude slant-path applications due to its inherent randomness, chaotic unpredictability, and strong effects. Typically, turbulence is characterized by the path-integrated structure constant or the Fried parameter, whereas the performance of electro-optic systems depends on the structure constant as a function of distance. Bridger Photonics, Inc. and Montana State University Spectrum Lab propose to develop a system to characterize the atmospheric turbulence as a function of distance but also in a spatially and temporally resolved manner. The success of such an approach would represent a significant leap forward in the characterization of atmospheric turbulence and may unlock a deeper understanding of a fundamentally chaotic problem. In addition, data collected with the sensor will assist the Air Forces need for improved electro-optic, coherent imaging and coherent communications systems.",

We will develop scalable solutions that can be easily integrated into a wide variety of UAVs. Specifically we are targeting a sensing/computing payload that ranges from 2 lb. in weight and $5,000 in manufacturing cost for the simpler missions, to 5 lb./$10,000 for complex missions. We will meet these targets by leveraging a large body of work in perception, planning and open architectures for UAVs conducted by our team over the past decade.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  New 4.5th and 5th-generation USAF fighter aircraft (e.g., the F-22 and F-35) can be adapted for multiple missions and offer a wealth of emerging technological capabilities. In these aircraft, pilots must master new tactics and procedures that differ significantly in comparison to previous generation aircraft. However, comprehensively training pilots across such emerging tactics and procedures is not economical in live exercises. To effectively, efficiently, and economically prepare pilots for next-generation multirole aircraft, we conducted a Phase I effort to design and demonstrate a Next-Generation, Multirole Fighter Instruction and Rehearsal Environment (GeMFIRE). In Phase I, we successfully established the feasibility of our approach, integrating a variety of low-cost, commercial devices. We demonstrated a DIS-enabled software simulation environment for simultaneous multi-pilot missions, and a scenario creation tool for multi-mission exercise design. Based on the successful completion of Phase I, we propose a Phase II effort to design, develop, and evaluate GeMFIRE. In Phase II, we will: (1) refine our work analysis with 4.5/5th-generation aircraft experts; (2) provide a wider range of displays and controls in our adaptive training environment; (3) extend probabilistic training models within our scenario authoring tool; (4) integrate these components into a suite of NICE-compatible flight simulation solutions.  BENEFIT:  The primary benefit of GeMFIRE will be in supporting cost-effective training and rehearsal for next-generation, multirole aircraft pilot squadrons across a spectrum of low- to medium-fidelity integrated simulator solutions. However, we recognize considerable benefit in coordinating with additional aircraft (e.g., F-22s, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) and ground forces (e.g., air operations centers), particularly those with multiple mission sets (e.g., ISR, strike). We will also extend our commercial agent development environment, AgentWorks, with authoring capabilities that will enhance AgentWorks appeal in the Serious Games and Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) Simulation training markets (e.g., introducing more intelligent adversary behaviors). Our intelligent agent models coupled with robust displays and control devices will also result in opportunities in emerging home entertainment markets (e.g., immersive video games).",

By considering value from a utilitarian perspective, the value of information is dynamic and many factors determine its relative usefulness. This project proposes to investigate these issues and bring more valuable information to the forefront of the analytical process. The proposed research and development targets several Air Force analysis operations units needs, and supporting their human assets with high-precision fusion and automated identification technology, including Pattern of Life development. A broad range of data types will be investigated and fused, including textual, relational, and imagery. A host of automation-assistive capabilities designed to identify information of value and bring it to the attention of the analyst will be developed, evaluated and improved. The project concludes with an integrated functional prototype of these capabilities that is deployed, evaluated and demonstrated to management in both unclassified and classified contexts.BENEFIT:Anticipated benefits of this projects success include human analysts improved capability to effectively leverage more and larger data sources in their work; improving human analysts situational awareness across larger and multiple simultaneous areas of interest; and improved analyst morale with the reduction of grunt work in their standard operations.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The objective for SBIR solicitation AF141-152 is the definition, development and execution of an uncertainty propagation analysis for modeling RUS frequency variation for Ni-base superalloys. Ensuring the accuracy of RUS modeling techniques requires a proper understanding of propagation of uncertainty in model results from various sources of error. In Phase I of the project, the Team identified sources of error and developed an uncertainty quantification (UQ) process that they applied to models and physical measurements of Ni-base superalloy coupons. For Phase II, the team proposes to apply that UQ process to additional geometries through a stepwise progression to more complex shapes. The team will compare modeled UQ results to RUS measurements for physical samples. These comparisons will enable verification and validation of the UQ results. Examinations of alternate RUS hardware configurations will be explored in a DOE format. Case studies to validate the uncertainty quantification process will be conducted. The team will also lay out plans for a transition to Phase III, which will feature a prototype RUS system in a production environment.BENEFIT:Development of modeling/UQ capabilities for RUS/PCRT will have significant technical and economic benefits for the DoD and commercial customers. Vibrant will make forward and inverse modeling with UQ an integral step in its process for creating inspection solutions. RUS/PCRT inspections will have better resolution for detecting the conditions of interest while reducing scrap rate. The new capabilities may also preserve serviceable life for some life-limited parts. RUS/PCRT enhanced with modeling and UQ techniques may reduce the fleet-wide cost of failure by reducing the frequency of field failures through improved detection of defects in critical components. While developing RUS/PCRT applications, forward modeling can be used to evaluate sensitivity to various defects of interest before time and money are expended on collecting parts and configuring test fixturing. Forward modeling can also enable the virtual population of a training database of resonance frequencies including the variations/defects of interest, requiring far fewer physical parts for a training database. Inverse modeling enables the determination of material state for physical components using measured resonance frequencies. Forward and inverse modeling will also be a crucial tool for more comprehensive material state awareness of a component, a major long-term goal for AFRL NDE research efforts.",

Particles treated with GGC yielded an obscurant cloud 1.7 times larger than the same mass of untreated samples during pyrotechnic burster field tests. Several GGC were successfully demonstrated during the Phase I program. They differ in their gas generation volume and their sensitivity to temperature and shock. The GGC creates microturbulence via deflagration/decomposition during obscurant dissemination and results in a high single particle separation efficiency. The GGC will be developed for use with pneumatic obscurant particle dissemination during the proposed Phase II program. PSI will demonstrate the GGC for pneumatically disseminated carbon fiber, TiO2 particle and brass flake obscurants. We will also optimize a GGC for use with pyrotechnic TiO2 M106 visible obscurant grenades. We have demonstrated alignment processes for fiber obscurants and will further develop and test these approaches during the Phase I Option using brass flake obscurants. During the course of the Phase II program PSI will provide a series of obscurants for pneumatic and pyrotechnic dissemination at ECBC and Capco to demonstrate the enhanced extinction provided by the PSI GGC and alignment methods.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:To perform on-airplane weld repairs of the F-22 titanium frames and forward and aft booms is highly desired, but currently not practical due to the required high temperature thermal stress relief process. An alternative is to apply the vibration stress relief scheme, which is increasingly used in heavy industry. The major problem associated with the vibration stress relief is its repeatability and controllability. Thus, the US Air Force is seeking a repeatable, vibration-based stress relief technology for on-airplane weld repairs of major structural components. In this proposal, X-wave Innovations, Inc. (XII) is developing a Portable Ultrasonic Stress Reliever (PUSR) for highly efficient, controllable and repeatable residual stress relief in weldments of airplane structural repairs. In the Phase I program, XII prototyped a PUSR system and demonstrated the feasibility of this approach for highly efficient, repeatable residual stress relief in weldments. For the Phase II program, XII will focus on refining the prototype system design and development with improved hardware and software. For the Phase III program, XII will focus on collaborating with our commercial partners to improve and package the PURS technology into to a turnkey commercially-available system.BENEFIT:The proposed PUSR system has many market applications in different industries such as the air and space, surface and underwater vehicles, automobile, and power plants. The total market will increase in the future because the residual stress relief in weldments is invaluable for keeping the structure dimensions, preventing damage initiation, and extending the service lift of many important material systems. The proposed research provides a great support for effectively relieving the local residual stress of a large structure without the need to put the entire structure at resonance. This local residual stress relief technique is more repeatable and accurate than any other vibration stress relief approach currently used in the field. Therefore, the market for the PUSR system is huge.",

Many factors along the value chain from farm fields to the family table contribute to food loss and waste however one unseen factor goes unnoticed, the plant hormone ethylene. Ethylene triggers over ripening in bananas, tomatoes, apples and other fruits and vegetables leading to spoilage and food waste. In cereal and oilseed crops, heat and drought stress triggers over production of ethylene leading to reduced pollination, reduced seed weight, and yield loss. Controlling the effects of ethylene both in fruit and vegetable packages, storage, shipment and at the retailer and in the fields greatly contribute to reducing food loss and waste.Research underway by MirTech is leading to novel ways to deliver of an ethylene blocking agent, a bio-pesticide known as 1-MCP (1-methyl cyclopropene). This new delivery technology will enable farmers, food packers, shipping companies, retailers and wholesalers to reduce food loss and waste by maintaining fruit quality and freshness and preventing yield losses in the field to fruit, vegetable, cereal crops and oilseed crop. Already MirTech has been granted patents on this new area of technology. If ultimately successful, MirTech will deliver a critically important tool into the hands of US growers, food packers and shippers and ultimately benefit every consumer.",

While bariatric surgical approaches can produce very effective weight loss, they are highly invasive and have significant risks of morbidity and mortality.

A technique for converting actual aircraft measured flight usage data into accurate calculated stresses/strains on the structural \"hot spots\" via physics-based, real-time aeroservoelastic simulations will be extremely useful to the Air Force to continue the operational readiness of its aging fleet. In Phase I, ZONA Technology, Inc. successfully demonstrated distributed loads calculations using the Stick-to-Stress Dynamic Flight Simulation (StS-DFS) framework and F-15 Saudi (F-15SA) flight test data, taking into account changing fuel mass. The overall objective of the Phase II effort is to establish a broad simulation capability for loads generation using StS-DFS, including store mass variation. We will use the F-15SA as a demonstration case to validate StS-DFS predicted loads with flight test data, account for variation of mass and pilot from aircraft to aircraft, generate stress time history due to various maneuvers, and perform fatigue analysis for estimation of residual fatigue life. The outcome of this effort shall be a crucial step towards the Airframe Digital Twin vision, leading to an updated life prediction and inspection interval of individual aircraft.BENEFIT:The technology developed during this Phase II effort will result in a technique for converting actual aircraft measured flight usage data into accurate calculated stresses/strains on the structural hot spots via physics-based, real-time aeroservoelastic simulations; this resultant technology is called the StS-DFS Framework. The StS-DFS Framework will have the capability to simulate the key aeroelastic coupling mechanism between structural dynamics and nonlinear unsteady aerodynamics with classical rigid body dynamics to generate a broad range of loads including the store ejection loads, maneuver loads, gust loads, buffet loads with the consideration of the effect of uncertainty associated with aircraft-to-aircraft variability, leading to an estimation of residual fatigue life of the airframe. This capability is a crucial early step towards the Airframe Digital Twin vision. The StS-DFS Framework will promote physical understanding of observed in-flight dynamic behavior by virtual flight test simulations. Since the StS-DFS Framework is able to accurately predict the fatigue life and damage of individual aircraft, it will be highly desirable to both military and commercial aircraft companies. The target customers for the StS-DFS Framework include all aircraft manufacturers, owners, and maintenance organizations, most of which are current ZONA customers.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The damage tolerance approach is used widely in the aerospace industry and has a physics-based foundation in fracture mechanics. The fatigue crack growth rate can be determined by calculating the SIF (stress intensity factor) and knowing empirically derived material parameters. Similitude is achieved for different loads, different crack sizes, and different crack shapes. The down side to fracture mechanics is that a crack must be assumed and for most fracture mechanics methods, the crack is assumed to be relatively large compared to the size of the plastic zone and the material microstructure. VEXTECs proposed approach will provide the actual size of the flaw and the cycles needed to grow to that size by applying probabilistic, physics-based fatigue crack growth models developed under this program. The damage is modeled as microstructurally small and physically small cracks by capturing the microstructure of the beta annealed titanium material and crack closure effects prior to transition to long crack regime. Phase II will demonstrate the feasibility of these models to accurately predict small crack growth by comparing with test data.BENEFIT:The benefit of developing a physics-based fracture mechanics methodology for analysis of cracks smaller than the linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) regime is the significant reduction in errors and uncertainty in the life predictions which result in unreliable or excessive conservative designs. The methods and tools developed in this SBIR will facilitate the design of more reliable & efficient aerospace structures. These models and software tools will benefit the USAF and OEMs in determining the fatigue life of structures accurately by directly linking to tools used for structural design. In the long run, these tools will also help in estimating maintenance and fleet readiness levels. The US military is, out of necessity, focusing on sustainment of its existing weapon systems, as opposed to procurement of new fleets. One important aspect of improved sustainment is better, higher fidelity models for existing aircrafts. These needs will be met through investment by OEMs and the military in better simulation tools. Assuming VEXTEC captured only a fractional percent of the discussed market potential, it would equate to many millions of dollars in annual revenue to the company. Moreover, VEXTEC foresees this opportunity following in the footsteps of previous successful technology transitions into the aerospace markets.",

Under the Phase I effort, STR developed a nonlinear filtering approach, based on the homotopy-based (flow-based) particle filter, and showed that it has the potential to greatly improve navigation accuracy. This effort will build upon these concepts to develop and demonstrate a prototype nonlinear filtering navigation system. We will evaluate the algorithms using realistic trajectories and IMU error models, and perform sensitivity studies to understand the impact of different errors, and tradeoffs in computation and accuracy. We will also perform a feasibility study on transitioning the capability to flight capable hardware for different missile systems. BENEFIT:The proposed effort will provide strategic strike vehicles with effective means for accurate navigation and guidance, using only the on-board IMU, thereby reducing the susceptibility to various kinds of interference and countermeasures, and enabling operational capability under GPS denied environments. The techniques developed by this proposed effort will also provide commercial non-GPS navigation applications.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The objective of this work is to develop a tool to quantitatively predict corrosion between carbon fiber composite (CFC) and 7050 Al, as used in remotely piloted aircraft (RPAs). Phase I showed that the dominant corrosion mechanism for this material mix is pitting. Therefore, this effort will introduce computational analysis of both galvanic and pitting corrosion rates on aluminum in structures joining CFC and aluminum in configurations typical of RPAs, wetted by water ingress or condensation. It will incorporate time-dependent changes in electrochemical properties and assess the effects of non-uniform electrolyte layers. The program will deliver to USAF a Rationalized Toolset that incorporates the knowledge gained during the program to permit accurate analysis and reduction of galvanic/pitting corrosion in airframes. It will also deliver a package of Recommended Corrosion Prediction Practices for material and process engineers, and a Recommended Corrosion Design Practices Document for designers. These tools will permit designers to minimize corrosion in RPA structures at the design stage, and maintainers to predict and manage corrosion in sustainment.BENEFIT:Since corrosion costs USAF about $4.5 billion per year (a quarter of the maintenance budget), the benefits of corrosion reduction are very large, especially when reduced corrosion is built in during the design phase. The tools developed and transitioned to USAF and OEMs by this project will make it possible for USAF to begin to move away from the find and fix approach to corrosion, to a less expensive and safer predict and manage approach. Since lightweighting, using composite structures and lightweight alloys has become so important for performance and energy savings, this approach is applicable, not just to military RPAs, but to all military and commercial aircraft and vehicles.",

While much of this data is ultimately not operationally useful, deployed assets lack the ability to perform in-situ analyses and identify the relevant elements. In addition, there exist vast databases of other auxiliary and contextual information, yet these data sources cannot be linked as it is impossible to query the image data directly in a semantically meaningful way. Therefore, there is an urgent need for automated tools and techniques that are able to process, triage, analyze, and enrich image and video data with more descriptive metadata.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The pressure oscillations associated with thermoacoustic combustion instabilities are a serious hazard to combustion systems such as gas-turbine-engine combustors, augmentors / afterburners, ramjets, and rocket engines. Unfortunately, combustion engineers currently face a dilemma when trying to estimate these potentially destructive phenomena. Engineers can obtain a quick insight into these instabilities with tools of very limited predictive capability, or they can use CFD, which can be deemed predictive but is too computationally expensive for practical use. A tool must be developed to bridge this huge gap in predictive capability and computational cost. With this in mind, Combustion Science & Engineering, Inc. will develop a software suite to estimate thermoacoustic combustion instabilities that will use a novel CFD / acoustic-solver strategy. This hybrid strategy uses mature concepts from CFD, acoustics modeling, and multiscale methods not applied yet to problems in combustion instabilities. Although this strategy is not trivial to implement, it can be developed in 2 years with a high probability of success. This software suite will also be able to conduct classic analyses and CFD simulations, providing combustion engineers with a well-rounded tool. At the end of Phase II, a software suite will be validated and ready for beta testing.BENEFIT:An important product from this project will be a suite of computational tools to analyze the thermoacoustic behavior of augmentors and combustors. These modeling tools can be used for a variety of applications, including the design and testing of these systems. This will be an important design tool for most propulsion systems, including gas turbines applications, for predicting combustion instabilities. This suite of modeling tools is very versatile such that the user can conduct a variety of analyzes of varying complexity and operating conditions. This product will give the design engineer much more freedom to test new combustor designs operating at wider range of pressures, temperature and fuel / air mixtures. The software suite proposed here will bridge a current gap in predictive power to estimate combustion instabilities and, consequently, will have a broad range of applicability, something which contrasts with traditional combustor-dependent tools. As a result, the proposed software will be readily useful to a wide range of combustion systems of interest to the military, such as gas-turbine-engine combustors, augmentors/afterburners, and ramjets, all of which are prone to the damaging pressure oscillations associated with combustion instabilities. Gas-turbine-engine combustors are widely used in the military since they are the prime movers of aircrafts, tanks, and some combat ships. Regarding augmentors/afterburners, these devices are of military importance because aircrafts use them to obtain bursts in thrust, such as those needed during takeoff, climb, missile evasion, and combat maneuvers; some of the aircraft in service that use augmentors include the F15, F16, F18, F22, and F35 (still in production). There is a need for tractable, design-specific thermoacoustic analyses in the gas-turbine community. This software will be used by both the design and testing communities. The product developed in this work will be a useful tool for subsonic, supersonic and hypersonic vehicle design applications for the US Air Force. Discussions with engine design teams indicate that the capabilities of this project will greatly enhance current design tools in use by equipment manufacturers. Also the market for this product will include gas turbine designers and manufacturers for both military and civilian aircraft. The use of this tool will significantly reduce development costs by eliminating some design iterations and hardware testing, which is quite expensive and time-consuming. This tool will be applicable to any propulsion system that utilizes combustion for energy input, including afterburners or augmentors, interturbine burners or any new concept for increasing gas turbine efficiency and power. In addition, the capability to model thermoacoustic processes is also important in a variety of stationary power generation applications, including large gas turbines used for electrical power generation or microturbines used for distributed power generation. Furthermore, this capability is useful to other combustion systems, such as used in boilers or furnaces.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an innovative nanocomposite coating that provides a substantial improvement in gear lifetime for rotorcraft transmissions following loss-of-lubrication. The high temperature, self-lubricating coating is composed of a nanocomposite material that provides lubricity and resistance against scuffing and brittle fracture over a wide temperature range (> 650C). The coating should allow helicopter transmissions to run for at least 45 minutes after loss of lubrication, significantly improving rotorcraft survivability. The solid lubricant coating is composed of a graded nanocomposite material. The coating is a chameleon coating in that the lubricious properties only kick-in when the coating is at high temperature (> 150C), such as during loss-of-lubrication. During normal operation the coating helps protect the gear surface, but the lubrication is provided by the transmission oil. The coating provides a significant performance improvement compared to conventional DLC and carbide coatings due to its superior resistance to degradation and lubricious properties at elevated temperatures and its ability to automatically provide lubrication as needed. This advanced coating technology was demonstrated in Phase-I to provide excellent wear performance under non-lubricating conditions with low friction and less than 1% wear compared to uncoated and superfinished AISI 9310 gear steels at 650C in air. The coating also provides excellent loading capability without coating failure, compatibility with helicopter transmission oil, and durability with negligible wear and a low coefficient-of-friction of 0.07 when lubricated. The Phase-II development will primarily focus on coating optimization and uniformity on gears for optimized high temperature wear characteristics. The coating capabilities will be validated first in spur gear contact fatigue tests and then ultimately in full-scale rotorcraft gearbox tests under oil-out conditions.",

A system that sufficiently simulates actual ACM functionality and dynamics in laboratory environment is sought to minimize aircraft development costs and schedule risks. In Phase I, Mainstream successfully completed the initial phase for developing an air-cycle machine (ACM) emulator. The original Phase I feasibility effort consisted of designing the ACM components as well as fabricating and experimentally validating one such component (i.e. cooling turbine rotor). In addition, Mainstream delivered and integrated the cooling turbine, along with a load-dissipating turbocharger compressor, in an Air Force Research Laboratory test facility and demonstrated the cooling turbine capability. In Phase II, Mainstream will continue the development of the laboratory emulators and will deliver two sets of matched turbine/compressor configurations for installation, testing, and evaluation during the period of performance.BENEFIT:The proposed approach seeks to emulate the cooling turbine and compressor of an air cycle machine to test various configurations of an aircraft thermal management system in a laboratory environment. By developing a laboratory based ACM designed to be easily and rapidly converted from one configuration to another by interchanging turbine rotors and compressor impellers, the technology enables testing of various cooling TMS configurations at relatively low cost when compared to actual airborne ACM. While the compressor technology for this program is developed for a larger application, the compressor can be scaled down and operate as an electrically driven supercharger for automobile applications. By being an electrically driven supercharger, fuel efficiency can be increased by minimizing turbo-lag present in traditional turbochargers. There is a very large commercial potential for the proposed system. The market size for automotive turbochargers/superchargers is large and growingthe global market size was approximately $1.9B in 2010 and is expected to grow to $2.9B by 2015.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:There is no single method available today that can reliably measure soot particle mass concentrations, number concentrations, PM specific surface area, and particle size distributions, especially with specificity to soot (black carbon, elemental carbon). It has been demonstrated that laser induced incandescence (LII) methods can reliably measure soot volume fraction, soot primary particle size, and volume specific surface area with very high specificity to elemental carbon. However, the method cannot measure aggregate size or size distributions. Under the Phase I program, we investigated an innovative method for measuring the soot aggregate size with a high degree of specificity to nonvolatile soot. The LII results when combined with the measurements from other existing methods (CPC and DMA) will provide more reliable PM mass concentration, number concentrations and directly measured soot particle size distributions. The ultimate goal of the Phase II program is to enhance the capabilities of the LII and to seamlessly integrate the LII with a CPC and a DMA instrument to provide comprehensive analysis of nonvolatile PM in real-time.BENEFIT:The availability of new mass measurement instruments, such as the LII, with ultra-low mass measurement sensitivity, will permit both engine developers and regulators to switch over from the current gravimetric method to the newly developed instruments for PM measurements in engine exhausts. By integrating the LII with other PM instruments, additional information can be extracted such as soot aggregate size. With regard to aircraft gas turbine engine emissions, the SAE E-31 Committee is specifically looking to qualify measurement techniques for the non-volatile components of particulate matter, namely soot or black carbon. Based on the extensive testing and comparisons performed by this committee, it appears to be leaning favorably towards the LII. This opens up another market opportunity for LII all gas turbine engine manufacturers will be interested in the LII to help them develop low particulate emission engines.The primary driver for the adoption of stringent particulate emissions and air quality standards around the world is to protect public health. The secondary driver is to protect public welfare which includes protecting our environment and the climate. The strict PM emission and air quality standards, in turn, are expected to be the key drivers in the future adoption of LII-based instruments.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:IP-based tactical networks which are being deployed increasingly must possess the capability to gracefully shed mission functions in accordance with the intent of the commander when network congestion occurs. Such congestion events are expected to be prevalent in tactical wireless networks because of two major factors: (1) the increasing use of bandwidth-hungry applications, such as full-motion video (FMV); and (2) dynamic changes in the capacity of wireless links, caused by node movement and environmental factors, which could dramatically shrink the available capacity of a link to a small fraction of its advertised maximum. Prioritization of IP packet flows associated with mission applications (e.g., VoIP, FMV, fire control, chat, web), in accordance with the commanders current mission priorities, will enable the network to preempt or discard packet flows with lower priorities to preserve unimpeded operation of high-priority mission-critical applications under network congestion events. Since mission priorities may change over time, dynamic or on-the-fly reprioritization of IP packet flows is imperative for tactical IP networks. To address this technical challenge and to meet the need identified by the Air Force, Architecture Technology Corporation (ATCorp) proposes an innovative software-based network management solution called the Mission-Based Agile Network Traffic Reprioritization (MANTRA) system. BENEFIT:The results of this SBIR effort will produce a MANTRA software product that can be integrated within tactical IP networks to enable mission-oriented network command and control.

ActiveSearch focuses on two key requirements. The first is that an analyst must be able to quickly and easily convey the types of information that should be targeted. To achieve this capability, we build on recent advances in automatic query expansion and active learning. Our approach allows queries to be expanded via a massive ontology, and then reformulated based on user feedback, so that the system can accurately recognize the targeted content. The second requirement is that the system be fast enough to respond to a user in real-time. To achieve this capability, we develop a novel approach that employs a sparse bit set representation for extremely fast query processing, together with a distributed architecture.BENEFIT:Todays analysts are faced an enormous number of documents and yet it can be difficult for them to find the information they need. Search engines can be ineffective for researching topics that cannot be easily be described in a few keywords. On the other end of the spectrum, text extraction engines can identify targeted facts quite precisely, but they need to be trained and laboriously tuned for each task. ActiveSearch represents a middle ground, allowing analysts to pose hard informational queries that can be rapidly tuned for a given task. ActiveSearch is a research engine designed to save analysts significant time when sifting through large document corpuses.

In Phase II, POC will continue development of the PFID to improve tool precision, durability, safety, and cost-effective manufacturability, as well as begin tailoring the tool to immediate customer needs, culminating in a final prototype, capable of reliably installing fasteners in a production-representative environment, with a clear, detailed path toward transition to production.BENEFIT:The proposed PFID system will meet the needs of the Air Force by greatly reducing both the labor required to install fasteners, as well as ensuring quality and consistency while reducing production costs of the C-130. PFID will also prove valuable while performing repairs and maintenance on legacy C-130J aircraft. It will ensure that the Air Forces aircraft fleet will be produced efficiently, spend as much time as possible in service, and have reduced maintenance time and costs. Furthermore, PFID can be adapted to reduce costs and improve quality for other manufacturers in both the commercial and defense aircraft markets, as well as be adapted to markets with similar manufacturing methodologies, such as those in the automotive and ship building industries.",

The sensor is based on optical coherence tomography (OCT), which in Phase I was shown to be sensitive to infiltration of calcium magnesium alumino-silicate (CMAS) into thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). In Phase II, a refined prototype sensor will be developed and used to measure the extent of CMAS infiltration of a range of test specimens and ex-service turbine blades and vanes. The accompanying model simulates the infiltration of molten CMAS into a porous TBC under non-uniform and transient temperature conditions, including the viscous flow, partial crystallization, and resulting strain of a given molten mineral deposit. The combination of sensor and model allows testing of predictions and subsequent development and use as a decision support tool for evaluation of the remaining life of critical engine components involving TBCs.BENEFIT: The proposed sensor system and damage model together enable predictions of remaining life of turbine blades and vanes that have been exposed to sand and/or volcanic ash environments. The combined product is envisioned to serve as a decision support tool for both military and civilian aircraft maintenance personnel. The envisioned OCT sensor system will be a valuable diagnostic tool for on-wing inspection of in-service engines to obtain non-destructive evaluations of CMAS infiltration level with improved assessments of damage. Researchers could use the diagnostic for rapid and efficient screening of advanced TBCs through non-destructive testing. Validated damage models will enable prediction of CMAS infiltration and crystallization dynamics, which provides a useful tool for testing and evaluation of CMAS mitigation strategies.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Research will be conducted to develop a standardized test for accurately determining the resin impregnation level in polymer matrix prepreg materials. A permeability type test will be developed which enables measurement of the open area in a prepreg material that is available for gas and volatile transport. The test will be developed into an ASTM standard so that permeability specifications can be incorporated into prepreg acceptance requirements. As a consequence of the developed test, prepreg manufacturers, composite part fabricators, and end part users can have greater confidence in the quality and reproducibility of the prepreg material from a manufacturing perspective and final part performance. Accordingly, this test will result in cost savings in manufacturing out-of-autoclave, vacuum bag only cure composite parts as well as parts made with other forms of prepreg materials.BENEFIT:The test developed in this program will ultimately lead to greater quality and reproducibility of prepreg materials for use in composite part manufacturing. This test will be able to determine accurately the level of impregnation of prepreg materials, which is especially necessary for vacuum bag only cure materials. All forms of prepregs will be able to be characterized including woven fabrics and uni-tapes. It is anticipated that this test will be used by prepreg manufacturers to provide batch specification details but also used by part manufacturers for quality and process control. This test may also be used to understand the gas and volatile transport in various layups as a function of material and orientation, and therefore intra and interply permeability. Further testing of how the permeability of the prepreg or layup changes during the cure cycle could also be undertaken with this test. It is anticipated that prepreg manufacturers will also find use for this test in the design of prepreg materials through analysis of how prepreg process parameters affect the level of impregnation. Ultimately, this low cost test will become a standard that can be used universally in the composite industry for quantifying one of the most important prepreg parameters (permeability) that relates to manufacturability of fiber reinforced composites.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:This project addresses the development and benchmarking of advanced algorithms to track modern supermaneuverable targets. The objective is to develop, demonstrate, and validate an assessment tool that provides future radar architecture design performance requirements to the acquisition community for tracking algorithms that will succeed against these modern threats. In Phase I, we enumerated and tested a wide set of tracking approaches, from traditional, fielded Kalman filter algorithms including the extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter, to state-of-the-art nonlinear filtering algorithms, such as the resampling particle filter and homotopy particle filter. We benchmarked these algorithms in simulation against a set of supermaneuvering targets using simulated radar measurements. The effort showed the failure mechanisms of standard Kalman-based approaches and brought to light the significant improvements available from modern, cutting edge nonlinear filtering algorithms. In Phase II, we propose to extend and refine the trackers developed in Phase I, test the methods with high-fidelity flight data, and use these results to produce recommendations for future systems.BENEFIT:The anticipated results from the project are: (i) an analysis of modern nonlinear filtering algorithms on modern supermaneuverable threats which shows military-relevant performance improvements over conventional tracking algorithms, to include: increased detection range and improved target localization, (ii) Matlab-level prototyping of these new tracking algorithms that are robust and computationally efficient, and (iii) a method of using these tools to predict in-theatre performance and recommend radar design and settings to optimize the performance. The immediate benefit of the Phase II tracking capability is to provide the Air Force with a quantitative assessment of the performance improvement possible when using modern tracking algorithms. Furthermore, the analysis will provide methods for determining how to design future systems to maximize in-theatre performance by selecting radar parameters and surveillance platform trajectories.",

        "abstract": "The space suit assembly (SSA) contains metallic bearings at the wrist, neck, and waist, which are exposed to space environment, and pose a potential shock hazard. Current methods to mitigate the hazard are short-term, and there is a need for an insulative and durable coating on the metallic components. In Phase I, working with a supplier of space suits to NASA, we demonstrated proof-of-concept of a novel Self-Healing Coating (SHC) system which is highly insulative and is capable of healing surface damages at ambient conditions. The three-layered self-healing coating was applied on flat panels of stainless steel, titanium and aluminum. In addition to self-healing, the ability of the coating to resist impact damage was demonstrated. Building upon the successful Phase I demonstration, the focus of the Phase II effort will be to further test and optimize the SHC system and implement on a prototype metallic bearing. The Phase II objectives include: (i) ensuring that the self-healing coating system can be used in space environment; (ii) determining the least coating thickness that will provide both self-healing and electrical resistance; (iii) developing a suitable process for depositing the coating on components of different geometries; and (iv) developing a property and performance data set that best predicts useful life of the coating. Successful development will culminate in applying the SHC system on a prototype component and performing the needed qualification testing. We anticipate achieving a TRL of 6 by the end of the Phase II program. The work plan includes preparing coating solutions and coating flat test panels; conducting performance tests and optimizing coating thickness using coated plates; qualifying the SHC system for use in a space environment; developing a property and performance data set that best predicts useful life of the coating; applying SHC system to a prototype hardware; and evaluating performance of coating on prototype hardware.",

The path towards integration remains a long one, however, as optical clocks currently occupy optical tables in the relatively benign environment of the research lab.

For the emerging class of dedicated airborne communications platforms this is sub-optimal. The mission of these platforms is to extend communications ranges, enabling enhanced (particularly IP-based) connectivity for other mission elements. This calls for a new type of planning system. Rather than end-users entering courses, courses can be planned automatically based on where the other mission elements are positioned. This information, along with relative priorities and specifics about radios allows for more effective planning of courses and placement in airspace of dedicated airborne relays.

Technical breakthroughs in multi-fuel combustion supported by innovative high speed pneumatic fuel injection combined with catalytic hot surface ignition systems enable complete freedom of compression ratio essential for effective turbo-compounding. Scavenge air and on demand engine manifold boost pressure is supplied by an electrically assisted, combustion driven hyper bar turbocharger that eliminates the weight and bulk of a positive displacement blower. The high speed permanent magnet motor/generators are independently mounted to the high speed turbochargers as well as the axial gap motor/generator imbedded in the flywheel. The speed differential and turbo compounding is by means of electronic inverter control, thus eliminating the complexity of mechanical transmissions. Variable ratio exhaust valve results in a trapped range from 9-12:1 CR. without compromising the combustion chamber geometry. With the valve closed, the higher 12:1 compression ratio improves cost start, efficient part load and stable combustion during high altitude descent avoiding ignition flame out. This innovative combine cycle engine can be characterized as having the breathing capacity and power density of the gas turbine combined with the fuel economy of the direct injected diesel.BENEFIT:Advanced heterogeneous multi-fuel combustion with favorable peak to mean pressure ratio essential for lightweight and durable engine construction. -Self-running advanced hyper bar turbocharger technology with electrically assisted compressor and on demand combustion driven supercharge independent of main engine exhaust flow. -Maximum hybrid core engine power densities below 1lb/hp. double the peak takeoff power by electrically assisted supercharging and/or direct 50% power contribution from the brushless PM motor. extended UAS range and endurance from an efficient direct injected heterogeneous charge.  low noise propulsor for covert missions.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:MZA partnered with the University of Notre Dame proposes advancement of aero-optical isolation hardware, data processing, and optical modeling for upgrade of AEDCs 16T wind tunnel. We will conduct testing at AEDC during Year 1 with mechanical diagnostics and an upgraded optical sensor with small-aperture access to the test section from outside the 16T pressure vessel. We will also design and implement a remotely-operated optical diagnostic sensor bench with environmental enclosure for use inside the AEDC pressure vessel. The sensor bench will include a high-speed wavefront sensor and beam expander enabling full-aperture aero-optics measurements. The remote optical diagnostic sensor bench will be tested initially at Notre Dames White Field wind tunnel in Year 2, verifying system functionality and isolation of aero-optical disturbances from a surrogate laser turret. We will conduct Year 2 testing at AEDC with the remote optical diagnostic sensor bench inside the 16T pressure vessel, enabling a large aperture wavefront measurement of the tunnel boundary layer. The sensor bench and test experience at AEDC will enable development of a conceptual design for AEDCs aero-optics isolation test section. The conceptual design will be captured in a WaveTrain optical model for virtual testing of future laser DE systems at AEDC.BENEFIT:The tunnel measurement system proposed here will allow AEDC and other wind tunnel facilities to isolate contaminating optical disturbances induced by the test section from aero-optical effects which are characteristic of laser directed energy systems and their associated beam director turrets/apertures. This system will improve the quality of aero-optical test data measured in subscale and full-scale wind tunnel tests for assessing performance limitations and operational envelopes of laser systems prior to costly aircraft integration and flight testing. Such a system will also help to identify sources of disturbances in the tunnel and suggest strategies for minimizing or eliminating these contaminants. Once tunnel disturbances are abated, additional testing such as real-time laser beam control tests can also be conducted in tunnels at AEDC. After proven successful for AEDC, the proposed measurement system, data processing, and optical modeling can be extended to other wind tunnels at government, industry, and academic facilities. The system may also be incorporated into a transportable Optical Diagnostic Range Simulator hardware used for testing laser systems in laboratory or hangar. The same product can be used in operational laser tests using a wind tunnel test section, becoming an integral part of the directed energy system developmental cycle.",

Building on our successful 94 GHz TWT, Teraphysics will initiate fabrication early on in the program to allow enough time for more than one fabrication iteration, if necessary.BENEFIT:The commercial potential is enormous for wireless communications, particularly to increase through put for backhaul applications.

        "abstract": "This effort will complete the work of the original Phase II project within the remaining budget. The effort will concentrate on the optimization of a non-intrusive ignition system.   The process of remote ignition of high pressure gases is influenced by turbulence, optics obfuscation, focal point length, and laser beam quality and power.  It is the intent of this proposal to study these effects further using a laser diagnostics facility already available.   Several new techniques will be studied to improve the remote ignition process.  One involves using a target inside the chamber for the laser beam energy to concentrate on.  This may improve the repeatability of the process over free space focusing.   The laser and optics remain safely outside the chamber.  In addition, the laser beam will be moved from the chamber centerline, to the chamber side wall.  In this untried scenario, the laser is still focused into the axial center of the chamber, but has a much shorter beam path.  This technique will used with and without the aforementioned targets.  Finally the project will address techniques to prevent sapphire window fogging such as heating the window and/or additional coating techniques.",

        "abstract": "We have invented a new class of robotics, called `Pneubotics', that rival current manipulators in payload and reach at 1/10th the weight. Our technology leverages insights into lightweight materials and mass manufacturing to create robots that derive power, structure, and movement from pressurized air. As a result, drive trains, motors, bearings, shafts, sliding surfaces, and excess structural material are eliminated, leading to robots with extremely high strength to weight ratios, inherently human safe operation, and high degrees of freedom at low part count. This transformative new technology has the potential to enable the widespread use of automated handling of material and equipment on missions in low Earth orbit and beyond. The compliant nature of these robotic systems allows them to robustly grasp arbitrarily shaped objects and makes them ideal for operating around sensitive equipment and materials or cooperatively with humans. Similarly, due to their fluidic architecture they can be deflated and stowed for efficient transport. The work described in this phase II SBIR proposal would integrate the component development and analysis performed in Phase I to build and test a full prototype manipulation system. By incorporating optical, internal, and tactile sensors and multi-level controls that take advantage of the unique characteristics of the manipulator and seek out appropriate contact to guide motion rather than avoiding it. By testing the entire prototype system in the field we will demonstrate operation in the ground environment and learn valuable lessons for IVA and EVA applications.",

Limitations of currently utilized field dressings greatly increase incidences of wound infection, further deterioration, shock and fatalities during CASEVAC to higher echelon levels of military medical care.  During Phase I, Lynntech demonstrated strong proof-of-concept in vitro for a novel approach, termed StABL-SD, to rapidly and reagentlessly sterilize and simultaneously encase burn wounds within a thin film dressing, which provides prophylaxis against infectious pathogens, controlled oxygen and vapor transport, and active support for proliferative wound healing.  In this proposed Phase II effort, we will fabricate prototype StABL-SD devices and demonstrate their utility in vivo using an accepted porcine model of thermal burn wound healing. StABL-SD can be utilized by minimally trained personnel in the theater of battle to stabilize burn casualties immediately after wounding for safer, non-deteriorative and more comfortable transport encased in the protective film dressing.  StABL-SD is of direct relevance to the unmet DOD need for improving warfighter survivability during transport stateside while simultaneously improving eventual treatment outcomes.  Commercial deployment of StABL-SD in future Phases will enable improved military and civilian burn casualty stabilization for successful and survivable transport to burn units.",

The system will support supervised autonomy, at flight speeds up to 10 meters/sec, in which a human operator provides high level control input and the UAV autonomously avoids obstacles while traveling in the desired direction. This capability will work in all light levels, from daylight to no light. We will also perform two full autonomy demonstrations. The first demonstration will be of a follow-me capability in which the UAV pursues a target while flying close to the ground and avoiding obstacles. The second demonstration will be of a building ingress/egress capability in which the UAV is first flown deep into a building by an operator, after which the UAV will autonomously retrace its path to the exit. This latter capability will involve the real-time creation of a limited topological map of the building over its flight path. Option efforts include the fabrication of a complete single-gram system and of a system designed for use in extremely photon-limited environments.",

We optimize Phase I findings for on-cubesat FPGA processing for interference signal detection and geolocation. Phase I findings are validated by construction of an FPGA processing board based on a current RRC design that meets Phase I recommendations of processing power, size, weight, and power. We construct a cubesat payload engineering model with this board. We construct an engineering model of the cubesat with all necessary control, power, and data handling interfaces to perform in-the-loop testing of the payload. We develop a GMAT orbit planning tool for control of the cubesat formation that maximizes geolocation performance. A demonstration of the GMAT planning tool and the payload test is given at the end of the project.BENEFIT:In this project, we demonstrate economically feasible methods for detecting terrestrial RF transmitters from space by construction and test of an engineering model. There are significant benefits to this concept including: 1) these cubesats are low-cost and easily replaced, so there is minimal concern with failure or loss as with high-value assets; 2) a formation is robust and reconfigurable, since all cubesats are identical and they have thrust capability; 3) replacement costs are low and launches are easy to get, so a backup set can be maintained and quickly launched; 4) a new design can be quickly implemented, launched, and tested; 5) each cubesat has significant processing resources, and a datalink between the satellites allows for shared parallel processing. This concept has application in areas beyond protection of USG communications including: 1) detection by the USG of unlicensed use of its radio spectrum within its borders; 2) assessment by the USG of the level of RF communication congestion in open-use frequency bands; or 3) monitoring by commercial entities of ocean shipping congestion for route planning through radar signatures. Also in this effort, we implement a receiver design for operation in a small form-factor cubesat with low power consumption. For more than ten years, RRC has been manufacturing and designing receivers for a variety of customers in the federal marketplace. A smaller, more efficient design will appeal to these customers as well, because it allows reduced size and power requirements.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:CEDAR is a software solution implementing a cloud computing capability within an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) such as the MQ-9 Reaper. It aggregates the available processing and storage capacity of onboard computers enabling them to be shared across a variety of mission applications ranging from sensor exploitation (SE) applications to on-board diagnostics and prognostics applications where the applications may belong to different security domains, e.g., Unclassified, and SECRET. By enabling mission-specific smarts to be easily programmed within a UAS, CEDAR provides the foundation for implementing the needed autonomy for mission operations. CEDAR allows a mix of computer platforms with varying capabilities to be dynamically provisioned among independently developed software applications in isolated security domains. It does this while providing fast, direct communication of sensor data, usually without the need for cross-domain guards, and without compromising security. The CEDAR design supports mission commanders in planning software deployment pre-mission to ensure available cloud hardware supports mission software needs. It enables autonomous in-mission cloud provisioning decisions by cloud-located applications, allowing the cloud to react to hardware failures and mission-generated tasks without requiring ground control intervention, making the CEDAR cloud appropriate for permissive and A2AD/contested environments. BENEFIT:CEDAR is a novel software product that efficiently and autonomously manages shared compute resources in an unmanned entity (UAV or robot) to run mission applications that analyze, combine, and filter data in real-time or near real-time. CEDAR provides an open platform for supporting the development of new UAS and Internet of Things applications. By supporting deployment of simultaneous applications in multiple security domains, it maximizes compute and storage resource utilization, allowing diverse independent, single-focus applications and providing the performance necessary for UAS on-board sensor exploitation with the possibility of increased UAS autonomy. Autonomous cloud control ensures mission-critical applications are provided critical resources, and allows testing new applications in an active platform without risk of interfering with existing mission-critical applications. The result of CEDAR research and development will be software adaptable to diverse hardware platforms, suitable for managing a cloud of low-cost COTS computer devices hosting commercial real-time operating systems and providing mixed capabilities in terms of processing power and coprocessor support that will benefit a wide variety of sensor data analysis algorithms. CEDAR will facilitate rapid innovation of surveillance, sensor exploitation, and diagnostics/prognostics applications by presenting a consistent virtualized environment from development to operational use. CEDARs cloud provisioning approach supports autonomous operation of UAV and robotic platforms, decreasing the oversight required Potential customers for the resulting commercial product include the military, law enforcement and homeland defense, and commercial enterprises.",

System design relies significantly on numerical predictions provided by computational models and simulations, however, an objective assessment of confidence in the predictions is a major challenge.   Metamorphs proposal is built upon a System Level Design methodology and tools, referred to as the OpenMETA tool suite, developed in prior DARPA funded research and now being productized by Metamorph for transition and commercial applications.   This problem of quantifying uncertainty and performing optimization under uncertainty is of significant interest to designers and engineers of complex DoD and Commercial systems.

        "abstract": "Large, open chamber Diesel engines are designed with compression ratios of 16 to 18:1 to facilitate cold starting. This is too high for best economy which is 14 to 15:1. Furthermore, these engines are designed for high power for highway vehicles with reserve for hill climbing and maneuvering. The objective is to demonstrate a combination of simple mechanisms designed for the Caterpillar C-12 to improve fuel economy particularly during light load operation as well as to allow improved engine power. One device will allow the compression ratio to vary between high (cold starting) and low (warmed-up running). A second device will disable some cylinders to improve idle and light load fuel economy which is particularly important for military surveillance, but useful for stationary generators and other applications where significant lighter load operation occurs. Minimal or no engine block modifications are anticipated. The work proposed demonstrates hardware viability in a firing engine. For the SBIR Phase II, the technology will be installed on all cylinders of the C-12 engine to demonstrate both compression ratio and disabling effectiveness. Computer modeling will guide the technology design and testing. A relationship with an established company(s) will be formed for manufacturing the technology.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Current surface modification and lubricant technologies are either ineffective or too expensive and difficult to apply on US Air Force refueling drogue components. A low-cost, non-toxic, environmentally benign, corrosion inhibiting, easy-to-apply lubricant could significantly reduce US Air Force current cost burdens to perform aerial refueling exercises and missions. To address these requirements Texas High Energy Materials offers an advanced lubricant technology that, in its first-generation, exhibited full compliance to MIL-L-23398 performance specifications, and has been fully characterized using state-of-the-art surface analysis methodologies. In Phase I we demonstrated its superior lubricating performance over the costly, maintenance intensive, and time consuming incumbent drogue coating. We also showed that it can be easily applied by maintenance technicians, without training, to drogues on aircraft in the field from a liquid shoe polish applicator and cured in place without heating, ovens or other equipment. In Phase II we will optimize its adhesion to unprepared extruded aluminum the drogue ribs; qualify it for use in this application using the full repertoire of challenging tribology tests and field condition simulations; scale up the manufacturing process; provide evaluation samples to Air Force Maintenance personnel for laboratory and field evaluations; and transition this new product to the Air Force. BENEFIT:Our permanent, ultra-low friction, durable, extreme-pressure resistant lubricant is offered as a cost-effective surface pre-treatment that will function alone or synergistically enhance the hydrodynamic performance of liquid lubricants and greases presently in service. Management of friction and wear of drogue refueling components with our lubricant technology will allow the US Air Force to achieve its performance operating cost targets. An added benefit or our technology will be to extend the service life of the lubricated part and ultimately the life of the drogue refueling system at significantly reduced life cycle cost. Air Force personnel will be pleased with the immediate cost, performance and application benefits from our proposed low-cost, ultra-low coefficient of friction, non-toxic, zero-VOC, environmentally benign, non-flammable, corrosion inhibiting, durable, high load-carrying capacity lubricant coating. Our lubricant technology will have a very low cost relative to mechanical grinding and polishing processes, and traditional lubricants and greases. In addition to outperforming those dated, well-worn products and expensive procedures, our lubricant provides application simplicity through HVLP, VOC-compliant aerosol spray, dip or brush application. We have direct experience developing a successful first-generation lubricant technology through the SBIR program. Advancements to this technology will be conducted to meet further US DoD, ASTM, SAE and STLE tribological test standards, specifications and efficiency improvement requirements. Potential Commercial Applications include aerospace servomotor applications, camshaft lobes, recreational rifle bolts and actions, tracked vehicle pins, ring and pinion gear sets, piston skirts, aircraft engine thrust bearings, ring and bore assemblies, and valve seats.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Current methods for inspecting exhaust ducts in low-observable (LO) aircraft are time consuming and error prone. Furthermore, next-generation aircraft are likely to utilize ducts with confined spaces that are inaccessible to maintainers. Technology that can reduce inspection times, minimize errors and provide access to confined spaces will benefit the Air Force by increasing aircraft availability and reducing lifecycle maintenance costs. To address this need, Intelligent Automation and Boulder Imaging propose to develop ARIS, an Autonomous Robotic Inspection System for identifying and mapping surface defects in exhaust ducts. The key innovation is the integration of a self-localizing robot equipped with an optical imaging sensor and associated control and inspection software. The system provides autonomous control of the robot to enable full coverage of the duct surface. It automatically detects and characterizes defects in coatings and registers their location in the aircraft coordinate system. In Phase I, a sensor head prototype and algorithms for localization and defect detection were developed. In Phase II, a robotic inspection system prototype targeted for a specific LO platform will be designed, built and demonstrated in a representative environment.BENEFIT:The proposed Autonomous Robotic Inspection System will automate the process of exhaust duct defect detection and analysis. It will decrease inspection time, improve accuracy, reduce sources of human error, enable inspection of confined spaces and improve inspection safety.

These successes and progress on the Modular Space Vehicle, along with standardization (Space Plug and Play Architecture) continue to show promise in a responsive space architecture focused on modularity and reconfigurability. There is a need to enhance the capability of small spacecraft to support this paradigm via miniaturized, high performance, and cost-effective components. Small, agile space companies can act as liasons between the commercial and space markets to leverage their strengths to ensure products are robust to the space environment, carry appropriate mission assurance and risk profiles, and can be delivered in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of conventional space components. Honeybee Robotics proposes to offer an attitude control product line tailored to the ORS charter. This product line will enhance and optimize a small spacecrafts attitude control capability at a fraction of the cost and lead time associated with conventional attitude control system designs. By incorporating modular design techniques and leveraging proven reliable commercial product lines we can offer the space mission designer ultimate flexibility and enhanced performance for the attitude control system. BENEFIT:The proposed technology is widely applicable to commercial, military, and civil space markets. The Operationally Responsive Space office is tasked with providing timely satisfaction of Joint Commanders needs which includes technologies which can be placed into theatre in a rapid, cost effective manner. NASA and NOAA are actively pursuing small satellite technologies to support increasing demands for Earth science including but not limited to weather/climate, coral reef, ocean salinity, and carbon monitoring.

The second layer of the design holds the memory cells and minimal circuitry to allow signal multiplexing of the through silicon vias (TSVs) that vertically connect the stack. This memory cell layer can be stacked serially, up to 16 memory cell layers, to yield a 17 layer device. Each memory cell layer will have 8Mb of user memory, exclusive of the built-in error detection and correction coding and the redundant memory bits. The interface will support the Honeywell x8 and x16 memory interface, the FPGA download mode interface, and a DDR2 DRAM compatible interface.BENEFIT:The benefits of this program will include the availability of resistive memory for harsh environments as well as making a non-volatile ReRAM process technology add-on (split-fab) generally available to commercial entities. ReRAM technology is generally considered to be the best technology to succeed Flash memory. The higher performance and greater endurance will also alter most future computer designs by providing a new storage class memory that has SSD like density with near DRAM access speed. This will revolutionize machine architecture and reduce compute power requirements. The split-fab option will permit semiconductor foundry customers to add ReRAM non-volatile memory to their devices as a 3rd party post fabrication process not effecting the original primary foundry processes. As most leading edge foundry processes don't offer a reprogrammable non-volatile memory option, this will make possible new hardware with higher density, lower power and much improved security.",

        "abstract": "Although great strides have been made in the development of simulators for training technical and teamwork skills, substantially less progress has been made with regard to their assessment. Typically, skills and performance are assessed by an expert observer using a Likert-type rating scale with anchors ranging from low to high. However, such methods are extremely coarse, and often provide little insight into the underlying causes of success or failure. What is needed are much more fine-grained, unobtrusive, and real-time measures of individual and team states such as cognitive load (CL), which can supplement expert observer ratings to provide a more holistic assessment of individual and team performance. By automatically alerting instructors to changes in CL, instructors can dynamically modify training scenarios on-the-fly, thereby ensuring that learners remain within the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) at all times. Further, by integrating CL measures during the post-training After Action Review (AAR), instructors and learners will gain a better understanding into the causes of effective and ineffective performance.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:In this proposal for SBIR program (phase-II), Test Devices, Inc, in conjunction with its industry partners Pratt & Whitney and Mechanical Solutions, Inc., will leverage its experience in the domain of high temperature full component and subscale testing to develop a prototype testing facility capable of conducting tests that will evaluate components under more realistic service environments to include:  Centrifugal loading and thermal gradients to produce multiaxial stress states at high temperatures  2000F target test temperature capability with thermal gradient  Up to 100,000rpm disk test speed  Capability to test in vacuum and controlled partial atmospheric conditions  Capability to test at pressures up to 50psi with gas species is considered as a part of stretch goals The HSST Phase-II project will be built on the successful result of phase-I work (AF141-175). The new temperature control system developed in the phase-I has successfully demonstrated its capability; it has generated a rim temperature of 2430F with a very steep thermal gradient (1100F/in) on a 5.0 (OD) disk. The result of phase-II work will culminate in a prototype subscale spin test capability with a thermal gradient, which is capable of generating an engine-like multi-axial stress field at realistic temperatures. BENEFIT:The USAF and engine OEMs will benefit from the highly-realistic subscale test facility proposed for the HSST concept in that it will provide critical data for the development and validation of coatings, hybrid microstructures, and other advanced material systems as well as support Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) activities and advances of component design and usage based lifing analysis. This will assist in speeding the development of new engines that are lighter, more fuel efficient and less polluting.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The wavelength region covering short to long infrared diapasons is used for environmental sensing, metrology and clinical diagnosis, and LADAR applications. All these applications require good optical isolation to prevent laser destabilization and possible damage. The main objective of this project is creation of the suitable material for optical isolation, which includes development of a glass which shows high magnetooptical properties (large Verdet constant), low losses and high optical homogeneity, and demonstration of bulk and fiber prototypes of optical isolators in the visible, near and mid-IR spectral regions (0.4-5 um). In order to make new glass isolator material available for fiber systems, we are going to continue exploration of an efficient fabrication of optical fibers from rare earth doped germanate glasses. Our efforts will be concentrated on fabrication of a single mode magnetooptical fiber and with further design and fabrication of polarization maintaining single mode fiber.BENEFIT:Based on our studies of magneto-optical glasses doped with rare earth ions we selected several perspective candidates for an effective optical isolation in Mid-IR region. Moreover we showed the possibility of rare earth doped PTR and Ge glass fibers, which is the first step on the way of all-fiber Mid-IR optical isolators. In the framework of the Phase II we will concentrate our research on the development of the fully operated high power (up to 500 W) actively cooled optical isolator working in 3-5 um region with 30-40 dB of returning loss at all power levels. Anticipated benefits of a proposed optical isolator include reduction of weight and dimensions of the final prototype, wide transparency in mid-IR region and low loss. Potential Commercial Application are the laser systems operating in mid-IR spectral region represent a fast growing market for medical, environmental and industrial applications. Commercial applications include optical isolators for solid state and fiber lasers rare earth and transition ions doped crystals and glasses, quantum and interband cascade semiconductor lasers, etc. Mid-IR optical isolators can also be used as intracavity elements providing unidirectional lasing (for example ring-cavity single frequency lasers).",

Thermal radiation has significant impact on both, the heat fluxes at the wall and physical phenomena controlling the combustion process. The objective of this SBIR project is to develop a general, computationally efficient, high-accuracy numerical tool for modeling radiation in combustion systems. In Phase I, a detailed review of various radiative transfer equation (RTE) solution methods and radiative property models was conducted. The Phase I effort concluded with selection of RTE solvers including the photon Monte Carlo, variants of the higher-order spherical harmonics method and the discrete ordinates method for further development. Radiative property models based on the Full-spectrum k-distribution showed the maximum potential to achieve high spectral accuracy at a fraction of cost of the corresponding line-by-line calculations. In Phase II, modules for spectral properties and RTE solvers will be developed and coupled with CFD codes of interest to the Air Force. The radiation modeling framework will be verified and validated using benchmark PMC solutions. The software tools will be delivered to the Air Force at the end of Phase II for integration into the design and analysis workflow.BENEFIT:The radiation transfer modeling tool developed in this SBIR project will have significant military as well as commercial applications. It will be directly relevant to the research conducted by the Air Force on hypersonic and high speed boundary layer flows, as well as gas turbine and rocket engine combustion. This tool will also be valuable to other agencies such as NASA, Navy and DOE. In addition, the module could be used for simulating large scale fires and for atmospheric radiation calculations. Further, the radiation codes can be used as a design tool to develop next-generation re-entry and other space vehicles (such as the NASA Multi-Purpose Crew Exploration Vehicle), and the components of future hypersonic vehicles such as Army Advanced Hypersonic weapon (AHW) and Air Force/DARPA follow up to HTV-2 unmanned hypersonic glider. The codes can also be used for plasma flow control in subsonic and supersonic aerospace applications. Finally, the tool will have wide appeal to rocket engine manufacturers (e.g., ATK, Pratt & Whitney, and Aerojet) and to universities developing rocket engine technology (e.g., Purdue, Penn State, and University of Alabama in Huntsville).",

In addition, the fabricated corrector element will be evaluated for performance in a complete optical assembly. Development and testing of a complete assembly provides an important assessment of future optical tolerance requirements for IR conformal window or dome sensor systems. This feedback loop between designer and fabricator is critical to properly defining optical component specifications with an understanding of manufacturing limitations. Furthermore, working through the process from beginning (optical design) to end (system assembly and test) provides an accurate and realistic cost and delivery estimate.

        "abstract": "Spinels combination of extended MWIR transmission and its ability to be produced in large sizes using conventional powder processing techniques, make it the material of choice for many sensor window applications. However, the severe environmental requirements for these applications drive the spinel windows strength requirements well beyond that has been demonstrated using the LiF hot pressing/HIP process. This is the most common method for producing large plates of spinel. By contrast, Surmets spinel is produced by a sinter/HIP process, which has long been known to provide much stronger spinel than hot pressing. During the Phase I effort, Surmet produced spinel blanks of up to 6x10x0.6 using its solid state sinter/HIP process. Biaxial flexure strength testing showed that Surmets spinel was significantly stronger (225-245MPa) than the spinel produced by LiF hot pressed/HIP (~100 MPa). The overall objective of the Phase II is to manufacture large spinel windows that meet the strength and optical requirements. Threshold set for part size is at 19x27x0.6, with objective at 30x28x0.6. This effort would leverage Surmets considerable expertise in commercially producing large ALON blanks up to 19x36 size and its very large furnace capabilities to demonstrate commercial production capability for large spinel windows.",

        "abstract": "The Variable Camber Continuous Trailing Edge Flap (VCCTEF) concept offers potential improvements in the aerodynamic efficiency of aircraft through real time wing shaping. NASA and Boeing have been studying the suitability of this concept to address the drag reduction problem in aircraft with reduced-stiffness wings. However, reduced stiffness may lead to wing flutter. In addition, displacements of VCCTEF control surfaces are limited and subject to highly nonlinear and time-varying constraints. Hence control design needs to solve a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. To address these challenges, in Phase I SSCI carried out initial development and testing of the Drag Identification and Reduction Technology (DIRECT). The DIRECT software estimates wing structural modes on-line and uses that information in a robust predictive controller design. Based on using Evolutionary Optimization and off-line analysis, DIRECT estimates wind disturbances on-line and selects optimal controller parameters from a table lookup to achieve on-line drag minimization. Building upon the successful Phase I development, in Phase II we propose to extend the DIRECT approach and evaluate its performance through high-fidelity simulations and wind-tunnel testing. Specific Phase II tasks include: (i) Test Phase I flutter suppression algorithms and PSC algorithms in a GTM simulation with flexible modes and VCCTEF control surfaces; (ii) Extend and enhance the drag minimization approach by developing innovative Performance Seeking Control (PSC) algorithms; and (iii) Compare the features of PSC and other available performance seeking control algorithms through wind-tunnel testing at the University of Washington Aerodynamics Laboratory (UWAL).

To dramatically reduce the development cycle, and reduce cost to tape out, Micro-RDC proposes a Structured ASIC approach. In this methodology, we fix an array of complex logic cells and provide a fixed area array for I/O pads supporting in excess of 400 Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) General Purposes Input/Output (GPIO) pins. In addition, we fix the power grid and the pins associated with power (core and I/O) and ground.  Thus, we require only routing in a subset of the metal layers to configure the Structured ASIC for a specific design. This leads to substantial reduction in design and verification time to tape out. Costs are reduced by requiring a subset of mask changes per design. In this work, we will build on Micro-RDC's existing 90nm silicon-proven Radiation Hardened Structured ASIC platform. We will develop a Structured ASIC platform at the 45nm SOI technology node.  The objective is to increase clock speeds to hundreds of MHz.

        "abstract": "The thermal transport requirements for future spacecraft missions continue to increase, approaching several kilowatts. At the same time the heat acquisition areas have trended downward, thereby increasing the incident heat flux. Current incident heat flux for laser diode applications is on the order of 5-10W/cm2, although this is expected to increase towards 50W/cm2. This is a severe limitation for axial groove aluminum/ammonia constant conductance heat pipes (CCHPs). The maximum heat flux in a CCHP is set by the boiling limit, which typically start at 5 W/cm2 for axial grove wicks, and 20-30 W/cm2 for powder metal wicks. The innovation is to develop CCHPs with a hybrid wick, which has a sintered evaporator wick, and a conventional grooved adiabatic and condenser wick.  These hybrid wicks can operate at higher heat fluxes, allowing the use of higher power laser diodes.  They also allow the use of Variable Conductance Heat Pipes (VCHPs) in Lunar and Martian Landers and Rovers, which must operate at tilts up to 45?.  Conventional aluminum/ammonia heat pipes can only operate with a 0.1 inch tilt, so they are unsuitable.  Loop Heat Pipes can also operate with tilting, but they are two orders of magnitude more expensive.  A hybrid grooved and sintered wick CCHP will allow operating at higher heat fluxes as compared to axial groove design and can also operate against gravity on the planetary surface, operate in space, carrying power over long distances, act as a thermosyphon on the planetary surface for Lunar and Martian landers and rovers, and demonstrate a higher transport capability than an all-sintered wick.",

The coatings will be applied to other materials including steel, glass and plastic to demonstrate the versatility of the technology. The coatings applied to these materials will be demonstrated to have the same optical reflectance properties as the Phase I coatings on aluminum. The nanostructured ultradark coatings will be shown to be mechanically and environmentally robust per Department of Defense (DoD) standards and a Phase III transition plan will be implemented in cooperation with our commercial partners. During Phase III we anticipate using the processes and methods developed during Phase II to apply nanostructured ultradark coatings to components used in a current DoD optical system.",

        "abstract": "US military medical personnel may be deployed to a variety of operational environments where their success saving lives depends on their ability to act quickly and effectively, both as individuals and as teams. Therefore, effective training must go beyond individual skills to include interactions among team members, and how those interactions transfer to operational environments. Currently, trainers must infer competence by observation alonea challenging task. Automatically sensing indicators of cognitive workload can augment performance observations, offering insight into factors underlying that performance. To address this issue, Charles River Analytics has designed and demonstrated the feasibility of a system to augment training by Monitoring, Extracting, and Decoding Indicators of Cognitive workload (MEDIC). Building on that success, we now propose a Phase II effort to iteratively evaluate and refine MEDIC, enabling the disambiguation of potential cognitive workload indicators from other causes, such as physical exertion. Our effort combines: (1) a multimodal suite of unobtrusive, field-ready neurophysiological, physiological, and behavioral sensors; (2) complex event processing to extract and fuse the best indicators of cognitive workload and team dynamics from the multiple, high-volume data streams originating from the sensor suite; and (3) probabilistic modeling techniques to interpret those indicators for easy understanding.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Missile test events provide the ability to evaluate the lethality of weapons systems in real-world conditions. While often immediately obvious whether the main goal of a test has succeeded/failed, it is much harder to analyze and understand the specific causes of success/failure. Current practices require arduous physical analysis of the target and its surroundings after the test is completed to obtain the level of detailed information needed. Among the most important metrics to analyze is Angle of Incidence (AOI). To accurately calculate AOI, 3D position/orientation of the weapon system must be precisely estimated at impact. To ensure that all test event information is fully utilized to further weapon system design and understanding, it is necessary to develop a system for providing accurate estimation and analysis of the weapon system during test event endgame. In Phase I, Toyon developed and demonstrated a video processing approach that provides highly accurate 3D target reconstruction, and 3D weapon system estimation to allow accurate 3D recreation of the entire test event endgame. In Phase II, Toyon proposes automating, extending, implementing, and demonstrating this low-cost COTS system in an prototype that allows users to fully recreate real-world test events and analyze their results with minimal effort.BENEFIT:The successful completion of this research will result in the development of a prototype sensor system that provides accurate 3D tracking and modeling capabilities for accurately measuring AOI. This sensor concept will prove invaluable for developing, testing, and analyzing current and future military weapons systems in live fire scenarios against a wide array of targets and environments. Successful development of a video based sensor system would also provide a transition path to providing AOI in tests containing moving platforms, such as maritime test events, and to several commercial applications. The system leverages very mature and rapidly progressing COTS EO/IR video sensor technology, which benefits from a large user community and decreases cost of the overall system. Additionally, utilizing video sensor technologies extends the range of potential commercialization opportunities for the developed algorithms and sensor architecture.",

        "abstract": "Wildlife are a reservoir of diseases affecting both humans and domestic animals.  These wildlife reservoirs represent a potential threat to public health, serving as a continuous and difficult to eradicate source of infection for zoonotic diseases, but may also represent a significant economic threat to US agriculture.    In particular, wild ruminants including white-tail deer may harbor vector-borne infectious diseases that can directly impact US Cattle and Sheep operations.  Medgene Labs focuses on the development of novel subunit vaccine formulations to address these critical diseases that may affect both public health and US agricultural animals.  Subunit vaccines have the advantage of being highly stable and safe from potential reversion to virulence, supporting strong protective immune responses without the potential for contributing to new outbreaks through combination with wild-type agents. Furthermore, these strategies are ideally suited to the development of immune responses to effectively differentiate vaccinated from infected animals (DIVA approach).   Our current development efforts have defined highly efficacious, DIVA-compatible vaccine formulation directed against Rift Valley Fever Virus, and a focus of this proposal is to define an efficacious oral vaccine. This proposal will leverage the existing strength that Medgene Labs brings to the generation of highly effective and safe vaccine strategies directed against RVFV and other orbiviruses of national interest to define appropriate delivery systems for oral vaccination of wildlife.  Following initial characterization of these oral formulations in a well-established sheep model, we will proceed directly in Phase II to define efficacy in target domestic and wild cervid populations.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) sensors have the unique ability to identify objects based on the spectral signatures of their surface materials. Movements of designated targets could be detected using images collected hours to days after they move. Many targets of interest, such as vehicles, have specular (non-Lambertian) surfaces with multiple materials and surface angles. This complexity, combined with possible changing atmospheric/illumination conditions and viewing geometries, can cause the observed target spectral signatures to fluctuate considerably, making detection and/or reacquisition challenging. The goal of this R&amp;D by Spectral Sciences, Inc. and the Rochester Institute of Technology is to develop novel algorithms and software to extract, predict, and account for these signature variations and thus advance the state of the art in hyperspectral detection and identification. The software would incorporate reflectance and BRDF databases, a reflectance calculation module, and a detection module. In addition, Phase II will feature a new field data collect focused on validating the target BRDF modeling and detection algorithms. The Phase II software package will be embedded in a copy of the popular ENVI software package as a prelude to transitioning the software to a Phase III commercial product for the private sector, government agencies, and academia. BENEFIT:The software would bring enhanced performance to hyperspectral target detection and identification in military and homeland security applications, including border and perimeter surveillance, site monitoring, and search and rescue. Platforms include UAVs and spaceborne systems. Potential civilian remote sensing applications are in the areas of agriculture, mineral prospecting, land management, drug interdiction, disaster preparedness, and disaster damage assessment. Potential applications in medical hyperspectral imaging include detection of pathogens, biotoxins, and disease processes.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Since the first NAVSTAR GPS satellite was launched, GPS has become one of the most important technologies used by modern military and civilian systems. While the legacy GPS constellation continues to provide support for many military applications, there is growing demand to identify and implement systems to enhance the capability of the constellation by ensuring more robust GPS service especially in GPS-denied environments or in regions where service is inconsistent. The next generation of PNT satellite solutions must provide an auxiliary high-gain antenna function for military users in these contested environments. Deployment of this functionality requires demonstration of a space-relevant antenna system capable of providing a steerable high-gain regional military high-gain (RMHG) beam. FIRST RF has developed breakthrough element and feed-network technologies that are applicable to a variety of high-gain antenna topologies which can meet the future needs of this improved GPS function. During Phase II this effort, FIRST RF will optimize, fabricate, and test an electrically-steerable high-gain GPS antenna which will provide up to 14dB of additional gain in the regional beam. In this development, FIRST RF recognizes system integration is a primary challenge and will work with industry and SBIR partners to address integration concerns throughout the program. BENEFIT:The development of electrically steerable high-gain antenna apertures that support either distributed-amplifier or single-amplifier topologies will be an enabling technology for the realization of a regional military high-gain GPS function. The reduced-profile antenna demonstrated by FIRST RF has been shown to be an ideal element for various array topologies (including both direct-radiation and reflector-based architectures). FIRST RFs technologies allow for the array to be deployed from the side of the space vehicle after launch then support an electrically steered beam that can scan across the entire GPS field of view with no moving parts. The maturity of the technologies demonstrated in this proposed antenna system will reduce the risk associated with developing a new payload antenna and decrease the qualification time for the hardware. Furthermore, FIRST RFs technologies have demonstrated the ability to save size, weight, prime power, and cost relative to not only conventional GPS antenna systems, but also other approaches for next-generation applications.",

This approach centers on a framework for representing context, and for using context to enable robot adaptive decision-making and behavior. The framework is called CARIL (the Context-Augmented Robotic Interaction Layer).  Context is an important part of human-human interaction.  Unfortunately, context is often overlooked when designing robotic systems.  The challenge is to translate high-level concepts, such as teamwork and collaboration, into specific requirements that can be implemented within control algorithms, interface elements, and behaviors.  During Phase I, CHI Systems developed a proof-of-concept CARIL implementation and applied it to a notional simulated robot in a simple station model.

A key innovation in Alphacore's approach to the ADC design is that we have considered how the ADC will be used in a system;  a custom designed digital back-end implements digital data de-multiplexing and signal conditioning to allow seamless integration with commercially available, high-end, field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) that are the main building blocks of modern scientific spectrometers and interferometers. Alphacore's ADC provides these improvements at much lower power and lower cost than existing commercial ADCs that use off-chip components to provide these features.     Alphacore's design takes advantage of the latest low-power, high-speed digital CMOS processes, resulting in ADC power consumption that is less than 1/8 of the power consumption of competitor ADCs.    The proposed ADC employs an innovative topology with high-bandwidth front-end sampling circuit combined with an interpolated flash-type ADC and encoder circuitry that simplifies FPGA interfacing.   All the needed clock signals are generated from a low-cost 100MHz crystal clock reference  with a low-jitter (",

Tactical SATCOM, such as, AEHF, and GBS, require increasingly high capacity to support DoD's C4ISR requirements, while on the other hand, civilian applications require high capacity to support high definition multimedia broadcasting, and high-speed internet access. To support the increasing demand in capacity, SATCOM payloads must provide wideband transponders to allow SATCOM terminals to communicate over multiple beams and multiple bands with channelized fan-out multicast and fan-in aggregation capabilities. The proposed research focuses on the development of a low-cost wideband digital channelized receiver to reduce the SWaP and cost for future high-capacity SATCOM payloads.BENEFIT:This research will produce a prototype that will enable low SWaP and cost for SATCOM payloads, gateways, hubs, and terminals.",

Our modular aerospike engine is capable of achieving significantly higher nozzle area ratios than traditional bell nozzles, when designed to the same volume and weight limitations.  Most notably, the modular approach means that multiple combustion chambers are used, instead of a single large chamber.  This enables the use of an additive manufacturing approach, a proven method for significant reduction in cost.  The modular approach also greatly reduces development costs because a single small thruster module can be qualified without the need for full-up engine tests.  The modular design also simplifies engine throttling, should it be necessary, because individual thruster modules can be started and stopped on command, which avoids the complications associated with throttling fixed-orifice injectors.  Our Phase I project, together with internal R&D funds we have invested, clearly show significant range increases can be expected from adopting the aerospike engine.

As has been demonstrated by several NASA interplanetary missions, there is no replacement for in-situ observations, like spectral imaging, that prove critical for understanding the context of solar system bodies. There is, however, a conflict between more capability at the target and the desire for minimizing mission cost. Minimizing the mass and power of an instrument reduce the size, complexity and therefore the mission cost. To enable more capable missions without high cost we propose to develop a hyperspectral/multispectral imager designed for a microsatellite platform that will function in a reduced light environment while minimizing the mass and power consumption. This type of instrument is crucial to the study of small bodies such as near earth asteroids and for missions further afield by maximizing capability while minimizing the instrumental cost and complexity.

        "abstract": "Today's CubeSats lack storable, green, safe propulsion options for complex science missions that may involve large Delta-V changes, proximity operations, and attitude control systems (ACS) for pointing, spin-up, and spin-down. Digital Solid State Propulsion (DSSP) is developing propulsion for CubeSats and will leverage existing research efforts into a new system for NASA. A key technology identified in the phase I solicitation is a Cubesat propulsion system that will enable deep-space CubeSats, which operate outside of Earth's magnetic field, to desaturate reaction wheels. These types of missions cannot use the magnetorquers that are common on the Earth orbiting CubeSats that are popular today. DSSP proposes continued development of a multi-pulse solid rocket motor (MPM), which uses green, safe Electric Solid Propellants (ESPs).  This MPM for CubeSats will enable desaturation of reaction wheels on 6U and 12U interplanetary missions with lower mass systems than conventional cold gas based solutions. The baseline performance requirement for this application is estimated to be 0.3 N*sec of impulse per pulse of the thruster in a short time and with low power impact on the satellite. This value is determined from a reaction wheel that has a 30 mN*m*s maximum momentum and a maximum thruster moment arm of 10 cm. DSSP already has a CubeSat Agile Propulsion System (CAPS) at TRL8, a close relative of which deployed safely on SpinSat from the ISS in November 2014, and DSSP's experience at qualifying and delivering flight hardware for that program can be leveraged for NASA. The SpinSat mission has already demonstrated that ESPs are so insensitive to accidental ignition that they can be launched as soft stow cargo to the pressurized section of the ISS and that the new MPM for CubeSats could even potentially be brought aboard the ISS also for later deployment.",

The Phase I effort has resulted in a high Performance Computing enabled Distributed Game theoretic Sensor Management software Suite (HEADGT) for RSO detection, classification, and tracking. We obtained promising results which clearly demonstrate that IFTs HEADGT software suite provides innovative and effective game theoretic approach for sensor resource management with consideration of various operational constraints. The developed HEADGT integrates space object classification and tracking, heterogeneous sensor measurements fusion, maneuver detection, collision alert, sensor modeling, game theoretic modeling and solution, hardware implementation, and visualization system. In the phase II project, we will refine, extend, and optimize our Phase I system concept and models to meet the realistic requirements of the Air Force for RSO detection, classification and tracking. In addition, IFT team will 1), extend and tie all the models developed in Phase I using high performance computing enabled implementations, 2), enhance the hardware prototype, 3), enrich interfaces with other SSA testbeds such as Space Fence System.BENEFIT:The proposed HEADGTSM toolbox has tremendous application potential in many military applications. It can be used to defensive counter space mission to protect high value space assets, collision avoidance, detection, tracking, classification space objects. In addition, it is applicable to relevant Defense Acquisition Programs within DoD such as Space Fence System, SSN - space surveillance network, SBSS - the Space Based Space Surveillance system, SBIRS - Space-Based Infrared System program, WGS - Wideband Global SATCOM, JSARS - JSPOC Situational Awareness Response System, DCGS-X - Distributed Common Ground System program (Air Force), DCGS-N -Distributed Common Ground Station-Navy, DCGS-A - DCGS Army system. For some of these programs we already have support and know considerable program details. The market for military applications is quite large and IFT has successfully transitioned research prototypes for inclusion in DoD contractor research simulations. This technology could also benefit deep space exploration and other scientific research activities in space research and development. Other potential commercial applications include monitoring the civilian networks, such as finance, medicine, communications, electric power, nuclear energy, internet service provider, air traffic control, etc. In addition, police and first responders for NASA, US Coast Guard, Department of Homeland Security, multi-layered sensing, disaster assessment, the national weather service, physical security systems, law enforcement agency, emergency control center, border and coast patrol, pollution monitoring, remote sensing and global awareness could be a potential application.",

This technology addresses the Air Force need to mitigate canopy water pooling during various flight phases on the F-16 and other fighter platforms through the use of durable protective coatings with advanced water shedding capability. The inherent hydrophobicity of the coating provides superior shedding of water from the canopy surface during take-off and landing, under mist or rain conditions. Pilot visibility imparted by the canopy coating will ultimately increase, as well as human and asset safety, when critical flight missions must occur during inclement operational conditions.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:A key challenge toward future directed energy systems is the development of power and thermal management technologies needed to support the laser systems, particularly fiber lasers. I2C Solutions and the University of Colorado have developed a conformal Thermal Ground Plane (TGP) technology that interfaces hard to cool double clad fibers with laser thermal management systems. During Phase II, TGPs will be developed and qualified specifically for a to-be-selected fiber laser system and the Phase II program will culminate with a demonstration of the functioning laser system with the integrated fiber laser TGP by industry partner.BENEFIT:It is anticipated that the developments undertaken will enable an innovative, extremely efficient thermal transport device that can be integrated with a wide variety of products. Military applications range from ruggedize and shock hardened electronics, lightweight power distribution systems, and directed energy systems. Commercial applications that would benefit from this thermal management technology range from consumer electronics to LED illumination. Ultimately the improved thermal performance in a variety of systems leads to better reliability and longer lifetime at greatly reduced cost, weight, and size.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Solid State Scientific Corporation (SSSC) is pleased to propose this SBIR program to design and develop a compact, long focal length, real-time, multi-spectral imaging sensor prototype for enhanced intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance (ISR) from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The spectral bands in the proposed multi-spectral design are tuned to detect the anomalies from vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (IEDs) during the day. At night, the spectral bands will support low-light level and active imaging. The proposed multi-spectral sensor will have a long focal length, but yet be as compact as a one color broad band sensor. The resulting spectral imager will simultaneously image four application-specific color bands in the Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) band, and employ a 640x512 staring camera to capture one spectral data cube during each frame of the camera. The sensor will be equipped with the first ever real-time optical zoom capability for multi-spectral imaging over the range of approximately 30-100mm. The sensor will be designed for integration into an existing payload on a Program of Record platform.BENEFIT:The new sensor will be compact which will result in decreased SWaP requirements compared to current systems. The multi-spectral system will include zoom capability which is advantageous for UAV ISR CONOPS. The specific application for the proposed imaging sensor is ISR including vehicle-borne IED detection, anomaly detection, low-light level and active imaging. Other potential applications for defense purposes include imaging through fog and smoke as well as situational awareness. In addition, we anticipate possible applications in law enforcement, homeland defense, and wildlife management.",

To address this need, Valley Tech Systems (VTS) is developing a new lightweight, low power and long duration solid propellant gas supplied ACS thruster that provides continuous ACS thrust during non-divert periods.

        "abstract": "The Phase I was successful in delivering a complete prototype of the proposed innovation, an LED-based, solid state, large area, pulsed, solar simulator (ssLAPSS).  The prototype not only proved the initial concept but significantly reduced risk and dramatically increases our ability to deliver a fully functional ssLAPSS in Phase II.  The proposed innovation simulates AM0 response of single, dual, 3, 4, 5 and 6 junction solar cells by using an array of different wavelength LEDs in close proximity to the solar panel string under test.  The ssLAPSS is adjustable in spectrum for selected wavelengths and Class A, the highest standard, for spatial uniformity and temporal stability.  The ssLAPSS consists of LED modules that are repositioned in a mounting frame to test many strings on a panel in sequence.  The ssLAPSS also includes optical sensors so that all metrics can be calibrated and validated automatically.\n\nSolar simulation is critical for all solar cell testing, and current large area, pulsed solar simulators will not work for coming 4, 5 and 6 junction technologies.  Because the vast majority of NASA missions rely on solar cells, this is critical, enabling test technology for future solar cells.  While accurate solar simulation is critical to all solar cell missions, it is particularly important to missions requiring large amounts of power, such as solar electric propulsion (SEP) missions.  Beyond NASA's needs, other members of the aerospace community, including prime contractors, solar panel integrators and solar cell manufacturers have a critical need for this capability, which presents excellent commercialization opportunities after the Phase II maturation of the technology.",

The PV cells are mounted on flexible strups that, assembled, constitute array disk pie segments between straight ribs and smoothly wrap between the latter on the central hub for stowage.  The surface shears in stowage effected by this kinematics are absorbed by shear compliant hinge strips between the strips, and the PV cells are mounted on the latter ro precisely align in the roll.  Deployed, the surface segments between the ribs are pretensioned with catenaries on the outer perimeter, supported by the rib tips which extend outward.

        "abstract": "A catalytic post-processor is the last unit operation that reclaimed water typically sees before being consumed by the crew, therefore the entire sub-system must be safe, reliable and well-understood. The key innovation required to provide a sub-system for longer-term missions is to develop catalyst technologies that maintain a high degree of activity and physical stability over multi-year operational lives. The high catalytic activity of noble metals combined with the surface area and adsorptivity of activated carbon are the ideal combination of parameters for achieving the highest level of performance at the lowest penalty for a post-processing sub-system. The problem has been the physical breakdown of traditional activated carbon catalyst supports. To address this problem, the Phase I and previous intermittent research efforts have shown that noble metal catalysts supported on Porous Solid Carbon, exhibit superior physical properties to alumina, ceramic and granular activated carbon-supported catalysts currently used by NASA and throughout the chemical process industries. The Porous Solid Carbon-based catalysts are proposed due to their remarkable hardness and physical stability combined with their high surface area and surface activity. Phase I continued the successful demonstration and scale-up of the technology, demonstrating that the reactors can be manufactured with high surface area and porosity and good internal consistency, as well as demonstrating that the catalytic activity is extremely high under very mild conditions. The Porous Solid carbon reactor scale-up will be completed in Phase II to International Space Station-sized reactors that will be fabricated, tested and characterized using advanced analytical methods that will yield a fully quailifiable protocol for manufacturing the reactors for Phase III flight implementation.",

Together, these technologies will boost ion thruster performance and life beyond current art.  Reservoir cathodes have demonstrated, in microwave tube environments, lifetimes beyond 100,000 hours with no drop in output.  Scandate impregnated cathodes have demonstrated emission beyond 10 amps/cm2 at 800 degrees Cb(W) and emission levels over 100 amps/cm2 at under 1000 degrees Cb(W).  This is over 200 degrees below comparable all-tungsten impregnated cathodes, the cathode normally used for space propulsion.  High temperature is the great enemy of long cathode life.  Longer-life cathodes are needed for interplanetary and lunar missions, as well as earth-escape and near-earth maneuvers.  In Phase II, we shall continue developing the hybrid scandate reservoir cathode and perfect our stand-alone scandium-doped tungsten cathodes.  We shall continue to improve our hollow reservoir technology.  Then we will combine the two technologies into an integrated module.",

        "abstract": "Laser communications (Lasercom) technology offers the promise of much higher rate data exchanges while reducing the size and weight of the telecommunications package for deep space missions. This improved system performance is due primarily to the narrow transmit signal beamwidth at the optical wavelength, which allows for more efficient delivery of the transmit signal to the receiver.  The problem of pointing a laser signal can in general be decomposed into the problems of (i) stabilizing the optical line of sight and (ii) providing the appropriate pointing reference to the receiver location.  Optical Physics Company (OPC) has adapted the precision interferometric star tracker it is currently developing under several DoD contracts for deep space lasercom beam pointing applications.   The OPC interferometric star tracker can also be used to provide precise attitude measurements to the spacecraft for navigation and orbit determination purposes.  The current concept for the beam pointing is for a star tracker to be mounted opposite to the downlink beam boresight.  This configuration has the advantage that, for outer planet missions, the sun will almost always be away from the tracker, thus allowing the tracker to have a direct view of the sky.",

Due to communications latency, control algorithms for future autonomous space power systems need to be very robust, highly reliable and fault tolerant.\n\nModeling of load flows is vital both to design spacecraft power systems and to operate them autonomously. A key element is state estimation&#151;given the available sensors and their readings, what is the real state of the system? What action is required to maintain operation? State estimation is especially important when the system is in an off-nominal condition. Human operators draw upon experience to integrate off-nominal sensor readings and develop a gestalt of system state, but autonomous operation requires computation.\n\nCurrent modeling techniques (i.e., Newton-Raphson (NR) optimization) are not equal to this task due to their iterative nature and initial point dependency. Many off-nominal cases cannot be solved at all using NR. Worse, even more off-nominal cases appear to be solvable using NR, but the solutions are actually invalid. An NR-based autonomous control system faced with off-nominal conditions will reach an incorrect conclusion more often than not, with potentially catastrophic consequences for the spacecraft.\n\nBy contrast, HELM&#153; provides deterministic solutions for off-nominal states, without dependence on initial solution seeds, thereby providing the level of fidelity and surety needed to develop an autonomous system.

The system can be used for both flight test andin ground test facilities.  The proposed system uses a very robust and proven sensor technology combined with a novel mounting and manufacturing technique.  The sensor array is reusable and requires no calibration, external power source or acquisition system. The system combines an array of small, surface flush, sensors embedded in an extremely thin, flexible polyimide strip coupled with a self-contained, battery powered acquisition, reduction, and storage system.  The system operates by sensing changes in local heat transfer within the boundary-layer.  Variations in heat transfer due to the state of the boundary layer (laminar, transitional, turbulent, separated regions) produce changes in the sensor output.  Other flowfield features where heat transfer is affected will also be discernable, such as shock waves.  The flush mounted sensors, embedded in a smooth, thin polyimide sheet, conform to the local surface contour and produce minimal aerodynamic interference, allowing non-intrusive measurements.  The system will be quantitatively accurate across the low-speed through supersonic flow regime.  No external power or control is required for operation.  After testing, the system can be quickly removed and reused.  Compared to current systems designed for similar measurements, the proposed system promises to provide a significantly more robust and efficient system in a relatively simple, cost effective package.",

        "abstract": "High-value bearings are a critical part of the safety, reliability, cost and performance of modern aircraft. A typical passenger jet will have 100 to 175 high-valve bearings costing from $2,500 to $50,000 each for a total aircraft cost of $300,000 to $600,000.  All gas turbine engine bearings are inspected at overhaul and typically 30-40% of there are rejected. For each engine overhaul, bearing replacement costs on average $100,000.  Any process that increases bearing performance and reliability will have a commensurate effect on aircraft safety, reliability, performance and operating cost. In Phase I, Ormond demonstrated a novel surface enhancement process, cavitation peening, imparting deep, high magnitude residual stresses that are predicted to significantly enhance bearing life, reliability and performance.  Preliminary fatigue results generated in Phase I look promising and analytical results indicate a fatigue life improvement of over 100% may be possible. Cavitation peening uses ultra-high pressure water jets to generate intense clouds of cavitation bubbles that collapse on the work piece generating shock waves that cold work the material. No particles are use, the process produces no waste and adds no weight to the part and is very inexpensive. The new technology is currently being evaluated by Boeing, Sikorsky, Bell and Rolls-Royce for aerospace applications and is proving particularly effective for gears. The company is also working with major bearing manufacturers Timken and SKF to investigate the value of the technology for bearing applications. The proposed Phase II work would refine the process, address readiness level issues and generate the fatigue data that is critical to wide spread acceptance of the cavitation peening technology.",

Specifically, we propose to develop a 20 W power amplifier with an associated PAE of 60% operating over the 31.5 to 34 GHz band. This will be accomplished by employing two major innovations. First, we plan to utilize wide bandgap Gallium Nitride (GaN) on Silicon Carbide (SiC) device technology to fabricate our high-efficiency MMICs. Operating at a higher voltage (typically 20-28 V versus 4-5 V for GaAs), GaN permits power densities which are 5-10 times higher than GaAs or InP. In addition to a higher power density, high-voltage operation results in lower matching and cell combining losses, making these MMICs more efficient. Secondly, we are proposing to utilize a switching mode of operation (Class-F) to enhance the device efficiency. While this method has demonstrated PAE levels of >80% at 2 GHz, these levels have not yet been realized at Ka-band frequencies. Computer simulations, contained in this proposal, indicate that by using this method, device PAE levels ranging up to 73% are possible at 32 GHz. Furthermore, this was verified by benchmark data from at least one GaN foundry showing a device, operating in Class-F, with a PAE of 80% at 3 GHz. Finally, simulations at Ka-band frequencies indicate that even with circuit losses, we can still maintain the efficiency (PAE) at or very close to 60%. The layout and performance of a multistage MMIC is included in this proposal, together with the overall SSPA configuration and performance.",

For space-based instruments whose geometries are constrained by the launch vehicle, increasing the aperture requires deployment of some aspect of the optical train and then the precise and dynamically stable latching of the deployed components into defined positions. Existing latching technology is either too inaccurate, unstable, or expensive for use in many NASA small satellite missions.\nPhysical Sciences Inc. (PSI) has developed a simple, scalable latching technology by applying precision engineering approaches from previous developments that carefully manages the friction and strain energy stored internal to the latching mechanism. This latch was shown to have better than 350 nm repeatability and stability. During the Phase I activities, PSI has also shown that an alternative locking flexure approach could meet the needs of certain deployable optics applications. Both approaches provide a small, low-cost latching system with sub-micron positional repeatability and dynamic stability.\nDuring the Phase II efforts, PSI will further explore the performance of the mechanism and flexure approaches and then down-select to one approach for complete development. PSI will integrate the precision deployment lock into a complete set of flexures and mechanisms to provide NASA and other customers with a complete deployment system for a 6U cubesat. In addition to the precision latching components, the team will also address launch restraint, deployment actuation & rate control, and the associated deployment of the sun shade and light baffles that are critical to the operation of any high performance optical spacecraft instrument.\nThe results of the Phase II will be an integrated system that will provide all of the deployable aspects needed for NASA and others to launch, deploy, and operate high performance optical instruments from cubesats, ESPA-sats, and other small spacecraft platforms.",

By developing laser-directed CVD technology for refractory metals, Ultramet will bring these inherent benefits to a class of materials that are notoriously difficult to form and thus are expensive to implement. By depositing successive layers of metal directly from reactive precursor gases, the system will be able to build components from rhenium, tungsten, tantalum, niobium, and their alloys with complex internal features and reduced assembly part count.

Our Airborne MUlti-Gas Sensor (AMUGS) technology is based upon two-tone frequency-modulated spectroscopy (TT-FMS). TT-FMS retains the advantages of near-infrared diode lasers while pushing detection sensitivity more than two orders of magnitude closer to the theoretical limit. Phase I results demonstrated that lightweight, low-power near-infrared systems can deliver sensitivity competitive with mid-infrared gas analyzers. This factor is important for UAV deployment because near-infrared systems that use fiber optic telecommunications components are robust, versatile, and cost-effective. AMUGS uses an open path optical cell that is lighter and more robust than instruments based on cavity-enhanced spectroscopy methods. In, Sensitivity demonstrated in Phase I was a factor of 5-10x better than its nearest competing techniques. Benchtop TT-FMS delivered sensitivities at 10 Hz of 5 ppm for CO2 and 12 ppb for CH4. Precision improved to 1.5 ppm for CO2 and 3.3 ppb for CH4 with 1 sec of signal averaging. The Phase II target is to design and build a flight-ready TT-FMS prototype that maintains or exceeds this benchtop detection precision. The AMUGS prototype will meet 5 kg and 50 W targets and will be flown on an all-electric model aircraft at the University of Texas at Dallas. This airborne testing will provide critical information that will help further development and commercialization of the AMUGS technology.",

        "abstract": "A significant technology gap for NASA astrobiology missions is the field detection of organics at the sub ppm level.  Currently, NASA uses different sensing technologies such as Pyrolysis&#150;GCMS to analyze planetary samples. These instruments require complex sample handling and can process only a limited number of samples.  It is critical to develop an effective instrument with extended and enhanced capabilities to enable future planetary multiple-mission needs. We propose to develop a novel nonlinear Raman spectral sensing instrument for trace organic detection at the sub ppm level based on fluoresence-free surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).  The proposed instrument will be capable of detecting the molecular signatures in Martian samples in the field with significantly improved sensitivity (>100,000,000) and reduced noise (>100).  It will offer NASA a ultra sensitive deployable instrument suitable for robotic missions in terms of in situ measurements, resolution, bandwidth, compact size, low cost, and ruggedness.  The detection of organics at the sub ppm level in Martian-like soils will be applicable to several future NASA missions, in particular future rovers for the upcoming Mars 2020 mission.   These mobile, fast and agile rovers are focused on collection for sample return and require non-sampling analytical instruments.",

        "abstract": "Ultramet and ARA Ablatives Laboratory previously developed and demonstrated foam-reinforced carbon/phenolic ablators that offer substantially increased high heat flux performance and reduced weight relative to conventional ablators. The structure consisted of an ablator-filled foam front surface backed by Ultramet's highly insulating aerogel-filled foam. Arcjet testing was performed at NASA ARC to heat flux levels exceeding 1000 W/cm2, with the results showing a significantly reduced ablation rate compared to conventional chopped fiber ablators, and ablation behavior comparable to FM5055 at just one-third the density. In 2008, NASA ARC contracted ARA to develop a new heat shield design involving integration of fully cured mid-density ablator blocks within a structural honeycomb reinforcement. The block ablator-in-honeycomb heat shield is envisioned to provide high atmospheric entry reliability due to the structural attachment integrity provided by the honeycomb lattice in the ablative material layer. In Phase I, the Ultramet-ARA team demonstrated the initial feasibility of using ablator/aerogel-filled foam within honeycomb cells through fabrication of a 16-cell panel in which foam blocks were literally pressed to shape using a die and then snug-fit into carbon/phenolic honeycomb cells. The 16-cell panel was infiltrated with ablator to a controlled depth on the front face, which simultaneously bonded the foam blocks to the honeycomb, and the remaining foam void space on the back face was filled with aerogel. In Phase II, block ablator-in-honeycomb structures will be optimized through flat and curved panel fabrication, properties testing, and high heat flux testing at NASA ARC and the Air Force LHMEL facility. This effort will leverage a current Ultramet project for NASA ARC focusing on optimization of ablator-filled foam compositions for use in the 1000-8000 W/cm2 heat flux range, which could ultimately be used in the block ablator-in-honeycomb architecture.",

        "abstract": "NASA's Air Traffic Management (ATM) research has produced many important, advanced decision support tools (DSTs) over the past three decades. A key challenge in the design and use of ATM DSTs is to determine how much control should be applied to the flow of traffic and at what point in the flow the control should be applied. This question can be addressed both during the initial operational ATM planning process, as well as during dynamic operations re-planning. This challenge has significant impact on the resulting effectiveness of any ATM control program that is applied, because inefficiencies can be caused by either under or over-control of the flow. Unfortunately, comprehensive DSTs don't exist for many ATM decisions that must be made, and most DSTs that do exist do not provide any guidance regarding when the control should be applied, nor do they quantify the potential risk associated with the timing of control application. An integrated decision support capability is needed to provide ATM specialists and flight operators with information to support planning and decision-making about tactical and strategic TMIs. The significant challenge that exists in providing this decision support capability is the uncertainty of prediction of both demand and capacity.\nThe work that has been conducted in this Phase I SBIR effort, and that is proposed for continuation in Phase II, addresses this fundamental research need in ATM automation system design in the context of the integration of Tactical Departure Scheduling (TDS) with Traffic Flow Management (TFM). During Phase I, we designed, tested and conducted initial validation on mathematical and simulation models that characterize and quantify the relationship between IADS capabilities and other TMIs. These models provide guidance and input for further NASA research efforts and activities, and they will also provide real-time operational decision support for Traffic Management Coordinators (TMCs) and other ATC specialists.",

        "abstract": "Aircraft Loss-Of-Control (LOC) has been a longstanding contributor to fatal aviation accidents.  Inappropriate pilot action for healthy aircraft, control failures, and vehicle impairment are frequent contributors to LOC accidents. These accidents could be reduced if an on-board system was available to immediately guide the pilot to a safe flight condition (including cases of control failure or vehicle impairment). Barron Associates previously developed and demonstrated (in pilot-in-the-loop simulations) a system for finding appropriate control input sequences for upset recovery, and for cueing pilots to follow these sequences.\nThe proposed work adds several innovative capabilities to the existing architecture and includes flight test verification of the efficacy.  One of the most significant current enhancements is the addition of adaptation to address off-nominal vehicle responses.  Off-nominal vehicle responses can occur for a number of reasons including adverse onboard conditions (e.g., actuator failures, engine failures, or airframe damage) and external hazards, especially icing.  The addition of adaptation capabilities enables the system to provide appropriate upset recovery guidance in cases of off-nominal vehicle response. The recovery guidance system is also specifically designed to be robust to variations in pilot dynamic behavior as well as to provide robustness to pilot deviations from the recommended recovery strategies.",

        "abstract": "Both vehicle automation systems and human pilots rely heavily on sensor feedback to safely control aircraft. The loss of reliable information for even a single state feedback signal can initiate a chain of events that leads to an accident. On small aircraft, hardware redundancy is often impractical and the failure of a single physical sensor could be the triggering event that leads to an accident. On commercial transport aircraft sensor hardware redundancy is common, but the potential for common-mode failures means sensor failures are still an important consideration.  In many cases, there is adequate information available to accurately estimate the true value of a parameter even if the sensor or sensors that directly measure the parameter have failed.  In the best case, a human pilot can exploit the available information to successfully fly the vehicle after a sensor failure, but it is a high workload task.  In many cases, lack of situational awareness and poor manual piloting skills create a situation in which the human pilot cannot safely handle the failure.  Similarly, many automation systems are unable to safely cope with failures.  The proposed research will build on the successful phase one proof-of-concept demonstration to develop a virtual sensor redundancy system that identifies and isolates faulted sensors, and fuses information from healthy sensors and vehicle dynamics models (including arbitrary nonlinear models) to estimate correct outputs for faulted sensors.  The research will also develop the Virtual Sensor Toolkit, a software tool that supports the entire lifecycle of virtual sensor development and deployment from requirements development to testing and design updates.

        "abstract": "Efficient nuclear-thermal propulsion (NTP) requires heating a low molecular weight gas, typically hydrogen, to high temperature and expelling it through a nozzle. The higher the temperature and pressure, the higher the thrust and specific impulse. For ground test facilities that will be heating the gas to temperatures up to 4400F (2425C), the number of materials that can be used is severely limited. The need for compatibility with hot hydrogen limits the field even further. In Phase I, Ultramet designed, fabricated, and tested a system for heating high-pressure hydrogen to temperatures approaching 2400C. The system included a foam-based heating element, an insulation package, and a carefully designed multiwalled pressure vessel that could contain the hot gas at pressures up to 2000 psig. The Phase I effort demonstrated the suitability of the selected materials and the overall design approach. Phase II will focus on scaling up the system, fabricating and testing hardware, and laying out a clear path to a system that can deliver hot hydrogen at flow rates up to 40 lbm/sec (the highest flow rate currently of interest to NASA) at pressures up to 2000 psig. The overall system will be composed of multiple modules, and each module will be comprised of multiple heating elements. Because the design is modular, flows higher than 40 lbm/sec can be achieved. The modular design also minimizes programmatic risk because it will allow the use of materials at higher technology readiness levels and subsystems that do not have to be scaled up.",

This can result in significant propellant savings on space vehicles, allowing the overall mass to shrink for launch on a less expensive vehicle or to allow the space vehicle to carry more payload at the same weight.  Many of the electrical propulsion systems operate in pulse mode, pulsing hundreds or even thousands of times per second.  Creating reliable valves that can operate in pulse mode for extremely long life and at low power are critical in these applications.\nIn Phase 1 of this effort, WASK Engineering demonstrated the suitability using a piezo actuated valve to meet the requirements of electric thrusters. Valves actuated with piezo crystals offer the benefits of 1) a demonstrated ability to operate at frequencies from 0 Hz to over 1,000 Hz, 2) the ability to throttle continuously from 0-100% open, 3) extremely fast response, 4) low power usage, 5) opening the valve with infinitely variable operating waveforms, sine wave, square wave, saw tooth, custom wave form, etc., 6) no EMI generated, and 7) a very low part count for reliability",

        "abstract": "The NASA's PATH mission employs GeoSTAR spectral radiometer processing data from antenna consisting of three arms, each holding 128 microwave receivers. Each of the 384 receivers amplifies RF signals, and down-converts them to an intermediate frequency (IF). As a result, 768 in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) signals are produced with a frequency of 10 to 500MHz. The IF signals have to be normalized and digitized with 1Gs/s sampling rate for further cross-correlation. Each signal from one arm of the receiver must be cross-correlated with all signals from the other two arms, therefore a system containing 196,000 parallel cross-correlation blocks is needed. Since the GeoSTAR is a space born instrument, low power dissipation and ensuring system reliability, through processing redundancy, are one of the most important requirements. A system assembled by using off-the-shelf components would be extremely power inefficient, bulky, and unreliable. Therefore, a system that is based on application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) is required. While working on the NASA's SBIR Phase II project \"Low Power Cross-Correlator ASIC\" (NNX13CP01C), Pacific Microchip Corp. has developed and fabricated  an ASIC that includes 128-element array of 2-bit 1GS/s ADCs, and 4096 parallel cross-correlation cells. The ASIC was designed based on the GeoSTAR radiometer requirements, therefore it is intended to be the key component in the cross-correlator system which is being developed. The system will contain means correlation results further post-processing and control of ASICs.",

In order to achieve this goal, the ALCs perform aircraft scheduled maintenance using well-defined planning and scheduling processes and procedures by assigning MRO tasks to minimize the time an aircraft spends at the depot and the associated maintenance costs. However, the current system does not allow for dynamic schedule re-planning that allows users to react to anomalous events or unscheduled maintenance requirements. Robbins-Gioia proposes to solve this problem by using advanced genetic algorithms to efficiently solve static and dynamic, large scale scheduling problems. With this innovative scheduling approach, we will improve that responsive and optimality of aircraft maintenance schedules to meet both preemptive and nonpreemptive maintenance requirements.BENEFIT:Initial market analysis shows that a general Maintenance Management System that addresses complicated scheduling and planning requirements can have applicability across the federal, state, and private business sectors. Any type of transportation maintenance facility or complex manufacturing facility that requires resource scheduling and re-planning may be applicable commercial markets for the technology sponsored by this SBIR research.

Performance is enhanced since the SCA will have a higher signal to noise ratio due to the large effective well, longer integration times, and higher injection efficiency resulting from the use of a feedback enhanced direct injection (FEDI) circuit.  Cost is lowered by using SLS detectors with a higher performance DROIC that can tolerate high leakage current.

However due to the scale and complexity of typical re-entry vehicle structures, it is likely that multiple 3D woven panels would need to laid up to create the overall heat shield, creating potential weak spots at the panel joints. In Phase I T.E.A.M., Inc. addressed the joint issue by developing an innovative stitching process capable of forming mechanically reinforced joints between densely woven, 3D carbon fiber pre-forms up to 3\" thick. The Phase I scope included design, model and fabrication of multiple stitched joint specimens with anticipated strength / stiffness properties multiple times higher than baseline, un-stitched joints.

The unit uses ambient vehicle cabin air as the feed and delivers high purity oxygen while meeting NASA's requirements for high flow capacity, closed-loop tissue oxygen control and operation in microgravity/partial gravity.  TDA's VSA system uses a modified version of the lithium exchanged low silica X zeolite (Li-LSX), a state-of-the-art air separation sorbent extensively used in commercial Portable Oxygen Concentrators (POCs) to enhance the N2 adsorption capacity. In Phase I, we demonstrated the scientific, technical, and commercial feasibility of the oxygen concentrator module (OCM).

The OCM will be capable of self-regulating the oxygenation of the patient using a closed loop feedback system that senses tissue oxygenation level. We will evaluate the sorbent performance in a breadboard bench-scale prototype under simulated microgravity/partial gravity exploration atmospheres and carry out a 1,500 hr longevity test (at a minimum) to determine its mechanical durability.

        "abstract": "To continue the trend towards ever more efficient photovoltaic devices, next-generation multi-junction cells will be based on increasingly complex structures.  These structures will require the ability to join two or more independently grown epitaxial structures together via wafer bonding which is a complicated process to include in a high-volume manufacturing environment using conventional wafer fusion techniques.  Additionally, metamorphic material is very difficult to bond due to the inherent roughness of the surface.  We propose the development of a bonding process based on an epoxy interface with an embedded metallic grid to provide electrical conductivity across the bonded interface.  This process is expected to be low-cost, compatible with metamorphic material and high-volume manufacturing, and readily scalable to 6-inch or larger substrates.  It will be an enabling technology for next-generation, five- and six-junction solar cells with 1-sun AM0 efficiency exceeding 37% in high volume production.\n\nAn example device structure that can benefit from the proposed wafer bonding technique is a six-junction solar cell.  This six-junction device is composed of two triple-junction stacks, one of which is grown on a GaAs substrate while the other is grown on an InP substrate.  The two triple-junction stacks must be bonded together to form the final six-junction device.  The epoxy-bonding process proposed here will allow this bonding to be accomplished reliably on large-area substrates.  This is essential for turning this structure into a practical, manufacturable, commercial product.  When coupled with MicroLink Device's proprietary epitaxial lift-off (ELO) technology which allows for reuse of both the GaAs and InP substrates, devices based on this six-junction architecture could potentially be manufactured for less than $170/W in sufficient volume to serve near-term applications.  This structure is expected to yield 40% efficiency under AM0 illumination.",

The Air Force and major air framers have long sought after a suitable tool for use in production and at maintenance depots. IERUS Technologies, in partnership with Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, proposes to mature the probe developed during Phase 1 of this program and demonstrate its successful application to a wide variety of gap filler materials installed in gaps on both flat and curved surfaces.  IERUS will also utilize its close partnership with Lockheed Martin to perform on-platform testing of gaps for the F-22 and F-35.  The probe will be capable of outputting results in terms of both effective surface conductivity and 1D radar cross section (RCS).  The latter will help engineers better understand the nature of gap material failures and better ascertain when gap fillers need to be replaced.  IERUS will deliver two hand-held ruggedized probe systems ready for field use at the end of this program.  BENEFIT:  The probe developed under this SBIR program will provide the Air Force with a highly accurate and reliable point inspection tool for gaps and canopies on current fighters and bombers.  The probe will function well on curved surfaces, which is a significant problem with current point inspection tools.  IERUS will adapt the probe for use in composites inspection as well as defect detection under visually obscured surfaces such as painted metals.  Several other measurement products are planned as a result of these developments.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in significantly lowering the cost of high precision glass molding through a low-cost carbide-bonded graphene coating. In optical industry, optical glasses have been the de facto choice. These lenses are used in cameras, projection systems and military equipment. However, cost and other considerations frequently lead to the choice of injection molded plastic lenses with their acceptable but lower image quality. The innovative carbide-bonded graphene coatings are both low cost and durable, and could allow use of precision optical glasses in places where plastic products are used today. The coatings also have the potential to spread to other markets such as advanced thermal management, next generation electronic components, and biosensors based on the unique combination of excellent mechanical, physical, optical transparency and biocompatibility properties together with tunable optoelectronic characteristics. Such products may greatly improve our daily lives in areas such as portable electronics and optics, energy saving and green manufacturing. This project will further advance the chemically vapor deposited carbide-bonded graphene coating process demonstrated during Phase I that involved using silicon wafers with micro/nano-patterning. With the help of our industrial partners we now intend to scale the technology to the commercial level. The process development is targeted to developing low-cost and mass-producible high precision glass molding, micro-optics, and NIR aspheric optics for cell phones and high performance laser collimators. These activities would also enhance our understanding of carbide-bonded graphene coating technology.",

In addition to the new modules and architecture built by Illinois Rocstar, we have identified a number of available tools that fit well with our vision of the final ICED product. Open-source tools from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory CAEBAT project and proprietary, but government-funded tools from the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) will be modularized and brought into the ICED system, ensuring that the Phase II value we bring to NASA is focused on developing new capabilities such as predictive tortuosity modeling, while assembling a tool that contains the most advanced battery modeling capabilities available.    Advanced science and modeling tools are rarely accepted by industry without (i) support behind them and (ii) ease of installation and use. Thus, we are focusing on bringing scientific software to industry in forms where commercial-quality, easily installed, and graphically-interfaced tools are needed by those who have no interest in developing software, and providing open-source source code to those that want it. We focus on generating predictive, advanced scientific tools to bear on problems of national interest. We bring a commercially-supported environment to the table for them, which is a service that the national laboratories cannot provide themselves. In the end, we will produce a significant advance in areas of battery modeling, while integrating multiple tools across other sources using our open-source Illinois Rocstar Multiphysics Application Coupling Toolkit (IMPACT). Our business model for providing this software to industry, government, and academia is significantly different than how most larger simulation software companies operate, and we believe has a significant value proposition to all parties that can benefit from advanced battery modeling and simulation.",

        "abstract": "We propose to demonstrate the portable source of lattice-trapped, ultracold strontium (PLUS) designed during Phase I. The device uses simplified and robust techniques for loading the traps, and directly leverages hardware already developed by AOSense. The simplified architecture for PLUS makes it amenable to future space qualification. When paired with a sufficiently stable local oscillator, PLUS can be operated as an optical lattice clock. Alternatively, the lattice-trapped atoms could serve as a starting point for producing quantum degenerate Sr gases for use in future sensor technologies or fundamental science studies. In the latter case, possibilities span explorations of artificial gauge fields to quantum information processing. A space-qualified standard with the expected PLUS-levels of performance could revolutionize deep-space navigation by allowing spacecraft to autonomously calculate their own timing and navigation solutions rather than relying on two-way links to Earth. Similar performance levels could enable an entirely new class of sensors capable of sensitive gravitational wave detection with single baseline optical interferometers. Significant technical risk has been removed from the Phase I design by heavily leveraging hardware and strategies already developed by AOSense on other programs and conducting Phase I technology validation for the new, PLUS-specific hardware. We will continue to incorporate new developments from related AOSense programs as appropriate to further reduce technical risk or improve device performance. The primary Phase II objectives are the construction, integration, and validation of the PLUS physics package and controller and the preparation of PLUS for integration with a cavity-stabilized clock laser.",

The majority of the analysis tools that exist today, however, do not harness the capability to analyze these unique systems, especially in the rotorcraft realm. The Phase I effort focused mainly on the development of the PANTHER tool in preparing it for modeling hybrid and all-electric rotorcraft. The tool was then exercised by modeling a handful of propulsion architectures. The goal of the proposed Phase II effort is to further improve upon the strengths of the PANTHER code that was developed, and then utilize this tool to further explore the hybrid-electric rotorcraft design space. Given the goals of the Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology Project (RVLT), the PANTHER tool must be further expanded to enable the sizing and performance analysis of unique rotorcraft configurations with propulsion system designs unseen in the vertical lift realm. The tool will be expanded with modules for fuel cells and flywheels along with improved engine modules, physics-based motor and drive models, and a new capability to model complete missions. The thermal management aspect will also be addressed with modules for radiators, cooling ducts, fluids, and pumps. With the capability of PANTHER vastly enhanced, numerous trade studies will then be conducted that attempt to explore a large portion of the rotorcraft trade space made possible by hybrid-electric propulsion systems. These trades will aim to answer many of the questions that have arisen in the community about hybrid-electric rotorcraft.

With a family of model interpretations, Marshal can compute the expectation that user procedures are correct and consistent. Marshal also computes diagnoses explaining which assumptions about the user's intended model lead to inconsistency.

        "abstract": "Infrared focal plane arrays (FPAs) based on Type-II strained layer superlattice (SLS) photodiodes have recently experienced significant advances. In Phase I we developed and delivered to NASA a 320x256 DUALBAND FPA integrated in a dewar cooler assembly (IDCA) that produces simultaneous and spatially-registered imagery in two spectral bands, namely, a fire channel in the 3-5 micron window and a thermal channel covering 8-12 microns. Such FPAs are known to be uniquely effective for detecting wildfires either locally from aircraft or globally from satellites in low earth orbit. The performance of SLS detectors now rivals that of mercury cadmium telluride but at a fraction of the cost. Their high quantum efficiency combined with the advantages of two-color imagery and data interpretation will permit the detection of wildfires with much reduced false alarm rates. The same devices will also enhance NASA's capabilities in a host of other satellite and airborne Earth-observing missions devoted to long-term global observations of the land surface, biosphere, atmosphere and oceans. They will also be instrumental in supporting future Space Science missions aimed at studying distant galaxies and discovering potentially habitable planets orbiting other stars. In Phase II we will expand dualband FPA format to 1280x1024 (12 micron pitch) and develop and deliver both a compact IDCA and camera so that NASA can field-test this promising new sensor technology for its wildfire-detection and other remote-sensing missions.",

The unit uses ambient vehicle cabin air as the feed and delivers high purity oxygen while meeting NASA's requirements for high flow capacity, closed-loop tissue oxygen control and operation in microgravity/partial gravity.  TDA's VSA system uses a modified version of the lithium exchanged low silica X zeolite (Li-LSX), a state-of-the-art air separation sorbent extensively used in commercial Portable Oxygen Concentrators (POCs) to enhance the N2 adsorption capacity.  \n\nIn Phase I, we demonstrated the scientific, technical, and commercial feasibility of the oxygen concentrator module (OCM).  In  Phase II, we will develop a higher fidelity prototype with an adjustable pressure output to produce 2-15 lpm of O2 at 50% to +90% purity from ambient cabin air.  The OCM will be capable of self-regulating the oxygenation of the patient using a closed loop feedback system that senses tissue oxygenation level. We will evaluate the sorbent performance in a breadboard bench-scale prototype under simulated microgravity/partial gravity exploration atmospheres and carry out a 1,500 hr longevity test (at a minimum) to determine its mechanical durability.  Based on the experimental results, we will design a prototype unit that will meet all of NASA's requirements (e.g., low power draw over the range of flows and oxygen levels, lightweight and volume), while delivering the desired oxygen flow and purity.",

SAW sensors are lightweight, passive (battery-less), simple, reliable, scalable, sensitive, do not disturb the operating environment, can be permanently placed on the critical components, allow quick and inexpensive acquisition of data to diagnose structure performance or failures, and transmit the relevant data to a remote data processing center wirelessly. A low cost software radio approach will be developed to overcome a strategic bottleneck in SAW sensor system development. In Phase I Albido demonstrated the proof-of-concept of the proposed sensor and the transmission capability in an adequate laboratory environment (TRL 3).

The presence of dry fibers throughout the layup before infusion allows improved breathing, removal of volatiles from prepreg, and improved compaction with only atmospheric pressure, mimicking the double vacuum debulk (DVD) process without the equipment. NONA resin is then introduced at ambient temperature to wet out all available contact surfaces and cure itself and the prepreg. The NONA epoxy resin uses its own chemical energy to propel itself through a complete cure with no external heat required. The baseline NONA resin provides good strength, chemical resistance, and thermal performance up to 350F. Pairing NONA resin with a compatible prepreg a cure of both systems is achieved at room temperature. Because the cure occurs at room temperature, the NONA resin locks in its shape near room temperature, thus allowing the use of low-cost tooling materials, typically avoided because of high CTE.",

With AFFMAD, FM engineers will be able systematically generate, analyze, and trade-off FM strategies at the system-level within a multi-discipline modeling framework. Focusing on the early design phases will reduce the technical, schedule, and cost risk of Science Mission Directorate (SMD) missions. A key innovation of the AFFMAD approach is to represent the FM models in a form that supports iteration over alternative FM strategies in order to optimize overall mission success. We accomplish this by building abstract FM cyber-physical models, annotating them with both FM characteristics and mission costs (e.g., Size, Weight, and Power (SWAP), latency, throughput), and using external tools to iteratively explore the state space of feasible FM strategies. At each iteration, AFFMAD collects performance and cost information about each alternative in the context of each mission phases as well as the entire mission.",

        "abstract": "Research is proposed to demonstrate the use of advanced manufacturing techniques to enable the affordable application of multi-functional thermal/environmental barrier coatings (T/EBCs) having enhanced resistance to high temperature combustion environments. T/EBCs are envisioned to protect the surface of Si-based ceramics against moisture-assisted, oxidation-induced ceramic recession. Current T/EBC systems have been demonstrated in long time exposures at ~2400 F substrate temperatures. However, their use at elevated temperatures (i.e., 2700 F substrate temperatures) is limited by the low temperature stability and high diffusion activity of current T/EBC materials. One approach to increase the temperature capability of these systems is the incorporation of multilayered T/EBC designs. In this effort, enhanced processing techniques will be employed to demonstrate the manufacture of robust T/EBC systems using a physical vapor deposition based processing approach which enables improved coating adhesion and advanced coating architectural, compositional, and microstructural control, as well as non-line-of-sight (NLOS) deposition. During this proposed Phase II effort, processing/property/performance relationships for the manufacture of the novel coating architectures will be determined. Optimized processing approaches will then be used to demonstrate the deposition of high temperature capable T/EBC systems coating onto components of interest to gas turbine engine manufacturers.",

        "abstract": "Some missiles employ a throttleable divert and altitude control system (TDACS) to maneuver the kill vehicle to the target.  Hot gas valve components in the TDACS must survive long burn times at high pressures and high temperatures.  Recently the team of Materials Research & Design (MR&D), Allcomp, and Southern Research Institute (SoRI) has developed a needled C/SiC composite that exhibits strengths that are equivalent to Novoltex (the present TDACS material) and less conductive than Novoltex.  The composite is fabricated with commercial needled brake preforms, a commercial pre-ceramic polymer, and a unique heat treatment cycle that maintains strength while reducing conductivity.  Aerojet tests of the new material (identified as 16A) resulted in five of six successful rocket motor firings.  The failure was due to a broken pintle that was traced back to poor Z fiber distribution in the commercial brake (Gen 4) preform.  The recently completed Phase I program addressed the composite failure by fabricating and characterizing C/SiC composites made with Allcomps recently developed, domestically available, needled carbon fiber preform (Gen 7).  The Phase I data showed 16A composites from Gen 7  preforms led to thermal conductivities, Z tensile strengths, and inplane flex strengths that were equal to or better than those from Gen 4 preforms.  Furthermore, C/SiC composites using improved Allcomp preforms (Gen 8) have performed very well in recent, more aggressive, Aerojet-funded rocket motor tests.  The objectives of the proposed Phase II are 1) to continue the development of 16A composites using the new Allcomp needled preforms (Gen 8 or 9), and 2) transition the composites to future TDACS hardware.  The low thermal conductivity and high strength of the 16A material translate directly into smaller valve hardware, more compact motors, and longer burn times.  The Phase II program will be performed by the team of MR&D, Allcomp, SoRI, and Aerojet.  MR&D will design and analyze hardware for ground test evaluation, Allcomp will fabricate the materials, SoRI will develop a property database to support the design, and Aerojet will guide the material development and perform rocket motor tests.

ARRVUE is a linear programming solution that employs multiple queuing methods to generate conflict-free timeframe and location solutions for ramp spot allocation.  TDKCs proposed Phase II efforts support the Air Force Systems Commands (AFSC) Complex of the Future (2014) vision for more efficient depot operations and supply chain enterprise.  This effort includes developing an overall design and approach for the integration of all existing and emerging re-planning and scheduling algorithms; specifying a standard set of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) that expands on those identified during Phase I to increase up-stream planning efficiency in Fleet Scheduling Systems (FSS) through scheduling adjustments; developing unique and effective role-based dashboards for Schedulers to support in vivo collaborative re-planning; and developing a robust decision support environment and technical re-planning framework that seamlessly integrates all the capabilities into an easy-to-use and easy-to-maintain, portable toolset.BENEFIT:The ARRVUE technology will become plug-ins for the TDKC Agile Work Environment (AWE) product line as options for existing AWE customers within the Air Force and other Services.  The AWE product with the ARRVUE plug-in library will be marketed to the other agencies and departments.  We anticipate commercial opportunities for ARRVUE technology within Phase II and plan to attend conferences, symposiums, and perform continued research to determine additional potential markets for a dedicated tool suite.  Examples of potential markets are aircraft manufacturers, aircraft maintenance industries, automotive maintenance and repair facilities, Navy and commercial shipping yards, railways, port authorities, or any enterprise requiring superior oversight of large asset management.",

Based upon our successful Phase I results, hese signals have the potential to be used for many forms of both metrology and process control. While many material properties might be studied by using this interaction, our initial focus is an investigation into beam and sensor characteristics for geometric analysis of the deposition. Signals derived from the electron beam-component interaction could offer spatially resolved dimensional information about the deposited material, as it is being deposited. This is important, as the ability to monitor a parameter during deposition creates the possibility of controlling that parameter during the deposition process. As a further refinement, the ability to collect and store a spatially resolved pass-by-pass map of the deposition path geometry may have value in on-the-fly adjustments to subsequent build passes. Such mapping would allow working with the layer-by-layer nature of the deposition process to fine tune the deposition geometry. Such spatially resolved, layer-by-layer deposition mapping could also be stored, giving a three dimensional mapping of the as-built deposition path geometry. This could prove valuable for component quality assurance.",

The fast time response and miniaturized system will provide a lightweight, low cost instrument for package for a wide range of deployments including aerostats (balloons and kites) to UAV such as Dragon Eye and SIERRA. \n\nChemical species mapping using UAVs enables model validation and attaining new data that complements and augments traditional aerial and satellite data.  However, there currently are limited options adapting commercial chemical sensors for detecting all species of interest at the levels required, and with fast response time.  Wet electrochemical cells, which provide accurate measurement for some species, are typically slow (30-60 sec), sensitive to pressure changes, and are a potential hazard from leakage.  Most commercial environmental carbon dioxide monitors are based on NDIR, with response time in the order of minutes.  Hydrocarbons are monitored by generic combustible gas sensors.  \n\nInstruments need to be low cost, compact and robust enough for incorporation in UAV systems, capable of surviving hard landings and sufficiently low cost that damage to the instrument and or loss of the UAV is not a major setback for the mission.  The proposed solid-state, microsensor technology is well suited for this application, because of the low production cost and robust packaging.

Silicon Germanium (SiGe) is a robust IC technology with superior electronic properties, resilience to harsh environments, and moderate cost of Si fabrication that can dramatically reduce mission size-weight-and-power and cost (SWaP-C).  IBM's 90-nm state-of-the-art 9HP SiGe BiCMOS platform delivers higher performance and lower power, and enables highly integrated (sub-) millimeter wave applications not possible with earlier SiGe nodes. It is therefore, a prime candidate for designing future mixed-signal/RF electronics for NASA. Currently, however, there are few wide-temperature/radiation data, models, and circuits in this platform. Advanced computational tools are essential to support design and assess performance of 9HP-based electronics.\nThis project aims to develop novel Radiation Hardened By Design (RHBD) analog/mixed-signal and RF ICs in the best-in-class 9HP technology. In Phase I, CFDRC and Georgia Tech investigated the electrical performance of 9HP SiGe HBTs across an ultra-wide temperature range. HBT-based circuits were examined for single-event transient (SET) response via irradiation testing and detailed mixed-mode simulations. RHBD techniques were identified for further evaluation. In Phase II, we will select representative 9HP-based circuits from high-frequency and general purpose (low-frequency analog/mixed-signal) applications, and perform electrical and radiation response characterization (DC and RF) across a wide temperature range, via testing and mixed-mode modeling. RHBD techniques will be implemented and verified via modeling, and promising designs will be fabricated, tested, and delivered to NASA. Technology scaling effects on extreme environment performance of SiGe HBTs/circuits across different generations (9HP vs. 8HP vs. 5AM) will be evaluated to support design/trade-off analyses",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:MIL-STD-1530C dictates how to maintain USAF aircraft through the Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP), which uses damage tolerant analysis (DTA) to set inspection intervals. While effective and safe, DTA can also be quite conservative, leading to excessive down-time for depot transit, tear-down, manual inspection, re-assembly, and return to fleet. In the interest of increasing fleet readiness, introducing condition-based maintenance (CBM) to strategic aircraft location could greatly promote asset availability. To deploy CBM, structural health monitoring (SHM) sensors are permanently integrated within aircraft to frequently/continuously indicate integrity of components, rather than relying on predictive models based on assumed loading profiles to dictate inspection intervals. While more complex SHM methodologies have been demonstrated with various levels of maturity, great benefit could be realized by extremely simple fuse-style sensors, which have the advantage of being easier to interpret data and potentially more straightforward to qualify according to MIL-HDBK-1823A. In its simplest embodiment, a fuse-style sensor is binary; a crack has grown or not grown. Generally, the more rungs introduced to the sensor, the more detail that can be provided about the crack. The proposed technology employs carbon nanotube (CNT) sensors, providing a continuum of crack gauge elements for determining crack length and orientation.BENEFIT:Once successfully demonstrated through a Phase II effort, there exists a broad commercial market for this SHM method. One of the key success factors for this technology is its versatility; the ability not only to be integrated into new applications, but to be retrofitted into an existing asset designs. The continuum crack gauge could be applied to composite or metallic structure, be used to find new damage, track existing damage growth, or be applied as part of a bonded repair to check effectiveness in crack arrest. Initial relevant markets would include DoD fixed-wing aircraft, but the technology could easily proliferate into any DoD asset, ranging from rotorcraft to ships and ground vehicles, to aid in condition based maintenance. Once demonstrated in defense applications, comparable commercial opportunities exist, particularly for aircraft and potentially buildings and civil infrastructure once the production cost has been driven low enough. MDC will work through strategic partners to license the technology for production and deployment.",

With the proliferation of UAVs there is need for noise data, both for ISR and non-military vehicles. Wind tunnel testing is common and much less expensive. The innovation is a novel in-flow microphone array combined with the start of the art Functional Beamforming algorithm that makes it practical to measure UAV noise in a non-acoustic wind tunnel. The proposal calls for further development of the measurement technique so that it can be commercialized as a service using the Kirsten Wind Tunnel at the University of Washington.",

This research addresses the fundamental difficulty of verifying the performance of autonomous systems that dynamically react to the environment.  In particular, this research program would develop novel methods for conducting non-parametric, closed-loop simulation testing of collision avoidance algorithms as well as other autonomous operations.  The technology generates a campaign of simulation experiments that automatically adapt to the algorithms in question. The purpose of this innovation is to expose potential vulnerabilities in UAS autonomy that are generated through the interaction of autonomous UAS algorithms with other agents such as an intruding aircraft operating under ``right of way rules\".  This work augments both the probabilistic open-loop testing methods, where agents do not react, and closed-loop testing where agent behavior is fixed a priori.",

        "abstract": "Thermal anemometry (a.k.a. hot-wire anemometry) has been a key experimental technique in fluid mechanics for many decades. Due to the small physical size and high frequency response of the sensors (resulting in excellent spatial and temporal resolution), the technique has been widely used for studies of turbulent flows. Even with the advent of nonintrusive techniques such as Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), hot wire anemometry is uniquely capable of extremely high frequency response and fine spatial resolution measurements. ViGYAN has demonstrated a fundamental change to the anemometer configuration, with two related aspects. First, the circuitry to power the sensor and establish its operating point is packaged immediately adjacent to the sensor, i.e. in the typical probe holder, removing the effect of the cable connecting the sensor to an external anemometer. Second, modern analog-digital conversion hardware has been employed to the maximum extent possible,  including directly driving the sensor. Data transmission is fully digital, immune to environmental variations or electrical noise. Based on these results, the Phase II work will deploy this \"Digital Bridge\" system using a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) device connected via fiber-optic cable the miniaturized \"probe holder\" electronics. The DSP will be controlled by a generic PC with software to control the system and acquire/store data. A production-ready version will be developed and delivered; facilities, expertise, and resources are available to fabricate and deliver production units at the conclusion of Phase II. Production designs for ruggedized units will also be done for use in wind tunnels that operate at higher dynamic pressures and extreme temperatures.",

This proposed innovation will lower the cost of space mirrors from their current state of the art of $6.4 M/m2 to less than $1.6 M/m2 while maintaining low weight, high stiffness and high performance for x-ray, neutron and UV/optical mirrors.  The basis of this approach relies upon Be-38Al (a lower cost beryllium) to create a substrate, the use of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) matching phosphorous containing electroless nickel plating (NiP) to establish an amorphous surface, and then single point diamond turning (SPDT) that surface to a precision optical figure out to the edge of the substrate.  Be-38Al provides a substrate material that can provide the same stiffness as beryllium because it is not limited by its fracture sensitivity like beryllium.  Electroless nickel applied to Be-38Al with the right phosphorous content can match the Be-38Al's CTE, and the use of diamond turning can readily produce optical surfaces that can be used as is or with final polishing.",

Additionally, a facemask prototype will be printed, and storage parameters will be determined.

Conventional CFAR detection processing has difficulty in heterogeneous clutter (i.e., maritime clutter) because the fixed data size windowing is not likely to be well matched to the spatial scales of the wave field over a wide range of sea states and is negatively impacted by the presence of sea spikes. The spikey non-Gaussian nature of heterogeneous clutter gives rise to significant spatially varying CFAR loss to maintain low false alarms that desensitize the radar in stressing clutter conditions. The Phase 1 effort utilized cliff top and airborne data to develop and test initial ACE-CFAR processing concepts at different scan rates and range resolutions. This field test data is both high scan rate and high range resolution, and reduced scan rates and resolutions are constructed through decimation and filtering, respectively. This data set is large and contains a large number of airborne cases that remain to be tested with ACE-CFAR processing in Phase 2.",

Liquid systems are the ideal candidate to fit this role because of higher performance than solids; however, they tend to be a significant safety risk due to toxicity, corrosiveness and shock sensitivity.  Monopropellants have reduced performance compared to bipropellant systems, but they have considerably less complexity and less system weight.  Two major drawback of currently fielded monopropellant systems are their propellant toxicity and the intricate, expensive catalyst packs which tends to degrade under the harsh combustion environments, affecting thruster performance and lifetime.  By advancing DSSPs innovative Green Electric Monopropellant (GEM), a high performance, lightweight, non-toxic, low hazard, liquid propellant system can be developed.  Since DSSPs propellants can be ignited by applied electrical power, simple inert electrodes can be substituted for the complex problematic catalyst pack.

The computational tool is designed to reduce costs by identifying critical and benign areas in the operational envelope and using the information to streamline testing. The proposed technology systematically merges modeling and simulation (M&S) and test and evaluation (T&E) to optimize the warfighters that are designed, produced, and tested by the U. S. military. The modeling technology will also reduce risk by providing reliable predictions to clear aircraft for successive test points prior to flight sorties. The proposed modeling technology is physics-based, leveraging the accuracy of high-fidelity models at a fraction of the computational expense. The software will be developed and tested with existing data from the X-53 Active Aeroelastic Wing (AAW) Flight Test Program. The program included a comprehensive set of flutter, loads, and handling qualities tests of a modified F-18A fighter aircraft, generating data that are representative of the types typically produced during military aircraft certification. Models will be calibrated in near real time in a series of tests that utilize flight data in the same chronological sequence that they became available during the flight tests.BENEFIT:The commercial product to be developed is flight test support software that enables near real-time predictions and model updating with flight data. The primary customers will be flight test facilities including the 412th Test Wing at Edwards Air Force Base. The tool will be configured for the full range of fixed-wing aircraft that undergo flight testing by the U. S. military. Applications include flutter, loads and handling qualities tests. Defense budget constraints require expanding mission roles in the existing military fleet with adaptable external store configurations and flight envelopes that require a continuing series of flight testing. The proposed software is designed to make this process safer, more reliable, and less expensive through more accurate and faster predictions during the course of each flight test, along with the ability to quickly adjust test plans based on systematic identification of the critical drivers of static and dynamic loading on the aircraft. Commercial opportunities for the software exist with military aircraft manufacturers including Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman. Non-military applications extend to commercial aircraft with a large potential commercial market. Other applications include loads testing on rotorcraft and launch vehicles.",

        "abstract": "There has been a renewed push across NASA centers and programs to make Systems Engineering & Integration (SE&I) processes more efficient and results-oriented than the current cumbersome and expensive cross-checking processes using text documents, and transition to a repeatable and a cost-effective process of Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). In parallel, Systems Health management (SHM), with its operational subset Fault Management (FM), has also been developing with rigorous model-based practices, but largely separate from the mainstream of Systems Engineering and Design activities in NASA and the DoD. The technical and knowledge gap between the SE&I and SHM processes results in significant inefficiencies during product design, verification and validation, and excessive operational maintenance costs, collectively yielding unacceptably high life cycle costs and failure rates. To address these challenged, QSI with Dr. Stephen Johnson, intends to develop tool neutral architecture, processes and interfaces for integration of model-based SE&I designed in SysML (Systems Modeling Language), with SHM modeling and analysis performed in TEAMS&#174; (Testability Engineering And Maintenance System). It is our intention to reduce the duplicative and disjoint effort by NASA's subject matter experts in the development of systems engineering and design models as well as systems health management/fault management models. The benefits realized through this effort are (a) Reduced systems engineering and fault management costs, combined with improved quality and traceability, as well as enhanced communication and coordination among stakeholders, (b) Improved quality of SE&I and SHM products by having inherent traceability across models and ability to catch defects in design and FM  earlier, and (c) Establishment of modeling recommendations for NASA community as it develops its MBSE approaches and models.",

        "abstract": "Hi-Z Technology has designed, built and tested a small thermoelectric module that is well suited to use the 1 watt radioisotope heater unit (RHU) as a heat source. The RHU is commonly used on space missions to keep electronics warm. Combining the Hi-Z module with the RHU allows the RHU to provide up to 40mW of electric power and 960mW of thermal power to heat instruments. The availability of this proposed radioisotope power supply (RPS) would broaden the range of missions that can be addressed by mission planners by enhancing the ability of space probes and experimental packages to operate in conditions that were previously not possible. The 20 year life expectancy, solid state nature and high reliability of the RPS make it an ideal solution for a wide range of missions including lunar, Martian and deep space missions. \nThe RPS technology is already proven having been used in applications exceeding ten years. The purpose of this proposal is to enhance the shock resistance of the RPS. Hi-Z's design can survive up to 2,000G's in its axial dimension and could easily survive launch. The proposed work will enable the RPS to survive shocks up to 10,000G's making it useful in a wider range of missions.\nThe objective of the overall 3-Phase program is to design, build, test and deliver a new RPS to NASA that uses a 1Wt RHU heat source. The technical objectives of the Phase II effort are as follows:\n1.\tSurvive a 10,000 G shock\n2.\tDeliver about 40mW of electrical power\n3.\tHave a life expectancy of about 20 years (30mW at EOL)",

        "abstract": "The innovation is a new Stretched Lens Array (SLA) with a thinner, lighter, more robust Fresnel lens (with thin glass or polymer superstrate or embedded aluminum mesh). The new lens enables a blanket-level specific power > 1,000 W/kg, including lenses, PV cell circuit (including cells, encapsulation, high-voltage insulation, and heavy radiation shielding), and waste heat rejection radiator. The new SLA array is cost-effective, with the most expensive array cost element, the IMM solar cell, contributing only $50/W to the array cost. The new lens is novel in configuration, enabling single-axis tracking for the array even in the presence of large beta angles (e.g., 50 degrees) between the array and the sun. For future high-power arrays (e.g., > 100 kW), including Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) missions, the new SLA will offer a unique combination of high efficiency (e.g., >35%), ultra-low mass, high-operating voltage (e.g., >300 V), and low cost. SLA technology is a direct descendant of the SCARLET array used to power NASA's Deep Space 1 SEP mission in 1998-2001. SLA recently completed a flight test on TacSat 4 in a very high radiation orbit, and the lessons learned from TacSat 4 led to the new SLA, the subject of this proposal. The new SLA is scalable to multi-hundred-kW array sizes using blanket deployment and support platforms such as DSS's Roll-Out Solar Array (ROSA). The new SLA will typically operate at 4X concentration, saving substantially on solar cell area, cost, radiation shielding mass, and dielectric isolation mass. The new SLA will enable the early use of state-of-the-art cells, such as inverted metamorphic (IMM) cells with 4 or 6 junctions, and will enhance the production capacity of cell vendors (e.g., 100 kW per year of 1 sun cells = 400 kW per year of 4X cells). The feasibility of the new SLA was firmly established in Phase I, and fully functional prototype hardware will be developed and tested by MOLLC, DSS, SolAero-Emcore, and CFE in Phase II.",

        "abstract": "The use of lithium (Li) metal as an anode material has emerged as one highly attractive option for achieving high specific energy due to lithium having the highest capacity (3876 mAh g-1) of all potential anode materials. However, the reliable use of these exceptionally high capacity anodes in a commercial cell has not been achieved due to safety and reliability concerns resulting from thermal runaway and short-circuit issues due to dendritic growth on the metal anode from lithium plating during charge-discharge cycles. Solid-state electrolytes (SSE) have been identified as one option to address this cell failure mode, but SSE technologies must be developed that combine high conductivity and mechanical properties conducive to smooth Li plating with feasible manufacturing processes. Also, the Li anode must be combined with an ultra-high capacity cathode in order to reach NASA's aggressive cell-level energy goals. To address this need, Solid Power proposes to utilize a Li-metal-compatible solid-state battery design to far exceed the specific energies achieved by state-of-the-art (SOTA) Li-ion batteries in a format that also provides for intrinsic safety and abuse tolerance. Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of surpassing 600 Wh/kg and 1000 Wh/L at the cell level which will give a 3-5X improvement over the best battery technologies planned for NASA missions today.",

However, to fully realize the platform's potential, propulsion capability is required. For low-cost spacecraft developers, this capability remains among the most resource intensive to successfully implement. Planetary Resources Development Corporation (PRDC) proposes to significantly reduce required resources by seamlessly integrating propulsion with another critical resource-intensive subsystem: the spacecraft's primary structure. PRDC will integrate high-reliability COTS components from the medical consumer products industries into an additively-manufactured two-module primary structural element that includes integrated tank, plenum, and manifold geometries for a hybrid green monopropellant / cold-gas propulsion implementation, as well as the spacecraft's launch interface. The resulting system, called the Integrated Propulsion and Primary Structure Module (IPPSM), provides a standard interface, serving as the strongback for simple integration of other Cubesat subsystems and payloads within the 6U and 12U size regimes. During Phase II, PRDC will continue the IPPSM development initiated during Phase I, culminating in the fabrication, assembly, performance evaluation, and environmental test of a full-scale 12U IPPSM prototype with integrated RCS and high-thrust, high delta-V capability. It is expected that the completion of the above work will result in a technical maturation to TRL-6 by the end of Phase II, ready for flight demonstration.",

In Phase 1, both equation-based and data-driven PV ROM technologies were developed and proof-of-principle was successfully demonstrated. A set of carefully selected ROM algorithms and model coupling schemes were developed in an integrated architecture to generate PV ASE ROMs. Critical evidence was established in NASA relevant case studies that ROMs enable unprecedented speedup and accuracy for aircraft ASE analysis. PV ASE ROMs for X-56A MUTT models in the current mission were developed, which demonstrated >10X reduction in the number of states and precise capture of vehicle dynamics at various flight conditions. In Phase 2, software will be expanded and refined for enhanced performance and functionality. ROM algorithms will be optimized in terms of efficiency for MIMO systems, consistent state representation, PV capabilities in a broad flight envelope. PV structural ROM will also be developed to consider changes in modal parameters at various flight conditions. The strategies for integrating ROMs, sensors and actuators with control design for ASE studies will be tailored to meet various needs in NASA. A modular software environment will be developed with facile interfacing to NASA tools for technology insertion and transition. ROM software will be extensively validated and demonstrated for ASE and flight control analysis of the current X-56A MUTT model, its future release, and other relevant aircrafts.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Cache memory has been used effectively for years to improve the computation performance of microprocessors. In microprocessors, the processor operations are performed on data contained within the register file via instructions that are loaded from main memory. Cache was implemented as a smaller, faster bridge between the register file and main memory to complement the processor speed. Systems operating in either a natural space or a nuclear weapons system radiation environment need radiation-hardened cache memory to ensure accurate processor functions. Our goal is to develop and commercialize a power efficient, high speed, radiation hardened cache memory device suitable for long-term space missions using existing trusted commercial processes and IP combined with innovative design architectures. To accomplish this, Scientic and Sandia National Labs (SNL) propose to leverage the memory architectures, cell designs, fabrication processes, and hardening techniques identified during Phase I of this program to develop an advanced SOA RH cache memory device, tailored to the AF Space application requirements, which can be implemented in existing fabrication processes to reach this goal. BENEFIT:High reliability integrated circuits operating in either a natural space or a nuclear weapon system radiation environment requires radiation-hardened cache memory to ensure accurate processor functions. Potential military and/or DoD applications for this device include command and control, navigation, communication, and data processing for interceptors, defense satellites, and other military and space flight systems. Other high reliability markets include commercial satellites, aircraft electronics, automobile electronics, and medical electronics. The electronic devices created for these markets typically have to mitigate soft errors; it is definitely the case for aircraft and medical electronics. Our approach is fairly efficient in a speed/density/power sense and provides an extremely low soft error rate, likely better than that which is currently in use. For military and/or DoD applications, our approach will begin by marketing to those organizations to which Scientic, Inc. and SNL have an existing business relationship and rich heritage of successful program deliveries. These include AFRL, SMC, Naval Research Laboratory, MDA, USASMDC, and other Government agencies, all of whom have an interest in survivable control systems. We also have excellent relationships with commercial sector organizations (technology corporations/prime system developers) that are potential users and will market these organizations as well. These include Boeing, Raytheon, Lockheed-Martin, Northrop Grumman, Honeywell, BAE Systems, and others. Finally, as mentioned above we will leverage our participation in conferences, seminars, and symposia such as HEART, GOMAC, RHET, and others to introduce the RH MST to the broader user community. The civil market requires a broader approach. Unfortunately, the proposed development lacks significant commercial potential. Most commodity microprocessors are at the 32 nm or beyond and employ multiple levels of cache already. The RH cache concept proposed herein will not perform better than what they already use. However, there exist certain high-reliability markets where hardened cache memory would be beneficial. These include commercial aerospace, commercial aircraft electronics, automobile electronics, and medical electronics. Electronic devices created for these markets typically have to mitigate soft errors; it is definitely the case for aircraft and medical electronics. Our approach is fairly efficient in a speed/density/power sense and provides an extremely low soft error rate, likely better than what is currently in use. Another potential high reliability market is computer servers. Servers that maintain large commercial websites are intended to be highly reliable, but also have high capacity. It is possible that the approach proposed here would be an improvement over what these systems currently use. These areas of interest potentially offer a fairly large commercial market. Although the main potential of the RH cache is as a companion integrated circuit for RH microprocessors or microcontrollers, where extremely low bit upset rates are required, this RH cache would be more effective if embedded in the microprocessor or microcontroller. In addition, once the proposed RH cache architecture is validated, the architecture is portable to other fabrication processes. Therefore, another potential opportunity consists of selling the architecture concept developed under this program to RH microprocessor or microcontroller developers for inclusion in their product. Successful completion of this program will result in a fully qualified, commercially available power efficient, high speed, radiation hardened cache memory device and/or RH cache memory IP to meet system requirements.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Landing gear systems are one of the more problematic subsystems on USAF aircraft. The most common landing gear failures are caused by mis-servicing of the OLEO-pneumatic landing gear shock strut, resulting in transmission of much higher loads to the airframe structure (even for a \"normal\" landing events or cause excessive fatigue damage than originally assumed). This phenomena is present and problematic for multiple aircraft platforms. The ability to measure, record, and alert maintainers and crew of the condition of the landing gear shock strut without physical inspection would significantly reduce the maintenance burden, while supporting readiness objectives. The information would also allow USAF to make more intelligent management decisions about operational limits, inspection intervals, removal intervals, and depot overhaul cycle values. ES3 proposes to address strut improper servicing issues through the use of a stand alone, self powered, on-aircraft, miniaturized STrut Operational Readiness Monitoring (STORM) system. The STORM system will have the ability to process and store captured data, and use programmed logic to detect improper servicing and alert operators to a problematic landing gear without physical inspection via wireless transmission. The Phase I effort successfully determined the technical feasibility of developing a multi-function STORM system to assess the shock strut critical readiness parameters (fluid level, pressure, and temperature). Technology readiness was advanced via component and breadboard testing in a laboratory environment utilizing a commercial main landing gear assembly. Phase II will continue to advance technological readiness to include full development, demonstration, and validation of the ES3 STORM system, utilizing the equipment and approaches identified during the Phase I effort. The demonstration and validation will be in a high fidelity laboratory environment, on a representative landing gear system. BENEFIT:ES3 anticipates the results of Phase II work will validate the feasibility and need for immediate pursuit of Phase II.5/III efforts. ES3 anticipates that current SMS technology is available to design and prototype a system that will meet the objectives of the program. The immediate benefit will be the ability to warn operators of low fluid level. This, in turn, will allow for more intelligent maintenance requirements, or inspection and repair intervals. This will maximize the utilization of the landing gear components, without compromising their safe operation; which will ensure life cycle cost reductions.",

This navigation system utilizes a micro mechanically scanned imaging sonar (uMSIS) as a perception sensor and a MEMS-based Inertial Navgiation System (INS).  By detecting, extracting, and matching features from the sonar data, the proposed system generates a vehicle pose estimate that is directly related to the environment and uses this pose estimate to correct the inertial drift of the navigation system.  As well, the system builds an online real-time map of the detected features to assist in navigating back through that environment.

        "abstract": "Under Phase I the liquefaction rate, refrigerant details, and mass flow rates of a small liquid nitrogen generator manufactured by our Company were measured under different conditions. Using scaling laws derived earlier for designing smaller and smaller microminiature refrigerators we have reversed the process and applied these to the design of a liquefier to meet the much higher desired production rate of the Offering. The projected performance is in good agreement with a similar device documented in the literature. We plan to proceed with the detailed design of the refrigerator components, the manufacture of the parts, advanced machining practices for the heat exchanger, assembly and test of the complete device. We have identified a suitable compressor, the refrigerant and the desired dimensions of the heat exchanger to achieve or come close to the desired production rate. Special consideration will be given to the packaging of the liquefier, use of novel materials of construction for the Dewar, enclosure, and means for purifying the Nitrogen, to meet the size and weight desired. We expect the power consumption to be higher but close to the desired value.",

Thermal control systems for space suits and spacecraft will need to meet critical requirements for water conservation and adaptability to highly variable thermal environments.  To achieve these goals, we propose an International Space Station (ISS) demonstration program for an innovative Space Evaporator Absorber Radiator (SEAR) technology.  A SEAR system comprises a lithium chloride absorber radiator (LCAR) for heat rejection coupled with a space water membrane evaporator (SWME) for heat acquisition.  SEAR systems provide heat pumping to minimize radiator size, thermal storage to accommodate variable environmental conditions, and water absorption to minimize use of expendables.  In Phase I we proved the feasibility of our approach by building and testing an LCAR with flight-like internal structures and designing an ISS demonstration experiment.  In Phase II we will design and build SEAR components, a flight-like test module, and a regeneration system according to ISS flight requirements.  We will demonstrate their operation in ground tests that simulate flight test conditions.",

        "abstract": "Advances in spacesuits are required, to support the ISS and future human exploration. Spacesuit development and ground-based testing require sensing and analytical instrumentation for characterizing and validating prototypes. While miniature thermosensors measure reliably at low cost, and can be incorporated all around spacesuit prototypes, incorporating gas sensors at locations of interest inside a spacesuit has been a significant challenge &#150; in particular for human subject tests &#150; because of the size and cost of available instrumentation. The sensor probes and cables must not restrict the suit or human subjects' mobility, and must not disturb the gas flow. Intelligent Optical System is developing luminescence-based sensing patches for non-intrusive monitoring of critical life support gas constituents and potential trace contaminants in spacesuits. Flexible sensitive patches inside prototype spacesuits are interrogated via optical fibers, and do not disturb the gas flow or the human subject. This will give suit engineers great flexibility for choosing multiple sensing points, fitting the sensor elements into the spacesuit, and cost effectively relocating the sensor elements as desired. In Phase I, a first demonstrator was validated at Johnson Space Center by comparison with current instrumentation used in the Suited Manikin Test Apparatus. Phase II will produce an advanced system ready for integration into NASA programs, and for commercialization (TRL9).",

The 2013 National Assessment of Education Progress reported that 66% of middle school students scored below proficient in reading, and 22% scored below basic, the lowest performance level. Students who struggle to read often have deficits in word recognition, which, in turn, inhibits comprehension. In general, students who have word deficits and struggle with reading do not receive the individualized support they need. In addition, commonly used screening and progress monitoring instruments often do not provide data that educators can use to provide individualized instruction.\n\nProject Activities: During Phase I (completed in 2014), a prototype app was developed, consisting of a login screen, a back-end database, a library with over 800 items such as words, sound-files, and pictures, and a set of word matching activities. Pilot research with 59 middle school students demonstrated that the prototype operated as intended, and that students enjoyed and were able to successfully complete each of the word matching tasks in the time allotted. In Phase II of the project, the team will design additional activities, and fully develop the back-end assessment system and teacher dashboard. After the development phase is complete, a larger pilot study will assess the feasibility and usability, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the app for promoting students' word recognition and reading comprehension. The researchers will collect data from 200 middle school students who struggle to read. Half of the students will be randomly assigned to use the app while the other half of students will use a paper-based exercise.

When using iASK, students will proceed through a series of game-like tasks, such as activities to fill in the blank with the correct word part, to order word parts, or to match words to a corresponding picture. The software will be adaptive, as words will get easier or harder based on the ability of the students to decode word parts. iASK will also include a teacher data dashboard to provide formative assessment reports and visuals to guide further teacher-led instruction.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: In this project the research team will develop and test a web-based platform, Lingo Jingo, designed to support educators in efficiently and effectively generating customized plans and materials to support the needs of K\u201312 English language learners. In 2012 in the United States, 4.4 million or approximately 9% of all K\u201312 students were classified as English language learners (ELLs). ELLs are a diverse group, who come to school with a wide variety of cultural backgrounds, skills, and levels of English proficiency. These students must be proficient in English to be successful in school, and to prepare for college and careers. Educators are also challenged to deliver instruction that covers academic content while meeting students' language capabilities. Many teachers do not have adequate instructional resources or capacity to meet this challenge.\n\nProject Activities: During Phase I (completed in 2014), the project team developed a prototype of Lingo Jingo. This web-based platform was intended to guide teachers as they select lessons designed to strengthen ELLs' English vocabulary, and to monitor progress and performance on the lessons. At the end of Phase I, the team carried out a pilot research study with 13 teachers. The researchers found that the prototype operated as intended, that teachers were able to integrate the vocabulary lesson within standard practice, and that students found the lessons useful. During Phase II, the team will increase the functionality of the platform to add individualized content to address learning needs of struggling students. After development is complete, the team will conduct a second larger pilot study designed to assess the feasibility and usability, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the website for promoting English language acquisition and content learning. The researchers will collect data from 20 ELL teachers, with each selecting two classrooms for inclusion in the study. The research team will then randomly assign one class per teacher to use Lingo Jingo to support standard classroom instruction, while the other class will continue with standard classroom practice only. Analyses will compare pre-and-post scores on student's English language acquisition and content-specific learning.\n\nProduct: Lingo Jingo is a web-based platform for educators, designed to efficiently and effectively generate customized plans and materials to support teaching and learning of ELLs. Lingo Jingo will provide three key features. First, it will host a library of language-learning lessons that teachers can access to meet specific instructional objectives, and through which educators will create their own lessons to add to the library. Second, it will allow educators to assign lessons that students can complete anytime and from anywhere. Third, it will provide educators with analytics gathered as students engage with lessons, including information about the activities accessed, time spent activities, how many times activities are repeated, and outcomes from doing activities.",

A principle objective of preschool is to prepare children for later success in school. Most programs focus on activities to support children's social and emotional development, and to strengthen pre-reading and mathematics competencies. Fewer programs explicitly focus on fostering children's executive function and reasoning skills\u2014even though research in the cognitive sciences demonstrates these skills also provide a foundation for school-readiness.\n\nProject Activities: During Phase I (completed in 2014), the team developed six prototype games and a teacher portal to track student progress. At the end of Phase I, results from a pilot study with 55 kindergarten students and 5 teachers demonstrated that the games operated as intended. Results indicated that students were engaged based on duration of game play, and that teachers were able to review game data for each child. In Phase II, the team will develop 15 more games and will further refine and enhance the functionality of the teacher portal. After development is complete, a pilot study will assess the feasibility and usability, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the games for promoting students' executive functioning and reasoning. The researchers will collect data from 200 students in 10 preschool classrooms over 2 months. Half of the students in each class will be randomly assigned to use Kiko's Thinking Time while the other half will play an art-focused gaming app. Analyses will compare pre-and-post scores on measures of student's executive functioning and reasoning.\n\nProduct: Kiko's Thinking Time will be an app with 25 games, each based on tasks shown to have cognitive benefits in lab research. Each game will be designed to isolate and train skills related to executive functioning, such as: working memory, reasoning, inhibition, selective attention, cognitive flexibility, and spatial skills. Game play will be self-guided and adaptive, as the software will adjust in difficulty based on student responses. The app will work on tablets, smartphones, as well desktops. In addition, a companion website will allow teachers to track student performance and to obtain educational material around executive function and cognitive development.",

        "abstract": "Pressure sensitive paint (PSP) systems are excellent tools for performing global pressure measurements in aerodynamic testing, especially in wind tunnel studies. The major limitation of PSP for pressure mapping is its dependence on an oxygen-containing flow, since those paints are actually oxygen sensors. Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) is developing a unique coating in which fluorescence quenching can form high resolution images of the true pressure distribution on surfaces in transonic flow in oxygen-free atmospheres. The fluorescence in these unique coatings depends directly on absolute pressure, and oxygen permeation into the coatings is not required. The new coating, however, is completely compatible with the \"legacy\" (oxygen sensing) visualization equipment used in current transonic test facilities. With this novel pressure sensing technology, coating materials can be used that are not useful for oxygen-based PSPs, and coatings that can meet requirements not achievable with classical paints, like operation at extremely low temperature or in highly contaminated environments. In Phase I, IOS has created the oxygen-insensitive pressure-sensitive coating materials, and applied them to glass and stainless steel test coupons. The fluorescence emission lifetime and intensity of these test samples were measured at varying static pressures under pure nitrogen, showing significant correlation with pressure in the range studied (from 0.05 to 14.7 psi), and excellent repeatability. This sets the stage for Phase II development and delivery of a complete temperature-compensated true ambient pressure sensitive paint system that can be used to characterize flow around structures in hypersonic wind tunnels. At the end of Phase II, the coatings will have been tested at relevant environments (TRL5), and will be available for NASA to begin testing in a high-fidelity laboratory environment (TRL6).",

Our air traffic management cost and economic model offers researchers and project managers a greater understanding of the cost drivers for aircraft operators and helps to validate the cost and revenue impacts of AOSP research. Increased validity of predicted results will help AOSP continue to receive operator support and hasten the transition of ARMD technologies into the NAS. Our model generates cost-benefit estimates for concept and procedure alternatives for individual airlines. The model also estimates a variety of impacts on industry, including input utilization and productivity, throughput, air transportation industry costs and fares, and broader economic effects such as employment and benefits to other industries. The ACAT goes beyond simple flight cost factors by providing greater fidelity in the cost analysis of flight segments, explicit estimation of training and certification cost, and realistic treatment of deployment time and risk. Our cost analysis is performed using airline-specific data, enabling more realistic assessment of airline investment decisions and identification of disparate effects and willingness to invest among airlines. ACAT can improve airline cost-benefit analyses to estimate the profitability of new and existing service on an ongoing basis, as well as investment in advanced ATM capabilities. The model will operate as a stand-alone tool and can integrate with airline flight planning and tracking systems. The model uses publicly available data that can be updated quarterly.",

Happy Atoms is designed to facilitate student learning of atomic modeling, a difficult topic for chemistry high school students to master. Standard instructional practice in this area typically includes teachers using slides, static ball and stick models, or computer-simulation software to present diagrams on a whiteboard. However, these methods do not adequately depict atomic interactions effectively, thus obscuring complex knowledge and understanding of their formulas and characteristics.\n\nProject Activities: During Phase I (completed in 2014), the team developed a prototype of a physical modeling set including a computerized ball and stick molecular models representing the first 17 elements on the periodic table and an iPad app that identifies and generates information about atoms. A pilot study at the end of Phase I tested the prototype with 187 high school students in 12 chemistry classes. Researchers found that the prototype functioned as intended. Results showed that 88% of students enjoyed using the prototype, and that 79% indicated that it helped learning. In Phase II, the team will develop additional models and will strengthen functionality for effective integration into instructional practice. After development is complete, a larger pilot study will assess the usability and feasibility, fidelity of implementation, and promise of Happy Atoms to improve learning. The study will include 30 grade 11 chemistry classrooms, with half randomly assigned to use Happy Atoms and half who will continue with business as usual procedures.

The modeling set will include individual plastic balls representing the elements of the periodic table. Students will use an iPad app to take a picture of models they create. Using computer-generated algorithms, the app will then identify the model and generate information about its physical and chemical properties and uses. The app will also inform students if a model that is created does not exist. Happy Atoms will replace or supplement lesson plans to enhance chemistry teaching. The app will include teacher resources suggesting how to incorporate games and activities to reinforce lesson plans and learning.",

        "abstract": "Video Demonstration of the Phase I Prototype: http://youtu.be/AIGigEXn12Q\n\nPurpose: This project team will develop and test Zaption, a mobile and desktop platform designed to support educators in effectively and efficiently utilizing video (e.g., from YouTube, Vimeo, or their own desktop) as an interactive teaching and learning object. Personalized learning devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets) populated with video content provide opportunities for students to access educationally-meaningful content anywhere and anytime. Yet, video has yet to realize its potential as a learning tool in or out of the classroom. One reason for this is that watching video can be a passive experience for students, whereas learning requires active engagement. A second reason is that even if students are actively engaged while watching a video, there is no easy way to elicit student responses to a video. And finally, there is no easy way to feed student responses to teachers as formative assessment data to guide subsequent instruction.\n\nProject Activities: During Phase I, (completed in 2014), the team expanded a pre-existing prototype by building a mobile app to enable anytime use and increase its functionality for teachers. At the end of Phase I, pilot research with 150 students in 7 classrooms demonstrated that the prototype operated as intended, teachers were able to integrate the videos within instructional practice, and students found the mobile app helpful and engaging. In Phase II, the team will add additional components to the prototype and will develop content-specific modules for use in high school physics classes. After development is complete, the research team will conduct a larger pilot study to assess the feasibility and usability, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the Zaption for supporting student's physics learning. The study will include 32 Grade 10 physics classrooms, half of whom will be randomly assigned to use Zaption and half of whom will follow business as usual procedures. Analyses will compare pre-and-post scores of student's physics learning.\n\nProduct: Zaption will be a mobile and web-based platform to support the use of any video (e.g., from YouTube, Vimeo, or their own desktop) as a teaching and learning tool. Zaption will include an authoring engine where users can find and select video clips and easily insert interactive elements such as questions, discussions, and annotations into the videos. Users will then publish videos directly on Zaption's website, or on any learning management system or classroom website. Students will be able to view videos as homework or in class, respond individually to the questions and prompts, and get feedback on their responses. Teachers will use Zaption Analytics to receive immediate and actionable data showing whether students actually watched and engaged with a video, and how students responded to the questions and prompts.",

Among school-aged children with speech communication disabilities, students with Autism Spectrum Disorder are most frequently affected, as are students with cerebral palsy and apraxia. To communicate effectively, many of these individuals rely on Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems, which convert symbols representing words and phrases into sentences read aloud by a computerized voice. While AAC systems do provide a means of communication, the rate (or speed) of current systems to convert symbols to computerized speech is often too slow for use in school settings. Furthermore, these systems do not offer customized supports to address the needs of individual users.\n\nProject Activities: During Phase I (completed in 2014), the team developed a prototype app for students who require assistive technology to communicate. Components of the prototype included pictures of over 650 symbols that represent words, an assembly bar with words and phrases that students use to construct sentences, a text-to-speech engine, and a relational database used to convert the symbols to words. At the end of Phase I, pilot research with eight grade school students with speech disabilities showed that the prototype functioned as intended and that students were able to successfully generate sentences that were read aloud by the app. In Phase II, the team will add components to the prototype and build out the functionality of the predictive algorithm to customize the support the app can provide. After the development is complete, researchers will use a quasi-experimental research design (specifically, an ABAB reversal design) with approximately 16 kindergarten through grade 8 students diagnosed with Autism to test the effects of the app. In the study, groups of students will alternate using and not using the app over a series of weeks. Analyses will compare student communication rates and accuracy with and without the app during this period.\n\nProduct: Speak Agent AAC will be an app for tablets or handheld phones designed to increase communication and accuracy rates for students with speech disabilities. Students will use the app to construct phrases or sentences by selecting symbols, with the app converting input into computerized speech to enable effective communication. The app will generate customized profiles for each user by feeding data into its predictive algorithm, resulting in faster communication rates with greater accuracy for individual students based on their own usage patterns over time. The app will also include assessment diagnostics that service providers will use to guide instructional practice related to communication and speech.",

Grade 3 students who read below grade level are more likely to drop out of high school than peers who read at grade level. Because of the importance of early reading, it is critical for grade schools to offer strong interventions along with additional support for struggling students. Small group tutoring sessions by teachers and certified paraprofessionals is one technique that has been successful at supporting reading outcomes.\n\nProject Activities: During Phase I (completed in 2014), the team developed a prototype platform consisting of the user interface, a teacher dashboard, and activities and games designed to promote critical reading skills such as word-level decoding, letter-sound correspondence, and comprehending decodable stories. At the end of Phase I, pilot research with two tutors and 16 struggling readers in grades 1 to 3 demonstrated that the prototype operated as intended, that teachers were able to integrate the prototype within standard practice, and that students found the activities engaging. During Phase II, the team will fully develop the technological infrastructure, teacher resources, and create and integrate content within the activities and games. Researchers will carry out a pilot test to examine the usability and feasibility, fidelity of implementation, and promise of the platform to facilitate tutoring sessions and improve reading. Approximately four hundred students in grades 1 to 3 that are having difficulty in reading will receive supplemental tutoring using The Lightning Squad. Half of the students will be randomly assigned to the intervention in the fall of 2016 and the other half will proceed with business as usual. Analyses will compare pre-and-post reading scores between the two groups over this time span.\n\nProduct: This team will develop The Lightning Squad, a multimedia platform designed to facilitate the tutoring of struggling readers in grades 1 to 3. The platform will be implemented through short in- or after-school sessions, where pairs of students will read words and stories presented by the computer with a teacher providing targeted support as needed. The key components of the technology will include: digital books, multimedia activities, such as games, puzzles, and videos, and a teacher dashboard to track student progress and provide instructional resources. Much of the content in The Lightning Squad will be adapted from the popular television programs Sesame Street and The Electric Company. All activities will capture student performance data, which will be used to continually adjust the pace and level of the content presented. For additional practice, students will have also access to activities at home. The Lightning Squad will be designed for laptops, tablets, and smartphones.",

This is important because according to the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress, students in the United States ranked 17th in science among the world's most developed countries, and over a third of eighth-graders scored below basic level, the lowest performance level. The Framework for 21st Century Skills presents the need for education materials that engage students and use technology effectively, meet rigorous content and skill standards, foster interdisciplinary work, and promote collaborative problem solving.\n\nProject Activities: During Phase I (completed in 2014), the team developed a prototype of Eco consisting of a system architecture that enabled user-controlled avatars to complete basic tasks. At the end of Phase I, a pilot study with 60 students from five classrooms demonstrated that the prototype functioned as intended, that students found the game to be engaging, and that students were able to collaborate with classmates during gameplay. In Phase II the developers will strengthen functionality, add content, and build a teacher dashboard to track student data and house implementation resources. After development is complete, the team will conduct a pilot study to assess the feasibility and usability, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the game for promoting students' ecosystem learning and environmental literacy. The researchers will collect data from 150 students in 10 classrooms. Half of the classrooms will be randomly assigned to use Eco to supplement standard classroom instruction while the other half will continue with normal practice. Analyses will compare pre-and-post scores of student's ecology knowledge and environmental literacy.\n\nProduct: Eco will be a multi-player game to teach standards in ecology and prepare middle schools students to be environmentally literate citizens. To play the game, students will enter a shared online world featuring a simulated ecosystem of plants and animals. Students will co-create a civilization by measuring, modeling, and analyzing the underlying ecosystem. Students will advocate for proposed plans to classmates and make decisions as a group. Cooperation and science-based decision making activities will occur, in order to prevent the destruction of the environment. The game will include teacher resources to support the alignment of game play to learning goals, and implementation.",

        "abstract": "While unmanned air vehicles are starting to operate in complex urban and indoor environments, many challenges still remain. In the proposed project we will develop a team of flying robots that can explore and map environments such as networks of underground tunnels. We will address three key challenges: First, the tunnel network topology is unknown and will have to be discovered incrementally by the flying robots. Second, the robots provide imprecise state estimates and environmental representations and hence the generation of globally consistent maps will require specific attention. Third, the computing and communication resources on the flying robots are expected to be limited and hence coordination and map generation will need to be optimized to run in real time.  Phase 1 has demonstrated a proof of principle system for tunnel exploration and mapping demonstrated in a simulation environment. In Phase 2, we will extend capabilities of the system as described above and will implement these in a physical team of robots that will be tested in two different environments. In Phase 3, we intend to address real needs in terms of exploration and mapping in military and in civilian search and rescue scenarios.  We expect that such an effort will require a robust platform and an intuitive interface that allows for operation by non-specialists.",

The VitalWave system uses Doppler radar and radar imaging to assess the vital signs individuals. The use of Doppler radar allows for a system that can measure vital signs with no direct contact required. This allows first responders the ability to assess the vital signs of multiple injured soldiers from a safe distance in compromised environments. Furthermore, this technique is completely standalone and does not require victims to wear remote sensors. Another advantage of the VitalWave system is the ability to measure vital signs through walls and debris. Unlike alternative systems, which require line of sight, UWB MicroDoppler radar can identify and assess victims behind walls and rubble. The VitalWave system is light weight and power efficient allowing it to operate on a single battery charge for extended periods of time. The possibility of including further vital sign detection within the VitalWave system will also be considered. These include but are not limited to movements, location, body temperature and blood volume.",

The 4DSM software tool is designed to post-process first-principles code (FPC) outputs.  The tool will use a validated debris-properties database and an innovative method to harness the database to generate signatures.  The key innovation is a new, fast parametric model in 4DSM that relates discrete debris signature properties to their formation conditions.  In Phase II, the database will be constructed through a systematic series of measurements on debris collected from ground tests.  The database will be used to train the parametric signature model, and, where appropriate, will be directly integrated into a signature model using an interpolative scheme.  The 4DSM software will be tested and validated against ground and flight test field data.

In response to this technology need, ExoAnalytic Solutions is developing Rapid Environmental Scene Characterization Using Efficient MEasurements (RESCUE ME).

It is able to scan over large scale structures with complex geometries and is much more sensitive to micro-damages than the most commonly used linear ultrasonic counterpart.  This multi-modal non-destructive evaluation (NDE) approach enables a very high Probability of Detection (PoD) at high through-put, and allows fine characterization of small defects (microcracks, porosities, etc.) on or below structure surface.

        "abstract": "An unexpected thermal event, such as the motor of a companion missile or destruction of a nearby target could interfere with a missile defense seekers sensor. In a raid situation, the density of targets makes these flash events more likely.  Modeling such flash events will enable evaluation and mitigation of their actual impact on system performance.  IAI has successfully completed phase I of this SBIR, generating a full flyout model, an impact simulation and algorithms to mitigate the effects of flash events.  For phase II, we will continue to enhance these algorithms using measured seeker data, and will test the algorithms with seeker models used by system integrators.  We will minimize the effects of flash by adjusting sensor parameters and processing images to enhance the target object.  This compensation can be inserted into the track loop of any image-based seeker.  Approved for Public Release 15-MDA-8169 (20 March 15)",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on developing a customizable tissue engineered tracheal implant for tracheal transplantation and reconstruction surgery. Current surgical solutions for these patients are limited by problems with the availability of suitable cadaveric tissue, as well as with unsatisfactory long-term survival of the engrafted tissues due to issues with both revascularization and immune rejection. The combination of an inert biomaterial scaffold and autologous cells avoids any concerns with graft rejection, while allowing for the reliable production of tracheal grafts. Nanofiber Solutions expects this new device will enable as many as 6,500 life-saving procedures annually. A successful Phase 2 project will demonstrate long-term performance of the nanofiber tracheal implant and the mechanisms of action in a large animal model as well as a humanitarian device exemption (HDE) application with the FDA to initiate a clinical trial. This trachea implant product addresses a $600 million dollar opportunity. Other tissue engineered products based on this technology platform address billions of dollars more in market opportunity. The proposed project is focused on developing a customizable tissue engineered tracheal implant for tracheal transplantation and reconstruction surgery. The trachea has challenging mechanical and biological requirements, and despite many attempts there currently is no fully functional artificial trachea. The fully synthetic tracheal scaffold is seeded with autologous stem cells harvested from the patient?s bone marrow. To prepare for an FDA submission and initial human clinical trials, we will accomplish three technical objectives in this Phase II work: 1) Optimize the use of a closed system, disposable seeding chamber to allow uniform cell seeding throughout the scaffold, 2) Develop a commercial manufacturing process for the production and placement of support ribs on the tracheal graft, and 3) Elucidate mechanisms of tracheal regeneration in vivo of intraoperatively seeded tracheal implants.",

Data fusion core development will leverage an existing software product (AquaQuIPS) developed under SPAWAR funding. The proposed BAMID system will provide the following capabilities: 1. Provide low-cost, persistent aerial surveillance of maritime choke points which are targets for maritime IEDs 2. Operate for up to 24 hours continuously in a maritime environment 3. Provide detection and geo-location of maritime IEDs 4. Receive and respond to satellite-based cues from an off-site data fusion core 5. Provide dark contact reporting to the data fusion core and display a simple, complete maritime domain awareness picture to the operator. BENEFIT:There is significant commercialization potential for BAMID as globally maritime IEDs pose a threat to commercial shipping vessels, especially in maritime choke points.

        "abstract": "Adaptive optics are needed for high-energy laser (HEL) weapon systems when performance is limited by atmospheric turbulence. This typically requires adding an illuminator laser to produce a beacon by reflection from the target surface. Since a small spot is needed, the laser must be projected from the main aperture, complicating the optical design. With this type of beacon, performance is often degraded by speckle, spot size, and branch cuts. The mid-wave infrared (MWIR) thermal emissions from the spot heated by the HEL can also be used as the beacon. This beacon would not be affected by speckle and would have fewer or no branch cuts. We propose using finite element analysis, scaling law and wave-optics modeling, to do a detailed study of this concept.",

The ABACUS family of systems support a) the mitigation of waves about Sealift ships at the Seabase to enhance personnel safety during cargo transfer to ship-to-shore connectors, b) the lifting and omni-directional maneuvering of a broad range of deck cargos to enhance throughput and c) the enhancement of ABACUS components to meet multiple Seabasing mission requirements. The QED team's technical approach is based upon carefully defining the overall Seabasing ship-to-shore requirement, identifying those areas where safety issues and throughput bottlenecks occur, and developing concepts that can solve those problems. Having identified the problem areas and proposed solution, the QED team moves rapidly to design and fabricate Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrators at either large-scale model or, as appropriate, full scale to test these concepts in real world operational environments.",

        "abstract": "In the post 9/11 security environment, rapid cargo inspection that does not impede the flow of commerce has become a high priority.   Cargo scanning using either radiographic imaging or active interrogation for Special Nuclear Material (SNM) requires high energy and high intensity x-rays.  High intensity x-ray sources are especially important for active interrogation techniques such as prompt neutron photo-fission, delayed neutron & gamma measurements, pulse-shaped discrimination and Nuclear Resonance Fluorescence (NRF).  The most common source of such x-rays is an electron accelerator. Existing pulsed copper accelerators can deliver high energy electrons (3-10 MeV), but have low duty cycle beams and correspondingly low average current. These low current beams limit the quality of x-ray images and SNM detection sensitivity.  Furthermore, inspection systems based on copper accelerators typically weigh several tons, have a large footprint, and consume hundreds of kilowatts of electric power.  As a result, these machines require a large, fixed site to operate.\n\nNiowave, Inc. has developed an alternative--a compact, portable, high-efficiency 10 MeV superconducting electron linac with 10 kW average beam power.  This high-intensity source, evolved from linacs developed by Niowave for x-ray sterilization and free electron lasers, produces an electron beam with a 100% duty cycle.  Our superconducting linac generates a continuous, high-energy, high-intensity x-ray beam that offers beam energy and beam current modulation. Such a beam is ideal for x-ray radiography, or for initiating photonuclear reactions required for active interrogation.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Hill AFB paint stripping operations for aircraft landing gear components is currently achieved by soaking landing gear components in a methylene chloride-based (MeCl) solution for 30 minutes, followed by plastic media blasting to remove residual paint. Current  operations use over 12,000 gallons of MeCl-based stripper each year. OSHA classifies MeCl as a potential carcinogen and regulates occupational exposures accordingly. As a consequence, the Hill AFB is seeking environmentally-friendly approaches to paint removal for aircraft landing gear components. The replacement chemistry must not contain HAPs and be at least as effective as MeCl in order to fit the current timeline for processing. Any material used for paint removal must not cause any deleterious effects to the aircraft landing gear components. In addition, since Hill AFB operates its own industrial wastewater treatment plant (IWTP), it is also imperative that the replacement technology not interfere with the waste water treatment process. This proposal addresses the MeCl-replacement requirements through a structured work plan that will fully develop the product formulations that were developed and successfully demonstrated under the Phase I program. The proposed program will meet all of the SBIR program objectives and establish a solid foundation for technology transfer and implementation.    BENEFIT:  The results of this SBIR program will immediately address MeCl replacement requirements in Hill AFB landing gear depainting operations. Once demonstrated, the replacement technology should be adaptable to other DoD depainting operations, as well as parallel  processes used in the commercial aircraft industry. Other applications include automotive and other industrial painting re-workoperations where parts require repainting due to initial quality issues, as well as possible adaptation to cleaning equipment and facilities used in painting operations.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  A SWIR 3D imaging LADAR architecture is proposed in which it shares the aperture with a FLIR sensor. To enable this combined passive and active sensor system, wide angle non-mechanical beam steering (NMBS) will be implemented at the exit window/entrance pupil of the system. Due to the large steering angles the SWIR LADAR is not constrained to the FOV of the passive MWIR sensor, freeing it from the constraints of the direction in which the FLIR is pointing.     Boulder Nonlinear Systems (BNS) and our teaming partners, ImagineOptix, and Exciting Technology, will build a prototype shared aperture 3D SWIR LADAR/FLIR system. Using polarization grating technology, and MWIR transparent liquid crystal switches, the 3D SWIR LADAR light will be steered without diffracting the MWIR light that is being collected by the FLIR. With this approach we expect to enhance the capabilities of the sensor system.      BENEFIT:  The effort proposed here represents an improvement to 3D LADAR imaging and passive and active IR sensors. Several DoD platforms could benefit from the shared aperture approach. In addition commercial 3D mapping would benefit from increased field of view and multispectral capability.",

Continued improvements in the fabrication and metrology methods will provide a pathway to a more timely process in the production of these windows. OptiPro is well positioned for a successful Phase II effort as they will combine the newly developed UltraSurf, 5-axis non-contact metrology system, extensive knowledge of CAD/CAM software and our 5-axis grinding and polishing machines.

        "abstract": "Future military platforms will require more extensive use of electronic power systems to achieve required performance levels. Energy storage is becoming a key enabler for power systems operating with high levels of transient power requirements and supporting fuel-efficiency operations while maintaining capability.  High density energy storage which operates continuously at high charge and discharge rates to support these loads under the combination of finite space, high power and energy requirements, stringent safety characteristics and wide upper temperature ranges drive the requirement for advanced cooling systems.  Proper thermal management of these high power electronic systems becomes more difficult as increasing power density requirements push heat generating components closer together.  This is made more severe due to relatively low full power operating temperature limits (in the range of 55-60C for certain components) which force designers to de-rate the components to ensure reliable operation. The combination of close proximity, volumetric self-heating, and platform coolant temperatures as high as 50C all contribute to increased system volume from redundant storage arrays operating with reduced energy density. While ongoing research efforts are attempting to develop components with higher operating temperature limits, improved methods of efficiently managing the thermal aspects of batteries, capacitors and flywheel motor/generators provides a near-term reduction in the need for component de-rating which would reduce component redundancy and increase system power density.  Storage devices with a cylindrical, can-style structure cannot efficiently couple to the high performance cold plates and heat sinks being implemented to cool other components. Although air-cooling methods (including finned adapters, etc.) have been utilized in the past, system volume constraints and platform placement typically remove useful convective flow paths. Other proposed techniques for thermal coupling have included the use of inefficient thermal interface materials, thermal conduction through the electrical terminals, or significant modifications, none of which provide a cost and performance effective solution.     Innovative R&D is needed to investigate cooling architectures which can be enabled for cylindrical geometry energy storage components that must be integrated into larger arrays.  The technologies should be scalable from small 18mm type cells through motors of 100mm or greater diameter.  The cooling architectures should be able to space-efficiently couple to a backplane, being integrated into shelving or cabinet designs to help maintain climate or thermal isolation and regulation throughout the device.      The innovative products brought forth through this SBIR effort should not contain precious or hazardous materials, nor require significant interfaces in order to support.  It is optimal for these devices to operate such that chilled water is not required, though fresh and/or seawater can be assumed to be available at 40C, with sufficient flow available to meet mission needs.  Ambient spaces should be assumed to be up to 60C and worst-case device maximum temperatures should also be assumed to be 60C.  In order to maintain density of the energy storage devices, these cooling structures should not expand the individual components greater than 10%, yet be capable of supporting pressure both from the inside in the form of cooling fluid flow, as well as external under compression of a battery pack, expansion during cycling operation, etc. If a special cooling fluid is to be utilized, the interface to facility/platform cooling fluid should be considered, along with the impact on efficiency and device/system density and packing factor.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Toyon Research Corporation proposes the research and development of advanced algorithms and efficient software for the detection, tracking, and geo-location of dim targets in infrared sensor data. The algorithms will provide detection of both moving and stationary targets with novel, temporal signatures based on near-optimal exploitation of high-frame-rate satellite-based IR imagery. The proposed detection and tracking algorithms are based on innovative development in a Bayesian track-before-detect framework. The geo-location algorithms are based on the coupling of mission image-to-reference frame alignment using a robust statistical algorithm, frame-to-frame feature tracking and registration, and estimation of physical sensor parameters to remove geo-registration biases. In addition, the utilization of advanced clutter modeling and rejection processes allows for the capability of detecting targets with intensities several orders of magnitude below image clutter. The developed algorithms will be implemented in efficient software libraries and delivered to the government for use in IR data exploitation processes. A prototype software application will also be developed and delivered for end-to-end demonstration of the IR sensor processing system. Toyon will provide software integration support and will perform extensive testing of all developed algorithms and software using real-world high-frame-rate IR sensor data, as well as simulated data to address algorithm limits and government interests.  BENEFIT:  The successful completion of this R&D will result in advanced algorithms and a real-time software implementation for detection, tracking, and geo-location of dim targets (moving and stationary) from space-based IR sensor platforms. A direct application will be insertion of the algorithm suite into existing baseline OPIR software at Air Force ground stations and/or technical intelligence labs, such as the Aerospace Fusion Center, to be used to process image data from existing sensors. The benefits of this successful R&D would be a comprehensive dim target detector to aid the Air Force in finding and locating adversarial threats, and locating threat development and test sites. This software could also be optimized for programs that use satellite sensors for surveillance such as NASIC ATEP II or the AFRL EAGLE HTI Space Experiment.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Ultra-stable and accurate frequency and timing devices such as atomic clocks are essential for modern communication, navigation, surveillance, and missile guidance systems. There are many atomic oscillators such as neutral calcium and neutral ytterbium that produce clock signal in optical domain. However, these optical standards are expensive and not widely available. The phase stabilized frequency comb can measure optical frequency eight orders of magnitude better than the best commercially available systems previously approached with RF and microwave electronics.   In this project, NP Photonics will develop a compact and rugged phase stabilized frequency comb optical system for precision atomic clocks and stable oscillators. NP Photonics specializes in highly doped, high gain per unit length specialty fibers that allows the tailoring of optical gain, nonlinear response, and group-velocity dispersion of the active medium. These fibers enable a simple, compact, robust, cost efficient and ultimately integration-compatible approach to develop high repetition rate (~500 MHz) fundamentally mode-locked Er/Yb-doped fiber lasers and ultralow noise single frequency laser for clock applications. NP Photonics is uniquely positioned to execute on these project goals having already achieved  fundamentally mode-locked lasers with GHz repetition rates, and ultra-narrow linewidth (< 400 Hz) single frequency lasers in a space-qualified platform.    BENEFIT:  Low-noise and very compact footprint microwave oscillators based on phase coherent division of the optical signal are critical building blocks for numerous applications such as high bandwidth precise timing distribution and synchronization, novel imaging techniques, precision metrology and spectroscopy, radar system. Femtosecond laser frequency comb itself can be used for frequency metrology, optical arbitrary waveform generation, high-speed optical sampling, and the calibration of astrophysical spectrographs.",

In Phase II, the high gain data link antenna design will be refined and optimized using state-of-the-art electromagnetic modeling and simulation tools.  The performance of the antenna system will be validated through the manufacture and testing of a high fidelity, form factor prototype.  The prototype will be subjected to full RF characterization and environmental testing to critical missile environments and also system tested in a missile testbed, resulting in TRL/MRL 6 for the antenna technology.

In phase I feasibility effort, Amastan demonstrated high temperature (1600 C) phase stable LMHA coatings that are phase pure upon annealing using its Uniform Melt State Process (UniMelt) spray process. In Phase II, Amastan will focus on two other precursor chemistries that have shown promising preliminary results, as well as increase process power to achieve the desired coating characteristics. Furthermore, the coating will be optimized to meet or exceed the specifications for TBC systems required in high temperature operations and CMAS resistance applications. Amastan will also optimize the production cost and team up with a turbine manufacturer to conduct tests on turbine components at the manufacturers testing rig. This step will position Amastans technology towards commercialization.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Liquid rocket propulsion systems require the use of high pressure LOX/GOX, and therefore have the need for LOX/ GOX compatible materials.  This is especially true with LOX turbopumps which are exposed to or submerged in LOX and exposed to high pressure-high temperature GOX during operation.  LOX/GOX compatible materials are also needed for injectors, valves, and oxygen rich turbines.  LOX resistant materials, also known as combustion resistant materials, will not burn when in contact with LOX/GOX.  Some materials may be compatible only up to a certain pressure level or flow velocity; however, materials that are compatible with LOX/GOX at all pressure and flow velocity levels are needed for use in advanced liquid rocket propulsion systems.  Throughout the evolution of the gas turbines, materials with specific benefits have been applied as surface treatments when the material alone does not have sufficient structural strength.  This effort proposes the application of a robust burn resistant vitreous enamel coating to components exposed to LOX and high temperature and pressure GOX.  Initial testing performed during the SBIR Phase I program established that the coating system could be consistently applied, was tolerant to thermal shock, was microstructural stability over time, and was resistant to ignition events.  BENEFIT:  Low cost burn resistant coating system for ox-rich staged combustion rocket turbopumps.  Due to thermal insulating benefits there is a potential for application as a low cost thermal barrier coating for use in military and commercial aircraft engine, and industrial gas turbines.",

        "abstract": "The Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) was designed to rapidly reconfigure for a variety of missions, such as Anti-submarine Warfare, Mine Countermeasures, and Surface Warfare. Currently, multiple and different material handling systems are used between the two LCS variants. For example, the Independence variant uses fork trucks, straddle carriers, and pallet jacks, while the Freedom uses straddle carriers and pallet jacks. These current material handling systems are not flexible to effectively transport payloads around the LCS and do not provide a common, cost-effective system that is also adaptable. Multiple payload handling systems increases crew training requirements and logistic support requirements. Additionally, no backup systems are available if one fails.   Robotic Research is designing and constructing a prototype of the Loading for Naval Resupply for Deployment (LNRD) material handling system that will combine the capabilities of all current handling systems into one advanced system compatible to both sea frame variants.

Examples of these systems include plasma thrusters, hypersonic vehicles, radiation effects simulations, RF sources, and compact neutron sources. Current simulation tools rely heavily on magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) models for these systems, which ignore important kinetic effects.  Additionally, available commercial codes have not exhibited scaling to massively-parallel CPU/GPU architectures.  The goal is to have a single, fast-running simulation tool that dynamically spans both MHD and kinetic regimes, correctly resolving spatial and temporal features.

This approach enables rapid deployment from validated and verified computational physics models and algorithms.  The new code will deploy algorithms for dynamic switching between different plasma model descriptions (e.g., fluid to kinetic), adaptive and dynamic mesh refinement.  New algorithms with automatic transitioning between the plasma models will be implemented and made robust for general use.

Batteries will provide surge power to arrive on station in 2-3 minutes after initiation. The fuel cell will startup during the flight and take over power supply. The fuel cell will supply trickle power to the battery so that dash capability is retained.  BENEFIT:  Since this UAV will be fueled by JP8, logistics concerns will be alleviated and rapid refueling will be possible. An additional benefit is that as the aircraft consumes fuel, its gross weight will reduce thereby further increasing range. The RIPPED UAV will eventually find a foothold in the industrial surveillance market as well as in law enforcement and border protection.

Working with the battery, the resultant Dual Mode EAU (DMEAU) would have the following functions: emergency power, transient energy supply/storage, battery charging, engine starting and 270 VDC power generation. The DMEAU would meet the requirements of the current BCCU space .  For this proposal, an advanced EAU breadboard converter will be fabricated and tested to expected aircraft actuator transient loads with an emulated energy storage battery  BENEFIT:  Fabrication of an advanced packaged EAU converter will increase the technology readiness level of the DMEAU. The combined outcomes of weight savings and increased vehicle capability will spur the application of Dual Mode Electrical Accumulator Units to several thousand high performance aircraft.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The E-Band frequency bands from 71 to 76 GHz and 81 to 86 GHz have been designated for satellite down- and uplinks, and have gained an increased interest. The wide bandwidth in excess of 1GHz allows the use of low order modulation schemes and simple receiver implementation. In other words, coarser Analog to Digital converters (ADC) and Digital to Analog (DAC) converters can be used in the RF front end. In this research, we will design the ADC and DAC using Second Order Delta Sigma Modulation techniques which achieve equivalent high oversampling by adding multiple paths and interleaved sampling while keeping the base sampling frequency low. The objective is to add paths to meet the requirement for 1GHz bandwidth and 9 bits effective number of bits. With Delta Sigma Modulation we can design monolithic System on a Chip solutions with integrated ADCs and DACs. The high density of the technology node can be exploited for implementing the System on a Chip capable of processing the high band width signals and providing the high speed host interface for space-borne communication systems. The Delta Sigma Modulators will be taped out in the Radiation Hardened 32nm SOI CMOS process.  BENEFIT:  Communication in the E-Band has established itself not only in point to point terrestrial links, but also satellite links to ground and inter satellite communications. The ADC and DACs developed in this project have a growing market in commercial E-Band communications. By designing the ADC and DAC using the Radiation Hardened 32nm SOI process, monolithic System on a Chip solutions with integrated ADC and DACs can be developed that save on cost, power and size while achieving the multi-GHz bandwidth requirements for E-Band communication in Space. Due to the high bandwidth required in E-Band, the ADC and DACs designed in this project can more than satisfy the demands for WiFi and 5G monolithic System on a Chip radio solutions where we can tradeoff bandwidth for even more power savings. Therefore, the demand for the chips extend beyond E-band and can benefit from higher volumes in these bands to expand the market and reduce costs.",

        "abstract": "Rapid response missions to remote, unknown areas are becoming a primary focus for U.S. military forces. These missions require time-sensitive development of intelligence from all available sources including open source data, historic imagery, and live collections. Capabilities currently exist to extract low-level information (i.e. entities, relationships, and actions) from these large scale data sources. However, most of the intelligence requirements that need to be fulfilled are of a high-level conceptual nature. The fulfillment of these intelligence requirements needs a system that can utilize the extracted low-level information and the context surrounding this information to provide concept-level knowledge generation.  Therefore, DAC proposes to develop a system called Automated Concept Map Elicitation (ACME). The ACME system will be focused on providing users with a rapid, visual mechanism for developing situational awareness around a specific intelligence requirement. To provide this capability, the ACME system will be built to support the extraction of information stored across numerous ontologies, utilize automated clustering of entity nodes and relationships to simplify the developed concept maps, and include an intuitive visualization of concept maps based on knowledge pertinent to the specific intelligence requirement.",

The technical approach utilizes the existing company technologies to create prototypes during the Phase II. The prototype demonstrations will pave the way to commercial success of the manufactured HRGe product. The Phase I program experimentally demonstrated an order of magnitude increase in the count rate capacity of the former electronic-readout system to create the new HRGe electronic readout and software system. Phase I saw the overall detector-system gamma-ray count-rate capacity improved from 70 kcps to 850 kcps, making the system more than 10 times more capable in high rate environments and offering a previously unheard of combination of sensitivity and count-rate capacity. Phase II will concentrate on the fabrication and evaluation of prototype HRGe detector systems. These prototypes will be more compact, more lightweight, and more power-efficient than any others having such high count rate capacity. The overall HRGe detector system count-rate capacity is projected to be several million counts per second, making HRGe the highest count rate germanium detector system with the largest sensitivity of any system ever made.

        "abstract": "Due to enormous growth of Internet traffic, the scale and responsiveness required for delivering applications to end users can be cost-effectively achieved by the increased adoption of cloud-based, virtualized services built by widespread use of compute, storage, and network virtualization. Therefore, IT infrastructures of enterprises, Research and Education (R&amp;E) networks (e.g., DOE ESnet), and commercial network operators are evolving from traditional, centralized, on-premise-only infrastructures to distributed and heterogeneous ones that incorporate resources from private and public clouds (where resources are distributed across multiple data centers). In these distributed networks where end-to-end network paths traverse multiple non-private domains, ensuring that the end-to-end infrastructure is delivering the required performance is very difficult. Realizing the above challenges, Ennetix is developing a solution, called XNet, that delivers end-to-end monitoring, analysis, and visualization of network performance for distributed, multi-domain networks. XNet presents a unique network performance management approach by leveraging a perfSONAR-based \\performance measurement overlay&quot; for collecting end-to-end performance measurements, augmenting them with traditional network data, and then employing advanced analytics and innovative visualization to deliver actionable outcomes to the network operator. XNet will be offered as a cloud-based (SaaS) solution for easier adoption by customers, faster roll out of features, and lower cost of service delivery. During the Phase I project, requirements analysis and design of the XNet platform architecture have been conducted. A working XNet prototype has been developed, and evaluation studies have been performed to determine XNet&apos;s effectiveness and scalability in proactively managing the performance of large network infrastructures. These feasibility and performance evaluation studies have been accomplished over the large enterprise network of UC Davis. Outcomes of the Phase I development efforts and evaluation studies have confirmed the viability of a commercial-grade XNet solution.In this Phase II SBIR project (as a continuation of Phase I effort), the goal will be to significantly expand XNet solution with additional features, analytics capabilities, scalable data stores, and new visualization techniques. A robust and commercial-grade XNet solution that can be used by network administrators to manage the performance of distributed network infrastructures will be developed. Finally, early beta trials will be accomplished to demonstrate the functionalities and performance of XNet on live networks and to pave the way to successful market entry and future deployment on premier R&amp;E networks such as ESnet. The proposed solution will greatly benefit network administrators and managers at DOE and other government organizations through a new approach for network performance management. The wider benefits of this effort will extend well beyond the immediate DOE scientific community, and on to other enterprises and network operators. In particular, many commercial service providers and enterprises can leverage the proposed cloud-based service to proactively manage their distributed network infrastructures.",

From computer data storage centers and electric vehicles to on-detector electronics used in nuclear physics instruments, a liquid-cooled micro-channel thermal control system will help improve the performance and reliability of these electronic systems. A new manufacturing method has been developed to produce 3-dimensional micro-channel thermal management systems. Continued optimization of the manufacturing process and micro-channel design will enable cost-effective, high performance solutions for mitigating heat removal in electronic devices. A Phase I program demonstrated a new manufacturing method to produce micro-channels with feature sizes in the 100 micron range at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. The process was scaled to produce 2 x 4 liquid-cooled thermal management units where improved thermal performance was measured with regard to competitive air and liquid-cooled systems. The manufacturing process was also demonstrated to produce 3-dimensional designs with intricate fluid flow pathways and features opening up new micro-channel thermal management design possibilities.  A Phase II program is focusing on optimizing the manufacturing process, scaling it upwards of producing 100,000 units per year, and optimizing the performance of liquid-cooled micro-channel designs. Internal and external test validation is being conducted with thermal management integrators to show the merits of these new micro-channel systems for cooling high heat flux electronics. New electronic system designs for computer data servers, hybrid electric vehicles, avionics, medical and office equipment, and telecommunications have heat removal requirements in the 100-1000 W/cm2 range as well as specifications for keeping device touch temperatures at less than 100 C.

To maintain U.S.s leadership position in the 21st century, we must seek alternate renewable and economically competitive sources for making HVCs that are used in polymers, medicines, advanced materials, and flavor and fragrance applications. Lignin, a natural biopolymer of monomeric phenol subunits, is a rich source of aromatic building block chemicals and contains about 40% of the total carbon of plants. Current biorefinery strategies primarily focused on valorization of carbohydrates of biomass because of lack of selective catalyst for lignin conversion. As a result, &gt;98% of 70 million tons of lignin annually produced by global paper pulping industries and biorefineries is neglected as a biorenewable feedstock and is typically burned for low value fuel. However, lignin value and hence the profitability of the current lignocellulose processing industries can be significantly improved by selective upgrading of lignin into high value products that can be used as green alternative to many petroleum-derived products. Spero Energy, Inc. has a proprietary catalytic technology for one-step lignocellulose deconstruction and selective conversion of wood lignin into high value flavor and fragrance chemicals, dihydroeugenol (DHE) and 2,6-dimethoxy-4-propylphenol (DMPP) of average market price of $22.5 per kg, with the simultaneous production of digestible cellulose. The combined global market of our lignin derived DHE, DMPP and the derivate aroma chemicals is about $1.1 billion per year. Using the SBIR Phase I financial support from the Department of Energy, Spero Energy has achieved several critical milestones including evaluation of feedstock flexibility, catalyst stability and lifespan analysis, and digestibility studies of the cellulose product.  The critical objectives of the Phase II technology development includes (1) process scale up to assess and mitigate scale up risks, (2) enhance operational efficiency of the process under continuous operation conditions, (3) process design and process parameters optimization, (4) produce products in quantities for industrial standard quality testing with reference to the benchmark of the current products and determine any unique properties of our products that may give additional competitive advantages and (5) complete detailed techno-economic analysis. The ultimate goal is to deliver a risk-free process on mini-pilot scale by the end of Phase II performance period so that the technology can be rolled out to pilot scale during the Phase III and the products can hit the target entry market.  On broader aspect, our technology provides a unique solution for upgrading the entire woody biomass selectively into high value downstream products with high carbon efficiently. Our long term strategy of upgrading the initial lignin products (DHE and DMPP) into commodity chemicals and aromatic fuel additive will bring significant societal and educational benefits for producing such products in a new way from lignin.",

Developing radiation damage resistant materials for both in-core and out-of core applications is a critical component of these next generation power plants. Testing these novel materials requires an intense neutron setting. A commonly used tool for testing novel materials is a high flux fast neutron environment. Fission-like spectrum neutrons are currently generated at either a nuclear reactor or a national laboratory scale accelerator such as the proposed Material Test Station at Los Alamos National Lab (using a 800 MeV proton beam). However, there are currently no fast-neutron reactors in the United States, and MTS will not be operational in the near future. We propose a convenient and low-cost alternative: an intense source of fast fission-spectrum neutrons produced from a superconducting electron linac. The proposed source is based on the photo production of neutrons, including (,n), fission, and neutron-induced fission, using a 40 MeV electron beam with power of up to 100 kW. This accelerator energy and power level is within the capabilities of superconducting linacs under development at Niowave.  In a parallel project independent to this proposal, Niowave is currently building a radioisotope production facility using a 40 MeV, 100 kW superconducting electron linac. Construction of the facility began in 2014, and the facility will be operational in 2015. The proposed fast neutron source will utilize the same linac as the isotope production station. However, a beamline switchyard will direct the beam between the two endstations: one for isotope production, another is for material irradiations. This SBIR includes the design, optimization and licensing aspects of the fast neutron source. Because a majority of the development is already underway with the isotope production facility, our intent is to have the proposed commercial fast neutron source operational by the completion of Phase II. Phase III of this proposal will commercialize the technology to build dedicated material testing systems and make them available as a commercial product.",

One essential piece of instrumentation that is needed is a precise, radiation-resistant, magnetic field probe. The NMR probes, that are currently being used, have a very limited lifetime in high-radiation environments. A cost-effective, radiation-tolerant replacement is critical.  We are proposing to replace these probes with micro Penning traps. The magnetic field  measurement will be performed by determining the cyclotron frequency of singly charged ions with well-known mass, from which the magnetic field will be determined via an image charge detection technique. This approach has been tested by our collaborator, and it has been proven to be sound and effective. We will concentrate our effort towards the development of magnetic field probes that are highly radiation resistant: The element placed inside the magnetic field, and subjected to the highest radiation, will be made of partially metalized fused silica glass, and the signal strength will be sufficiently strong, that associated electronics may be positioned at a distant shielded location. In contrast, even radiation-hardened NMR probes have some active components located on the probe.  In Phase I, we designed and fabricated key elements of the magnetic probe, including several  Penning microtrap demonstrators. These demonstrators have a trapping volume that is twoorder smaller than that previously demonstrated. Their mechanical and electrical characteristics, including voltage breakdown, were recorded. Simulations were carried out to  explore design tradeoffs. In Phase II, a full prototype will be fabricated, and its characteristics will be evaluated. The electronics, and the related hardware and software will be stream-lined to reduce production costs.  The successful development of inexpensive, radiation-resistant, high-precision magnetic field probes will bring numerous benefits to the public as a whole. These probes will directly assist in the development and delivery of radioactive ion beams produced by accelerator facilities, and will sustain a rich experimental program. Our magnetic probes will also find use in accelerator-based cancer therapy medical facilities. Medical accelerators do age over time, and older machines often produce more errors.

        "abstract": "usiness and industry need to anticipate the potential risks and opportunities that climate change may create in the decades ahead in order to start now to ensure continued success and prosperity. This project is transforming the results of scientific computer climate research into quantitative business-specific formats that provide actionable foresight for adapting to climate change. Climate simulations for the 21st century computed recently for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) by 29 climate modeling centers were aimed at predicting climate change driven by four scenarios of greenhouse forcing. The Climate Change Information System for Business and Industry (ClimBiz) is translating relevant subsets of this huge dataset archived by DOE into forms that will enable private sector executives and their firms to revise their business models and strategies to meet the challenge of climate change. A ClimBiz Phase I data analysis system and website is currently producing information about potential time variations of key climate variables in various regions of the world. Examples of business-specific transformations relevant to agriculture and energy have been developed and demonstrated. Phase II will focus on visualization of spatial patterns of climate change and the associated business impacts and on downscaling the scientific simulations to provide greater regional and local detail. With its own database selected and downloaded from the DOE archive, ClimBiz will offer customers a rapid and flexible facility for creating scenarios relevant to their activities and for estimating the probabilities that industry variables may become favorable or unfavorable in the next few decades or later in the century. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits. ClimBiz information will assist agriculture, the conventional and renewable energy industries, water and coastal management, and insurance and finance, among others, to anticipate and adapt to climate change and thus continue to contribute strongly to the national welfare and economic vitality. ClimBiz will be attractive and valuable to a wide range of customers here and in other nations.",

        "abstract": "Collinear wakefield accelerator approaches are limited to transformer ratios of less than two for symmetric drive profiles. Exceeding this limitation is necessary to establish dielectric wakefield acceleration as viable technology for future compact high-gradient accelerators. Novel methods are needed to generate asymmetric shaped drive beams ideal for enhanced transformer ratios.  We propose to develop a longitudinal bunch shaper that is capable of generating nearly idealized triangular profiles using the beam self-wakefield interaction in a dielectric structure followed by a compact chicane. The shaped beam will serve as a driver for a second stage dielectric wakefield accelerator with enhanced transformer ratio. In Phase I, the system was conceptually designed and theoretically modeled with simulations for benchmarking. The system components were fabricated and assembled and installed for experimentation at the Brookhaven National Laboratory Accelerator Test Facility. The Phase I results experimentally demonstrated the generation of a beam with triangular profile consistent with theoretical modeling and simulations. In Phase II, we will build off the successful results and integrate a second stage structure to accelerate particles and measure the transformer ratio of the system. We will also explore alternate geometries and attempt higher-order shaping schemes. COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS AND OTHER BENEFITS The benefits of dielectric wakefield accelerator structures include shaped bunches to extract energy, and access higher frequencies. It also provides high-added value in afterburner applications for existing facilities, allowing an increase in energy at negligible added footprint. The R&amp;D has implications ranging from laser acceleration to high frequency components in communications. Finally, these structures serve as robust sources of terahertz radiation, (high peak power, narrow bandwidth) for material spectroscopy and pump-probe experiments.",

        "abstract": "To improve public security and prevent the diversion of radioactive material for Radiation Dispersion Devices (or so-called dirty bombs) DOE is planning to dramatically reduce the amount of radioactive material in use. Ir-192 is the most common isotope used for radiography and poses a higher risk of being diverted since it must constantly be replenished, and is found in small, portable devices that nevertheless contain dangerous amounts of material. The existing technology of RF linacs based on sophisticated multi-cup copper structures is too complicated and expensive to be compatible with massive replacement.RadiaBeam is developing an inexpensive, energy-tunable, portable linac based on easy-to-manufacture, structure to allow effective capture of tens of keV electron beam injected from an inexpensive electron gun and acceleration to a final energy up to 1 MeV. The structure design significantly simplifies brazing, eliminates time consuming tuning due to the high group velocity in common tube housing. The bremsstrahlung X-rays produced by the ~1 MeV electron beam on a high-Z converter at the end of the linac will match the penetration and dose rate of a typical 200 Ci Ir-192 source.A two-section, hybrid Alumina-Copper, easy-to-fabricate, disk-and-ring-type structure has been designed. The novel design eliminates multi-cell brazing and expensive RF windows as combines them with the couplers. Assembling of the structure is as simple as stuffing of a pipe with the CNC-milled disks and ring. The simulations indicate attaining of a 1.2 MeV energy for a more than 10 mA current with low power ~100 kW X-band magnetron. Seven cells (~1/6th) of the structure have been fabricated at the cost of $180 per cell. Test mockup with the 7 cells driven by a 14 keV electron gun from L3 have been built with novel designs of vacuum port and alternating periodic permanent focusing. Up to 30 mA have been transported through the 7 cells at 50% transmission up to 30 Hz rep rate at better than 0.1 nbar pressure without indications of damage. In Phase II project we are going to design, fabricate and commission the X-ray source based on the novel type structure to match the penetration and dose rate of a typical 200 Ci Ir-192 source. In Phase II we demonstrate suitability of the system for mass production and feasibility of attaining 40 lbs weight of the system.",

        "abstract": "Worldwide there are a number of synchrotron beamlines dedicated to resonant soft x-ray inelastic scattering. There are also new beamlines currently being designed to take advantage of improved third generation synchrotron radiation sources and this powerful experimental technique for probing electronic structure. These beamlines utilize energy dispersive spectrometers and share a common need for advanced detectors that can provide better energy resolution. An energy dispersive spectrometer disperses an incident x-ray beam in such a way as to translate each x-ray energy into a corresponding position on the resulting beam. Thus, in these spectrometers energy resolution is dependent on the position resolution of the detectors used. Current state of the art detectors provide position resolution of ~25 m to 40 m.  This either limits the resolvable energy resolution and/or requires long complex spectrometers to achieve the desired resolution.  Researchers at a national laboratory have demonstrated the technical feasibility of a novel directdetection, soft x-ray imaging camera with 5 to 10 times better position resolution that the current state of the art. The primary objective of the program is to advance the concepts demonstrated in the laboratory to the point that commercial detectors can be produced to support the mission-focused DOE goal of enhancing fundamental energy science. The Phase I effort produced a functional prototype that was used to demonstrate performance using x-rays. In parallel, efforts were expended on the commercial engineering needed to transition this national laboratory research and development to the commercial sector. The Phase II program will implement the designs developed during Phase I and produce a beta prototype for testing at a soft inelastic x-ray scattering beamline.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits.  Detectors resulting from this program will significantly improve the ability to precisely characterize atomic structures which will in turn provide considerable benefits in terms of discovery and new material science. These detectors will be especially beneficial in any sort of soft x-ray spectroscopic diagnostic. Commercial embodiments of this technology will result in better resolution for existing beamlines and enable shorter (more economical) beamlines for the future. In addition, this fine pitch detector holds promise for developing bench-top-scale spectrographs with unprecedented spectrographic x-ray resolution for industrial laboratory markets.",

        "abstract": "The interconnect networks of datacenters and extreme scale high performance computers (HPC) will require a bandwidth density, in terms of connections per area, that cannot practically be met with todays optical transceiver technology. The push for high-radix connectivity in combination with an ever increasing amount of data transported on these advanced networks requires increasing numbers of fiber connections which are projected to scale beyond what can be accommodated at the network switch front panel interface. To keep pace with big data and HPC, optical transceiver technologies must evolve from discrete component solutions with data channels transmitted over parallel fibers, to integrated photonic solutions which use wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) to transmit multiple, high data rate channels on a single fiber. In this way, cost-effective optical transceivers with unprecedented bandwidth densities can be realized to keep pace with the connectivity needs of datacenter and extreme scale HPC.  In this program, Aurrion proposes to partner with IBM to develop low thermal-sensitivity, high bandwidth-density optical receivers which will enable the high speed (&gt;100Gb/s) and high interconnectivity advanced network topologies that will be needed for datacenter and extreme scaling computing. Building on previous work where Aurrion and IBM demonstrated a single channel 60 Gb/s digital optical receiver, phase 1 will focus on developing an athermal WDM receiver design compatible its high speed photodiodes and IBM electronics. In subsequent phases, full receivers, incorporating the designed demultiplexors, photodiode arrays, and electronic drivers can be demonstrated. If successful, the technology developed in this program will be commercialized to address datacenter and HPC market needs.",

        "abstract": "Three different modalities of radiation sterilization currently exist: gamma-ray sterilization, electron beam sterilization, and x-ray sterilization. One of the most common ways to sterilize goods is with gamma producing radioactive sources, most commonly Co-60 and Cs-137. Long-term possession of these sources is undesirable due to security concerns, Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversight, and rising replacement, storage, and disposal costs. In addition, gamma sterilization typically requires relatively long exposure times to achieve the doses necessary for effective sterilization. Lastly, these sources present a homeland security risk as they may be used to build a Radiological Dispersal Device i.e., a Dirty Bomb. We propose to develop a radiation sterilization system which uses a superconducting linear accelerator (linac) to provide high radiation doses and thus eliminate the industrys reliance on disadvantageous Co-60 and Cs-137 sources.  Electron linacs offer many advantages over radioactive sources. First, they can produce high energy bremsstrahlung x-rays by striking a metal converter on demand and can easily be turned on and off. Second, linacs can produce radiation of varying intensity, photon energy, and power. Third, a bremsstrahlung photon cone is focused, compared to the isotropic radiation emitted by sources and thus is more efficient. Finally, linacs produce little radioactive waste, and they are a low security risk because they cannot be used in any way to build a dirty bomb. These positive factors make linacs a compelling option when choosing among radiation sterilization methods.  Niowave has been developing superconducting linacs for nearly a decade. Recent advances in superconducting accelerator technology have reduced the capital and operational costs to the point where they are now competitive with conventional (normal conducting) linacs. Niowave has started construction on a new sterilization facility that will become operational in 2015. The sterilization system using a superconducting linac will be compliant with the ISO 11137 scope within the ISO 13485 standard and Niowave will seek certification from the accredited certification body, BSI. By having a certified system, Niowave will then be a reliable contract sterilization facility capable of sterilizing FDA approved medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and tissue implants. This project will result in an operational sterilization facility by the end of Phase II that can replace high activity source sterilization. The resulting design of this superconducting accelerator based sterilization system will be marketed as a turnkey system in Phase III.",

        "abstract": "Accounting for the geologic conditions in unconventional shales is an important factor in an optimization problem. Placing the wells too close wastes drilling money. Placing the wells too far leaves resources in the ground. Given the fact that a well in unconventional shales may cost $12-20 million, optimizing the well placement of hundreds of wells in a field becomes a very large cost savings and environmental protection technology. Using an optimal number of wells decreases the drilling cost while maximizing production, and decreases the environmental impact of developing the field by using less water, using less sand and chemicals pumped in the well and disturbing less the local communities.  The development team at Z-Terra researched and identified in Phase I a new approach to image with super-resolution small scale faults, reflector unconformities, in general any small scattering objects, by using Diffraction Imaging as a complement to the structural images produced by reflection imaging. By identifying the areas with increased natural fracture density, the reservoir engineers can design an optimal well placement program that targets the sweet spots, areas with increased production, and minimizes the total number of wells used for a prospective area. In the Phase I project we developed Diffraction Imaging prototype software designed to image with super-resolution the small scale fractures in shale and carbonate reservoirs. Areas of increased natural fracture density are associated with higher production wells. The Phase I work accomplished the primary goal of examining the feasibility of imaging small scale fractures in shale reservoirs and improving the Diffraction Imaging technology. In the Phase II project we will research and demonstrate the correlation of the areas with high fracture density in reservoirs with increased oil and gas production, and build the commercial software analytics tools that allow the reservoir engineers to integrate the imaging tools with the reservoir optimization and well planning tools. Several new applications of the basic Diffraction Imaging principles also need to be developed, tools for analyzing and visualizing azimuthal variations of the diffraction amplitudes that in turn reveal information about the fracture and stress distribution in a reservoir, better visualization and post-processing of specularity gathers.  Commercial Application and Other Benefits  High resolution imaging of the small scale fractures in shale reservoirs like Eagle Ford, Bakken, Niobrara, Utica and Woodbine, and the identification of reservoir areas with high natural fracturing (1) reduces the field development cost, (2) improves the production and recovery efficiency by delineating the areas associated with increased oil and gas production in unconventional shale reservoirs, (3) decreases the environmental impact of developing the field by using fewer wells to optimally produce the reservoir, using less water, using less sand and chemicals pumped in the well and disturbing less the local communities, and (4) increases the amount of national oil and gas reserves that can be produced economically.",

        "abstract": "There is a need to reduce the cost and improve the reliability of hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and their supporting infrastructure to enable FCEV competitiveness. Many reliability problems stem from plastic and elastomer seals employed in hydrogen systems that leak and degrade as a result of the extreme temperature and high pressure hydrogen environments. There is a critical need for improved materials are needed that can enable seals to operate reliably at both extreme temperatures (-40T200C) and high hydrogen pressures (&gt;875 bar).  GVD Corporation proposes to utilize hydrogen gas barrier coatings deposited on such seals to shield them from hydrogen permeation and enable reliable, long-term operation. These barrier coatings are based on GVDs novel thin film vapor deposition technology. In GVDs process an inorganic-organic multilayer barrier coatings are fabricated from the vapor-phase and is grown directly on the surface of the elastomer seal. The coating deposits uniformly and conformally over three-dimensional seals and gaskets. Further these coatings are highly flexible and stable at 200C. In Phase I, GVD demonstrated technical feasibility of the concept by depositing flexible, well adhered barrier coating stacks on elastomeric substrates. These coatings survived temperatures up to 200oC while reducing permeability to helium by &gt;50% (equivalent to a 70-90% reduction in hydrogen permeability). During Phase II, GVD will optimize these materials for ease of manufacturing. Demonstration of resistance to high-pressure hydrogen permeability will be shown directly. The deposition process will be scaled up and a production tool designed to handle significant product volumes. In addition, prototype seals will be coated and tested at the bench level by a hydrogen compressor manufacturer and in the field by an industrial user of FCEVs. GVD has also already secured commitment from a commercial partner to bring this technology to market through an existing sales and marketing agreement. Commercial Applications and other Benefits. FCEVs have the potential to significantly reduce US dependence on foreign oil and lower harmful emissions that contribute to climate change. Successful commercialization of GVD barrier coatings for polymer seals will help improve reliability and reduce cost of hydrogen systems employed in FCEVs and their supporting infrastructure. GVD barrier-coated seals developed during this project may also be useful for equipment used in the oil and gas industry and for organic electronic devices such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs).",

        "abstract": "The latest rare isotope and ion beam accelerator facilities used for important nuclear physics experiments require free standing thin film stripper foils, targets and x-ray windows made from low atomic number (low Z) elements such as Be, B and C. It is expected that the currently used thin films will need to be improved due to the much higher beam power densities in the next generation nuclear research facilities including the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). The overall goal of this project is to develop technologies for the production of free standing low Z multi-layer nano-crystalline thin films in the range from a few ug/cm2 to over 100mg/cm2 for applications as charge strippers and targets in heavy ion accelerators as well as x-ray windows for gaseous detectors. During Phase I, the feasibility of the proposed technical approach was experimentally established by fabrication of stress controlled multi-layer films made from low-Z nano-layers, which showed the following results: (i) 3-4X increase in stripper foil lifetime when irradiated with 78Kr14+ beam at NSCL-MSU, (ii) 5X increase in stripper foil lifetime when irradiated with H+ beam at Cardinal Health, and (iii) Pin-hole free hybrid (C-B) windows with low energy x-ray transmission better than the current state-of-the-art 8 micron Be windows. In addition, this technology is being made available to the DOE community through MICROMATTER, which became a UHV subsidiary in July 2014. During the proposed Phase II, a commercially viable, fully automated process and equipment will be designed and assembled for low cost mass production of free standing low Z thin films based on the technology developed in Phase I. These free standing Super thin films will be extensively tested and evaluated for use as stripper foils, high energy targets and low energy xray windows for detectors. The quantitative performance goals for Phase II are: (i) Foil Lifetime : 10X improvement over standard carbon foils for both H+ and heavy ions, (ii) x-ray transmission better than 50% transmission at 525eV (O peak), and (iii) cost: $10-25 per square inch depending on thickness and quantity. To achieve success in this project, UHV has assembled a team of experts with extensive experience in nuclear accelerators, thin film fabrication and analysis, thin film equipment manufacturing, and high energy ion beam testing. These improved thin films will have very significant impact on the operating conditions of the next generation nuclear accelerator facilities, that are used not only for scientific research but also for medical and commercial isotope manufacturing. As an example, the radio-pharmaceuticals manufactured in these facilities are used to treat (radiation therapy) millions of people with cancer around the world. These nano-layered thin films will be immediately added to UHV&apos;s product line to make them commercially available through existing sales channels (www.MICROMATTER.com, www.nanoRANCH.com and www.nanoXRF.com).",

        "abstract": "The availability and continued growth of high performance computing (HPC) is opening new avenues for complex physics based software simulations. The usage of high performance computing is particularly important in high-fidelity large-eddy simulation of multi-physics engineering problems such as the development of more e cient and less polluting advanced energy technologies. Large-eddy simulation is a branch of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). While high performance computing based large-eddy simulation is common amongst researchers, its adoption in commercial industries is still hindered by inherent complexities in utilizing the associated software tools. The proposed solution herein is a web-based platform with user-interface tools that support large-eddy simulation in high performance computing environments. Development through Phases I and II will build a web platform that accomplishes several overall goals:   provides immediate value to large-eddy simulation software usability through stand-alone user-interface tools   creates a collaborative web-based simulation framework that engages computational experts, designers and decision-makers   enables greater knowledge and insight generation from high-fidelity large-eddy simulation data The web-platform user interface tools are targeted at a commercially marketed large-eddy simulation code. This code was developed from turbulence modeling methodologies resulting from the Department of Energys Predictive Science Academic Alliance Program&quot; at Stanford University. During Phase I the web based platform and three user interface tool prototypes were deployed. The platform demonstrated the capability to connect to computing resources that run large-eddy simulation software. The user interface prototypes then simplified tasks associated with simulation setup, interactive analysis and data management. Commercial user feedback on the tools was gathered and assimilated into objectives for Phase II. This second phase will focus on refining the front facing user experience of the web tools while also enhancing their underlying  functionality. For example, one innovative prototype from phase I allowed engineers to interactively inspect simulation data much like a radiologist inspects planar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) output. Phase II will reduce the setup steps associated with this tool and add additional analysis probes to the maps like pan and zoom interface. Probes for data correlations and time animation will require additional back-end features from the large-eddy simulation code. Additional research and development will explore modularization of the web platform to allow a plug-in like capability for new user interface tools. With respect to energy technologies, large-eddy simulation is poised to impact the design of cleaner and more e cient gas turbines. The web platform will ensure that industry users can e ciently derive knowledge from simulation to create design insights.",

        "abstract": "Low cost and accurate monitoring of sequestered gases such as CO2 is critical to insure that these gases are not reentering the atmosphere. Management requires, in part, improved atmospheric and ground monitoring of these greenhouse gases through sensors capable of measuring the subsurface flux, concentration and the carbon isotopologues of CO2 with high accuracy. These Monitoring, Verification and Accounting (MVA) tools needs to meet very strict requirements including; (a) the ability to differentiate between natural and anthropogenic CO2; (b) sensitive to the location of injected CO2 and any potential release; (c) robust enough for operating in harsh environments; and (d) capable of monitoring requirements across the range of storage formation(s), depth)s), temperature(s), pressure(s) and porocities.  The ability to differentiate between natural and anthropogenic CO2 emissions requires detectors that can differentiate CO2 isotopologues. In this program an ultra-sensitive infrared CO2 sensor system, designed to optimally operate at 4.35 m, where both CO2 isotopologues are optically active will be constructed for MVA monitoring. The sensor will be able to accuracy and rapidly measure the concentration and isotopic ratio of CO2 isotopologues, and thus determine the gas origin. The ultra-high performance infrared CO2 sensor will be deployed and field tested at the University of Montanas Zero Emission Research Technology (ZERT) subsurface CO2 field site.  In Phase I an infrared detector optimized for detection at 4.35 microns, which is ideal to detect and measure CO2 isotopologue amounts and ratios, was designed, fabricated, and tested. A methodology for incorporating this into a proven CO2 gas monitoring system at Montana State ZERT facility was also developed. The detector constructed in Phase I will be incorporated into the ZERT gas monitoring system for MVA to monitor sequestered CO2. This will upgrade the system capabilities significantly, and will be capable of discriminating between natural and anthropogenic CO2. After construction, this system will then be optimized and laboratory developed to assure optimum performance and field tested. Commercial Application and Other Benefits A low noise high sensitivity mid infrared detector for use in CO2 monitoring has been developed. This detector is being incorporated into a carbon sequestration monitor that can differentiate between naturally occurring and anthropogenic CO2 in Phase II. This technology can be translated to other applications including monitoring of other greenhouse gasses that have absorption bands in the infrared. This system could also be used to monitor other dangerous gases that have an infrared absorption signature.",

Mu2e will directly probe the Intensity Frontier as well as aid research on the Energy and Cosmic frontiers with precision measurements required to characterize the properties and interactions of new particles discovered at the Intensity Frontier. In order to reach its science goals, detector upgrades are required. A key apparatus of Mu2e is its calorimeter, which will need faster and more UV sensitive photodetectors for reading out the ultraviolet (UV) emission from fast scintillators located in the calorimeter disk.  RMDs silicon avalanche photodiodes (APDs) have been identified as a potential photodetector for the Mu2e calorimeter, however, this will require an epitaxial modification (superlattice doping) of the APD to increase detector UV sensitivity and speed of response. In the proposed effort our optimization will involve exploiting an epitaxial fabrication process, which has been used successfully with silicon CCDs that will improve APD UV sensitivity and temporal properties for the detection of UV scintillation emission.  During Phase I we explored the feasibility of modifying RMDs APD technology with epitaxial processes developed at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). We epitaxially modified RMD APDs, characterized the modified APDs basic properties and demonstrated that we successfully developed detectors that offer greater UV sensitivity with a faster detector response time compared to RMD standard APDs. In Phase II we will continue to improve upon the processes for modifying APDs with particular attention invested towards improving the APD durability, reducing the APD electronic noise, while maximizing the UV sensitivity at 220 nm and attenuating the sensitivity at longer wavelengths through the use of applying passband filters onto the APDs. At the end of Phase II we will have developed and tested calorimeter modules for Mu2e based on RMDs modified APDs. 5. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits Medical imaging modalities such as SPECT and PET, which use blue-UV emitting scintillators, would directly benefit from advances in the proposed technology. Likewise, hand held instruments and vehicle portals used for monitoring nuclear material movement using UV emitting scintillation crystals would benefit as well.

They provide high gain, low noise, and unmatched spatial and temporal resolution. However, their high cost and availability in only relatively small sizes remains a critical barrier to their widespread use in these markets.  In this program high-resolution micro-channel plates (MCPs) will be produced in 8 x 8 inch size, far larger than currently available MCPs. MCPs developed in this program will have high, uniform, and stable gain, and will leverage a key advantage of this technology: that MCPs can be made from glasses chosen to offer attributes such as greater physical durability and lower dark current.  High spatial and temporal resolution is important for applications such as vertex separation and particle identification in ToF measurements as well as water Cherenkov counters and high-resolution sampling calorimeters. It will also benefit commercial applications such as detectors for mass spectrometers, PET scanners, and homeland security applications such as neutron detectors for cargo/vehicle inspection. The advancements made in this program will enable MCP technology to be applied to a much broader range of applications in these markets.  Phase I accomplishments included demonstrations of high spatial and temporal resolution in 10 m pore MCPs made by this technology in 33 mm dia. formats, as well as a clear path for producing these MCPs in far larger sizes. The MCPs produced in Phase I had high, stable, uniform gains of 104 @ 800 V. In Phase II the processes for making these MCPs will be further developed and extended to the much larger 8 x 8 inch size. Gain performance will be optimized, and specific performance benefits will be achieved by constructing MCPs from alternate glasses. Large-area, high resolution MCPs will be provided to early adopters in support of application testing, including particle identification time-of-flight measurements at the Fermilab LArIAT beamline.",

        "abstract": "High efficiency, low cost RF sources are required for proton, ion, and muon accelerators. These sources must be compact and provide precise control of the output power and phase. Currently only large, expensive klystrons can provide this performance.  Calabazas Creek Research Inc. proposes to develop a phase locked magnetron-based system that has phase and amplitude control via a low power amplifier. The system uses phase modulation to control the RF power. The efficiency can exceed 80% and the cost is expected to be less than $3/Watt, significantly lower than other high power amplifiers.  CCR originally proposed to develop a magnetron with a grid for control of phase and amplitude. Detailed simulations showed that this was not a promising approach. The grid was found to be viable only in magnetrons with low duty cycle, and amplitude control was demonstrated; but the grid was found to be not effective for phase locking. Attention was turned to a concept from FermiLab, which is very promising for both amplitude and phase control and does not require a grid.  CCR will develop an RF system providing phase and amplitude control of a 100 kW peak, 10 kW average 1.3 GHz magnetron. Procedures and techniques will be applicable to design of systems at other frequencies and power levels. The program will include development of the magnetron and locking electronics. The system will be tested at FermiLab. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits  Magnetrons can provide high levels of RF power at very high efficiency at low cost. As oscillators, however, their applications are limited. Magnetrons with more precise control of the output power and control of the phase could find wide application in accelerators and colliders. They would also provide improved performance for high resolution radar.",

        "abstract": "There are numerous important applications for high power electron beams. In addition to use for fundamental nuclear physics, possible applications of this type of beam include x-ray sterilization, active interrogation, radiography, and isotope production. Most of these uses rely on a target acting as a bremsstrahlung converter to produce a high energy, high flux x-ray beam. By incorporating an additional conversion process, such a target can also be optimized for positron production. Conventional converters are made of solid, high Z metals with a high melting point, such as tungsten or tantalum. These solid converters cannot absorb more than a few kilowatts of beam power without complicated cooling methods which limit photon or positron flux density. A continuous-wave (CW) superconducting linac creates a potential for machines with very high density photon or positron fluxes, but these require converters which can withstand the higher power of the CW electron beam (~ 100 kW). A liquid metal target removes the concerns of thermal damage to the converter.  We propose to produce a liquid metal target capable of converting high electron beam power (e.g. 10 MeV at 10 mA) into a high flux x-ray and positron source. This design will be collaboratively developed with material science experts from Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Phase I results have led us to choose lead bismuth eutectic (LBE) to serve as a converter and coolant medium which is impervious to radiation and thermal damage. This converter can be optimized for two modalities: creation of a very high density x-ray flux, and maximization of positron production. Testing for both systems will take place at Niowave or the Idaho Accelerator Center (IAC). Most of the technologies the proposed design will draw on are a direct continuation of Niowaves Phase I developments. This includes a natural circulation driven liquid metal converter. A proprietary converter based on an electromagnetic (EM) liquid metal pump has also been developed and successfully tested.  Finally, a mechanically pumped molten metal converter is on the drawing board. The natural circulation driven liquid LBE converters has already undergone preliminary beam conversion and thermomechanical testing with a kilowatt of electron beam power. Once prototype EM and mechanically pumped systems have also been constructed, these loops will be subjected to a similar battery of testing. In addition to beam conversion and thermo-mechanical testing, photon and positron production as well as corrosion tests will be devised and performed at IAC and LANL respectively.",

Currently only 20  30% of the light produced by the OLED can be extracted. In order to be considered as a commercially viable option, OLED lighting efficacy has to improve dramatically. The mismatch between the refractive indices among the active layer, transparent conductive anode layer, ITO, and substrate is a major root cause of light loss. Incorporating any internal light extraction (ILE) layer that address this root cause can dramatically improve the efficacy and lifetime of the OLED device. In this SBIR Phase II project, based on the successful development of an innovative prototype ILE layer in the Phase I, the formulations and processes will be integrated into OLED lighting volume production process for commercialization. Solid-state lighting (SSL) such as light emitting diodes (LEDs) and organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) can lower the US consumption of electricity for lighting and contribute to approximately 50% in energy saving. Even though in terms of technological and commercial development, OLED lighting behind LED, it has several unique advantages.

While GPR is a state-of-the-art subsurface mapping technology, the resolution is fundamentally limited and is a major hurdle to using non-invasive geophysical mapping in many scenarios. In addition, in the many scenarios where GPR is used, the cost to performing a high quality geophysical mapping is high due to the high level of GPR expertise that is required to collect and interpret the raw GPR data. Therefore, novel techniques are required to improve the resolution imagining capabilities of GPR systems.  The proposed HD TomoGPR is a mobile, fieldable high-resolution subsurface 3D image generation system based on unconventional GPR. The system can be used in any situation where an accurate underground visualization is required. Potential use cases include fine-grained root analysis, concrete analysis, and geological surveying of construction sites. The primary benefits, as compared to other GPR systems, are improved resolution ( 2mm) and improved 3D imaging for easy survey analysis. The 3D imaging benefits are derived from the increased data collection (via multiple antenna look angles collected from a stable data collection platform) that supports state-of-the-art GPR tomography to generate high-resolution 3D images.  Phase I focused on the development of the advanced radar system and interpretation software for relatively coarse roots and the investigation of the capabilities to advance the system for fine root analysis. The novel features of Phase I are the implementation of a 10 GHz GPR system and the application of novel GPR tomography to generate 3D pseudo images. Phase I focused on the development of the advanced radar system and interpretation software and the investigation of the capabilities to advance the system for fine root analysis (0.6 mm diameter objects are demonstrated).

The proposed GPR system offers the potential to be easily deployed by domain non-specialist with any RADAR background or expertise. As such, biologist, horticulturist, and life scientist will benefit from the successful commercialization of this technology for a variety of scientific studies and assessments.

Large arrays of detectors are hampered by the large cost of many channels of electronics and the potential for data pile up in fully digital systems. The goal of this program is to develop a basic module that can be used to build larger detector systems with multiple position sensing elements. We will further develop newly discovered plastic scintillators that have neutron versus gamma pulse shape discrimination and couple them to solid-state detectors. We will optimize the light collection and determine the useful energy range while choosing the appropriate level of electronics integration to make a useful module. The phase-I combined RMDs plastic scintillators with its solid-state optical detectors to develop a spectroscopic neutron detector for nuclear physics research and other detector systems. We fabricated materials with various emission wavelengths to match the detection efficiency of the optical detector. Several solid state detectors were compared in measurements of mixed gamma and neutron fields up to 20 MeV.  The Phase II effort is designed to produce a complete module that is tested and developed in a relevant environment, such as the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). The module can then be adapted to multiple applications as a stand-alone unit, or as a single element in a large array of detectors. We will complete the fine tuning of the scintillator properties to maximize the signal from the detector. We will develop the support apparatus for the optical detector. The work will maximize our ability to address the needs of DOE researchers while positioning RMD as a supplier of detectors that allow expanded research at a lower cost of operation and installation. Commercial Applications and other benefits: The proposed detector technology can be used to develop major neutron detection systems at multiple university and national labs across the USA, and additional sites worldwide.

Yet improved scientific instruments are needed to more fully understand and better predict the potential consequences of changes in this environment. Specifically, instruments do not currently exist to simultaneously register 3D topographical information with gas concentration over the widespread spatial and temporal domains needed to understand the tundra dynamics. More generally, this type of 3D imaging technology is needed for a variety of important endeavors including: detecting leaks in oil and gas production and distribution infrastructure, properly recording industrial carbon emissions, and verifying the efficacy of carbon sequestration efforts. The proposed effort addresses these measurement needs by developing a 3D imageing gas sensor, and data analysis approaches to quantify terrestrial system dynamics and functioning. The sensor and algoriths will be used during this effort to advance terrestrial environmental monitoring at the NGEE-Arctic site. The sensor combines existing 3D imaging lidar technology with simultaneous and co-aligned CO2 and water vapor concentration measurements. The data acquisition networks and data fusion algorithms will be used to co-characterize lidar datasets with other subsurface and surface-based geophysical point measurements to greatly improve understanding of controls on greenhouse gas evolution. During the phase I effort, a prototype sensor was constructed, and the feasibility of the measurement approach was verified. Additionally, data fusion and data mining algorithms were developed to detect environmental hot spots and moments that will be key for understanding terrestrial environmental dynamics. If a Phase II contract is awarded, a compact and rugged sensor package will be developed, and adapted for use from a UAV platform to greatly increase the spatiotemporal coverage for terrestrial environmental monitoring. A groundbased version of the sensor will be field tested at the NGEE-Arctic site, and the resulting datasets will be used to study sub-arctic tundra ecosystem dynamics.  In addition to the sensors utility for scientific ecosystem monitoring, this technology is expected to be useful reduce waste and improve efficiency in the energy industry. Potential applications include: methane leak detection from pipelines, well platforms, and holding tanks for the petroleum industry, CO2 monitoring and verification for industrial emissions and carbon sequestration efforts, biomass density and carbon flux estimations in managed ecosystems for agriculture and timber industries, and monitoring and maintenance of critical infrastructure for transportation and geotechnical industries.",

        "abstract": "The two reflectometers at SNS serve rapidly growing communities in the fields of nanoscience, membrane bioscience, surfactant chemistry, etc. Unique capabilities of these instruments include ultrahigh neutron intensity for in-plane diffraction and off-specular/grazing-incidence small-angle scattering measurements, and the combination of reflectometry and high-angle diffraction for resolving large-scale and nanoscopic structural/magnetic features under the same experimental conditions. While the data rates and the Q-range covered by these instruments at a single scattering angle are sufficiently high to permit real time kinetic studies on many systems, currently installed detectors do not meet the performance requirements for such studies.  The development at RMD of advanced neutron scintillators that demonstrate high absorption efficiency for neutrons and exhibit neutron-gamma discrimination by pulse shape (PSD) and pulse height (PHD), combined with recent advances in large-area picosecond resolution photosensors, has nowmade it possible to develop detectors with the potential to realize a transformational impact on neutron detection and imaging. By combining these new technologies, we will develop a detector that simultaneously provides high detection efficiency for thermal neutrons, nanosecond temporal resolution, tileable large area modules, and sub-millimeter spatial resolution while supporting necessary count rates available at the reflectometer instruments. The Phase I research demonstrated feasibility of the proposed detector by synthesizing high performance scintillation materials in special morphology, and by establishing their high efficiency, superior spatial resolution, necessary count rate, and neutron-gamma discrimination properties. Scintillators integrated into various readout sensors formed prototype detectors that were evaluated at ORNL-HFIR to ensure efficacy of the approach. Phase II project is a logical extension of the Phase I work and will focus on large area growth of the identified best performing scintillator composition and the development of a cost-effective readout for special large-area photosensor. A deliverable detector module will be assembled and tested at the ORNL-HFIR.  Commercial applications and other benefits: Large area neutron detectors with fast timing, high spatial resolution, and high efficiency are needed for numerous applications, ranging from non-destructive testing to baggage scanning at entry ports. In addition to safeguarding nuclear facilities, ensuring effective MC&amp;A in facilities, and allowing radiography/tomography in new approaches for spent-fuel storage and processing, improved scintillators and non-3He detectors are critically important to homeland security, nuclear and high-energy physics research, and the development of new sources to effectively address our nations future energy needs. The proposed detectors will also allow scientific research leading to the development of new drugs, materials, and systems that directly impact healthcare and quality of life.",

        "abstract": "Current and future communication and computer networks require affordable, high performance interconnecting wires and cables to take advantage of ultra high-speed communication transmission lines and computational hardware. Existing singlemode optical fiber interconnects are expensive and difficult to install by local users and consumers. To address this problem, NanoSonic is developing low-cost, easily handled polymer optical fibers with bandwidth-distance products greater than 1GHz.km. Short length interconnects of such fibers would allow the transmission of 10 Gb/sec data tens of meters with negligible degradation.  During Phase I, NanoSonic demonstrated the feasibility of fabricating graded index polymer optical fibers using its patented molecular-level self-assembly nanotechnology manufacturing processes. Grading the index of the fiber allows higher bandwidth-distance product, as well as dispersion shifting and dispersion flattening important to maximize the number of parallel channels in dense wavelength division multiplexed (DWDM) systems. Polymer fibers made using conventional methods do not allow the type of index modifications required to achieve such performance. Polymer optical fiber preforms were made by self-assembly, and preforms were collapsed and drawn to create prototype optical fibers. Initial measurements indicated performance close to that modeled.  During Phase II, NanoSonic would work with the Polymicro subsidiary of Molex Inc., a major U.S. manufacturer of optical fiber cables and interconnects, to fabricate and evaluate improved polymer fiber prototypes. First, Phase I manufacturing equipment would be redesigned and reconstructed to incorporate proportional-integral-derivative (PID) feedback control. This would reduce errors in fiber diameter control over long lengths encountered during Phase I, allow the continuous production of kilometers of fiber that meets specifications, and maximize output per unit time while minimizing waste. Polymicro would assist with equipment design based on many years experience manufacturing specialized glass optical fiber products. Second, multiple groups, including Virginia Techs campus communication and computer network, DOE Berkeley and Oak Ridge laboratories, a regional telephone cooperative, a multi-school system data network, and two large U.S. technology companies, would perform beta site testing of short length polymer fiber interconnects. Beta test sites would potentially include GENI and ESnet hardware.  Commercial Applications: The primary application of the graded index polymer fibers produced through this program would be as short length interconnects in high speed communication and computer networks - in other words, as low cost jumper cables up to a few hundred feet in length. Extended applications could include use as fibers with dispersion flattened spectral response that allows increased DWDM channel capacity; complex index grading enabled by self-assembly permits the fabrication of such waveguides.",

        "abstract": "In order to better support network management, network operators need the appropriate network analysis tools and services. However, only a small fraction of collected measurement data is ever examined or analyzed, due to the lack of automated tools. Moreover, current network/cyber analysis tools are typically associated with one specific types of network measurement data. More tools are needed to integrate multiple types of measurement data for a better analysis. All the above impair the network operators ability to accurately and quickly gain the needed understanding of network status and maintaining the network effectively and promptly.  Situation is Being Addressed: To address the above issues, Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI) is developing NetFaultSONAR, a scalable and advanced network fault and cyber analysis tool/services. It takes network data as input from data repository, interpret network status by showing performance metrics, conduct network analysis to detect and identify potential issues, and provide analysis results to the network operators through graphic interface. What was done in Phase I: In Phase I, we successfully implemented anomaly detection algorithms for different types of network measurement data, and tested them using the real data or emulated data. We also implemented the root-cause analysis scheme on a simulation platform, and successfully tested it using the emulated anomalies and validated its feasibility, scalability and complexity. What is planned for the Phase II project: In Phase II, we will further develop NetFaultSONAR to provide better network understanding and data analysis. The core functionalities of NetFaultSONAR system include data collection and preprocessing, anomaly detection, topology/service information retrieval, event correlation across different sources and types of measurement data, root cause analysis, and data visualization.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The proposed network analysis tool has the potential to greatly reduce overall operational costs, whilst maintaining or even enhancing the reliability of existing networks. Moreover, due to the heterogeneous and complex nature of scientific networks, the proposed network and cyber analysis solution can be applied to the operation of a full range of DOE and partner networks, i.e., including ESnet local networks at DOE national laboratories, and those at numerous collaborating institutions and universities across the world. In addition to DOE and partner networks, a broad range of companies and organizations can also benefit from our proposed tools, such as small/ medium company networks, backbone network, DOD military networks, etc.",

Agiltron proposes a fiber based ultrafast 10-micron seed laser that can provide the required specifications and high performance. Its success will directly benefit DOEs compact proton and ion sources. The innovative technology can be used for ultrafast laser generation over the whole mid-IR range, and speed up the development of mid-IR laser applications.Agiltron, Inc. has successfully completed all tasks and demonstrated the feasibility of a fiber based 10-micron ultrafast laser in Phase I of the Program.

Using this mode-locked laser, we demonstrated the feasibility of parametric femtosecond laser generation based on frequency down conversion.

The investigation results of Phase I will be used to optimize the design of the laser system and build a fully functional prototype for delivery to the DOE in the Phase II program. The prototype development in Phase II program will be in the collaboration with Professor Chandrashekhar Joshi, the leader of UCLA Laser-Plasma group. Prof. Joshi discovered a new mechanism for generation of monoenergetic proton/ion beams: Shock Wave Acceleration in a near critical density plasma and demonstrated that high-energy proton beams using CO2 laser driven collisionless shocks in a gas jet plasma, which opened an opportunity to develop a rather compact high-repetition rate ion source for medical and other applications which could be significantly cheaper than that based on RF acceleration.

        "abstract": "Infrared spectroscopy is the most widely used technique for chemical characterization with a worldwide market of over $1B annually, but has fundamental spatial resolution limits of at the scale of many microns. Atomic Force Microscope based infrared spectroscopy (AFM-IR) has recently broken this spatial resolution limit using the tip of an AFM to detect IR absorption with spatial resolution &gt;100X better than conventional IR instruments. AFM-IR has already been successfully applied to many applications, including polymer composites and films, photonic devices, organic photovoltaics, fuel cell membranes, and bacteria for biofuels applications and other energy applications. Unfortunately, the high instrument cost, driven by expensive tunable IR lasers (~$150K), has dramatically constrained the adoption of the AFM-IR technique to top tier universities/national labs and very large companies. While demand is increasing for high resolution infrared spectroscopy at DOE and other synchrotron IR beamlines, there has not been a viable technical approach to interface AFM-IR to these synchrotron sources. As such there is a tremendous opportunity to expand the impact of infrared nanospectroscopy if: (1) the AFM-IR technique can be enabled with a much lower cost IR source; and (2) made accessible to synchrotron beamlines.  Proposal Approach: Following successful Phase I research, the proposer will develop a new low cost mid-IR source to enable a low cost/high performance AFM-IR instrument, covering the full mid-IR wavelength range. The new platform will employ a low cost thermal source in combination with a novel proprietary technology that enables it use for AFM-IR. This effort will leverage previous investments by DOE that resulted in the development of resonance enhanced AFM-IR that enables detection of IR absorption from nanoscale regions of a sample with improved sensitivity. The Phase I research has demonstrated feasibility of key aspects the proposed system, including the feasibility of the low cost mid-IR source and associated spectroscopic measurements. Phase II efforts will (1) optimize and extend IR modulation techniques developed in Phase I; (2) demonstrate resonance enhanced AFM-IR spectroscopy with the low cost thermal source; (3) build a production prototype instrument suitable for customer sample measurements; and (4) demonstrate low cost infrared nanospectroscopy on real world samples. This project will also interface AFM-IR and s-SNOM capabilities to the synchrotron at the DOE Advanced Light Source. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The proposed instrument will provide broadly applicable chemical analysis at the nanoscale on an affordable platform. Specifically, it will provide: (1) ~100X improved spatial resolution compared to convention instruments; (2) lower cost than current AFM-IR instruments; and (3) a platform to interface AFM-IR and s-SNOM capabilities to DOE and other synchrotrons. By dramatically reducing the cost of infrared nanospectroscopy (currently affordable only to multi-billion dollar companies and top-tier universities), this project will make a powerful new analytical technique much more widely and will accelerate R&amp;D in diverse fields including polymers, energy, photonics, life sciences, pharmaceuticals and others.",

        "abstract": "Environmental sensor networks capable of taking data quickly enough to capture minutescale fluctuations and durable enough to capture these data for entire seasons provide essential information for studying the seasonal and annual effects of microbial activity across complete ecosystems. Distributed sensors for subsurface dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration measurement are of particular interest because of the outsized role DO plays in catalyzing a diversity of environmentally important biogeochemical reactions. Commercially available DO sensors cannot provide the desired spatial and temporal density for resolving data over extended periods at the ecosystem level The overall goal of this proposed body of research is to develop a monitoring technology that provides insight into spatial and temporal variations in dissolved oxygen as a result of hydrological factors, such as seasonal infiltration events and excursions groundwater elevation. To accomplish this goal, a cost competitive DO sensor that can operate for months (or longer) in an uncontrolled, outdoor environment without the need for human intervention and/or recalibration will be developed.  The sensor design will allow having multiple sensing sites within a single sensor probe. This will enable data acquisition from multiple probes to generate fourdimensional (space and time resolved) maps of oxygen concentration by importing the timetagged data from the sensors into commercially available geographic information system (GIS) systems. Opti O2 improved the design of its single point DO sensor in order to reduce costs and improve manufacturability. We also changed our electronics approach, with the new approach being based on a proprietary timedomain spectrometer to monitor the emission from the sensing film, for which a provisional patent has been filed. We built and calibrated four of these sensors and demonstrated a signaltonoise ratio of greater than 100 over a period of one month of continuous, interventionless operation. We also completed the detailed design of a segmented/modular sensorprobe. The Phase II project has three overarching objectives. First is to build, calibrate, and qualify a number of multisegment sensor probes, including a base module capable of direct communication to a cloudbased data storage system. Second is to develop a GISenabled program that can gather, analyze, and display 4D (time/space) dissolved oxygen data. Third is to deploy sensor systems at three distinct field sites of scientific interest both to have disinterested thirdparties validate our claims of technical superiority as compared to existing one and to gather DO data of unprecedented accuracy and temporal/spatial density that shall be used by the scientific community to better understand these sites. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Recent USGS studies have shown that dissolved oxygen is a proxy for detecting a broad array of chemicals which would otherwise require an extensive suite of sensors to identify. Since the use of a single sensing modality device greatly reduces deployed, thereby providing realtime environmental assessment. The data gathered from an ecosystem wide network of DO probes will provide water system operators with the information they need to proactively respond to changes in the environment, thereby ensuring the publics access to safe drinking water.",

        "abstract": "The Department of Energy (DOE) seeks useful methods of generating intense beams of reaccelerated rare isotopes for the next-generation Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), currently under construction at Michigan State University. Stopping high-energy, heavy-ion reaction products in fast-release solid catchers is an important method to be developed for realizing intense beams of short-lived isotopes of elemental or molecular species. Short-lived isotopes are expected to play a key role in unraveling the mysteries of nuclear physics, nuclear astrophysics, and fundamental interactions at low energies.  This project will develop refractory tungsten powders as catchers, which retain open porosity after extended heating at high temperatures. The goal is to ensure that the tungsten catcher retains open paths between grains for effusion of atoms or molecules from the catcher to the ion source in order to harvest unused rare isotope beams. Alkalis, noble gases and reactive molecular species are targeted in these measurements. Simulations will be used as a predictive tool for the transient species of interest.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of grain growth suppression in candidate W powders. Offline, ultrahigh vacuum heating of candidate powders showed very low outgassing rates compatible with on-line characterization. Modeling refractory carbides and sulfides to optimize the selective release of specific elements as molecular sidebands was successfully completed. A very sensitive residual gas analyzer commissioned off-line showed excellent sensitivity to detect 13CO molecules released from alumina nanopowder doped with 13C isotopic powder. More rigorous screening of candidate W catchers is planned in Phase II, to ensure sintering-free operation in isotope production conditions. On-line release studies will be conducted with light beams (4He, 7Li, 13C and 18O) followed by heavier beams (136Xe and 120Sn). Predictive simulations of release characteristics will be validated through on-line release profiles. Commercial applications and other benefits:  The immediate market need for these hot catcher materials is the DOE and installations like FRIB that have powerful and unique techniques for rare isotope production. Potential other markets include porous metals, metal foams in thermal management applications and medical applications such as diagnostics and cancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "To address the DoE need for a high-power laser source used for synchronous photoinjection of GaAs photoemission guns, AdValue Photonics proposes to develop a radio-frequency synchronized 100W mode-locked green laser source at a GHz rate. Previously-demonstrated GHz-rate modelocked solid-state/fiber lasers suffer from a reliability issue due to the use of fragile free-space bulk optics for their laser cavities. We propose to develop an all-fiber high-power laser system, which can be synchronized to an external GHz-rate reference signal. Our proprietary high-efficiency rareearth- doped glass fiber technology enables us to develop a robust high-power GHz-rate modelocked fiber laser system. In the Phase I effort, several key concepts of the proposed technology have been demonstrated. The major Phase I achievements include the demonstration of a GHz-rate mode-locked Yb-doped fiber laser, the demonstration of nearly 100W laser out power amplification and &gt;10J-level femtosecond chirped pulse amplification with &gt;20dB gain in 20-30cm long Yb-doped fiber. With these well-demonstrated concepts, we will be able to develop and prototype a highly reliable, compact, high-power, mode-locked green laser for GaAs photoemission guns application. In the Phase II program, we will focus on engineering design for a robust high-power GHz-rate modelocked Yb-doped fiber laser system with a special emphasis on synchronizing the mode-locked laser pulses to an external RF reference signal. The proposed technology will provide a robust light source not only for applications in DoE advanced accelerators, but also for many other scientific and industrial applications, such as optical arbitrary waveform generations, ultra-stable microwave references, telecommunications, material processing, medical surgery, high harmonic generation, and frequency comb spectroscopy.",

        "abstract": "Thyratrons are common components of many klystron modulators. Requiring replacement approximately every 10,000 hours as well as periodic maintenance and adjustment, they represent a high recurring cost for accelerators (and other installations), which are designed to operate for much longer periods of time. A solid-state replacement for these thyratron will improve performance, decrease operating costs, improve reliability, and increase the life of the klystron.  Diversified Technologies, Inc. (DTI) is developing a solid-state switch as an alternative to legacy thyratron equipment. The initial unit produced under this SBIR will be a direct replacement for the thyratrons currently being used at SLAC. The switch will meet or exceed all performance metrics of the existing thyratrons, including physical size and packaging, to allow for immediate installation at SLAC.   In Phase I, DTI successfully demonstrated the technology for a solid-state thyratron-replacement switch assembly. We have demonstrated full operating capability and arc handling for both individual IGBTs and a representative matrix of IGBTs, and peak-to-peak pulse jitter of 1.5 ns, which is five times shorter than typical thyratron performance, and will help stabilize of the LCLS beam.  In Phase II, DTI will optimize the thyratron replacement switch assembly for low manufacturing cost, and will demonstrate the expected reliability through extensive testing under accelerated conditions. Commercial Applications/Benefits: The switch being developed under this SBIR will be a direct replacement of SLACs existing thyratrons-----meeting or exceeding pulse requirements and fitting within the existing modulator cabinet-----enabling seamless integration. Once this device is proven, DTI will be able to inexpensively adjust operating characteristics to meet the needs of other facilities, as this is governed simply by the number and orientation (series vs. parallel) of the IGBTs.",

These individuals need more than the standard visualizations of global-scale temperature and precipitation changes that are currently available on informational websites; they need that data translated into impacts on extreme weather events, urban energy demands, regional food yields, water supply, fire risk, and public health issues specific to their communities. The overall research objective is to develop new software tools that enable non-researchers to visually and dynamically explore climate change data specific to their communities without the need for years of specialized training, complex data assimilation, or huge investments in technology infrastructure. Phase I focused on the issues of computer processing time, data storage capacity, and command-line interfaces that remain a significant barrier to widespread access and use of climate data by local decision-makers. The Phase I prototype is now is able to store and process large amounts of historical and forecast climate change data, as well as general sustainability metrics that complement the climate data and add local context. The prototype will be extended from a Philadelphia-based pilot to nationwide coverage in Phase II. Further, the application will enable client organizations to upload their own local datasets specific to their communities in order to customize the modeling output. This will support compelling new use cases focused on community resilience planning and resource allocation.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Primary customers will be municipal, regional, and state governments that need to support environmental planning, watershed management, and disaster response efforts that are critical to their communities.

        "abstract": "Heavy metal (such as lead, uranium, chromium etc.) contamination is a widespread concern that poses a problem for public health when contaminated water is consumed or enters the food chain. Monitoring our water resources is important to achieve timely remediation. Heavy metal testing is typically done in the laboratory by sophisticated analytical techniques that are time consuming and expensive. A few spot test kits are available, however there is a lack of any accurate, low maintenance, inexpensive continuous monitoring solution.  We will commercialize an on-site, real-time continuous monitoring devise for detection and quantification of hazardous metals at concentrations below the regulatory limits in water matrices such as potable, ground, surface and industrial waters, while generating minimal, non-hazardous waste. It will allow for unattended operations for up to 30-days, while measuring water samples for a specified metal at a frequency as low as 2 minutes. There is a number of benefits which include reduced travel expense (reagents are replaced once every 30 days), monitoring is day and night providing a larger amount of data and human error is low. This will be beneficial for a large number of industries, environmental service firms and local agencies that will be able to monitor their effluent streams, rivers, lakes etc. This devise can be used as a tool in DOE&apos;s environmental management program for monitoring and remediation of water that is contaminated with radionuclides and heavy metals as a result of the range of activities associated with nuclear weapons program, such as in the Oak Ridge site, Tennessee and the Rifle site, Colorado,. In the Phase I project, an initial prototype was designed and developed and tested successfully for detection of uranium. Hardware components were selected or custom made. The continuous monitoring equipment utilizes novel catalytic DNA (DNAzyme) based fluorescent biosensors for effective detection and quantification of hazardous metals. In the Phase II project, we will complete the development of a wall mounted online monitoring device for metals including lead, uranium, cadmium, mercury, copper and chromium. Pre-treatment units will be integrated to allow for monitoring environmental water, such as well, lakes and rivers. It will be deployed at field sites to obtain data for several applications, such as monitoring groundwater and monitoring industrial effluents.",

        "abstract": "With the increase of energy consumption and water stress, power plant cooling, which accounts for 40% of fresh water withdrawal, has been received more and more attention. Dry cooling technology is currently the most feasible solution to reduce this water consumption. However, the cost of the dry cooling system can be more than 5 times of the typical wet cooling system. Increase the dry cooling efficiency and reduce the cost will help the adaption of this type of technology and therefore reduce the cooling water consumption of power plants. The proposed coating technology, Self-Assembled Monolayer (SAM), is able to promote the dropwise condensation, a more efficient condensation mode, to increase the dry cooling efficiency and consequent reduce the capital and operational cost of the dry cooling system. Compared to many other existing hydrophobic coating technologies, the SAM coating has thickness 1 ~ 3 nm that is able to minimizes additional thermal resistance contributed from coating itself, which results much higher heat transfer improvement. Phase I has successfully demonstrated the improvement of condensation heat transfer (six-fold compared to typical filmewise condensation) with the proposed coating technology in the bench top test loop. Phase II plans to further demonstrate the proposed coating technology in the actual components as well as subscale system. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: In addition to the dry cooling system, the proposed surface treatment can also be used for other industrial cooling and condensation applications.",

        "abstract": "Mass Spectrometry (MS) is one of the most widely used analytical techniques for chemical characterization. It is used routinely in a wide variety of industrial and academic laboratories in a wide set of applications such as polymers, pharmaceutics, life sciences, photovoltaics etc. Despite MS being a very powerful chemical analysis technique, when used as the detection system in chemical imaging its spatial resolution is restricted to several tens of microns when used with conventional atmospheric pressure surface sampling methods. On the other hand, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is a powerful technique that can be used for nanoscale morphological and physical property measurements but one of its greatest drawbacks is that it has been chemically blind. Our proposal will bridge this divide by implementing and commercializing the combination of AFM with the definitive elemental and molecular characterization capabilities of MS. Our technical approach is to use an AFM thermal probe to desorb nanoscale sample areas which are then collected, ionized and delivered to a MS Inlet. The feasibility of our technical approach for nanoscale chemical imaging was demonstrated during Phase I where 500nm resolution was shown for real world polymer samples. A wide range of scientifically relevant compound classes were thermally desorbed by applying heat to an AFM probe and subsequent mass spectrometric chemical detection. Chemical images of patterned dye printouts, bacteria, mouse brain tissue and phase separated polymer thin films were obtained. A pre-commercial beta version of the AFM-MS product will be developed in Phase II in collaboration with sub-contractor, Dr. Gary Van Berkel, ORNL Distinguished Scientist and Group Leader of ORNLs Organic Mass Spectrometry Group. The goal will be to enable routine multi-modal, nanoscale chemical imaging of real-world samples provided from a number of private and academic research entities. Desorption, transport and ionization of sample material will be further optimized and new designs will implemented for high sample throughput. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: By utilizing nanoscale MS chemical information, we will target specific applications that will have the most commercial impact such as surface blooming of stabilization additives in polymer manufacturing, discovery of better drug delivery and contaminate free packaging materials and the study of biological functions through the analysis of metabolites in tissues and cells. However, we anticipate significant downstream benefits in broad areas of materials, pharmaceutical, and life sciences application areas including but not limited to the development of advanced pharmaceutics, polymer materials, nano-contaminate detection in semiconductors and electronics, organic photovoltaic materials, automotive materials, materials for energy generation/storage, cell biology, and cancer research.",

        "abstract": "There is a market demand in the area of the coils used in MRI/NMR machines, accelerator magnets and wind generators, for 2212 superconductor-based round wire, if it is available with the capacity to carry higher currents, and without the filament defects commonly present in existing wires. However, 2212 wire that is suitable for meeting this commercial demand cannot be produced until the quality of the 2212 powder, the most vital component that forms the superconducting filaments, is improved. In this Phase 2 SBIR Project, Solid Material Solutions, LLC (SMS) will establish 1) pilot commercial scale production ofn  high-purity 2212 powder by a low cost, single step approach that immediately packs and seals the powder into a container (billet), and 2) development of a powder for packing that enables fewer defects and superior electrical current when processed into wire. The impurity content of this powder is at less than half the levels specified in standard available powder. These developments are important to magnet builders because 2212 wire produced with these billets would be free from many types of filament defects, superior in consistency, lower in cost and able to carry higher current. These improvements are critical to enabling the production of 2212 wire that can satisfy market demand. For the scientific community these 2212 wires will be of benefit in the areas of accelerator, fusion, high field and NMR imaging magnets by allowing the completion of experiments that are critical to making major scientific advances, but which are impossible to accomplish today. For improving health and longevity, these wires would make the diagnostic capability of MRI available to people in many parts of the world where it is now unavailable due to the way the MRI system is cooled. Today the magnet in an MRI machine must use liquid helium to maintain the required low temperatures (4K). Liquid helium is not available in many parts of the world because it is difficult to produce, store and transport. 2212 wires containing our billets will make MRI diagnostics more widely available because these wires can operate in warmer temperatures (20K) that do not require liquid helium cooling. For improving the environment, wind generators made with these 2212 wires will be much lower in weight than present generators (250 tons instead of 400 tons). This weight decrease makes it much more economically viable to build wind generators off shore where wind conditions are more reliable.",

However, limitations with pulsed electron sources in brightness have prevented this technique from achieving its full potential. A brighter ultrafast electron-gun using improved field emission technology would enhance UEM capabilities at leading research facilities, including those funded by the Department of Energy. How this Problem is being addressed Deficiencies associated with conventional field emitters used in pulsed electron sources are being addressed with the development of innovative advances to their design and fabrication methods. These field emitters are projected to exhibit superior operational performance, and also extreme reliability due to their unique capacity of being regenerated to original condition in-situ after undergoing operational degradation from laser and ion impact damage. What was done in Phase I During Phase I research, a high-vacuum test chamber for studying the production of field emission structures using our proprietary methods was designed and constructed. The technical feasibility of the process was completely validated. The characteristics of these field emitters were studied, and an initial test of laser-assisted field emission was demonstrated. Practical means to incorporate this technology into electron guns were devised. A key partnership for Phase II R&amp;D and Phase III commercialization was formed. What is to be done in Phase II A complete electron gun system incorporating this new technology will be assembled. This apparatus will be run in the laser-assisted field emission mode in both nanosecond and picosecond temporal ranges. Some initial experiments will be performed, and the technology will be readied for commercialization. Other potential applications for this field emission technology will also be studied. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits In addition to its application in UEM, the technology being developed here should find productive use in more conventional forms of electron microscopy. Other scientific instrumentation that requires very bright particle-beam sources will also benefit from the superior emission characteristics and durability of this novel field emission technology. This will increase the commercial potential of this project well beyond the specialized field of UEM. Although this proposal is responsive to DOE needs in electron microscopy, this research may also prove valuable for other departmental interests such as high-energy electron accelerators and free electron lasers.",

        "abstract": "National neutron scattering facilities serve a large and diverse community of users in science and engineering. We propose to improve the performance of one of the most basic and critical components of these facilities, neutron guides, by utilizing a novel fabrication method. The guides are neutron-transport optical devices, which are made of hundreds of meters of state-of-the-art mirrors. Currently, each section of guide sides is polished to fractions of a nanometer (called superpolishing). Due the effort required for superpolishing, guides cost contributes a significant portion of instrument construction and operation budget. In addition, glass substrates of commonly used guides are susceptible to radiation damage if placed near (~5 m) the neutron source. We recognized an opportunity to fabricate metal neutron guides at a lower cost and much more stable against radiation damage. Our fabrication technology involves replication of multiple nickel sides from one superpolished mandrel by electroplating. Our electroforming technology produces tens of Ni replica mirrors, preserving the surface quality of the mandrel. Thus, we can produce sides for a long guide for the cost of one or two existing guide sides. Our production method can accommodate all the parameters, which are required of modern guides, in terms of the surface quality, complex geometrical shapes, and multilayer coatings (produced by sputtering, the same method as existing guides). In addition, the electroform replication could be used to supply other neutron optical components, such as focusing and bending mirrors. During the Phase I we fabricated a small prototype section of Ni guide to show the feasibility of our method. During the Phase II, we will fabricate a guide section of the size required by neutron facilities, fabricate multilayer coating, and test with neutron beam. Our new approach to fabrication will immensely benefit neutron-scattering facilities by supplying affordable guides of very high quality.",

Current technology, based on scintillators or silicon detectors is limited in spatial resolution and efficiency. We have developed processes for growing polycrystalline mercuric iodide films directly onto readout chips, providing a direct-converter semiconductor x-ray detector with good efficiency and excellent spatial resolution, and with reasonable cost for large-area devices.

        "abstract": "Direct conversion of shale gas to useful chemicals or fuels has faced the central challenge that reaction rates and product yields high enough to be economic are accompanied by overreaction to full combustion products in either conventional or unconventional approaches. We are developing an integrated process combining alkane activation via oxidative coupling to form ethylene or higher alkene oligomers, which will be followed by direct-fed integrated ethylene to fuels process. A viable direct shale gas to fuels and/or chemicals process offers substantial energy savings with significantly reduced process complexity and capital intensity, as compared to industrially practiced large-scale indirect routes which include methane-steam reforming, followed by watergas shift, and then methanol synthesis or Fischer-Tropsch upgrading. While extensively investigated, this direct pathway is problematic due to reaction engineering constraints. Common features of both the oligomerization and ethylene polymerization reactions include potential to overreactions, especially to combustion products or waxy polymers, reaction rate limitations related to mass transfer, or need to moderate reaction rates due to excessive adiabatic heat of reactions. PCIs reactor technology has been developed to overcome these limitations while maintaining effectiveness of the catalysts. In Phase I we completed proof-of-concept testing that demonstrated the viability of our approach. Specifically, for reactions involving an overly reactive component, in this case oxygen, we were effective in limiting overreaction to carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, enhancing the yields of ethylene, while maintaining overall methane conversion levels, creating a pathway towards developing a economically viable process that will perform equally well in both small and larger scale projects. In Phase II, we will further develop our reactor technology for long term robustness, conduct small-scale pilot unit testing, and develop modeling tools directed at developing a process design package. The overall goal of the Phase II program will be to develop the design and operating specifications to enable a pilot-scale demonstration of our CMT reactor technology for the  ethylene synthesis component of a shale-gas to gasoline or chemicals project. Success would simultaneously cut the costs of transportation fuels while also improving American energy independence and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",

This included preliminary studies of space charge, and a detailed analysis of how chromaticity affects the beam dynamics.

        "abstract": "The accelerator light source community has developed a library of well-validated numerical tools for studying X-ray generation from spontaneous emission. Many of these use approximate techniques, which may neglect key physics. It is therefore necessary to develop a complete framework for start-to-end modeling with a user-friendly interface. RadiaSoft LLC, in collaboration with Brookhaven National Laboratory, will develop an open-source Python framework around the Synchrotron Radiation Workshop (SRW). This tool will be available in the cloud, with support for existing beamlines at light sources from around the world. IPython notebooks will be used to leverage existing scientific libraries, and to provide a user-friendly interface for customers who are not experts in X-ray optics. We successfully containerized SRW for the cloud. We also added a number of physical modules and algorithmic improvements to the SRW library. Finally, we developed an IPython prototype, with simple GUI features, for start-to-end simulations of the CHX beamline at NSLS-II.  In Phase II, we will make SRW more available to the open source community and further expand its library of supported optics. We will also develop the commercial infrastructure required for running IPython-based virtual X-ray beamlines in the cloud. COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS AND OTHER BENEFITS: By making SRW available for subscription-based use in the cloud, RadiaSoft will provide a reliable, accurate, easy-to-use simulation tool for the users at the over 40 synchrotron radiation facilities across the world. This will help fields ranging from crystallography to chemistry to materials science.",

        "abstract": "During this Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project Tetramer will focus on increasing the performance and lowering the cost of on-site hydrogen generation by developing a higher performance proton exchange membrane for the electrolysis of water. Hydrogen generation is a promising technology for renewable energy capture as it has the capability to store massive amounts of energy in a relatively small volume and is highly flexible. With the ever-increasing addition of wind and solar renewable energy to the traditional electric grid, the need for energy storage also grows. In Europe and Japan, hydrogen is already being looked upon as a key part of the energy storage solution, providing a link between the electric grid and gas grid infrastructures.The lack of a hydrogen infrastructure is currently seen as one of the barriers to full conversion to fuel cell cars, which would need no gasoline, thus further reducing our dependence on foreign oil. Hydrogen can also be injected into the natural gas pipelines (thus making that energy carrier more green), used in the production of high value chemicals such as ammonia, or used to upgrade conversion efficiency for methanization-produced biogas. In addition, electrolysis can also provide ancillary services to the grid such as frequency regulation and load shifting. Working with Proton OnSite, a global leader in on-site hydrogen generation with over 2000 installations worldwide, Tetramers early stage Phase I results were very encouraging, demonstrating the feasibility of significantly lowering of energy costs through better performance, particularly with respect to lowering hydrogen crossover and better polarization performance. Tetramer achieved these results by focusing on synthesizing a new lower cost polymer molecular architecture. Phase II will expand on these excellent results by targeting thinner membranes with even less hydrogen crossover at higher pressures and higher durability. During Phase II, Tetramers partner, Proton OnSite, will actively participate in the testing and design of Tetramers membranes. They will then build a prototype system which will demonstrate the commercial value proposition. These activities are expected to generate 15 new jobs in South Carolina and over 100 jobs in Connecticut.",

        "abstract": "Aerosol particles are known to affect the global climate through direct absorption and reflection of solar radiation and through cloud formation. Globally, it is believed that ~50% of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) originate from atmospheric new particle formation and growth. Sulfuric acid vapor plays a key role in new particle formation, although detailed mechanisms remain unclear. Recent experiments have shown that trace levels of organic amine vapors can enhance particle nucleation by 1000 times or more compared to sulfuric acid alone or sulfuric acid plus ammonia. Amine vapor concentrations are typically very low and at the detection limit of current measurement techniques. The evaluation of atmospheric nucleation rates and particle growth is limited by sparse amine vapor measurements and the resulting lack of knowledge of atmospheric amine budgets. The proposed use of amines for CO2 sequestration may increase ambient amine concentrations and has significant implications for aerosol CCN budgets and their cloud interactions. This SBIR project will develop an instrument for the detection of ambient amines with a factor of 10 to 1000 times better sensitivity than current instruments, in order to improve characterization of global amine budgets and our understanding of their role in aerosol formation. We will develop and commercialize a new chemical ionization mass spectrometer that employs sulfuric acid cluster ionization chemistry for the selective and quantitative detection of gas-phase organic amines. The Phase I project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of detecting organic amines and ammonia in the 1 to 10 parts per trillion by volume concentration range in both laboratory experiments and in ambient air using the proposed technology. The Phase II project will focus on further refinement of the sulfuric acid cluster ion source and inlet, calibration schemes, and construction of a prototype instrument with evaluation in both laboratory and field settings. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The initial market for this instrument will be atmospheric research groups at universities and national laboratories with research programs focusing on new particle formation and growth. Larger applications include carbon capture and sequestration pilot projects using amine solvents, amine gas treatment at refineries and natural gas processing plants, forensic science, and breath analysis. We expect that the system developed in this program will yield a significant level of direct commercial sales and contract field measurements.",

        "abstract": "Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) offer exceptional promise for electrical power generation with reduced carbon footprint, but SOFC reliability must be improved. SOFCs utilize ferritic stainless steel sheets as interconnect plates between the fuel and air chambers. They are sealed using alkali earth - silicate glass that remains vitreous at operating temperatures, typically 650-850C. Reactivity of the alkali earth elements in the seal glass with chromium oxide in the steel interconnect leads to diffusion formed voids in the glass, which in turn cause seal failures.  Yttrium stabilized zirconia (YSZ) has been identified as a potential barrier to prevent alkali earths in the seal glass from reacting with the interconnect. To be successful, YSZ with a high degree of density, structural perfection and uniformity must be formed in cost effective way over rough interconnect surfaces. The project will leverage atomic layer deposition (ALD) to form the YSZ barrier. The objective is to demonstrate YSZ barriers with high density and conformality, using a simple masking technique, to permit large production lots of 1000-2000 interconnects, with the barrier limited to the interconnect perimeter. Phase I demonstrated exceptionally dense, adhesive and  uniform YSZ barrier layers on ferritic stainless steel interconnects, and a novel masking technique was developed. Reliability testing, performed by a major fuel cell manufacturer, showed this barrier significantly reduced diffusion at the interconnect/glass interface, demonstrating feasibility of the technology. A detailed cost analysis projects barrier cost in line with DOE targets for a mature process.  All Phase I Tasks were successfully completed.  Phase II will systematically optimize YSZ barrier film performance on ferritic stainless steel, extend the Phase I masking approach to full sized interconnects, and evaluate long-term performance of the barrier. Experiments will employ a prototype coating tool that can process 50-100 full size interconnects. Phase II will result in a completely defined barrier manufacturing process, including design of a full-scale coating system. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits High performance YSZ barrier films will dramatically increase SOFC reliability, which will multiply the demand and applications of the technology, and leverage the expanding supply of natural gas in the U.S. Other thermal barrier applications may benefit from this technology, particularly for use in engines and turbines, leading to increased efficiency.",

However, current manufacturing technology is not able to produce products that are sufficiently cost effective, efficient or stable to succeed commercially. A breakthrough in manufacturing technology is needed to realize the benefits of this new form of lighting.  We are developing a new type of enhanced substrate for OLED lighting that will improve efficiency and performance while significantly reducing manufacturing costs. This substrate is made by roll-to-roll manufacturing and can be adapted to virtually any type of OLED device architecture. We will develop and demonstrate these improvements using both simple white-light devices and commercial white OLED lighting panels.  What was done in Phase I: We made and demonstrated three key structures that significantly improved the performance of OLED devices: an internal nanoarray that increased the extraction of internally (waveguide) trapped light, an inexpensive microlens array that increased the overall internally reflected light output, and a hybrid metal micromesh structure that improved the efficiency and uniformity of the transparent conductor layer.  Our first Phase II goal will be to complete the development of the nano- and microstructure enhancement films successfully begun in Phase I and demonstrate the benefit of these films with functional white OLED devices made by multiple manufacturers and developers. Our second goal will be to begin development of a modular roll-to-roll (R2R) pilot processing line to produce these materials. This will lay the groundwork for supplying large quantities of low-cost enhanced substrate to multiple OLED developers and manufacturers.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits The availability of low-cost OLED lighting will greatly expand the current market for solid-state lighting by extending it into new areas that are made possible with the availability of flexible, thin, lightweight, large-area lighting filmsareas that conventional LED lighting cannot address.

        "abstract": "The continuous push towards higher photon energies and higher imaging resolution  in X-ray analysis systems has brought current state-of-theart X-ray focusing zone plates to a limit of 20 nm resolution at &lt;10 keV photon energies. Zone plates for focusing with same or better resolution at energies up to 25 keV are now necessary for imaging and elemental analyses of multi-element samples, such as nanocomposites, biological or geological samples, and nanofabricated electronic devices. Zone plates with such parameters are not yet available, while even for energies &lt;10 keV, there is a significant shortage of commercially available zone plates, amplified by the demand for these devices in commercial X-ray microscopes.  What is being done: Hereby, Fresnel zone plates with composite architecture will be developed for focusing hard X-rays up to 25 keV with &lt;20 nm resolution, using ultra-nanocrystalline diamond films as a high-performance substrates, electron-beam lithography, Iridium damascene, and a sequential lithography approach for aspect ratio enhancement.   Phase I proved the base steps for achieving such zone plates possible: obtaining flat diamond membranes with different conductivity layers, high resolution electron beam lithography on top of diamond layers, transfer of the pattern into diamond, compatibility of the Iridium films deposited by atomic layer deposition with additional growth of diamond on top, the possibility of polishing metal-coated zone plates without damaging the nanostructures and wafer scale fabrication of zone plates. Phase I also implemented the composite design in conjunction with a novel, superior design of buttresses for preventing the collapse of resist patterns. Phase II will refine some of the processes already proven possible, develop the sequential lithography scheme for enhancing the thickness of the zone plates, and integrate them into one fabrication sequence for obtaining advanced zone plates at wafer scale. The zone plates with composite architecture will be accompanied by suited beam stops and apertures to be tested on X-ray beam lines of the Advanced Photon Source/Argonne National Laboratory, then will become available for commercialization.  Commercial Applications: While developing zone plates for the hard X-ray regime is a significant milestone for X-ray techniques in general with significant ramifications in other sciences, stress free/flat, layered, and nanostructured diamond membranes will dramatically impact a series of other applications, including diamond grids for transmission electron microscopy elemental analysis, electron strippers for proton beam accelerators, pressure sensors, microphones, loudspeakers, and many others with large market potential.",

However, advances in detector technology have not kept pace with advances in synchrotron brightness, leading to limitations on scientific output and research capabilities. General statement of how this problem is being addressed Superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) X-ray detectors based on Ta thin films offer both high energy resolution and high count rate capability, two key features needed to meet growing demands for advanced detectors for synchrotron science applications. Work completed during Phase I and II We successfully fabricated several prototype STJ detectors and detector arrays during Phase I and Phase II. These prototypes have been characterized at the synchrotron, where we demonstrated world record energy resolution using a prototype multi-pixel STJ detector array. Plans for the Phase IIB project For Phase IIB, STAR Cryoelectronics proposes to extend the scope of the Phase II project to develop next-generation STJ detectors with significantly improved energy resolution and speed, both of which will enhance the competitive advantage of this detector technology and accelerate successful commercialization. Commercial applications and other benefits The new X-ray spectrometer based on STJ detector arrays will meet compelling needs for improved detector instrumentation for X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the synchrotron. This powerful spectroscopy technique is used to study the local molecular and electronic structure of specific elements. XAS samples can be highly diluted and generally do not require substantial pre-treatment, and they can range from chemicals and biological samples or tissues to soils and rocks.

One new type of instrument, the wide-angle polarized neutron spectrometer, is severely constrained by the volume of high-quality polarized 3He gas that can reliably be produced. In a prior project, our team developed a prototype large-scale 3He polarizer with potential for addressing this need. By illuminating a large multi-liter glass polarizer cell inside a pressure vessel with a 1.2 kW wavelength-locked laser, we had demonstrated spin-up rates of 20% per hour for 50 STP liters, a world record. During Phase 1 of this project, we designed and had built an industrial-scale titanium vacuum pump. During Phase 2 we assembled a test rig with uniform field, transfer lines, and diagnostics. We demonstrated that this compressor could evacuate polarized 3He from an analyzer into a reservoir while retaining 3He polarization within a few percent. A second goal, the development of commercial-ready software and hardware infrastructure that could operate the system stably over time periods of several days was also achieved. Finally, the third Phase 2 goal, and much of the effort, was directed towards fabricating, filling, and testing 8.5 liter aluminosilicate glass cells for the polarizer. We were successful in flawlessly fabricating and filling three GE180 cells, achieving lifetime over 12 hours and delivering our ultimate polarization of 60%. Calculations show that additional tuning of the laser could have provided as much as 70%. We propose a sequential Phase IIB continuation of this project for new research and development tasks that extend beyond the scope of the original Phase II grant. Firstly, we will investigate new cell preparation techniques, including applying sol-gel coatings on these 8.5 liter cells fabricated from both borosilicate and aluminosilicate glasses to achieve long 40+ hour lifetime and high polarizations of 75% or more. Secondly, we will pursue 85% polarization by implementing a novel architecture external cavity pump laser we recently invented that can produce multi-kilowatt output at line-widths much narrower than any commercially available pump laser, as low as 30pm. Thirdly, we propose to demonstrate our 3He gas circulation and polarizer technology at a US neutron scattering facility as an essential first step of our commercialization strategy. Opportunities for commercializing this technology are outstanding. New large-angle neutron scattering spectrometer installations at laboratories throughout the world are actively seeking turnkey commercial polarized 3He solutions, while spin-off applications include neonatal lung imaging and optical pumping of alkali vapor lasers for missile defense.",

In order to effectively mitigate these breaches, traditional corporate border security needs to transition to a defense in depth cyber security posture. As networks get faster, such as the DOE ESNet and corporate datacenters such as Target and The Home Depot, it becomes more difficult to gain network visibility across the whole enterprise. The technology developed in this proposal will enable such network visibility, even on the largest and fastest networks available today.We have developed a scalable cybersecurity technology  called R-Scope that at its core can inspect every packet transiting a network to determine where that packet came from, where it is going, and the type of communication it is carrying.  This data can then be used to craft policy which can alert when anomalous events take place, such as the exfiltration of data (credit cards, personal identification, critical intellectual property, or even the latest movies) off premises to foreign computer systems. Through the Phase I and Phase II efforts,  we engaged in basic R&amp;D to address the notion of &quot;performance collapse&quot; in a network cyber security appliance.

        "abstract": "Driven by emerging industry standards, electric utilities and grid coordination organizations are eager to seek advanced tools to assist grid operators to perform mission-critical tasks and enable them to make quick and accurate decisions. The emerging field of visual analytics holds tremendous promise for improving the business practices in todays electric power industry. However, the conducted investigation has revealed that the existing commercial power grid visualization tools restrict the visualization process to follow a limited number of pre-defined patterns created by human designers, thus hindering users ability to discover. In the final analysis of the 2003 East Coast Blackout, lack of situational awareness was cited as one of the contributing factors which aggravated the severity of the event.  This project proposes a data-driven approach to interactive visualization of power grids. The proposed approach relies on developing powerful data manipulation algorithms to create visualizations based on the characteristics of empirically or mathematically derived data. The resulting visual presentation emphasizes what the data is rather than how the data should be presented in a pre-designed manner, thus fostering insight and enabling knowledge discovery. The proposed data-driven visualization approach, as demonstrated in the successfully completed Phase II  project, has proven to be promising for building the next-generation power grid visualization tools.  Application of this approach has resulted in a state-of-the-art model exploratory tool currently licensed by  many utility organizations and vendors in the power industry. The supported use cases range from  exploratory data analysis to visual data mining. Users have been proposing integrating the developed data-driven visualization solutions with their legacy utility information systems to provide added values. The proposed sequential Phase IIB of this project will focus on extending the pioneered data-driven visualization techniques to enhance situational awareness in a power grid control room. The goal is to assist system operators to perceptually monitor a large number of events and present the analytical information in a way that reduces cognitive demands on operators. The proposed research will be executed in collaboration with two industrial partners. The emphasis will be put on providing utilities with a rapid and cost-effective integration solution without requiring an overhaul of the existing utility information infrastructure. It is expected that the research to be performed will result in a commercialgrade real-time visualization tool that can be integrated with the existing utility information infrastructures, providing much-needed situational awareness and real-time decision support.",

This will serve as a conduit for productivity-improving research to show up in the hands of US manufacturers. Phase I research enabled the evaluation and mitigation of key risk factors affecting the integration of the FieldView Client (GUI and graphics core) with VisIt. The plan called for three primary research tasks, resulting in the development of two prototypes, all with the goal of understanding the best way to integrate the FieldView client with the VisIt server. Phase II research enabled successful, early integration of FieldView with the VisIt server, establishing a viable path forward while revealing additional complexities. Phase II also resulted in the creation of an in situ workflow that can accelerate simulation post-processing by creating extract databases for analysis in FieldView. These activities brought credibility when early adoptors were able to create faster workflows based on the developed technology.  Phase IIB will address performance concerns in VisIt that could inhibit its ability to serve in a commercial environment where users must often do more with less and still make good decisions. VisIt will be enhanced in key ways that make it faster and more able to adapt to upcoming exascale architectures. Research from phase IIB will also address the user interface challenges associated with tablet and mobile computing. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  VisIt performance enhancements will enable a growing group of companies to accelerate their workflows and get their products to market faster. A hardened version of VisIt will be made available commercially under a subscription pricing model.",

        "abstract": "The effectiveness of synchrotron radiation science has been hindered by the limited availability of advanced diagnostics. In many cases, the capability to produce photon fluxes has outpaced the ability to detect and measure the resultant photons. Synchrotron applications are becoming more demanding as beamlines are being designed with brighter sources, smaller focal spots, and wider energy ranges within a single beamline. A novel diamond-based transmission beam monitor has been shown to have unprecedented linear behavior combined with the ability to determine intensity, position and timing suitable to meet the user demand for increasingly high flux, small focus size, and beam stability. Products based on this novel concept will provide a valuable new tool to fully utilize the worlds brightest synchrotrons.  Researchers at national laboratories have developed proof-of-principle monitors that demonstrated the core capability of the diamond-based monitors in terms of measuring beam flux and position. The proposed program builds upon these developments and takes a broader look at the needs of the Synchrotron radiation community in contrast to the current state of development.  Phase I completed a commercial engineering study on the existing technology and determined that it is feasible  to produce a suite of diamond detectors to meet current and future diagnostics needs. The Phase II effort completed the feasibility investigations and advanced some core manufacturing techniques to the point where basic commercial devices can be produced. Phase II also initiated investigations into advanced techniques that would enable higher performing and potentially more cost effective devices to meet more demanding x-ray beam monitoring applications. The current state of development falls short of meeting beam monitoring requirements for soft x-ray and ultra-high flux applications. Additional research into techniques for diamond thinning, metallization processes and materials, readout electronics and diamond characterization is required to fully realize the potential of this novel diamond-based monitoring technique.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits This program will provide commercial beam monitors with functionality not available today  that being an xray  beam monitor robust enough to accommodate the high x-ray beam fluxes from 3rd generation synchrotron beamlines, while also retaining the sensitivity to observe monochromatic beams on a per pulse basis. In addition, it will enable closed loop beam diagnostics to aid in the troubleshooting and optimization of current and future beamlines throughout Synchrotron radiation community.",

        "abstract": "THz technology has a rapidly growing number of potential applications in solid-state, nuclear physics, medicine, biology, remote sensing, imaging, industry and communications. However, THz radiation facilities based on FELs, electron storage rings, and/or energy recovery linacs are too large, expensive, and not readily available for a broader community of users to operate it on a flexibly customized, on-demand, and independent basis.  In this project we are developing a compact and much less expensive coherent terahertz source that allows generation of high peak and average power. The approach uses microbunching provided by the beam compression in an alpha-magnet, beam pre-bunching in the RF gun, and resonant Cherenkov radiation in a robust radiator. The THz radiation in the source can be accompanied by synchronized, intense, sub-ps bursts of hard X-ray radiation for additional capabilities.  Phase II tasks have been completed and all objectives were met. All the source components including the THz beamline, 2D steerable radiator integrated with antenna and bending magnet, table-top alpha magnet with moveable scraper and diagnostics ports have been designed and assembled at the APS Injector Test Stand facility. THz radiation was successfully produced at 0.52 mm wavelength, ~ 330 J/cm2 macropulse energy density, and 7% bandwidth, which is close to that simulated.  In response to the desires of our beta customer, the APS light source, in Phase IIA we will design, fabricate, assemble, and commission a prototype of a turnkey tunable THz source. A new system will be designed and tested to provide frequency and spectrum tunability. The system will allow in-vacuum manipulation to change the gap, angle, absolute and relative positioning of the slow wave radiating structure. One part of the radiator system will be designed to provide radiation frequencies over 2 THz by using a CVD diamond coated structures and 3D periodic micro-structures. Another part of the radiator system will provide broadband radiation by using a tapered structure in combination with a micro-wiggler. A novel steering system with capability of precise beam translation would enable to maximize the radiation intensity and switch the beam interaction with the radiator parts having different dispersion. The components and entire system will be tested and commissioned at APS Injector Test Stand facility.",

        "abstract": "Infrared spectroscopy is the most widely used technique for chemical characterization with a worldwide market of over $1B annually, but has fundamental spatial resolution limits at the scale of many microns.  Anasys pioneered the field of Atomic Force Microscope based infrared spectroscopy (AFM-IR) which recently broke this spatial resolution limit using the tip of an AFM to detect IR absorption with spatial resolution &gt;100X better than conventional IR instruments. The research and development efforts that have occurred during the Phase I and Phase II projects have demonstrated the capability of a new technique called Resonant Enhanced AFM-IR with sensitivity  more than 100X better than current commercial AFM-IR capabilities, allowing chemical analysis down to the monolayer level. In addition, we have demonstrated the ability to perform Resonance Enhanced AFM-IR measurements in liquid opening a range of new applications. Unfortunately the Resonance Enhanced AFM-IR technique has two key limitations which this proposal seeks to solve: 1) Operation in liquid is still not of sufficient sensitivity for many research applications 2) The Resonance Enhanced AFM-IR measurement is not fast enough for substantial commercial adoption. Proposal Approach: We will use a combination of new cantilever designs; new detection techniques and algorithmic and electronics improvements to achieve our goals. Our sub-contractor in this proposal is our longtime collaborator Prof Mikhail Belkin of UT-Austin who is a co-inventor with Anasys of the Resonance Enhanced AFM-IR approach and an expert in the field. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: It will enable the AFM-IR technique to penetrate the large and important Life Sciences field where it is required that samples are hydrated. The speed improvements will make it a powerful new analytical technique that will be adopted much more widely and will accelerate R&amp;D in diverse fields including polymers, energy, photonics, life sciences, pharmaceuticals and others.",

        "abstract": "Hydrogen production for mobility and energy storage from proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis is attractive due to its efficiency, ability to quickly cycle up and down, and deliver hydrogen with high and differential pressure. However, capital costs are high due to expensive materials, especially the membrane and catalyst. Though membrane costs are predicted to decrease, precious metal catalysts costs will come to control capital costs as this technology matures. Decreasing the precious metal requirement for PEM electrolysis is therefore vital for the wide spread use of this technology. The overall objective of the Phase IIB project is to commercialize low precious metal loading, high-performance catalysts for PEM water electrolysis that we have successfully developed in our Phase II project, which may significantly lower the capital cost of water electrolyzers.  In Phase II project, we have developed and demonstrated two advanced catalysts. These two catalysts enable reduction of the precious metal catalyst loading on the anode by an order of magnitude, while maintaining performance equivalent to an industry-standard anode. These catalysts also demonstrate good endurance over a 1000-hour test.  In the proposed Phase IIB, we will further develop and transition the innovative catalyst synthesis technology to successful commercialization. First, we will scale up the catalyst synthesis process to make short production of these catalysts. Second, we will develop an effective Membrane and Electrode Assembly (MEA) fabrication process to make reproducible and full-sized MEAs. These MEAs will be subsequently integrated into large-size electrolyzers to test their performance and durability. The success of the Phase IIB project will lead to the commercialization of these advanced catalysts for hydrogen production from water electrolysis. These catalysts enable reduction of precious metal catalyst loading on the anode by an order of magnitude while maintaining performance equivalent to an industry-standard catalyst. Alternatively, operating costs (dominated by the cost of electricity), the highest cost of PEM hydrogen production, can be lowered by increasing the loading of these catalysts. These combined efforts will make the commercialization of PEM water electrolysis for production more viable.",

        "abstract": "Superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities are being successfully used for acceleration of charged particle beams worldwide. In addition, the application of SRF cavities for the manipulation of beam properties in the transverse plane finds more and more applications. The use of superconducting structures allows very high deflecting fields in a compact structure, highly desirable feature for applications involving manipulations of the charged particle beams at the point of delivery, such as Final Focus (FF) point. Using superconducting deflecting structures in future SRF accelerators allows for further increases of the interactions of existing colliding beams, and hence the overall machine performance. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been gradually upgrading its performance since its commissioning in 2009. LHC will be at the energy frontier in high energy physics for many years to come. Even before initial commissioning, plans have been under discussion for an upgrade, in particular toward an increase of its luminosity. One avenue that has been under discussion is the introduction of a bunch deflecting scheme (also called a crabbing scheme) to restore the luminosity lost due the finite crossing angle. The Large Hadron Collider has identified SRF deflecting cavities as a way to increase luminosity for the upcoming High-Luminosity (HiLumi) Upgrade. The technical objective of this Phase IIA continuation project is to fabricate the helium vessel, HOM dampers and tuners for the SRF deflecting cavities to be used in the HiLumi Upgrade. To meet the HiLumi Upgrade schedule, these fully dressed cavities must be at CERN by the end of calendar year 2015, integrated into a cryomodule in 2016, and ready for installation at SPS in early 2017. Compact equipment utilizing SRF cavities can be successfully used in a broad range of applications from increasing beam luminosity in colliders, to manipulation of the correlation between the longitudinal and transverse phase space projections of the beam particle distribution.",

These activities lead to back injuries which account of 36% of work place injuries. This project will result in an assistive technology to reduce injuries in these workers. There are many workers in shipbuilding and construction sites who perform tasks which cannot be assisted by available technology. Robotics and automation fields do not have solutions in the near horizon to automate these tasks. Therefore, workers are an essential part of these industries. The technology proposed here will make the workers? environment much more pleasant, prevent them from getting disabled and maintain their quality of life. As back injuries cost the US alone 20 billion dollars annually in direct and indirect costs, the technology proposed will not only benefit workers but also employers. Addressing a pain point that costs billions of dollars globally each year gives this project strong commercial potential. The evaluations performed during this project will reveal the technology?s effect on workers? back. This will create an opportunity for other institutions to investigate fundamentals of human back pain or back injuries. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will improve the lives of workers and reduce financial burden on companies by developing a Trunk Support Exoskeleton (TSE) to reduce back injuries in workers caused by stooping and bending. Back injuries account for a large number of work place injuries. The goal of this project is to develop technologies based on user and customer recommendations, issues encountered during field evaluation, and experimentally evaluate the technology. The tasks include analysis, design and evaluation to reduce separation between the exoskeleton and the user, experiments and design to ease workers during prolonged low angle stooping and determining the requirements for walking while bending. It is expected that these features will make the technology more attractive and useable to users and customers. In addition, to evaluating the technology to validate the features above, experiments to quantify the performance of the technology during activities similar to those that workers would encounter will be performed. It is expected that the technology will reduce the participants? strain on their lower back without reducing their performance.",

        "abstract": "High Performance Computing technology has advanced significantly, and advanced parallel computers are being built, with DOE leadership.  Yet, the American engineering and manufacturing industry has not started leveraging parallel computing at a significant level, partly because of the challenging nature of modern simulation software. US competitiveness in manufacturing may suffer due to its ineffective utilization of parallel computers. The Charm++ parallel programming system, developed at a University with DOE and other federal funding, has demonstrated promise in handling complex dynamic parallel applications in computational science.  It automates resource management, tolerates failures, and can manage power/thermal issues. The objective of this project is transform Charm++ into a robust and easy to use system, with new runtime capabilities targeted to industry applications. The Phase I effort focused on analyzing the parallel computing  needs of manufacturing/engineering industry, and refactoring the Charm++ software to retain its unique and innovative features that are of importance to this industry, while streamlining  the software. Many features were identified as unnecessary; often vestiges of past academic research, and carefully removed.  Performance estimation and tuning was carried out for common platforms used in industry including Infiniband and cloud based clusters. New features were implemented to eliminate unexpected errors, and enhance ease of use. During Phase II, extensive innovations and improvements are being made to the Charm++ system to (a) improve ease of use for new Charm++ programmers, (b) increase robustness of the software, and (c) to extend the runtime capabilities to address industry needs.  New capabilities will include improved accelerator support, Fortran support, further automation and auto-tuning of functions such as load balancing, resilience and power management. In addition, we will demonstrate the utility of Charm++ by developing a new application in collaboration with an ISV.Commercial  Applications and Other Benefits: The SBIR project effort is aimed at producing a commercially viable product based on Charm++  that incorporates innovative  research on object-oriented  parallel programming with adaptive run-times. It will be the main commercial application to result directly from this effort. In addition, it is expected that libraries developed using Charm++ product will be an additional category of commercial applications. Some of these may come from Charm works, Inc., but it is expected that many, in future, will come from other companies. End-user applications are probably the largest cate- gory of commercial applications enabled by this project effort.

        "abstract": "Linear colliders based on two-beam wakefield acceleration have an intrinsically modular design. A fundamental requirement of two-beam wakefield acceleration that has yet to be demonstrated is the staging of sequential accelerating modules. For a successful staging demonstration two key things have to be addressed: drive beam separation and the timing between the accelerated beam and wakes from different stages. Previous methods addressed the timing issue by sending the drive beam through a 180 degree bend, but this leads to problems with coherent synchrotron radiation and subsequent degradation of beam quality.  We propose to use a fast stripline kicker for drive bunch train management. We estimate that the power   requirement   and   turn-on   time   are   well   within   a   grasp   of   current   technology. Synchronization of the main (witness) beam with wakefields generated by the drive beam can be done by a series of variable microwave power delay lines, which eliminates the need to bend the drive beam. We propose to use an overmoded TE01 mode based cylindrical waveguide as a delay line because of the reduced power loss of this mode. In  the  Phase  I  project,  we  have  designed  and  built  all  necessary  hardware  to  setup  and demonstrate a major component of the staging process. Starting with initial staging experiment early in the Phase II work, we will demonstrate the entire staging process by the end of the project. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Staging is a key experiment that has to be demonstrated for the validation of the wakefield collider concept. If the main (witness) beam can be made synchronous with the drive beam wakefield generated in separate stages, and preservation of the main beam emittance can be shown, then a collider at a given energy can be designed by just stacking together the required number of wakefield modules.",

New higher energy (2-20keV) applications also need as an alternative to beryllium foil windows. Beryllium is increasingly not useable due to foil defects, toxicity, and high cost. During Phase I, Luxel successfully demonstrated the feasibility of X-ray windows which meet these emerging needs. Phase II windows will feature large areas, high soft X-ray transparency, improved cryogenic shielding, and compatibility with overall ultrahigh vacuum system requirements, such as baking to 150C. Luxel will also adapt the Phase I innovations to soft X-ray sources, such as those to be used in semiconductor metrology. Anticipated benefits are consistent with the stated needs of the Department of Energy, as expressed in the Phase I request for proposal, the 2012 Basic Energy Sciences detector workshop, and by strategic plans for various DOE facilities. Improved windows will enable lower dose imaging of human soft tissue, higher detectivity of trace chemicals, better probing of the early universe, and new imaging spectroscopy methods. Instruments for studies of pulsed nuclear fusion at Sandia, the National Ignition Facility and Los Alamos will become feasible. The windows will improve capabilities for high harmonic generation and for pulsed energy studies, such as at free electron lasers beam lines.  Higher source intensity will increase the capabilities of X-ray semiconductor manufacturing metrology in 2017 and beyond. Anticipated DOE benefits also include improved personnel safety, by providing a nontoxic window that has equivalent or better performance than beryllium for many applications.  The DOE Chronic Beryllium Disease Prevention Program identifies reduced exposure as a primary path for improved beryllium safety. The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Safety Committee lists Elimination as the highest hierarchical element for improving beryllium safety. Phase I investigations focused primarily on the use of high precision lithography for producing large windows and cryoshields with high soft X-ray transparency. Associated membranes and high temperature bonding were developed to take advantage of the new structures, resulting in unparalleled window area, soft X-ray transparency, and thermal infrared blocking. Phase II will combine grids, meshes and membranes optimized for cryodetectors, general use X- ray windows, and soft X-ray lithography source windows.  The Year 1 activities will focus on refining the Phase I innovations, and providing prototypes for user feedback. Cryoshields will be optimized by fabricating and testing numerically simulated designs.  A light-element ceramic will be optimized as a soft X-ray window material.  A high temperature bonding operation will be refined to minimize organic content and increase the membrane use power. Feedback will be solicited from users, such as those identified in the attached letters, and other users at National Institute of Standards and Technology and DOE facilities.  Based on that feedback and further integration of the processes, a final round of prototypes will be fabricated in Year 2, which provide a final combination of the elements developed in Phase I",

The SNS at ORNL needs improved H- source performance to meet upgraded SNS requirements. The PIP-II Proton driver at Fermilab needs a CW H Ion Source to satisfy demanding performance specifications: 10 mA CW beam current with normalized transverse rms emittance 0.2  mm mrad, fast chopping capability, fast intensity variation, and high availability. Many other new accelerator projects need CW and pulsed H- beams with performance exceeding those achieved today. Currently, there is no H- source that satisfies such demands. In this project we propose to develop novel modifications of H- source designs which will satisfy these requirements. The new source is an advanced high duty factor (up to CW) version of a saddle antenna (SA) RF Surface Plasma Source (SPS) with improved efficiency, up to 15 mA average current, improved electrode cooling using new materials, new cesiation procedures for reduced cesium loss, longer lifetime by suppressing electrode sputtering, immunity to electrode shorting, and push button operation. The design of the advanced SPS with SA RF discharge was developed including optimized H- emitter, cesiation, beam extraction, formation, and transport.  A  prototype  of  the  CW  SA  RF  SPS  has  been developed  and tested for validation  of the feasibility  to produce the necessary  parameters.  Relative to previous RF sources, the specific efficiency of positive ion generation was improved to 200 mA/cm2 kW (a factor of 40) and the specific efficiency of negative ion generation was improved to 20 mA/cm2 kW (a factor of8).

Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The primary application of the new source to be developed in this project is for high intensity proton drivers that might be used for Spallation Neutron Sources and energy and intensity frontier discovery machines.  The source is also an upgrade path for many existing and planned applications for medical treatments  (including  hundreds  of  cyclotrons  with  external  injection  for  isotope  production),  cancer therapy, high-current tandem accelerators for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, and homeland defense to produce resonant gamma ray techniques to detect explosives and Special Nuclear Materials.",

In Phase I, TeraSys demonstrated the feasibility of SIFTer through modeling and simulation, showing that SIFTer is able to extract specified waveforms from noise and meet the Armys size, weight and power-handling targets. In Phase II, TeraSys will develop a hardware prototype less than 0.10 cubic feet in size and demonstrate the utility and advantages of SIFTer in specific Army applications, setting the stage for Phase III transition through programs such as PdM EWIs RF Interference Mitigation (RIM).

        "abstract": "The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in revolutionizing the current mechanical system design practice across multiple industry sectors. Rather than using multiple rigid parts to create a mechanical system, our compliant design method, inspired by designs in nature, exploits material elasticity to create one-piece compliant systems or joint-less mechanisms. Our compliant design software will provide designers with a powerful tool to create products with dramatic reductions in part count, thereby reducing manufacturing cost ( at times eliminating assembly operations altogether), enhancing reliability and precision in ways that could not be achieved through conventional design methods. By replacing assembly-intensive products with compliant designs that have substantially lower assembly burden, manufacturing in the U.S. could be more competitive. For example, our compliant wiper has 75% fewer parts, weighs 50% less, and costs 60% less to manufacture in Detroit compared to conventional multi-piece wiper that is made in China. Thus, technically skilled machine operators producing one-piece designs would create value locally, without the burden of shipping costs and delays, to tip business equation away from offshoring. Thus, broad adoption of compliant design as enabled by our software will lead to more \"Made-in-USA\" products. This project seeks to develop a framework for Integrated Computer Aided Engineering software for compliant designs. While commercially available design software can assist users in evaluating conventional mechanisms with rigid links and joints, there is no readily available software tool on the market to create (synthesize) and optimize the design of compliant mechanical solutions. Compliant design synthesis algorithms seen in existing research literature often require specialized knowledge that \"non-\u00adexpert\" users might not have, and the algorithms are often not robust enough to consistently create feasible designs. In Phase I, we laid the theoretical and the computational foundation needed to develop a unified compliant design framework. Starting with functional design specifications such as desired motion output(s), and input actuator(s), the algorithms will (a) determine an optimum topology (i.e., how material should be distributed within a prescribed 2D or 3D space), and (b) optimize the size, shape and geometry to meet performance requirements such as fatigue life (stress constraints), manufacturing constraints and dynamic response. In the proposed Phase II effort, we will refine the user-\u00adinterface and extend the functionalities to integrate all key elements into a field-\u00adready commercial package that enables both expert and non-\u00adexpert designers to create compliant design solutions.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:High speed photography is a valuable tool for the analysis of a great many phenomena. As higher speed events are captured, it is necessary to provide an increasing amount of illumination to maintain proper exposure levels to match the decreasing exposure times. Flash sources are desirable to provide a large amount of light for a short time before significant heating can occur. Nanohmics proposes to develop a robust and reusable replacement for the standard PF300 flash bulb. By employing light emitting diodes (LEDs) as a source, operators will have precise control of flash initiation, duration and intensity, resulting in increased reliability and quality of the photographic data captured during a high speed test event. Additional benefits will be in the form of elimination of the recurring cost of flash bulbs and decreased time for test setup. The high intensity source developed in this program, FlashLED, will consist of an LED array with an optical output in excess of 500,000 lumens. This results in more illumination than a single PF300 bulb for the target area. Longevity testing has shown it will operate with no degradation after thousands of flashes which translates to decades of service at the Holloman High-Speed Test Track.BENEFIT:The market for flash illumination continues to demonstrate significant annual growth for both the military and civilian markets, growing to over a billion dollars in 2013. As these units become smaller, less costly, and more useful to a wider variety of industries, they become incredibly valuable as they decrease the cost of testing for military and industrial products, among others. Specifically, the compact and high power flash illuminator that Nanohmics develops will provide increased benefit by providing a more timely response, enhanced portability and a wider range of test conditions.",

This effort combines our unique expertise in instrumented-Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) with new approaches in MA of reactive powder blends to develop a new generation of tunable high density structural reactive materials. Unlike conventional steel warhead casings that provide only kinetic energy, the structural reactive materials are designed to provide the same structural support, but with the added advantage of activating highly exothermic thermo-chemical reactions upon impact with the target. As the high temperature reactions proceed to completion they release an extreme amount of thermal energy that is not provided by conventional munitions.

New space vehicles, even small satellites, are significantly more capable than their predecessors. Concepts like disaggregation and hosted payloads are driving mission timelines to new extremes. Gone are the days of 10-year development cycles. New ground systems need to support quick turn programs and multiple missions. They need to be agile and allow for field modification of ground system resources.  Software-based front-end processors and T&C applications are a key part of this transformation. Combining a software-based FEP with basic T&C capabilities, in a user-configurable, low cost platform becomes a game changer.  BENEFIT:  The creation of an integrated software-based FEP and T&C system has wide applicability in the ground satcom, satellite bus test and data acquisition markets for both government and commercial customers.  We also foresee incredible potential in the CubeSat, hosted Payload, test, and launch domains. These require agile, light weight ground systems that are user modifiable. These systems lower both initial and life-cycle costs in each market.  As these systems evolve to support new or expanded missions the functionality can be adapted quickly by non-programmer personnel.",

TIMs aim to ensure a continuous thermal conductivity path between the heat source and heat sink/dissipater, thus permitting the efficient operation of electronics. The major impediment to achieving reliable TIMs is high thermal interfacial resistance, which increases over time due to introduction of air pockets and the loss of contact between the meshing surfaces under thermal cycling. ADAs TIM grease provides a 10C or better reduction in junction temperatures, at a fraction of conductive filler concentration compared to state-of-the-art, which enables this grease to sustain desired performance through severe thermal cycling conditions. The objective of this SBIR Phase II follow-on contract proposal is to enhance the technology and manufacturing readiness for ADAs nano-enhanced TIM grease and to integrate it with power system modules that are currently used on advanced fighter aircraft.  BENEFIT:  ADA has designed our efforts to realize the maturation (readiness level) of high-performance TIM grease materials through close collaboration with a Tier 1 supplier for platform insertion in military and commercial aircraft sub-components. If successful, ADAs technology will permit the development and usage of electronics that offer higher power and faster operating speeds by providing more efficient heat management. This will directly benefit capabilities in next generation AF efforts such as those anticipated in military aircraft, directed energy systems, satellites, and avionics. Furthermore, this technology will have direct benefits in many commercial electronics including personal electronics (e.g., laptops, cell phones, music players) and civilian aircraft, spacecraft, and other microelectronics applications.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to address the need for alternative imaging technologies for women with mammographically dense breast tissue by significantly enhancing clinical breast ultrasound images. Mammography is the gold standard for breast cancer screening; however, both dense breast tissue and cancerous lesions appear white on a mammogram, making it difficult to reliably detect cancers. Women who have dense tissue - 26 million in the United States alone - need alternative imaging technologies for early stage cancer detection. Studies show that the addition of a single screening ultrasound increases cancer detection by 28% over mammography alone, with significantly higher combined diagnostic accuracy. Despite these findings, a fourfold increase in the false positive rate undermines ultrasound use by physicians in breast imaging. A technology that improves ultrasound image clarity in dense breast tissue would revolutionize breast cancer imaging by allowing physicians to noninvasively detect malignancies previously obscured by their size and/or poor contrast and distinguish them from benign lesions. There is the strong potential to save lives by substantially increasing the overall cancer detection rate while simultaneously reducing the number of false positives. The proposed project seeks to develop an adaptive beamforming technology that will significantly improve the clinical utility of ultrasound imaging. Unlike traditional beamforming, adaptive beamforming estimates the time delays between ultrasound probe elements and does not require prior knowledge of the speed of sound along the beam path to produce an image of the tissue. The more accurate time delays result in improved beam focusing and allow for larger transducer arrays, which in turn allows for deeper signal penetration - enhancing signal strength, spatial resolution, and image contrast. The preceding Phase I project used simulated ultrasound data to develop a novel adaptive beamforming technique with least-mean square filters that improves signal-to-noise ratio by up to 32 dB and image contrast by up to 38%. The Phase II project objectives are to acquire raw, radio-frequency ultrasound data from both representative breast phantoms and an in vivo study; to optimize and finalize the adaptive beamforming algorithm; to process the study data and evaluate improved image contrast and clinical benefit; to produce a software application embodying the adaptive beamforming technique; and to design the network architecture and data management approach required to deliver that software as a license or as a Software as a Service (SaaS) product to medical facilities.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aligns with a major shift in healthcare to reduce hospital acquired infections. At a cost of over $1.5B and 600,000 extra hospital days in the US alone, surgical wound infection in high-risk abdominal surgery patients is a major healthcare burden. In addition, providers and hospitals face greater scrutiny of their wound infection rates today, and the sweeping changes of healthcare reform have incentivized these critical stakeholders to invest in preventative solutions. However, currently available solutions are insufficient, and existing surgical device companies have not developed a compelling pipeline of products to address this unmet need. The proposed technology enjoys a competitive advantage in that it operates in a relatively open competitive landscape, and its unique mechanism of action provides a comprehensive wound protection strategy. Thus, this technology has the potential to make a significant worldwide impact on wound infection, both from a healthcare quality and commercialization standpoint. The initial market for this technology is in colorectal surgery, with ample expansion opportunities into other abdominal surgical markets totaling over $1 billion. The proposed project seeks to develop and commercialize a novel technology designed to prevent one of the most frequent, morbid, and costly hospital-acquired infections: surgical wound infection. The technology is an innovative surgical tool that provides a comprehensive anti-contamination strategy for the wound that is also user-friendly for the surgeon. This device has the potential to be a transformative innovation in the quality of surgical care, particularly in the 3.5 million patients undergoing high-risk abdominal-gastrointestinal (GI) surgery in whom wound infections are the most common. The technology also allows surgeons to experiment with a variety of approaches to identify ?best practices? for intraoperative wound care. This Phase II project proposes three main objectives. First, the company will refine the scientific understanding of the local and systemic therapeutic of the anti-contamination therapy through numerical modeling and pre-clinical testing in a porcine model in order to provide clinical use recommendations. Second, the company will design and develop a product sized for laparoscopic surgeries in order to support a broad-based commercialization effort. Third, the company with develop scaled manufacturing capability to support commercial release of the CleanCision product platform.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the significant improvement of surgical accuracy, which will dramatically reduce surgical errors, improve outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. In spine surgery alone, there are more than 500,000 procedures every year in the US utilizing implants such as screws. In 4% to 11% of these surgeries, the implant placement is inaccurate. For the patient this translates into longer recoveries - from days to weeks - and in many cases into a second revision surgery. The patient is non-productive, unable to carry out their daily routines for weeks, while the healthcare system has to absorb the costs of the longer recovery as well as the revision surgeries. For both the healthcare and economic systems these are avoidable costs. The medical imaging technology being developed in this project has the potential to eliminate surgical inaccuracies across the $2.4B market of image guidance, improving clinical applications that range from orthopedic surgery to minimally invasive vascular interventions, to cancer diagnosis and treatments. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will demonstrate a novel imaging modality, which provides near-real-time 3D live imaging - 4D - during surgery. This novel system will provide surgical imaging at a lower x-ray dose than fluoroscopy (current standard), with a geometry that allows concurrent imaging with surgery. This 4D technology has the potential to significantly reduce surgical inaccuracies, improve outcomes and reduce costs. Phase 1 successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the reconstruction algorithm used by the proposed imaging modality by showing its potential of higher surgical accuracy in a single spinal screw insertion. This Phase 2 project will I) prove the robustness of the reconstruction algorithm across a variety of use-cases, II) demonstrate the clinical usability of the 4D scanner, and III) confirm the clinical utility of the scanner. The clinical usability will be studied with an ergonomic model in a surgical setting. The clinical utility will be proven by building a system prototype and performing image quality and x-ray dose comparisons versus fluoroscopy and 3D in a realistic surgical setting. Preliminary results show that these objectives are achievable. This research is readying the technology for clinical research, regulatory clearance and commercialization.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to allow for more energy efficient surface treatment, more consistency in surface treatment processes, reduced scrap rates in manufacturing and more reliable bonded and coated structures. This in turn will reduce barriers to adoption of these inherently efficient manufacturing methods. Markets that have expressed keen interest in the proposed sensor technology include automotive OEM?s and their suppliers, major airframers and their suppliers, and manufacturers of general purpose surface treatment equipment. Other major markets include manufacturers of medical devices, consumer and industrial electronics, and food packaging. The theoretical and practical knowledge gained through this work will advance the ability to apply these principles to create robust surface free energy sensors. This understanding is critical for controlling many processes that depend on wetting phenomena, including printing, adhesive bonding, painting, rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing, application of agricultural chemicals, and aircraft deicing. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will address the needs engendered by the current environmentally mandated shift from solvent-based adhesives and coatings to water-borne systems, which has made the control of surface treatment extremely critical. Currently, surface treatment processes are performed without feedback control. The quality of surface treatment is determined by expensive destructive testing. The proposed sensor is based on ultra rapid determination of the equilibrium shape of a miniscule drop of a probe liquid on the surface in question, a parameter directly related to the Gibbs free energy of the surface. The research objectives are to develop a fundamental understanding of the relationship between ballistic deposition parameters of small liquid drops, the morphology and energetics of a substrate surface, and the equilibrium drop geometry, and utilize this knowledge to design and construct prototype closed loop control surface processing equipment. This understanding will be developed primarily through high-speed imaging of the interaction of growing droplets with surfaces of various chemical composition and morphology. This knowledge will be incorporated into the design and construction of prototype surface processing equipment that includes closed loop feedback for precise control and verification of surface free energy.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is very significant. Current peptide-based drugs constitute important tools in human healthcare, and development of new peptide-based drugs represents a growing proportion of the pharmaceutical research effort. Current peptide drugs addressing widespread diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and osteoporosis have sales above $1 billion. These drugs must be delivered by injection. This SBIR aims for new drugs with comparable heath benefits that can be taken in pill form, because the convenience of oral delivery, relative to injection, would rapidly capture most of the market. The high stability engendered by our design strategy should enable drug development for diseases that currently cannot be treated. Thus, the commercial potential of this project is high. Orally delivered replacements for injectable drugs would have a substantial broader impact because they would enhance patient compliance. Inadequate treatment of T2DM for example, leads to adverse health consequences that degrade productivity and quality of life for patients. Increased compliance resulting from a general ability to deliver peptide drugs in pill form would vastly improve outcomes for patients, including the specific patients populations targeted by our current programs. The proposed project is motivated by fundamental questions about the way drug molecules are processed in the human body. Drug candidates cannot address a human disease unless they reach the appropriate sites within the body and then persist in those sites. The proposed research focuses on a particular class of bioactive compounds called \"peptides.\" Peptides can act in powerful and favorable ways within the body, with high specificity of action (which minimizes \"side effects\"), but they are subject to very rapid destruction after administration. This weakness of peptides requires that they be injected regularly, but peptide drugs would be much more useful if they could be taken orally. This SBIR Phase I project examines unique peptide-like molecules that are designed to retain the favorable pharmaceutical action of peptides themselves but to resist degradation mechanisms within the body that rapidly destroy peptides. The stomach is the most destructive site for peptides, and this project aims to generate peptide-like molecules that are sufficiently robust to survive the stomach and reach the small intestine, where they can be absorbed. Achieving these molecular design goals would have high intellectual merit in addition to advancing drug design.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in developing a first-of-its-kind hemodynamic parameter monitoring device for the early detection of heart disease that will significantly improve the management of patients with compromised heart functions. Heart disease is perhaps the next cardiac epidemic, as over the past 50 years, a steady rise in life expectancy has led to progressively increasing frequency of degeneration. Heart disease is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and treatment, particularly by surgery, is expensive. Many technologies have emerged to assist the diagnosis such as the electrocardiogram, magnetic resonance imaging, and cardiac catheterization, and the 2-D echocardiogram. Existing 2-D echocardiogram instruments have been inadequate tools for screening as they require significant support staff and infrastructure. Considering the cost, risks, and availability of these diagnostic tools, cardiac auscultation remains an important part of the initial investigative process for heart disease patients. The societal impact of this project is significant as a new modality will be made available. The device is not an improvement over existing technologies but a step up from current technology that does not exist today and opens the door to numerous commercial possibilities. The proposed project will develop a novel device for the non-invasive assessment of heart disease called Multi-Dimensional Cardiogram (MDCG). This technology addresses the market for early detection of heart disease by offering, novel multi-transducer framework, advanced hardware and algorithmic signal processing. The phase II will consist of development of the hardware and software for a portable device. The device will provide physicians with multiple dimensions of information from the heart signal to diagnose heart disease based on the Mitral, Tricuspid, Aortic and Pulmonary valve sounds; enabling earlier detection, close outpatient follow up, and remote home monitoring. Physicians rely on auscultation and evaluation of risk factors since access to cardiologists and certain diagnostic modalities are not always available or practical. We have identified and propose to meet this important need for a device that can enable non-cardiologist physicians and healthcare professionals to perform examinations for heart disease which are more detailed than possible with stethoscope auscultation. The MDCG technology improves the diagnostic accuracy required for monitoring patients with heart disease. The intellectual merits of this device include the development of a high-performance system in a single, low-power compact package that is easy-to-use and has a small transducer array footprint.",

Comprised entirely of biocompatible and biodegradable materials and coated by cell membranes derived from natural red blood cells, the nanoparticles are able to circulate for an extended period of time in the circulation. Their biomimetic exterior allows them to serve as a decoy to scavenge virulence factors that attack cell membranes.

Successful development of the manufacturing process also has broader impact in the field of nanofabrication and nanomedicine development.

To ensure that the manufactured nanoformulations will have the optimal size, uniformity, biological activity, and performance, advanced fluidics, filtration, microscopy, and particle tracking techniques will be applied for precision nanoparticle preparation and characterization.

Tight integration of clinical data with radiology images will enable evidence-based approaches to be used by care providers in oncology. The tools being developed in this project will enable accelerated transition of comprehensive data-driven cancer research into clinical practice for decision making related to diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Recent trends, such as wide adoption of electronic medical records and radiological images and availability of powerful computing at reasonable prices have made it possible to improve the prognostic and diagnostic power of data, in particular imaging data analysis in healthcare. The integrated analytics platform being developed will streamline treatment monitoring by imaging and reduce diagnostic errors; hence increasing the quality to cancer care.

The platform combines recent advances in data mining, context search, image segmentation and deformable registration into an imaging system deployed at the point of care. The diagnostic potential of clinical and image data will be enhanced by the ability to compare lesion characteristics of the current case to a large repository of lesions from other studies with known diagnosis. The proposed search tool will generate patient cohorts with a given set of diagnosis and treatment conditions and present the related images to the diagnostician. Additional technology will locate and track tumors and provide detailed characterization such as size, shape, location and texture with detailed analytics.

The proposed 3D rangefinder uses an array of tiny piezoelectric ultrasound transducers which are built on a silicon wafer using microfabrication techniques. Custom electronics are used to control the transducers and the system emits sound into the air and receives echoes from objects in front of the transducer array. The proposed ultrasonic 3D rangefinder has the potential to be small and low-power enough to be left on continuously, giving devices such as smartphones, tablets, and wearable electronic devices a way to sense physical objects in the surrounding environment. Based on the smartphone market alone, the potential market size for this device is over one billion units per year. Mobile contextual awareness will enable 3D interaction with smartphones and tablets, facilitating rich user interfaces for applications such as gaming and hands-free control in automobiles. Looking beyond the smartphone and tablet market, the proposed rangefinder will feature size and power advantages that will permit integration into centimeter-sized devices which are too small to support a touchscreen. During Phase II, the major technical goals of this project are to transfer the ultrasound transducer manufacturing from a university laboratory to a commercial production facility, to develop a custom integrated circuit for signal processing, and to develop engineering prototypes. In Phase I, micromachined ultrasound transducers having a novel structure designed to improve manufacturability were developed and a demonstration prototype was built using signal processing algorithms running on a personal computer. In Phase II, the ultrasound transducers will be manufactured in a commercial facility for the first time and signal processing algorithms will be realized on a custom mixed-signal integrated circuit. A prototype package for the transducer and integrated circuit chips will be developed and detailed acoustic testing of the packaged prototypes will be conducted.",

If this project is successful, numerous industrial and commercial applications will benefit from increased component longevity and more efficient operation of machinery, coupled with labor and energy savings. From a societal perspective, this technology has the potential to save a large portion of the substantial amount of energy lost to friction in ubiquitous components such as generators and engines, while simultaneously reducing wear-related material/component failures and associated downtime costs. Previous research has predicted that a successful global application of the proposed technology in existing transportation systems will enable an absolute energy savings that exceeds the total energy generated by all currently-deployed photovoltaic, geothermal, and biomass sources combined. This project will focus on the further development and scale-up of ceramic nanosheets with structurally different sides (sticky/slick), which will be used to form a self-generating tribological thin film coating for improved lubrication. This coating is formed during normal operation, particle by particle. The creation of these low-friction tribological coatings has been previously observed but requires further optimization for robustness and additional engineering and testing for commercial applications. Understanding the influence of composition and surface dopants is required for market application of the resulting, nearly frictionless coatings. Additional material testing and successful scale-up of the production of these nanosheets are needed for commercial viability. Follow-on applications of these anisotropic nanostructures are envisioned in the areas of catalyst supports, plastic fillers, and smart materials.",

The proposed agitation and sedation system will assist in realizing an improved distribution of ICU workload by allowing the medical staff to focus on patients with increased agitation and in need of immediate attention. It is expected that this technology will also improve the quality of care in military ICUs. The proposed project focuses on the development of a multi-modality agitation and sedation assessment system for patients in ICUs. The primary consequence of oversedation is the prolongation of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. Prolonged ventilation is expensive and is associated with known risks, such as inadvertent extubation, laryngo-tracheal trauma, and, most significantly, ventilator-associated pneumonia. Alternatively, agitated patients can do physical harm to themselves by dislodging vital life support and monitoring devices with excessive musculoskeletal activity. Undersedation and oversedation result in excessive economic burden on the healthcare system. The annual cost of oversedation in the US is $400 million, whereas reducing mechanical ventilation in oversedated patients by just one day can result in an annual savings of $4 billion in the US alone. Current clinical practice in patient critical care requires the nursing staff to assess the patient?s agitation and sedation state and provide sedatives to ameliorate the patient?s agitation. This process relies on subjective assessments and can be influenced by personal bias. This project proposes to use machine learning algorithms to integrate data from multiple sensing modalities to objectively identify cases of undersedation and oversedation in ICU patients.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION  provided by applicant   MRI cerebral perfusion imaging is a widely disseminated technique on nearly all MRI scanners used for clinical diagnosis of brain disease and for neuroscience research  Over the last five years there has been considerably increased use of arterial spin labeling  ASL  for clinical diagnosis  while still i v  injections of a gadoliium based contrast bolus are widely used clinically  Both brain perfusion methods  ASL and DSC techniques  involve making images very fast to identify the passage of blood through the capillary compartment  The image signal to noise ratio  SNR  is limited by the small  e g       fraction of blood in tissue volumes  This is proportionately small but a second limitation is the time window of imaging  which is constrained to about         milliseconds for the capillary phase of blood passage  Therefore  rapid imaging of blood inflow is essential  For this reason DSC contrast based methods and ASL with multi slice  D EPI have not been able to satisfactorily image perfusion in the entire brain except with thick slices hence reduced spatial resolution   D imaging has therefore been developed as an alternative to  D EPI  However   D images have certain desirable characteristics compared with  D if there are patient motion artifacts  To overcome these limitations we propose to develop novel technology to acquire images simultaneously instead of separately  This approach called simultaneous multi slice imaging ASL  SMS ASL  and SMS DSC increases by several fold the number of images that are acquired during the limited time window of capillary perfusion phase so the whole brain can be imaged  Another benefit of SMS ASL is that the time to scan the brain can be greatly reduced by avoiding repeated scans of different brain areas  thus  reducing motion artifacts  A second major innovation in this project is the Hadamard encoded ASL  which is highly useful in clinical studies where the blood arterial transit time  ATT  is not known as in normal aging of people  The Hadamard ASL acquires images at several different inflow times  TI  to be sure to capture the capillary perfusion phase of blood in at least one set of images  By acquiring the different TI values in a well defined sub bolus partitioning of the labeling period  their combination gives separated images at the distinct TI with essentially  x the SNR and half the net scan time as required by current methodology which acquires each TI data set independently and sequentially  Both the Hadamard and the SMS can be combined for further improvements in SNR  speed and spatial resolution  This will highly impact the accessibility to patients and the robustness of the perfusion technology in clinical use  The availability of the new simultaneous perfusion imaging technology will give clinicians and researchers the capability of performing significantly improved MRI perfusion measurements in patients and these improvements will impact the diagnosis of many different brain diseases  including stroke  leukoencephalopathies and degenerative diseases  i e   Alzheimerandapos s disease and Parkinsonandapos s disease  Perfusion measurements of quantitative cerebral blood flow  CBF  and ATT are important quantitative biomarkers useful as physiological imaging in evaluating new drug therapies for brain diseases  This family of new perfusion imaging techniques utilizes more efficient pulse sequences that provide major advantages in resolution  slice coverage  SNR and speed  The new simultaneous imaging will have high utility and be highly desirable for use on clinical scanners worldwide  The improved quantitative MRI perfusion imaging offers overall increased efficiency that is highly commercializable given they provide improved diagnostic approaches to evaluate brain disease and further improve specificity and sensitivity in MRI neuroradiological exams  The new sequences will be designed  implemented and evaluated on MRI scanners operating at     Tesla at AMRIT  at  T at University of California Berkeley and at  T and  T at University of California  San Francisco Medical Center and at Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging  Massachusetts General Hospital  and Harvard Medical School  Once the new perfusion sequences are optimized they will be further evaluated and optimized in collaborative clinical test sites of UCSF Medical Center  UCLA and University of Pennsylvania  In addition to establishing their value in neuroradiology exams  they will be made into useful tools for basic and clinical neuroscience research PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  MRI is a proven non invasive technique to measure blood perfusion in the brain  by both arterial spin labeling  ASL  which traces the passage of blood into\nthe brain and by dynamic susceptibility contrast  DSC  perfusion measurements which rely on the i v  injection of a small amount of tracer material without involving radiation  The widespread\nuse of these promising techniques of MRI perfusion imaging have been prevented by the inefficiencies in the image formation process which is limited to sub segments of the whole brain  or sacrifice detail when imaging the whole brain  We are proposing to develop a highly efficient imaging technique which will give researchers and clinicians the capability to perform  D and  D perfusion images of the whole brain by recording images simultaneously rather than separately as is currently performed in all scanners  The resulting quantitative measures of cerebral blood flow will very valuable for medical diagnosis and in research on neurovascular diseases including stroke  and wide spectrum of neurological diseases including brain tumors  as well as for medical research on neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimerandapos s disease  Parkinsonandapos s disease and for leukoencephalopathies including multiple sclerosis",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is making tough, 3D printed parts that can be directly manufactured through additive processes commercially available. Additive manufacturing has potential to revolutionize the way parts are produced by streamlining product design, production, and validation, which allows for low production costs and accelerated lead times. The penetration of additive technology into industrial processes has been greatly slowed by the current inability to 3D print parts of any stiffness with materials properties on par with traditionally manufactured parts. Particularly, 3D printed materials tend to tear or fracture more readily between successive printed layers. At Adaptive 3D Technologies, we have developed resins that produce tough, robust parts that are tougher than many current 3D printed products in the x, y and z planes by achieving covalent crosslinking across printed layers. These materials and processing techniques will help drive additive manufacturing into large volume, yet customizable, market sectors to increase efficiency and productivity across industries. The printed parts resulting from our printable materials will further U.S. manufacturing by lowering production costs, increasing product performance and reshoring advanced manufacturing. This project is focused on understanding interface chemistry and adhesion phenomena in a special class of low-viscosity, thiol-ene resins to produce a range of mechanically tough materials that are 3D printable via stereolithography (SLA). A significant problem with current SLA approaches is that successive printed layers do not adhere sufficiently together, leading to large reductions in toughness as measured by the stress-strain response in soft, viscoelastic and stiff materials. Our Phase II research explores the tradeoffs between molecular architecture, reactivity, resin viscosity, and key printing parameters to develop improved materials to enable tougher printed parts than industry standards along multiple axes of deformation at similar printing speeds and feature sizes well below 100 microns. We have developed a portfolio of 3D printable materials with room temperature Young's moduli near 2 MPa, 20 MPa, 200 MPa or 2 GPa. Soft and viscoelastic materials have strain capacities well above 100% in all print directions, including when measured perpendicular to print layer interfaces. We expect to further our polymers' thermomechanical properties through the proposed Phase II SBIR effort by incorporating proper additives into our systems to control color, shelf life, aesthetics, mechanical properties and compatibility with various jetting techniques.",

        "abstract": "In this Navy Phase II SBIR Program, MATECH proposes to leverage its lengthy experience in ceramic matrix composite (CMC) fabrication with recent advances in Field Assisted Sintering Technology (FAST) to demonstrate dramatic cost reduction and improved CMC performance. FAST is also known as Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS). FAST can consolidate materials in as short an active process time as 2 minutes! Typical process times range from 5 to 15 minutes. FAST has been demonstrated for metals, glasses, ceramics, and nano-composite materials. Little information is available in the public domain, however, about the application of FAST to CMC fabrication. Given the lack of an experience base in applying FAST to CMCs, MATECH proposed initiating this effort by focusing on the fundamentals. In the Navy funded Phase I Base SBIR program, centered around the development of 2700F capable SiC/SiC CMCs, MATECH demonstrated that FAST/SPS processing can be applied to final CMC densification to achieve very low porosity and high density, evidence of CMC fracture behavior and fiber pull out, and a SiC/SiC CMC with undetectable oxygen contamination (or any other contaminants).",

        "abstract": "Composite materials are attractive to the Army for numerous applications in order to reduce weight compared to metallic structures. However, the low thermal conductivity of composites have limited the insertion of composites in applications where poor thermal management threatens critical electronics components. The U.S. Army is seeking advances in composites materials that can enhance the thermal conductivity of the composites materials without negatively impacting the structural characteristics or significantly increasing the cost. Applied Sciences, Inc. (ASI) has developed a carbon nanomaterial sheetgood (CNF Mat), which has demonstrated the ability to enhance the thermal conductivity of structural CFRP composites by an order of magnitude, without significantly affecting the mechanical properties of the composite, and enabling over 25% reduction in weight compared to a baseline composite. The CNF Mat material is readily scalable and is projected to be a low production cost. ASI proposes to further develop and optimize the CNF Mat, fabricate and test prototype composite components, and develop a detailed cost model and scale-up plans. The resulting material will be a prospective disruptive materials technology that will enable CFRP composites to be considered for numerous applications that were previously reserved only for metallic structures.",

Additionally, the development of this core technology can be used for research of numerous other diseases. The product developed during this project has potential applications in the pharmaceutical and contract research organization markets for drug discovery, monitoring therapeutic efficacy, and assisting with clinical studies. While this Phase II proposal includes the development and commercialization of a DVT panel, the commercial product offering will cover a wider variety of disease-related proteins for research applications (e.g. protein combinations in which academic researchers, contract research organizations, or pharmaceutical companies have interest). The proposed project will result in a better, more robust tool for detection of disease-related proteins in patient blood. The product will be able to measure the amounts of multiple proteins at one time without a problem known as ?antibody crosstalk?, which hinders the quality of results when using other technologies. Work on this project will involve developing a kit that includes equipment and reagents for an end-user to work with and analyze blood samples for proteins of interest, in this case those involved with cardiovascular disease. A working prototype device was developed as part of Phase I funding, and Phase II will improve upon the device (increased analysis time and multiplexing) until useful for the analysis of clinical samples.

Of particular interest are sustained airflow temperatures of 2800aF.  To obtain this temperature, improved heating elements and systems are needed.  During Phase I, an oxidation resistant, high temperature iridium-based wind tunnel heating element has been developed.  Resistive heating experiments showed element surface temperatures greater than 1650aC (3000aF) can be obtained with the current architecture.  During Phase II, the process parameters and techniques developed in the Phase I effort will be optimized.   For the Phase II investigation, Plasma Processes will partner with the University of Alabama at Huntsville to aid in the design and analysis of a complete heating element system and Southern Research Institute to characterize the heating element properties.  The modular system will then be delivered to the Air Force for testing with high mass flow rates at Arnold Engineering Development Center.  BENEFIT:  The development of an oxidation resistant heating element and heating element system will enable testing of engines and critical hypersonic components such as leading edges and nose tips at high Mach Number (5+).  This capability will support numerous military applications with in the Department of Defense and other government agencies such as NASA.  In addition, this technology is needed for commercial entities in the following sectors: oxidation resistant coatings, defense, material R&D, nuclear power, aerospace, propulsion, automotive, electronics, crystal growth, and medical.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project focuses on robot systems designed for early childhood education (preK-2). There is increasing research and applications for educational robotics, but little attention are focused on the foundational years. The early childhood segment is underserved because there are few available platforms for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education that are developmentally appropriate for children 4-7 years old. However, research shows that from an economic and a developmental standpoint, educational programs that begin in early childhood result in lower costs and more durable effects than those that begin later on. This project focuses on developmentally appropriate robot kits for young children, and the curriculum support, teacher resources and automated assessment tools to make this innovation useful for early childhood education in a broadly disseminated, sustainable and scalable way. Recent re-envisioning of early childhood programs by the Federal government has resulted in calls to develop innovative technologies and approaches for teaching STEM. Given the size of the industry devoted to early childhood education, the potential commercial impact is significant, opening new markets and job opportunities. This innovation also has the potential to have significant positive impact on the US economy by preparing children with economically important skills. The innovation underlying this project is the design of a robot system that engages 4 to 7 year old children in learning programming concepts through the use of a developmentally appropriate programming language. In order to be developmentally appropriate for this age range, the programming language is physical, not typed, with no screens or keyboards of any kind required. The resulting educational platform also enables children to develop engineering design process skills by building physical objects that can respond to different inputs through the use of sensors. This project is organized around five technical objectives: a developmentally appropriate robot kit for young children to learn programming and engineering; robot modules for curriculum integration with other areas such as math, science, literacy and the arts; support systems for early childhood teachers through a web portal with resources for both formal and informal education and professional development strategies; and an automated learning assessment system that collects data characterizing student learning directly from the robot, analyzes it through innovative mechanisms and displays it using visualization tools according to the different needs of parents, educators and school leadership to understand learning outcomes; and cost reduction of the robot system for broadening adoption.",

        "abstract": "There is a need to remotely detect, collect, and evaluate physiological signals of interest. Applications and concepts-of-operations (CONOPs) that would benefit from this capability include, but are not limited to: building-clearing, warfighter health monitoring or battle damage assessment and triage, situational awareness and assessment. Existing micro-impulse radar (MIR) and ultra-wideband (U\\1\\fB) technologies have the capability of detecting heartbeat and respiration at distances up to- 8 meters (1) but are limited at greater distances and in challenging environments, such as penetration through thick or multiple walls, concrete, and RF-noisy environments.    There is interest in counting and localizing the sources of multiple physiological signatures in a cluttered environment. For example, in a building that has experienced a catastrophic event (fire, earthquake, etc.), the detection of survivors and assessment of their medical condition, in addition to their location to within 1 meter accuracy, would improve the likelihood of recovery of personnel and their survivability. Additionally in a crowded environment it is highly challenging to uniquely identify persons based on collection of physiological signatures, such as electrocardiograms (ECGs). It is possible that high-frequency ECGs or other signals could improve the confidence level in unique identification.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this SBIR is to develop an advanced autonomous acoustic classification capability, known as Normal Mode Decomposition (NMD), for use with two acoustic sensors under consideration by PMS-485 for the Shallow Water Surveillance System (SWSS): the Planar Array Prototype (PAP) and the Advanced Deployable System (ADS). The NMD algorithm, originally developed by OASIS under ONR 321-US funding, differs from traditional intel-based classification methods by exploiting acoustic propagation physics and fundamental differences in the way surfaced and submerged sources excite the shallow water waveguide. Under the Phase II effort, the NMD algorithm will be ported to C language and integrated into a prototype SWSS embedded software baseline. Data analysis will be performed in order to quantify NMD performance using existing data sets from the ADS and/or PAP arrays in a suitable, downward-refracting, shallow water environment. Under the Phase II Option, if exercised, a real-time demonstration of the technology will be conducted. Post-analysis of experiment data will be performed to support a formal quantification of baseline performance. The effort will culminate with the delivery of a Phase III development plan that outlines the path for transition of the technology to U. S. Navy use.",

This project will develop cost-competitive advanced electrostatic capacitors that are critical components in many pulsed power and power electronics. These advanced capacitors will be able to minimize the capacitor size, weight and reduce the material and maintenance cost of power inverters in hybrid and plug-in electric vehicles, smart grid, oil/gas/geothermal down-hole drilling and exploration, wind turbine generators, grid-tied photovoltaic, and many other energy and military systems. The success of this project will facilitate the broad adoption of advanced energy efficient switch technologies. The technical objectives of this Phase II research project are to develop and commercialize advanced film capacitors with high energy density, high power density, and high thermal stability. Current dc bus capacitors in many medium and high power systems are dominated by polypropylene (PP) film capacitors which were developed more than 60 years ago and they have low thermal stability. This project will develop prototype capacitors using proprietary three-component nanodielectric compositions combining high thermal stability, high dielectric constant, low dielectric loss, as well as low cost. The success of this project is built upon our integrated and interdisciplinary approach that combines integrated computational material engineering (ICME/EDV), nanodielectric material with balanced thermal, electrical, and mechanical performance, inexpensive film production, and advanced capacitor design.",

Due to the inherited complex and heterogamous nature of network, it is quite challenging to provide synchronized view of data, autonomous analytics from geographically dispersed, large volume of data. To overcome such challenging issues, Intelligent Automation, Inc. propose to develop a highly scalable and autonomous NetOps Analytics (SANA) system, which defines and captures abnormalities in information and network behaviors to generate alert if any abnormalities are detected. In addition, proposed SANA system maps missions into required resources and guarantees synchronized information sharing to increase level of information value, health and trust. In Phase I, the prototype SANA system was developed on cloud platform and its performance was evaluated. The preliminary performance evaluation confirmed that the SANA system outperforms conventional single server based solution in terms of CPU/memory utilization and computation delay. The evaluation results also confirms that the SANA system can handle multiple query/computation requests simultaneously with large volume of input data.",

Currently searching for footprints involves CBP agents driving over long stretches of road and visually searching for signs of human activities. In this technology and product development effort, Lynntech proposes to develop a COTS mobile-device based system (smart-phones and tablets) which can utilize vehicle-mounted COTS cameras to automatically scan upcoming segments of road for human footprint trails. \nIn the Phase I Lynntech successfully proved the feasibility of this approach and demonstrated real-time footprint detection at a Kingsville, Texas border patrol station using COTS components mounted on a moving vehicle. In the Phase II effort, Lynntech will increase footprint trail detection performance and make the developed system easier for border patrol agents to integrate into their day-to-day operations. This work includes modifications to the system to enable footprint trail detection at night, as well as changes to the user interface to enable users to maximize detection performance over different border road soil types. Multiple rounds of on-site visits to border patrol stations over the Phase II period ensure system relevance to DHS and to border patrol agents' day-to-day operations.\nThe proposed footprint detection approach has direct commercial use by Customs and Border Patrol to enhance border agent performance. Additionally, the technology can be used to automate the detection of surface defects on large airport runways.",

EWARS will also provide calibration accuracy, digital uplink format/precision, and high dynamic range.

In addition, A-size packaging will be demonstrated. New processing techniques will be demonstrated that extend the current and planned sensor capabilities. As part of the development, the EWARS team will develop and demonstrate critical technology that can transition to production A-size sonobuoys. To maximize economy and to minimize risk, the EWARS prototypes leverage heavily on existing technology readily available or currently being developed for use in other U.S. Navy sensors.

Current torpedo-detection algorithms are effective against certain models, but evolving torpedo propulsion systems and enemy tactics constantly chip at away at the present defense capability. This proposal will demonstrate opportunities to use the hull-mounted sensor to significantly close that gap by increasing the probability of detecting torpedoes and reducing false torpedo alerts. Our approach is to develop improved signal processing that facilitates existing and future feature detectors, and to develop kinematic features that exploit the motion characteristics and the broad spectrum of energy of these weapons. The specific means to achieve this are: 1.     Utilize extended bandwidth and other improvements to the hull-array adaptive beamformer (ABF) to better detect both kinematic and acoustic-signature torpedo characteristics 2.     Develop kinematic feature-detector algorithms capable of detecting various torpedo motion patterns (for example, wake-homing torpedoes) with the hull array",

To address this need, Creare will develop a high-resolution, high-precision, imaging ultrasound system to detect and characterize recrystallization in single-crystal turbine bladesthe Turbine Blade Inspection System (TBIS). During the Phase I project, we demonstrated that the TBIS approach can effectively detect recrystallization in single-crystal CMSX-4 and copper. We also established that our TBIS can detect recrystallized grains as small as 25 m. During the Base Phase II project, we will design, fabricate, and demonstrate a prototype TBIS.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Coordination, collaboration and integration across the many elements of the S&T community are critical to the success of the overarching joint planning and coordination process.  Responding to expectations, queries or findings requires: alignment of the context to ongoing initiatives; a determination of the relevance to Research and Development (R&D) specifically; and discovery, representation and delivery of data that support informed decision-making.  These activities are often executed by cross-organizational Communities of Interest (COI) that are organized and managed by the Reliance 21 initiative.  Specific deliverables of COIs are 10-year R&D plans, roadmaps and portfolio reviews.  Data sources used to produce these artifacts come from many authoritative sources and are both structured and unstructured.  Semantic Services for Enterprise Analytics (SSEA) will enable ASD (R&E) to exploit semantic technologies and standards to support its mission as the authoritative source of information regarding ongoing activities within the R&D community.  The proposed SSEA work in this document will encompass direct support to the diverse range of COIs in the preparation of their R&E roadmaps.  The Command, Control, Comms, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) COI has been identified as an early adopter and we will begin SSEA efforts in collaboration with this COI.    BENEFIT:  Benefits to the Air Force parallel those to ASD(R&E), as Air Force is an active participant in critical R&E resources such as DTICs Unified Research and Engineering Database (URED).  Air Force laboratories and strategic planners will all have access to the SSEA analytic and information discovery capabilities described here.  These capabilities significantly automate large amounts of currently manual hunt-and-peck and sifting and sorting operations undertaken for multiple reporting and planning activities.  SSEA greatly increases the ability of analysts to process massive amounts of structured and unstructured information through:      Automated tagging of data with domain-relevant vocabulary.   Organizing datasets for relevance ranking and navigation.   Producing machine-executable representations of Critical Information Requirements.   Extracting specific information from large volumes of text.   Delivering decision support information to knowledge workers.",

The novel WiPEM system provides critical information not only on the physiological status of multiple first responders to be monitored and transmitted to the incident command, but also on critical surrounding information to enhance the situation awareness. It incorporates four major components: (1) an array of physiological sensors integrated directly onto the SCBA (Self Contained Breathing Apparatus), (2) an array of miniaturized environmental sensors in a wearable package, (3) processing and communication electronics compatible with the Public Safety band of the LTE cell phone network, and (4) ergonomic mechanical packaging. The novel design of the open-architecture system is compatible with existing Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and working with the industrial leaders of PPE, including Scott Safety, will enable certification for various applicable NFPA standards in the future. In Phase I, POC performed comprehensive analyses, assessments, and feasibility demonstrations of an optimal solution to address DHS requirements and first responder needs to comply with the existing PPE/SCBA systems and FEMA requirements. In Phase II, POC plans to develop a fully functional prototype system according to the outline developed in the Phase I detailed technical analysis for further testing and continue development of smart algorithms for sensor data processing.",

        "abstract": "This proposed effort will develop the Particle/Ray Interaction Simulation Manager (PRISM) software platform which was begun as a Phase I program.  The goal of PRISM is to meet the x-ray simulation needs of the explosive detection community.  In Phase I a user survey was conducted of a wide range of system manufacturers who reported that existing simulation tools do not meet their desired needs for ease-of-use, run time, or modelling of complex objects.  Therefor we are designing PRISM to leverage these existing tools, while adding an easy-to-use graphical interface for specifying system parameters and visualizing models. In this way PRISM will create a unified user-interface wrapper for commonly used simulation tools, which we hope will be of high value to the user community. PRISM will have the following key features:  (1) User interfaces for both expert and non-expert users, (2) Open-source architecture that can be linked to numerous simulation tools, (3) Input from CAD files so that complicated objects can be easily modeled, (4) A digital luggage and cargo library tested with experimental data.  The final deliverable will be a functional, commercial-grade, open-source, PRISM platform, which will provide an easy-to-use interface for defining simulation structures. PRISM will initially be fully integrated with GEANT4, but will be architected for future expansion to other simulation tools.

Under this Phase II SBIR effort, we propose the development of two technologies: (1) An aqueous system that fills the cab uniformly with moisture and protects the vehicle occupants for up to 5 minutes from thermal burn injuries. This system is activated by the existing vehicle fire detectors and lowers the rates of radiation and convection heat transfer to the skin of vehicle occupants. The moisture is also extremely effective in scrubbing smoke and fire gases.

Situation Awareness (ICEE-SA) SBIR Phase II research is to extend next-generation situation awareness, visualization, sensor/video processing, and decision support technologies to civil engineering, infrastructure readiness, and security/operations support.   ICEE-SA addresses technology maturation in the following areas: integration of standards-based sensor/control specification technologies to enable control system automated introspection, interrogation, status, and reporting; the extension of the core framework to support Air Force civil engineering operations; development of role-based dashboards for domain operators; and establishing a base-level demonstration capability.  The resulting prototype will be a robust decision support environment and technical framework that seamlessly integrates all the capability into an easy-to-use and easy-to-maintain toolset suited to military and dual use applications.  BENEFIT:  ICEE-SA has direct application to new Air Force infrastructure support and situation awareness for base federal facility operations.  New Environmental Protection Agency and other energy and infrastructure compliance standards will require enhanced tools and capability for situational awareness.  New federal regulations related to the security of SCADA and older industrial controls systems also increase the need for such technology.  ICEE-SA has significant commercial applications in many industries including banking, utilities, and communications, where situational awareness and systems engineering would have high payoff due to the complexity of their environments.",

block downmodulation of MHC I in HIV infected cells without interfering with its surface levels in uninfected cells  and without affecting other unrelated host proteins  These inhibitors prevent the appearance of infected cells with low levels of sMHC I  which cannot efficiently present viral antigens and are partially resistant to CTL killing  We propose to use these inhibitors to overcome the activity of Nef and facilitate the killng of latently infected cells after pharmacological reactivation with LRAs  The specific aims to optimize inhibitors through medicinal chemistry and identify a preclinical candidate are presented below  Specific Aim    Lead optimization of inhibitors of MHC I downmodulation  Two lead series will be subjected to multiple iterative cycles of lead optimization to improve potency \nspecificity  metabolic stability  solubility  permeability and CYP profiles  with the goal to identfy a preclinical candidate  Specific Aim    Validation of advanced candidates with in vitro  ex vivo and in vivo assays  Advanced molecules in one lead series will be used to test their effect after addition of CTLs to HIV replicating cells  Inhibitors will also be evaluated with and in vivo model\nof HIV latency  humanized BLT mice  to determine whether they diminish the size of the viral reservoir and the frequency of viral rebound after LRA treatment  Specific Aim    Preliminary determination of m o a  Studies aimed at understanding the mechanism of action of these inhibitors will be carried out  Putative interactions with host partners will be interrogated and those that can be specifically blocked by the MHC I inhibitors will be further investigated  Success in this Phase II application will be defined as the milestone identification of a preclinicl candidate with adequate PK properties in rats  predictive of oral use in humans  The preclinical candidate will have been validated in ex vivo assays with samples of aviremic patients  and with the humanized BLT mouse model of latency  These studies may result in first in class inhibitors of a novel family of specific immune activators for use in HIV eradication approaches PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  The persistence of latent HIV infected cellular reservoirs represents the major hurdle to virus eradication  Latently infected cells remain a permanent source of virus  Reactivation of latent virus is possible  However  upon reactivation the patientandapos s\nimmune system fails to eliminate the infected cells  To solve this problem we have developed molecules that facilitate the killing of reactivated cells  These inhibitors block an important virl activity that allows the virus to escape the CD  positive CTL response  In the presence of these inhibitors reactivated cells become sensitive to the action of these cells  In combination with drugs that reactivate the latent reservoir these inhibitors could be used in approaches to cure HIV  PHS           Rev         Page

        "abstract": "The WW Technology Group proposes an innovative solution to these challenges called Design for Certification. The combination of a modeling framework that integrates system architecture artifacts with desired system properties for dependability, safety and certification within a comprehensive system model greatly enhances the capabilities of system development and maintenance teams. The use of automated support via the system analysis and design tools enables further realization of significant program cost savings. The development of tools to supply customized certification artifacts that are tuned for the requirements of certification specifications such as submarine Fly-By-Wire represents a significant opportunity to increase the quality of the system evidence and reduce the costs associated with generating evidence for compliance audits. Finally, the tools allow system maintainers and designers to make intelligent trade-offs between performance, dependability, safety and certifiability of the system. These improvements result in significant development and life cycle cost savings associated with reducing safety certification efforts and improving performance certification efforts. They also improve risk management by identifying and tracking issues as early as possible and improve overall system quality.",

        "abstract": "Shipboard launch and recovery of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) is a challenging engineering problem requiring careful design and integration of hardware and software. The seaway-induced relative motion between the host vessel and ROV is often difficult to measure or model, which may render automatic control approaches ineffective and force reliance on manual operation by a very small number of highly trained operators. The success of a launch or recovery is thus highly dependent on the proficiency and alertness of the operator(s). Recovery of the RMMV from the LCS Independence variant is especially challenging and labor-intensive. The overall objective of the research is to provide more robust recovery technology to enhance safety and repeatability while reducing operator workload, saving time, and reducing the risk of equipment damage.  The Phase I analyses resulted in the design of a promising RMMV recovery system that Barron Associates and its research partners believe will prove to be reliable, safe, and cost-effective. The Phase II effort will feature further analysis, design, and prototype construction and will culminate in in-water testing and demonstrations.",

        "abstract": "The continued growth in the number of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, such as unmanned aerial systems (UASs), combined with the increasing ability of sensors to generating ever greater amounts of data, are taxing the capabilities of current data links and the available spectrum for pushing sensor data off-board as a primary concept of operation. Platform sensor suites are beginning to migrate towards high definition cameras, multispectral suites, and collaborative collection with other embedded and external sensors. These new sensors and platforms with multiple sensors are producing data rates which exceed or sorely tax the physical and practical limits of the current beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) and line-of-sight (LOS) data links which fit in UAS. The spectrum required as the logical trade-off is also becoming a significant limiting factor. These limitations lead to impacts on the number of platforms and sensors that can operate in a given area per a given time.     The USAF seeks to increase the capability of UASs to transport ISR data from the sensor to the user with low latency, while minimizing size, weight, and power (SWaP) impact.     The goal of the Phase I effort is to develop an approach that increases the capability of UASs to deliver various ISR products without increasing the spectral occupancy.  This initiative can include but is not limited to, advanced data compression techniques, on-board signal processing, data link waveforms, Forward Error Correction techniques, dynamic bandwidth allocation, foveal /BW agile sensors, etc.  An approach may synergistically integrate these techniques to achieve the desired outcome.  Solutions which reduce the bandwidth required to deliver to transport ISR data are also of interest.  Solutions need to minimize Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) impacts.",

        "abstract": "Despite advances in automated instruction, virtual environment (VE)-based shiphandling trainers still significantly depend upon expert mariners, with individual instructors typically working with only a single active student at a time. This bottleneck makes it difficult to realize the full benefit of VE training systems. Promising support technologies, such as the Conning Officer Virtual Environment (COVE) Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) and the CRESST Assessment Engine (CAE), offload many manual training tasks, but also introduce new supervisory challenges to successfully monitor the progress of multiple students. To address these challenges and enhance the overall efficiency of COVE training, we will extend the design, development, and evaluation of a Shiphandling Educator Assistant for Managing Assessments in Training Environments (SEAMATE). SEAMATE will enable smaller numbers of instructors to supervise larger groups of students through a combination of improved student performance tracking, event-based automated feedback, and efficient, contextualized alerting. SEAMATEs instructor-oriented user interface (UI) will support at-a-glance awareness of multiple students performance, providing dynamic feedback to direct the instructors attention and improve awareness of individual student progress and intervention needs. Overall, SEAMATE will increase the effectiveness and efficiency of VE-based training methods, enabling highly trained shiphandling instructors to work with larger training cohorts.",

Prioritized diagnostic and  repair actions achieve cost-avoidance through reduced mean time to repair (MTTR), reduced  frequency of no fault found (NFF) codes, increased mean time between maintenance events  (MTBE), and increased utilization effrciency of the VDATS platform. The net result is higher  asset availability at reduced cost. Examples of relevant beneficiaries include Electronic V/arfare  (EV/), communications, and navigation systems where conventional diagnostic methods are not  sufficient to ensure cost-effective operational readiness of the aircraft to perform its mission.BENEFIT:The potential cost-avoidance enabled by the Expert Troubleshooting Repair System (ETRS) is  conservatively estimated at $2 million per yeff per \"bad actor\" Circuit Card Assembly (CCA)  part number in direct maintenance costs. There are additional savings from reduced indirect  logistic and inventory management and increased asset availability. This is based on a very  conservative estimate of 100 instances of \"bad actor\" CCAs, each incurring an average of two  unnecessary maintenance actions at a round-trip cost of $10,000 in FY2014 dollars. The costavoidance  for just three types of bad actor ALQ-172 CCAs over the next five years is over $30  million (3 CCA x $2Miyear x 5 years).

This new approach offers the potential advantages of significantly lower costs and easier scale-up using nozzle-free nanofiber spinning processes. Dry reusable adhesives as a replacement for messy liquid glues will improve product safety and reduce environmental impact. Removable and reusable adhesive tapes and labels will also eliminate waste and facilitate product recycling. The resulting products will have strong shear adhesion and easy peel, leading to broad application with a wide range of substrates like glass, metal, wall board, and plastics. Proof-of-concept samples have confirmed market-driven value propositions. The Phase II project will develop commercial products and applications for consumer and industrial applications, for automotive assembly systems, for decorative wall murals, and for medical device and health care uses. Fiber spinning and collection techniques will be engineered to improve product performance, reduce costs and improve scalability of the manufacturing process. The Phase I project has confirmed proof-of-concept dry adhesive samples with shear adhesion strengths exceeding 20 N/cm2 in dynamic mode and 45 N/cm2 in dead weight mode. The resulting samples have low peel strength and are reusable. In Phase II, the electrospinning process will be optimized using novel polymer blend systems to achieve performance targets for specific customer product development. The nozzleless electrospinning process will be scaled to the pilot level for product testing and to provide the engineering design basis for commercial manufacture. A continuous roll-to-roll process to produce aligned nanofibers will break new ground in the electrospinning industry. New applications in medical devices have been proposed by strategic partners to capitalize on the self-adhesion properties of these materials. Dry adhesive applicator systems will be developed to allow the aligned adhesive nanofibers to conform to surface asperities. With the Phase I success of proof-of-concept prototypes, the Phase II effort will move the development of aligned nanofiber dry adhesives into the market introduction phase in preparation for commercial manufacture and sales.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop and commercialize radiation-tolerant integrated circuit (IC) technology for producing radiation-tolerant/hardened (rad-hard) ICs capable of being manufactured using leading-edge commercial IC processing instead of expensive specialized processes which use older, less efficient lithography nodes. The direct customers for the technology, to be delivered in the form of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools and support services, will be semiconductor integrated device manufacturers and semiconductor foundries. In the CT scanner industry, improved radiation-tolerance of the electronics will allow key components to be placed directly in the X-ray path, improving signal quality, and resulting in better images at reduced X-ray dose levels to patients. Reducing X-ray exposure from CT scans is a medical priority, as it has been estimated that 0.4% of current cancer incidents result from high X-ray doses from CT scans. Application of the patent-pending technology in radiation-hard ICs for a wide range of other commercial radiation-environment markets will follow, including commercial satellites, nuclear-power electronics, nondestructive testing, and medical electronics sterilization. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will provide integrated circuit (IC) designers access to leading-edge IC technology and advanced lithography nodes in developing ICs for radiation-tolerant applications, and is based on patent-pending transistor-level design and layout innovations and their implementation in EDA tools. In Phase I, proof-of-concept was established; transistor structures evaluated for X-ray and gamma radiation tolerance improved by a factor of 7 for 1.8V transistors, and by well over a factor of 10 for 5V transistors, with the use of the technology. The research objective of Phase II is to provide ready access to the benefits of the technology to IC designers by incorporating the methodologies for transistor-level design and layout improvements into industry-standard EDA tools. A number of technical challenges will be addressed in Phase II, including optimizing the tools for producing area-efficient and cost-efficient transistor layouts, and assuring seamless integration with existing design flows. A beta version of an EDA tool kit will be developed in Phase II; the anticipated result will be a tool that can be used by initial customers in producing rad-hard ICs used in CT scan electronics and other applications.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Exquadrum, Inc. proposes to develop an innovative and advanced, low-cost, high-performance, cryogenic upper stage engine cycle.  The SLATE engine is a modified dual-bleed expander cycle that maintains state of the art performance while enabling significantly reduced weight, size, and cost, increased reliability, improved operability, and scalability.  The engine cycle enables lower pump discharge and system pressures for high-reliability and reduced weight.  Additionally, the engine uses a thrust chamber and nozzle arrangement that overcomes the historical limitations of expander cycle engines inability to scale to high thrust.  The proposed engine concept is significantly smaller and lighter than both historical and state-of-the-art engines.  The low-cost thrust chamber provides improved stability over any existing conventional thrust chamber of comparable engine size.    In Phase I, Exquadrum conducted trade studies to optimize the engine cycle, generated a vision engine conceptual design, and developed and manufactured the low-cost thrust chamber at full scale.  In Phase II, Exquadrum will conduct full-scale engine testing of a section in pressure-fed mode in a systems engineering risk-reduction based development program to quantify performance and demonstrate the advantages of the engine cycle.    BENEFIT:  Anticipated benefits include significantly increasing the thrust-to-weight, while retaining high reliability and operability, and significantly reducing size and cost.  Additionally, this engine cycle enables a scalability not possible with current engines enabling it to fulfill a wide range of applications.  Potential commercial applications include the growing commercial launch industry, and their need for low-cost, high-performance upper stage engines.  This engine cycle is ideal for the next generation of cost-optimized launch vehicles.",

        "abstract": "The broader commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is the commercial development of novel materials and processes for the immobilization of enzymes. The project is targeting enzymes as catalysts to be used in the manufacturing of active pharmaceutical intermediates (API). The use of enzyme for the production of pharmaceuticals has the potential to reduce cost, complexity and improve efficiency in making these products. The green, cost-efficient and scalable oxidative immobilized enzymes will benefit manufacturers by improving their production efficiencies and economics as well as minimizing adverse environmental impact. The technology could make benign oxidative enzymes commercially competitive replacing expensive precious metal catalysts, toxic, or other hazardous chemicals used in the production processes for APIs. The industrial applications for this technology could be broad well beyond the pharmaceutical arena. The technical objectives of this Phase II research project are to (1) develop oxidative enzyme constructs and biocatalytic schemes for the production of high-value commercial active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), (2) develop and produce magnetic macroporous scaffolds, and (3) improve operation of commercial reactors for continuous flow manufacturing or retrofit existing production processes using these magnetic catalysts with immobilized enzymes. This project enables immobilization to become a part of the selection process: enzymes can be selected for their true potential in their immobilized form by engineering enzyme immobilization with three levels of innovation: entrap commercially-available or third-party engineered enzymes into magnetic nanoclusters; create high-surface area scaffolds that stabilize the magnetic nanocluster assemblies, providing cost and process advantages of maintaining the nanocluster assemblies in suspension magnetically. This project is focusing on a high-potential, well-described and commercially available enzyme from the oxidoreductase family that will be used the synthesis of drug intermediates by enzyme-producers and enzyme-end users in the pharmaceutical sector.",

The system would incorporate novel recirculation of the evaporator condensate to pre-cool the air flowing through the condenser coil. This technique is estimated to reduce the power consumption of the air conditioning unit by 9%.  The system would also leverage advances in engine and generator control technology to realize dramatic reductions in fuel consumption.    Energy Quest will produce a series of prototypes incrementally correcting and improving the product based on lab testing and field trials. Extensive field trials will reveal any flaws in the unit as well as ensuring the unit matches the aircraft needs. The final unit will be as energy efficient as possible while being designed for low production cost, reliability and maintainability.BENEFIT:The fuel consumption of the proposed system, which will replace the legacy -70 system, is projected to average 10.6 gallons/hour, compared to the existing -70 system, which uses 36.6 gal/hr, a 71% reduction in fuel use.",

The electronics layout and sensor suite was designed for plug and play use. The Phase II effort will consist of improving on the original Phase I/Option design for the modular test surrogate and integrate a full torso and neck capable of housing a wide range of sensors for experiments and model validation. A modular instrument-ready surrogate will be delivered at the end of Phase II for evaluation and feedback by JNLWP.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a platform for the discovery of new anthelmintic (anti-parasite) drugs. Drug resistance is occurring with all anthelmintics currently on the market. Current drug development only introduces new molecules to the existing drug targets. As a result, drug resistance quickly jumps to these new drugs, which makes them ineffective shortly after market introduction. Without an adequate source of effective anthelmintics, livestock yields, crop damage, and human capital are starting to suffer. The social burden is creating economic losses totaling hundreds of billions of dollars worldwide. By focusing on a novel drug target that controls entry into infective life forms, this proposal aims to generate a new class of anthelmintics to combat this growing problem. The drug companies that commercialize this potential new class of anthelmintics will access a market potential of $1.5 B per year or more. The SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a platform for the discovery of new anthelmintic drugs using genetically engineered nematods (C. elegans). The approach used will insert a segment of a parasite gene in replacement of a segment of a native gene. The resulting chimera gene converts the C. elegans nematode into a form that better mimics the parasite state. Drug hits found active on the chimera-expressing nematode are then refined into leads by testing for efficacy against parasite infection model. The proposal's chimera platform is adapted to a diverse set of parasite genes. The resulting diverse platform is expected to provide a rapid path to discovery and eventual introduction of a novel class of anti-parasite drugs with broad-spectrum activity.",

The development will include the design and development of all associated signal processing algorithms, along with implementation of HDL code on an FPGA-based target platform.  The modem implementation is intended to serve as the basis of a future SATCOM system exploiting V/W-Band spectrum.  The development will culminate with the benchtop demonstration of the ultra-wideband modem operating in digital loopback on the targeted FPGA-based platform, including digital channel emulation impairments to aid in characterizing modem performance.  BENEFIT:  Successful Phase II will result in a wideband, power-efficient modem implemented on low-cost commercial FPGAs operating at wider bandwidths and higher data rates in excess of what is available in the commercial, terrestrial market.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in demonstrating the commercial implementation of NBD Nanotechnologies, Inc.'s (NBD) Enhanced Condensation Coating. NBD's external surface coating sustains dropwise condensation on copper-based tubes, resulting in energy savings and increased efficiency for industrial condensers in steam power and thermal desalination plants. NBD's innovative and proprietary techniques ensure adhesion onto the substrate while not compromising the thermal resistance with the coating's sub-microscale thickness. NBD has validated the increased efficiency of its external surface condenser coating technology at a lab-scale and will carry out pilot tests to quantify the efficiency gain and technology durability at a system-level in industrial condensers, as requested by utility customers. NBD presents a technology that addresses the key commercial bottlenecks of durability, scalability and performance, which have stymied coatings in condensers, presenting a leapfrogging technology that addresses the water-energy nexus. Every 1% improvement in power plant efficiency results in $10MM revenue per plant per year, as stated by a partnering power generation company. Thus, any improvement in the efficiency of a steam condenser has significant impact that directly benefits both global energy and water sustainability efforts. This project contributes to R&D advancement focused on: large-scale chemical and coating processing, surface wettability, nano-and micro-scale heat transfer, condensation, and water and energy resource sustainability. The project's multidisciplinary nature reflects the dynamic aspects of condensation heat transfer phenomenon, which covers varying length scales (nano, micro, meso and macro scale) and time scales. Thus, the challenging nature of optimizing and sustaining enhanced condensation invites innovative and creative solutions to mitigate the water and energy resource management problems. During Phase I, the project demonstrated the proof of concept of the coating's condensation enhancement for both industrial condensers with pure steam (and trace amounts of non-condensable gases) and for HVAC/dehumidification systems where condensation occurs with higher concentrations of non-condensable gases. The objective of phase II proposal is to address and facilitate the required steps for scaling up and integrating NBD's condenser coating into industrial condensers' supply chain. NBD has identified industrial condensers as its primary entry market, where a greater increase in condenser system performance and savings in cost and fuel consumption can be reached. NBD has been establishing partnerships for pilot studies to perform larger scale experimental tests to validate its technology's performance, durability and system-level efficiency gains empirically.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is focused on establishing full-scale production parameters, quality control procedures, operational testing and commercialization of cutting-edge compartmentalized vacuum composites. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in cold chain shipping, storage, building insulation, automobiles, aerospace and other advanced markets. The first application is in the cold chain shipping industry, for packaging and storage of temperature sensitive materials. A new generation of thin (less than 1\"), light weight, highly insulated (R value 25-30), durable, and long service life boxes will meet a critical need in this area. Temperature-sensitive products such as vaccines, blood, organs, and diagnostic specimens are shipped using insulated containers, and the new materials to be developed will permit longer shipping duration, higher impact resistance, and re-usability. The cold chain shipping market includes the Red Cross, blood banks, pharmacies, clinical trial shippers, diagnostic centers, life science material providers and whole sale distributors. The annual United States market potential in life sciences packaging is estimated at $291 million. The resulting materials also have significant potential for uses in permanent and temporary structures, and in a variety of transportation applications. Successful completion of the Phase I work has resulted in cost-effective (an order of magnitude lower expected cost), stronger (ten times the impact resistance of Styrofoam), lightweight, thin (less than 1\"), highly-insulating (R 16-22), compartmentalized vacuum composite materials. An exclusive machining capability was also demonstrated, whereby vacuum composites can be cut and sized on-site without degradation in thermal performance, an issue which affects current vacuum insulation panels (VIPs). Optimization of the developed composites to achieve targeted insulation rating, cost, and service life characteristics will be conducted during Phase II. Thermal performance, mechanical characteristics and operational performance will be evaluated for their application in cold chain shipping and in building/structural insulation. The team will also validate boxes fabricated using these materials in cold chain shipping to verify safe transportation of blood products, organs, and/or pharmaceuticals. Based on the Phase II work, it is anticipated that these materials will be poised to replace petroleum-based foam materials and vacuum insulation panels as a high-performance and economical solution in these markets.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate an entirely new approach to farming seafood. To date only a limited amount of marine aquaculture on-land and indoors is carried out anywhere utilizing a technology requiring only saltwater, limited space and our novel zero waste approach,. This approach takes advantage of ecological principle whereby diverse aquatic species ? including fish, sandworms, algae, oysters, seaweed and more ? are cultured together in a cyclic system in a way that allows the waste from one to serve as nutrition for others. Because such facilities are not in the ocean, seafood culture will no longer be restricted by certain naturally ideal habitats, competition for space, strict environmental regulations, occasional pollution and hazardous weather. Indeed, they offer what may be the only technology able to satisfy the ever growing global demand for protein. The inputs required are sunlight for the plants and feed, but even the latter can be cultured either internally or derived from ever-present, external waste streams. The approach is commercially attractive, too, especially when combined with alternative energy sources. Being modular, the first unit can be readily emulated everywhere. The proposed project seeks to break away from dependency on the oceans for seafood production sites and, of course, to do so in a manner that is economically viable. On-land production does offer challenges, many of which are overcome by farming diverse kinds of seafood together, a second break-away that confers health and generates byproduct revenues. To do so requires new farm designs, a grasp of each aquatic crop?s special needs and full understanding of how each interacts beneficially with others within the shared space and seawater. To achieve this so that the first full scale, commercial operation can be undertaken with confidence, it is deemed vital that a pilot plant be operated for not less than two years. Within that period, approximately ten forms of marketable marine plants and animals will be introduced. Health, growth and overall water quality will be carefully monitored. Special attention will be given to purely practical aspects of aquafarm management so that, when commercial, any reasonably capable farmer can manage the operation, guided by a computer model that, along with equipment design, will be a major deliverable of the research in addition to the proposed demonstration. From apparent complexity, simple commercial methods will emerge.",

        "abstract": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to answer the presidential call to \"create digital tutors that are as effective as personal tutors.\" More than any other subject, mathematical learning is cumulative, and as students fall behind their classmates, new material becomes less comprehensible and they can face an ever-widening gap to their peers. Formative assessment (FA) practices have been well established as effective in closing these gaps and informing teacher decision-making. While the influx of mobile computing devices has enormous potential to help facilitate change in education, the potential is heavily dependent on the availability of proven, research-backed software and services. This project will help close achievement gaps by providing students with adaptive, personalized instruction and also providing teachers with valuable FA techniques, data, and suggestions. More broadly, the data will yield opportunities to research and model student understanding and to analyze the learning process, enabling additional research into effective practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics. With its strong customer value propositions and innovations that will enable new forms of software-enhanced teaching and learning, this project will also create significant commercial value within the educational market. This project will create digital learning environments that go beyond current state-of-the-art systems to deliver adaptively selected instructional video segments and highly interactive problems, and do so while maintaining a flow of content that feels natural - as if the learning was occurring in the presence of an actual tutor. The ability of the system to adapt to the needs of an individual student is based upon a real-time assessment of student understanding and leverages cutting edge research from the fields of formative assessment, machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data. The ability to model student understanding and analyze the learning process will lead to the creation of new learning analytics tools and enable additional research into effective practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics. The proposed research will seek to demonstrate, in a randomized crossover trial, the effectiveness of the adaptive, online system over a control treatment. The researched solutions will also employ novel FA implementations such as collaborative review and white-boarding (via wireless communication), record and playback of teacher work, use of student sentiment, groupings of peers for collaborative work, and models of student understanding that incorporate teacher input (teacher plus software in the FA loop).",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Significant cost reductions and system improvements would ensue if multiple transmit and receive antennas could share one RF aperture without performance degradation due to self-interference phenomenon.  Effects of radar jamming signals would be also be reduced through the use of a properly designed reflector capable of only reflecting the RF radiation of interest. To enable such improvements, a narrow band meta-surface, capable of dynamically switching between two reflective states was designed. This present effort intent is to fabricate this design both as a single element and as an array and to characterize the subsequent surface for tunability and to characterize the meta-surface properties. Fabrication, manufacturing and effects of space environments on this reflecting surface will also be investigated.  BENEFIT:  An active frequency selective surface will allow multiple transmit and receive antennas to share a common aperture, dramatically reducing system footprint and mitigating effects of jamming signals. Such a surface will find use in space-based platforms where communication and sensor payload size, weight and component count are of extreme importance.    Potential products to be developed from this technology include a reflector/antenna that will enable the use of a common radio frequency aperture for transmit/receive applications in a space environment. The reflector will be electronically tunable to operate at applicable frequencies. Such a product would be a low-cost alternative to current space-based antenna payloads. In addition, negative effects from unwanted signals found in space communication systems would be mitigated with the current SSSC design.",

Proven feasible via modeling and simulations in Phase I, BRAINWARE is based on solid-state memristors, analog silicon neurons and low-power clockless system architecture. This novel approach offers an entirely new way of implementing high-performance massively parallel high-speed processing capability, crucial to replace todays high-power supercomputing systems. Using this approach, the Phase II BRAINWARE system architecture uniquely integrates multiple independently packaged memristive crossbars with VLSI-based analog neural network. Superior to the state-of-the-art parallel processing method, this integration results in a small, lightweight, low-power cognitive processing technology suitable for integration in unmanned aerial system (UAS) image processing platforms and cognitive communication systems. Additionally, BRAINWARE processors offer unprecedented capabilities: immediate sleep and wake-up function, low noise and electromagnetic emission and high resistance to hardware attack. We expect that at the end of Phase II, a BRAINWARE system prototype with processing power equivalent to 50 million mammalian neurons occupying less than 15 cubic centimeters will be ready for initial Army testing.",

Direct mechanical drive of the air compressor for example introduces constant parasitic losses that could be eliminated by driving the compressor electrically on-demand. Providing an electric-drive capability to the MTVR engine air compressor and HVAC compressor means these standby systems can be powered by on-board batteries, a more efficient auxiliary power unit, or shore power  allowing the engine to shut down and reduce idle fuel consumption. Also during transient operation energy is lost in deceleration and braking to pumping friction and brake heat. Providing a means of dynamically harvesting energy of the driveline and turbocharger could allow this energy to be reused. The engine turbocharger coupled to an electric motor-generator could harvest energy during deceleration which could be re-introduced to minimize turbo-lag on acceleration, providing more boost pressure with lower turbine backpressure resulting in higher engine efficiency. These approaches to improving efficiency will be analyzed, tested, and evaluated, with the most favorable approaches implemented on a Caterpillar C12 engine, and in the Phase II Option, an MTVR vehicle.",

ABF algorithms ability to suppress loud acoustic interference arriving in the sidelobe region of beams will reduce clutter and improve detection performance.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is development of a microbial technology for the conversion of low-value sugars into high-value chemicals. Most industrial chemicals produced today are derived from petroleum and other nonrenewable raw materials. The long-term growth and sustainability of the chemical industry benefits from development of new routes to existing chemicals using renewable raw materials. Furthermore, due to higher infrastructure costs and stricter environmental requirements, many chemicals that were once produced in the United States are now produced abroad. This contributes to the U.S. trade deficit. This Phase II proposal aims to develop a fermentation technology where domestically grown agricultural materials (for example, corn and waste agricultural residues) are converted into high-value chemicals. The optimized fermentation process is estimated to be cost-competitive with the incumbent petrochemical route when scaled. If successful, this proposal will facilitate growth of a domestic bio-chemical manufacturing industry, targeting the $30 billion organic acids market. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop large-scale, high-throughput techniques to optimize gene expression in industrial yeast. A significant problem within the field of industrial biotechnology is the ability to engineer and optimize the fermentation performance of non-academic or model microbes. Most molecular metabolic engineering tools are developed for use in two model prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, E. coli and S. cerevisiae, and are not suitable for use with industrially relevant microbes. Without these tools it is costly and slow to commercialize new fermentation technologies. The goal of this Phase II project is to develop and implement a set of molecular biology tools designed for acid-tolerant yeast, and working to apply them toward improving small molecule production. Specifically, the molecular biology tools are useful for tuning (up- or down-regulation) user-defined gene transcription and translation. Engineered microbes harboring the desired genetic modification(s) are assayed for improved small molecule production from sugar in small scale fermentations. Successful genetic modifications are those that result in more efficient small molecule product formation from sugar, and ideally decreased biomass formation from sugar, providing a lower production cost in a scaled, commercial process.",

Replacing standard automotive sunroof glass with dynamic sunroof glass will increase fuel efficiency by 3 miles per gallon during summer time. If all the glass in an automobile is replaced with dynamic glass then the impact will be much larger, resulting in decrease in oil consumption by several millions of barrels per day.

The novel electrochromic layers developed during Phase I research will be improved further and scaled up to commercially significant size prototypes. New smart windows will cost 3-4x lower compared to current smart window products on the market or in advanced development stage.

        "abstract": "This SBIR Phase II project will develop novel 3D web and mobile role-playing simulations that can improve social skills in children. Virtual characters participate in nuanced conversations with students, powering a transformational experience for practicing and assessing communication skills. Rigorous evaluations have demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of teaching perspective-taking and social skills through simulated role-playing, beneficial to students struggling with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or bullying. These simulations will disrupt the multi-billion dollar market for social emotional learning (SEL) by allowing students to learn and practice social skills as they would with teachers or therapists, but at a fraction of the cost. Current solutions for practicing and assessing social skills rely on face-to-face interaction, which is costly and difficult to scale. Producing socially rich, open-ended simulations has previously been infeasible, due to technical challenges required to replicate the complexity of human language. This project overcomes these barriers using an innovative technology with the potential to revolutionize how people learn and practice social skills by delivering real-time personalized feedback at scale. Future applications of the social behavior capture (So-Cap) technology that underlies this project range from contextually aware intelligent personal assistants to socially aware robotics. This project's unprecedented ability to respond authentically to open-ended natural language input relies on an innovative crowdsourced approach to artificial intelligence (AI), which imbues machines with the ability to understand dialogue in context and engage in extended conversations covering multiple topics. Individualized responses are tailored to user input by drawing from a massive database of recorded human dialogue, captured from online role-playing. The process for mining meaningful patterns from this data also employs crowdsourcing, relying on non-experts hired online to cluster and annotate words, utterances, and events. A computational model formed by these patterns powers a real-time conversational engine, which selects responses by combining AI techniques including plan recognition and case-based planning. The goal of this research is to pioneer a practical, repeatable process for democratizing the production of social simulations, minimizing cost while maximizing societal impact by providing social skills practice at scale.",

The process will use underutilized feedstocks such as corn stover and forestry residue to produce fermentable sugars, which can be converted into various raw materials and finished products. The project will add to the scientific understanding of ionic liquid bioprocessing and has the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stimulate rural job creation. The technical objective of this Phase II research project is to develop an integrated process for converting lignocellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars. The process uses ionic liquids that dissolve biomass and afford monomeric sugars at high yields via a reaction that is both simple and fast. What is lacking is an affordable method for separating sugars while recycling the ionic liquid. In Phase I the project demonstrated an efficient strategy for sugar recovery. By the first half of Phase II the goal is to integrate sugar recovery into the process front end. Unit operations taking raw biomass to clean sugars and lignin will be performed in batch open loop in order to close mass balances and set a baseline for further process development. Then, the loop will be closed with the addition of ionic liquid cleaning and drying. By the end of this project, the objective is to demonstrate a stable and high-yielding process, including experimentally validated techno-economic projections showing unprecedentedly low capital and operating costs.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will profoundly improve the economics of solar water heating (SWH) systems. Little innovation has occurred in this area since the advent of evacuated tube solar thermal collectors in the 1980s. Despite these advances the cost of SWH systems is much higher than the cost of fossil fuels in the U.S. Thus while there exists a flourishing global market in excess of $20B, the market for such systems in the U.S. is virtually nonexistent. The solar thermal collector technology under investigation has demonstrated performance in terms of efficiency vs. output temperature that is already superior to that of state-of-the-art collectors. Economic modeling further indicates that in high volume production the collector would be substantially less expensive than commercial products. This combination of improved performance and reduced cost has the potential to make SWH economically viable in more than 40 states in the U.S. An outcome which could provide a solid economic foundation for the revival of a domestic industry, and accelerate the proliferation of these systems worldwide. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will extend the performance envelope of two solar thermal collector architectures identified during the Phase I effort. Current solar thermal collectors exhibit non-economic price/performance metrics and are constrained to water heating applications in only a few markets worldwide. The first architecture utilizes advection to improve the insulating properties of a granular nano-porous medium. The Phase II effort will transition this architecture from prototype to the fabrication and characterization of an engineering scale collector. It is expected that increasing the size and solar simulator output (currently below reference standard) will increase efficiency significantly. Material dopants, heat transfer fluid dynamics, and optical absorber thermal properties will be examined computationally and experimentally to further improve performance. The second architecture significantly extends the operational range. This effort will explore techniques to expand this range including the use of material dopants to modify optical characteristics and the development of passive technique for concentrating optics. Computer simulations suggest that outputs comparable to that of a parabolic trough are possible.",

Hence, compliance tracking, aligning curricula with competencies and course authoring are manual and expensive processes. This project aims to unlock these silos and make it simple to search, tag and curate courseware at topic-level across multiple platforms. The technology also extracts student feedback and assessment information and maps it against granular learning objectives to provide new insights to track and improve learning outcomes. By unlocking courseware stuck in silo-ed college systems, this project facilitates a cross-institutional marketplace that enables any institution to share and/or monetize curated high quality content, and conversely have access to curated course packs that may be taught by adjunct faculty, a $2B market opportunity. Simplifying faculty access to Open Educational Resources and curated learning content from other colleges will help drive down student course-pack costs significantly. The key technical innovation in this project is seamless extraction of learning content from multiple educational repositories coupled with a syllabus-driven semantically intelligent search and recommendation engine woven into the course curation process. Developing an abstracted mechanism to interface with different types of learning management systems and other repositories, and making it portable without requiring a common content format is a significant innovation. Natural Language Processing techniques combined with curated controlled vocabularies and taxonomies are applied to simplify curation of a course, notably automatic topic identification and instructional tagging. The curation data is leveraged in the semantic search engine to improve recommendation of courseware during course authoring. The goal of the adaptive recommendation engine is to improve discovery and usage of both open educational resources and courseware developed in other colleges, without requiring expensive professional services. Another goal of the project is to extract student feedback seamlessly using IMS defined standards regardless of which learning management system is used to deliver the content. The student feedback, assessment data, grades and other information pulled from various college systems are then correlated to provide rich analytics and visibility of student outcomes and alignment of courseware with competencies.",

The coming of the information age has mandated radical changes in the skills set required for 21st century. To teach these skills, as articulated in the Common Core Standards, teachers are expected to target students? ability to conduct short as well as more sustained research projects. The Internet is not only the obvious go-to place for teaching these skills but one of the reasons for mandating them. It is the easy access to vast amounts of information that has made it possible for everyone to conduct research, analyze data and build new knowledge. The problem, however, is that the Internet is not a library with reliable and catalogued information that can be searched by topic and, in school libraries, by reading level. The development of the proposed technology, a personalized librarian on-demand, solves this problem. It offers unprecedented opportunity for learners of all ages to engage in inquiry, it enables differentiated learning and gives learners a life-long tool to help them understand and critically engage with digital information. The target market is not limited to the U.S. The developed linguistic algorithms apply to non-English, allowing early targeting of the international market by building web curators for other languages. This project blends research on linguistics, psychology of reading, natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. Innovative NLP technology is used to detect age-appropriate sites that are relevant to the curriculum. The developed technology analyzes the reading difficulty and thematic content of websites automatically in real time search. The purpose of the system is to make adaptive individualized recommendations that match the student's reading level and are appropriate for her current familiarity with the topic. The patent pending adaptive component is built using machine learning and collaborative filtering methods. The resulting research tool, a personalized web curator, is based on novel methods for modeling the student's familiarity with the topic of web resources. These methods are extended to include novel analysis of video content. Unlike other adaptive educational products, the system's adaptive recommendations do not rely on obtaining test scores from the user and corresponding them to pre-labeled, leveled data. The complete solution includes an integrated gamified experience that helps the students acquire basic and advanced research skills and develop the habit of applying them consistently. The project team includes educational technology experts from academia and schools and conducts extensive studies evaluating learning benefits by the afforded differentiation in instruction, including special education programs and English Language Learners.",

The goal is to countervail today's stress on the grid, caused by rapidly growing electric power demand and the integration of renewable power sources. In this project, a distributed energy storage system will be developed that is robust, scalable, deployable, and price competitive. The storage system will help to improve the power quality, avoid widespread power outages, integrate renewable energy, and improve the utilization of existing grid assets. This storage system will allow utilities and system operators to reduce investments into the existing grid while simultaneously improving the service for their customers. The grid-scaled distributed energy storage market is an emerging market that is projected to growly rapidly in the coming years according to numerous studies. Among all the different storage technologies, batteries have the scalability, calendar life, cycle life, response time and low maintenance costs most suitable to the needs of distributed, power-grid-integrated energy storage.

Sodium batteries were identified by Sandia National Laboratory as providing the highest technical and economic development potential for grid-scaled distributed energy storage. The main barriers to their wide-spread implementation are their considerably high production cost, their high operating temperature, and their long charge/discharge time. Na4B has developed a new electrolyte to vastly improve the ion transport and to overcome the technical limitations inherent in the existing technology.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop an analytical assay to enable measurement of biological samples by mass spectrometry and fluorescence. The assay will be based on a microarray platform, for applications in the areas of targeted quantitative proteomics, enzymatic activity assays, and combinatorial chemistry. Targeted quantitative proteomics measures changes in the concentration of a specific protein biomarker across multiple samples, such as cell lines, tissues, or biofluids. In the pharmaceutical industry, this method is widely used to assess efficiency of a drug candidate compound as well as its potential toxicity. Researchers are especially interested in the multiplexed approaches to quantitative proteomics that could provide detailed information on the state of various cellular biochemical networks. The significance of this project is the newly developed capability to rapidly separate, purify, and concentrate a large number of proteomic biomarkers for multiplexed quantitative analysis by mass spectrometry. This will result in the assay miniaturization to help lower the costs of the drug development process. Outside of the pharmaceutical field, the technology can be utilized in the clinical settings for performing minimally invasive diagnostics. It also can be extended to basic biology research to study a wide range of important biological interactions including antibody-antigen, drug candidate-drug target, enzyme-substrate, receptor-ligand, and others. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a new analytical technology for life sciences termed Bead-Assisted Mass Spectrometry (BAMS). BAMS is a microarray platform that enables independent data acquisition by fluorescence and mass spectrometry. It applies the method of image cytometry to rapidly screen thousands of microbeads arrayed inside individual wells on a miniaturized microwell plate (picotiter plate). It is the first technology to incorporate high throughput analysis by mass spectrometry into bead-based bioassays, which in their current form are measured primarily on flow cytometry instruments. The dual detection capability is particularly important in proteomics where mass spectrometry can be applied to distinguish protein isoforms and proteins with different patterns of post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. This project will utilize mass spectrometry imaging in combination with two- and three-dimensional fluorescence imaging, and will perform complementary analysis of bead arrays on the MALDI TOF and ESI MS platforms to achieve greater sequence coverage. This technology will provide researchers with far more options with respect to designing custom multiplex bead assays than currently possible. In addition, BAMS may be used to measure optically encoded beads, mass tag-encoded beads, and even non-encoded beads such as combinatorial peptide bead libraries.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from the proposed technology touching many aspects of architectural design. The company's cloud-based acoustic simulation service (CBASS) is aimed at architects and acoustical consultants. There are over 105,000 architects, 25,000 architecture students, and 2,000 acoustical consultants in the US. Acoustic simulation is a $450 million market. CBASS will be used to understand a building's acoustics before it is built, reducing the time and money spent on fixing acoustic issues. CBASS will check for acoustic issues in a design and automatically suggest ways of fixing them, allowing architects to be more certain of their designs, and saving on remodeling costs by getting the acoustics right initially. CBASS will also speed up and simplify the process by which architects and acoustical consultants collaborate, leading to reduced costs and better acoustics. The company will offer low-cost subscriptions to students, to help train the next generation of architects to think about acoustics earlier in the design phase. Increased use of acoustic simulation will lead to better sounding spaces for everyone: classrooms that are more conducive to learning, hospitals that more conducive to healing, more enjoyable theaters, and quieter homes. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop new ways of using cloud computing to understand and improve the acoustics of buildings. Reliably modeling the behavior of sound waves is a hard problem. Researchers have recently developed an algorithm called Adaptive Rectangular Decomposition (ARD), which can accurately model acoustics. To make it work on complex, real-world data, the company has developed algorithms for running ARD on multiple computers at the same time, in the cloud. In this project the company will develop new algorithms that use acoustic modeling and machine learning to automatically check for compliance with standard acoustic guidelines, identify acoustic issues, and suggest changes and improvements to a design that are likely to improve its acoustics. When running ARD in the cloud, individual computers must keep sending data to each other, slowing down the overall simulation. The company will develop improved ways of managing this data exchange, allowing much faster and more reliable acoustic simulation. To let teams of architects and acoustical consultants collaborate on a project, the company will also develop ways of allowing the same project data and analyses to be accessed and reviewed by multiple people at the same time.",

The technology developed in this proposal will provide a competitive edge in the rapid engineering of synthetic organisms to produce biochemicals by fermentation that are currently produced from oil (reducing our CO2 emissions) or extracted from natural species (reducing our taxing load on existing ecosystems). This technology also has the potential to be used for the manufacture of drugs, and to engineer novel organisms to improve crop production and therefore help address the mounting challenges of providing food to a growing world population without tapping too much in Earth's resources. Commercially, the chemicals that will be enabled by application of the technology developed during the Phase I program open up billion dollar markets that are currently inaccessible to the chemical industry. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a platform that combines computational enzyme design with systems biology to create a fully integrated system for the design and testing of novel cell factories for the production of bulk and fine chemicals. During the Phase I project, the company, in collaboration with the University of Washington, has successfully developed a high-performance software code to rapidly design novel metabolic pathways to produce any target chemical from central metabolism. In Phase II, the company will further advance the concept by (1) developing a high-performance pathway prioritization module to estimate each designed pathway yield and impact on organism metabolism in the context of whole-genome models and (2) use the software platform to design libraries of pathways for the production of a variety of specialty chemical targets that are commercially valuable and not known to be produced by fermentation at scale. Then, (3) using an experimental screening setup, the DNA for all the proposed pathways will be assembled screened at high-throughput for detectable production of the target chemicals.",

After its qualification, 3D TSV selective metallization technology will enable fabrication of high performance 3D microsystems at lower cost by replacing costly damascene interconnect technology with selective electrochemical metallization technology for TSV metal fill, bump and redistribution layer formation. The successful completion of this project would have a significant societal impact by accelerating 3D IC wafer technology adoption into state-of-art high performance digital devices such as next generation of smart phones. This project will also have positive economic impact by creating US semiconductor jobs and maintaining US technology leadership over a wide range of electronic applications and consumer electronic devices. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project advances a novel three-dimensional through-silicon vias (TSV) selective metallization technology to fabricate low cost and scalable 3D integrated circuits (IC). Physical and economical limitations for two-dimensional scaling (so called \"Moore?s Law\") prevent further increase of integration density to improve the performance of IC. These challenges have stimulated the development of 3D TSV technology (so called \"More than Moore\") in order to increase the speed and bandwidth of the devices as well as to decrease the form factor and power consumption of integrated microsystems. However, the mass adoption of 3D IC is limited by the high cost of 3D TSV interconnects (due to the use of expensive vapor deposition and chemical-mechanical damascene processes) and its poor scalability (due to low conformality of physical and chemical vapor deposited films) to high aspect ratios and smaller via sizes. Proprietary and patented 3D TSV selective metallization technology developed during Phase I project will be further optimized and qualified on production tools to address cost and scalability issues of 3D TSV interconnects. Enabling low cost and scalable 3D ICs will allow heterogeneous systems integration for next generation smart phones and other consumer electronic devices.",

Companies will be able to offer new experiences to customers, analyze their movements, and provide them with targeted information or advertisements when and where they need them. Other applications of the technology will provide considerable societal benefits: (i) first responders will be able to accurately localize victims, thus reducing response times and saving lives; (ii) building managers will be able to condition rooms in real-time based on their occupancies, substantially reducing energy consumption; (iii) people with disabilities will be able to obtain assistance by finding wheelchair-accessible routes; (iv) warehouse managers will be able to reduce order fulfillment time; (v) service providers (e.g., hospitals, military, IT) will be able to track, dispatch, and more efficiently manage critical workforce personnel (e.g. doctors and technicians).

        "abstract": "To deal with the increasingly complex, dynamic and unpredictable operational environments of the 21st century, unmanned and autonomous system, sensor, and vehicle technologies are being expanded and improved. For example, unmanned air, ground, and maritime systems provide an expanding set of capabilities, such as intelligence, detection, security, targeting, and strike, while reducing the risk to human life. The goal with the employment of these systems is to shift from todays manpower-intensive model of unmanned system control to a future model with fewer users who are supervising autonomous systems (1). However, to achieve this goal, a significant issue that needs to be addressed is determining how users can, and should, supervise these multiple autonomous systems in future environments that are unpredictable, complex, and highly dynamic.     A key technology that can help users supervise these autonomous systems is the development and maturation of machine-based anomaly detection, to detect and characterize significant anomalous behaviors that might emerge within an on-going mission and task context. This technology can help users supervise systems by drawing users limited attention to just the most critical, anomalous events and will be a key enabler to reducing the manpower required to manage autonomous systems by monitoring for anomalous events currently performed by humans.    The focus of this effort is to make the anomaly detection technology relevant and useful to the future human supervisor. The output of this effort should define, structure, and enable efficient information transactions between users and the anomaly detection technology.    Research will be needed to inform the development of system behavior anomaly detection algorithms, including models of system normalcy, deviations from normalcy, and mission context. A central challenge in this domain will be determining what behavior constitutes significant deviations from normal behavior.  Deviations in the face of dynamic missions, and operational contexts is difficult to define, and must be relevant to the human user supervising the system. The model must be tailored to needs of user tasks and decisions, and tuned to optimize trust in automation (2, 3, and 4) and avoid the documented pitfalls of automation (5, 6). A user interface layer and an associated business process will be needed to structure and enable interactions between users and anomaly detection algorithms.    The proposed research will develop techniques to enable the detection of anomalies in the behavior of command and control systems. The desired solution should be applicable to anomaly detection in a variety of command and control domains, such as multi-echelon military command and control, and the management of multiple autonomous vehicles and systems. For example, for the management of multi-UAV systems, the algorithms will detect anomalies to either make corrections within the UAVs mission scope or alert the operator and provide alternative courses of action. Resultant capabilities are expected to produce cost savings through a reduction in manpower, as Autonomous Warfare evolves from multiple operator vehicles with teams of human controllers, to a single operator managing multiple systems.",

Currently deployed systems utilize phased array fed dishes limiting the number of spot beams and gain since earth coverage is accomplished by limiting the number of beamwidths scanned. The solution proposed is a direct illumination phased array that is scaleable for very high gain. Greater than 30 simultaneous beams are supported without substantially increasing the integration complexity of the beamforming network over a single beam phased array. The proposed approach leverages commercially available components but proposes to integrate more devices into a single package for greater function density and board area reduction. During the Phase I program we validated through simulation and test the fundamental building block for this advanced multi-beam phased array for future Ka-band SATCOM payload antennas.  Phase II will build on this work through the design and fabrication of a mutli-beam phased array  BENEFIT:  FIRST RF is proposing a scalable, modular approach to multibeam phased arrays that does not require the cost, size, and complexity of multiple RF manifolds. This leap ahead in phased array technology will be advantageous in all applications for directive array antennas.  Applications that will benefit from multiple beams include high data-rate line of sight communications for mobile military forces (ground, air, and sea) where multiple beams can increase frequency re-use and network capacity and multi-beam radars. Multi-function wideband arrays are also being developed to simultaneously support communications, electronic support, and electronic attack functions.  A lightweight, cost-effective means for providing multiple beams will significantly increase the capability of those systems and increase the flexibility of platform integration.

Applications include axle loads ranging from 8,000 to 23,000 lbs. As applications vary the torque requirements of the brake system also vary. To work with multiple brake systems, multiple friction materials may be required to couple the MMC brake drums. This \"family\"of friction materials needs to emcompass both low and hig coefficients of friction. Currently available friction materials work very well in low to medium coefficient of friction (Mu) applications such as commercial trucks/braking systems. The purpose of the Phase II effort is to further evaluate the potential for a \"newly developed\" friction material that will be adaptable to wide-ranging heavy vehicles both in the Military and Commerical markets when coupled with MMC brake drums.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Nonvolatile memory (NVM) technologies are a critical component of modern satellites.  These NVM chipsets perform tasks ranging from storing mission-critical boot code to large multi-gigabyte mission data recorders.  This requirement for high-density NVM has shifted focus on to commercial CMOS FLASH.  FLASH technologies are capable of high-density devices, compared to resistive or phase-change technologies, and typically scale on pace with Moores Law.  However, charge pumps and other CMOS FEOL components face reliability concerns from TID and SEE (heavy ion) radiation exposure.  As such, there is an inherent need for the introduction of intrinsically rad-hard carbon nanomaterials into commercial CMOS.  Whereas previous wafer-scale processes for carbon nanomaterials have been hindered by device-to-device variation, CVD graphene sheets provide the opportunity to control material quality over a 200-400mm wafer.  Harper Laboratories, LLC, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Novati Technologies, and BAE Systems will manufacture a graphene-based FLASH bit cell that is CMOS-compatible and capable of forming multiple commercial suppliers.  Novati technologies will provide FEOL and BEOL CMOS fabrication capabilities that, combined with Harper IP, will ready a graphene-based FLASH technology for transition to a high-volume CMOS foundry in Phase III.  BAE Systems will provide rad-hard testing to validate the technology.  BENEFIT:  The general anticipated benefit would be a graphene-based FLASH memory technology capable of supporting high-density space memory applications.  A secondary benefit is the development of a CMOS-compatible process for patterning graphene devices with low device-to-device variation across a 200-400mm wafer for which a varying number of commercial applications could arise (graphene on-chip interconnects and transistors).  In particular, the introduction of a CMOS-compatible graphene processes can provide disruptive shifts in the global semiconductor industry, including post-CMOS technologies.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from lowering the barrier to entry for, and simplifying the use of, cloud computing systems via a novel, open source, cloud platform. The proposed advances have the potential to facilitate and expedite innovation and technological progress by a diverse software and global developer community, enabling more people to tackle the important yet increasingly challenging and data-intensive computing problems facing businesses today. The company's technologies address directly the key pain points of this explosively growing platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and cloud-based application development market - namely privacy, lock-in, and control. Unique to the company's approach is compatibility with a leading, proprietary, public cloud PaaS standard (Google App Engine). As such, the company's solutions have significant commercial potential because they are directly applicable to businesses that employ App Engine today (there are currently over 4.5 million active applications), and they lay the groundwork for addressing the larger PaaS market in the long term. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is based on a distributed system that executes and manages web-based and mobile cloud applications (apps) via automation, thereby relieving developers, operations staff, and Information Technology (IT) groups of the burden of doing so. The proposed technology advances address the issue of vendor lock-in - i.e. the use of proprietary technologies, services, and systems that effectively prevent users from switching to alternative vendors. In the cloud space, lock-in is proliferated through the use of (i) proprietary interfaces and tools, (ii) complex pricing models, and (iii) the lack of interoperability across vendors. The proposed technology disrupts lock-in by public cloud vendors by automating software deployment and management across clouds, and by making it easy to move applications and data between vendor offerings and on-premise clusters. In particular, the company's technologies abstract away the complexities of cloud use, and provide monitoring, backup/restoration, and migration of applications and data across clouds at the push of a button. By providing features that are currently unavailable today, the proposed technologies have significant potential for reducing the cost, risk, and learning curve associated with cloud-based development, deployment, disaster recovery, and migration for the next generation of cloud applications.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to simplifying the display backplane manufacturing process and thereby deliver cost savings to a display industry annually losing billions of dollars. The technology being developed as part of this Phase II project has the potential to outperform current thin film transistor (TFT) backplane technologies in key Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) performance areas such as power consumption, image brightness and quality, and color richness. The vision of this project is to redefine the cost, manufacturability and performance of displays through the use of advanced materials and novel electronics. Beyond dramatic economic implications for the LCD industry, the amorphous metal and metal oxide-based technologies developed through this project will enable a technically and economically viable path to roll-to-roll production of flexible glass displays. Enabling a roll-to-roll \"flex\" factory could reintroduce display manufacturing to the United States. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project challenges conventional display industry practice by eliminating semiconductor content and relying on quantum tunneling conduction enabled by innovative materials to control the LCD backplane. The relatively simple tunneling devices developed as part of this project contrast with the industry's focus on increasingly complex semiconductors and manufacturing processes to meet the performance demands of UHD TV while reducing cost. The use of these structurally less complex tunneling devices in the LCD backplane has been enabled through the use of amorphous metal thin-films. The objective of this Phase II project is to develop a prototype display incorporating amorphous metal thin-film based tunneling devices and to evaluate its performance in terms of gray-scale control, power consumption, and maximum refresh rate. It is anticipated that amorphous metal tunneling devices can outperform current TFT technologies in these three areas by enabling 12-bit gray-scale accuracy, increasing the sub-pixel aperture ratio, and eliminating the need for semiconductor materials. The results from this prototype will confirm the technology's core value proposition, amorphous metal thin-film devices improve UHD performance while reducing manufacturing cost and increasing factory capacity.",

This research will provide the basis for the development of PMLC and Shielding Effectiveness (SE) that will counter this problem and provide the necessary growth potential for evolving threats.  During the proposed Second Phase II effort, PMLC-SE technical feasibility demonstrations will be performed to demonstrate that this PMLC-SE technology will increase shielding effectiveness several orders of magnitude while increasing the bandwidth which will allow countering the estimated interference and high power microwave (HPM)/electromagnetic pulse (EMP) threats without transient interference failure or permanent damage.  The intended PMLC-SE operation principle is to establish virtually instantaneous energy exchange between nonlinear PMLC coating material and incident EMI, thus negating these fields.  This effect will be achieved using nonlinear properties of the PMLC-SE constituent material when influenced by EMI.

In phase I we demonstrated that our approach of using SiC solid state switches to increase the switching frequency in order to reduce the size, weight and cost is feasible. The feasibility was demonstrated via analysis and bench top testing. The concept design developed in Phase I showed that the size and weight of a PUC module is one third of the size and weight of current state of the art power processing modules. It also showed that the cost of a SiC based module is about one half the cost of Si Based module. The goal of the Phase II effort is to develop a prototype of a compact Point of Use Conversion (PUC) module for 60 Hz to 400 Hz power converters and a design of a compact PUC module for 60 Hz to 270 VDC power converters for naval shipboard applications with acceptable efficiency, power density and cost while eliminating the need for a separate 400 Hz distribution system.",

        "abstract": "This SBIR extends and refines pulse clustering and de-interleaving software modules (C/C++), as explored in Phase I, to process non-contiguous clusters of pulses received from Electronic Support (ES) acquisition scanning receivers sampling the signal environment (spectrally, spatially, and temporally). It also provides an approach to detect, mitigate and better utilize pulses with multi-path. The result is improved Emitter Identification (EID), with quantitative confidence, and a reduction in candidate emitter lists and ambiguities. Algorithms and software leveraged include: pulse clustering using multiple parameters measured on each pulse, time based de-interleaving, RF Agile clustering, and cluster correlation. The effort addresses a wide variety of challenging emitter signal classes and agilities for which current approaches have shortfalls (RF agility, pulse repetition frequency (PRF) agility, pulse-width agility (PW), combinations of RF/PRF and/or PW agilities, and complex modulations). It also addresses multiple interleaved PRFs of various pulse-widths and modulations from single emitters.  In Phase II the processing model is updated, software developed, and performance quantified. An EDM is developed and demonstrated (TRL6) with AN/SLQ-32 forward- and backward-fit architectures. RAS will work with platform and system integrators and the government to plan and define a Phase III transition effort to achieve TRL7.",

Although waste water is generally processed according to regulations, the effluents from many of the deployed MSDs are not routinely monitored for coliforms; it is simply assumed that the MSD is working properly. Therefore, there is significant risk that unsafe wastewater effluent is being released into river or coastal waters unintentionally. Therefore, to better enable the United States Navy and commercial vessels to meet regulations, rapidly and inexpensively monitor the performance of MSDs and minimize onboard storage space requirements, Luna Innovations is developing the E.coREADi system to detect fecal coliforms in MSD wastewater effluent. Lunas technology will be rapid (less than 5 hours currently, less than 3 hours envisioned by the end of Phase II), sensitive (monitor 1 CFU/100 mL in the specified time), easy-to-use, require no specialized training, allow historical tracking of analysis, and will save significant expenses along with space on Navy vessels.",

It is compatible with cryogenic and room temperature environments and substantially increases performance.  Its baseline array size is 4x that of existing arrays and provides 20x the pixel power of existing arrays.  Its signal data input lines operate at twice the current capability.   The EFPM requires an advanced packaging system providing a unique dewar based housing and electronics set.  The package proposed here provides all interfaces required by the EFPM.  It accommodates benchtop cryogenic testing for better array characterization prior to chamber integration.  The package allows easy integration and removal of the EFPM.  Further, an internal optical window, added directly to the EFPM, protects the emitter pixels from damage and contamination in all environments.  The packages close proximity electronics generate power and clock signals that are distributed to each subarray of the EFPM.  The electronics also provide and distribute the very high currents required by the IR emitter pixels.  The high current capability is managed in an efficient and array-safe manner.  These capabilities and other features offer performance beyond any emitter package previously attempted in the infrared scene projector community.

To assist with further streamlining of mission planning workflows, Sonalysts Phase I SBIR developed a prototype Operations Status Board (OSB) interface and demonstrated use-cases for it. Phase I mapped tactical system data sources to OSB data frame requirements and proposed a framework for continuously monitoring status and automatically alerting operators when status cannot support upcoming mission plan events or other ship evolutions.  In Phase II, Sonalysts proposes to develop an OSB prototype as an Ozone Widget plug-in application to the MPA. Phase II research tasks include status board workflow analysis, Commanding Officer interviews to evolve the content and layout of OSB data frames, implementation of risk assessment considerations as alert algorithms, and development of use-case scenarios.

The system employs one or more composite cylinders and an innovative first-stage regulator coupled with commercial-off-the-shelf scuba parts. With this additional submersion time, divers will have increased operational flexibility resulting in a higher likelihood of mission success. In Phase I, a first prototype regulator was designed, built and tested at up to 10,000 psi. It was interfaced with COTS second-stage components to demonstrate preliminary full system functionality. In Phase II, a rigorous, stage-gated product development process will be followed to reach TRL 7 and initiate certification tests of the new ultra-high-pressure scuba. The plan includes a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and a Critical Design Review (CDR) to document the progress of the system design. A Phase II Option plan is proposed as well, as an additional third year will likely be needed to complete the certification tests required for military use.

The goal of the SeaLandAire team is to develop an inexpensive, simple, yet highly functional expendable sensor pod to cooperatively characterize submarine acoustic and electromagnetic signatures for increased tactical awareness at sea. This Check Range Sensor Pod (CRSP) will be deployed from a submerged submarine to measure and evaluate its detectability relative to an established benchmark (such as the average signature for the submarine class, or a specific operational requirement). The pod must be designed to operate within the limitations of a submarine in a forward operating location.

Most crucial to our work will be the design and development of a full infrastructure, called SERUM (Simulated training Exercises with Robust Unmanned Models) to support advanced AI for the USMCs simulation technology portfolio. This infrastructure will allow for robust, unmanned entities to exist in virtual simulation environments (e.g., VBS2), and will also include the necessary hooks and mechanisms to allow entities to both perceive the world and make actions within it.   Using SERUM, developers and knowledge engineers can develop and integrate behaviors that drive SUDM characters within VBS2, thereby reducing the role player footprint required to support training. We anticipate that this resultant capability will provide significant flexibility for executing virtual and augmented-reality SUDM training by significantly reducing the constant requirement for manned role player support. Because the automated role players are driven by robust AI models and not scripts, training scenarios that use them can be much more dynamic and representative of the trainees operational responsibilities.",

Our Phase I results showed three separate mechanisms for defeating both traditional armor piercing rounds as well as new AP rounds that use tungsten carbide penetrator cores. With these mechanisms now understood, our Phase II work will focus on optimizing the physical system design and evaluating the resulting armor solution in terms of SWaP (size, weight and power) to provide the warfighter with a radically new concept in personal ballistic protection. Not only will this design address current threats, but we will also be looking forward, addressing the newest and most dangerous ballistic threats whose introduction onto the modern battlefield is already looming.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The traditional approach of SDR is to provide flexibility and allow for longer lifecycles by employing FPGAs. These devices have the advantage that they can be reprogrammed to support different waveforms, but have been limited to applications not constrained by size and power as they are power-hungry and not well suited for mobile applications. From a military perspective, another critical disadvantage that results from FPGA based design is that any reconfiguration requires hardware changes. Unlike a simple software change, this requires a costly and time-consuming procurement process to secure the needed technology update. Quantum Dimension has envisioned a true SDR platform based on todays efficient low power processors. Here changes can be made via software-only. With such architecture, a suite of powerful products can be developed to allow the integration of advanced GNSS signal processing with SWaP optimized mobile design. Specifically, we will leverage our existing architecture for GNSS signal processing in this research. Our proposed research effort will encompass multiband GNSS/SoOP integrity algorithm development, optimization and real-time software development. A hardware architecture for a small form factor device that that can utilize these processors and evolve into a device that supports the CGM size is a key outcome.  BENEFIT:  There are multiple commercial applications of this research for GNSS integrity. Beyond the usage for the CGM, most military GPS applications would benefit from the enhancement to GNSS integrity. Additionally, there are multiple civilian applications for GNSS enhancements including the following industries: agriculture, fishing, surveying/mapping, homeland security/first responder etc. There will continue to be an explosion in the growth of these types of applications for the cellular user who would like access to locational or navigational data for everyday requirements.",

Despite the need for strong mine countermeasure (MCM) technologies and capabilities, resources devoted to MCM have been limited in general, and are likely to remain sparse. There is therefore an urgent need to extract more actionable intelligence from the data streams of existing systems. Active sonar is the leading marine mine-hunting technology. The work proposed here aims to extend the capabilities of existing MCM systems using a combination of multi-ping processing and feature based classification to improve weak target detection and reduce the false contact rate. These algorithms will increase search rate and reduce operator review time for existing systems without the need for costly hardware upgrades. The algorithms will be capable of real-time processing on the existing PMA resources. By further exploiting existing sonar data streams this work will increase the increase the effectiveness of these critical Navy assets.",

To accomplish this task, an optically sampled millimeter-wave receive array is sampled via optical pulsed laser gating of the detection array. These signals are then reconstructed using an all optical image processor that is capable of generating real-time image samples. The optically gated sampling of this array is driven in conjunction with an optically generated millimeter-wave source that can be gated and phase with unprecedented levels of flexibility. Under the Phase I effort, key risk areas in the realization of such active/passive imaging arrays have been mitigated and the Phase II efforts proposed herein will culminate in the fabrication of a prototype sensor to be delivered as part of this effort. Developments made under this effort will directly supplement a passive imaging technology that is currently on track for transition to a prime US defense contractor and, as such, has a direct and immediate transition path to US DoD applications.",

Ship motion for the catamaran is significantly different from a monohull such as the DDG 51. Both its peak linear and peak angular accelerations will be higher than those for a monohull in high sea conditions. Because the current turret train and elevating actuators of the railgun are not designed to accommodate the higher accelerations and higher frequency contents in the ship motions of the JHSV, the Navy has desired to mount the railgun on an MCP so that the turret train and elevating actuators can function as designed. Specific design objective of the MCP includes reducing the linear accelerations by at least 50%. The MCP will also reduce the higher frequency contents to make them similar to those of an uncompensated monohull. A technology demonstrator of the MCP will be developed and tested using a fire control radar as its payload aboard the JHSV in the summer of 2016. The developed MCP technology is scalable for much larger payload should a requirement for supplemental railgun stabilization emerge.",

In Phase II we propose to mature the ESKAAP technology including the incorporation of timing-critical operations controlled through precise clocking schemes to ensure that all data collected is appropriately registered to the same temporal sample space. ESKAAPs encapsulated electronics prevent sweat, humidity, debris, and outdoor exposure from affecting the sensor nodes performance. Its redundant microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensor architecture helps to minimize noise and spurious measurements with the aid of Kalman filters, which improve estimation of sensor state and help to reject the noise. The miniature ESKAAP device can be used together with camera-based tracking solutions indoors and can take over when transitioning to outdoor environments.

        "abstract": "A multi-scale Lagrangian-Eulerian algorithm has been developed during Phase I to determine the vorticity confinement term for rotorcraft Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) computations. Similar to the Large Eddy Simulation approach, the present algorithm simulates the large scales in the flow field and models the unresolved small scales like the tip vortices in the computations. The large scales are simulated using the Eulerian approach while the unresolved small scales are modeled using the Lagrangian approach. The effects of the unresolved small scales are included into the governing equations as the Vorticity Confinement terms. As a result, one is able to perform a rotorcraft CFD computation on a regular CFD grid without excessive numerical diffusion of the tip vortices. The feasibility study of the four-bladed model of the UH-60A main rotor with the Black Hawk blades is successful, demonstrating the capability of the proposed algorithm for accurate prediction of both structure and location of the rotor tip vortices. During Phase II, we will further extend the methodology to viscous computations and apply it to simulate the seven-bladed model of the heavy helicopter CH-53E main rotor and the complete CH-53E configuration.",

The ability of tactical logisticians to properly prepare for the effects of terrain and weather offers greater responsiveness and survivability. Technology Service Corp (TSC) and its Colorado State University (CSU) partner propose a flexible terrain and weather impact analysis software tool to support agile operational planning. Our approach includes combining a considerable Army investment in decision support tools with other information technologies into a configurable and packaged impact analysis software engine. The package will include: 1) a user-configurable terrain analysis engine, and 2) a soil moisture/terrain ponding engine that operates at actionable tactical map scales. In Phase 1, TSC and CSU, evaluated the computational efficiency of terrain ponding algorithms, investigated the display of ponding information, and developed an innovative finite state diagram and predictive typing mechanism for Subject Matter Experts to enter geospatial analysis rule sets. In Phase 2, TSC and CSU will enhance the geospatial analysis grammar and rule syntax, and implement a user interface based on predictive typing. TSC and CSU will also investigate robust model calibration approaches and efficient down-scaling of soil moisture data. The prototype terrain ponding software will then be repackaged for wide application.",

Solid State Scientific Corporation has developed a unique ground moving target indication signal processing algorithm which is ideal for SWaP limited systems due to its computational efficiency and its sensitivity to low-observable targets.  During Phase I, data from a fielded radar system was processed with this innovative algorithm. The results of the analysis yielded improved performance and decreased computation time. During Phase II, the algorithm will be optimized and embedded in real-time processing on a fielded radar system.  BENEFIT:  The new radar processing mode will significantly reduce the false alarm rate for size, weight, and power limited systems performing moving target detection in mountainous and urban environments. This advance will improve the ability of unmanned aerial vehicles to perform intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, thus enhancing the situational awareness for soldiers, intelligence officers, and commanders in order to identify threats and make critical decisions. The proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicle drone platforms is expected to continue since they offer a cost effective means for the U.S. DoD to conduct military operations despite reductions in troops on the ground.",

Addressing the need identified by the Army for automated network-parameter assignment to network devices in the tactical environments, DHCP-T will eliminate time-consuming manual configuration of network devices in mission command systems and dynamically assign network parameters based on mission needs. Developed on industry standards, DHCP-T includes an extensible architecture capable of handling a variety of network devices and networking scenarios, including those involving tactical radios and routers. The software-only technology will operate within the existing COTS network infrastructure, providing a cost-effective solution to network initialization and reconfiguration.

It does so by splitting data streams into substreams and assigning these to unused spectral energy segments (bandwidth fragments). SPLITTER sits between the data source and transmitter and is completely communication transparent allowing it to work on C, X, Ku, KA, and Q bands and is not effected by angular polarization variations, frequency, data path length, or energy per bit. The Phase I prototype demonstrated overhead 250 ms, and guarantees accurate data stream reassembly in non-symmetrical and agile data streams. The design does not employ duplication, and the embedded self-referencing linking methodology eliminates the need for reference channels. In Phase II, we will develop an advanced prototype by porting our computationally simple software to FPGA-based hardware that supports data rates from 1bps to 10Gbps.

The configuration and operation of network devices needs to be simple, fast, and reliable. If too much complexity is exposed to equipment operators, they will need expensive training. More likely, they will be under-trained, which increases network mis-configuration and downtime. Standards-based automation tools can greatly reduce the complexity required for network management. The emerging NETCONF standard protocol can be optimized to meet the special needs of tactical networks. The goal of this research is to identify the specific gaps in the NETCONF protocol and architecture that limit its usefulness in tactical networks, explore a limited number of solution paths, and recommend a solution approach to close the gaps. Major improvements in transaction resiliency in slow and/or unstable network conditions can be achieved. Enhanced NETCONF and YANG can be used together to provide a solution platform for scalable configuration management performance in low-bandwidth networks with lots of NETCONF servers to manage. The NETCONF security model and server architecture can be enhanced to allow any component (e.g., identity management, user authentication, role-based access control) to be configurable and independent of the NETCONF server.",

        "abstract": "Communication between soldiers on the battlefield is currently limited to voice and hand signaling. However, the realities of combat, including loud noises and visual obstructions, degrade these communications modalities.  The U.S. Department of Defense is interested in the use of tactile human interfaces as a supplemental communications channel between soldiers.  A field-deployed haptic communicator would consist of a body-worn tactile array capable of wirelessly exchanging information between soldiers via the skin. Mide Technology Corporation has completed a 6-month Phase I effort resulting in a positive feasibility assessment for a haptic communicator that employs piezoelectric actuators.  A complete system prototype consisting of a 12-element tactile array and electronic driver unit was successfully demonstrated.  Prototype performance as a direct-touch device was evaluated through formal testing on human subjects, while its efficacy as a vibro-tactile device was demonstrated qualitatively in the laboratory. The array is sufficiently thin for integration into clothing, the electronic hardware is small and battery-powered, and the system is of reasonable cost.    Mide intends to carry out a Phase II research and development effort that will improve the current state of piezo-tactile technology and test performance of advanced prototypes through human testing in a simulated operational environment.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a new Distal Locking Hemodialysis Catheter System that will be the first to provide clinicians with a tool to manage the most significant complications (infection, thrombosis, and loss of lock solution) associated with chronic hemodialysis catheter use. More than 430,000 Americans currently receive hemodialysis treatments, and this prevalence is expected to grow 3-5% each year. A significant portion of the $29 billion spent annually treating ESRD patients in the U.S. is dedicated to managing complications with vascular access ? many of which are associated with catheters. It typically costs between $2,000 and $40,000 per patient to treat a blood-borne infection, which translates to more than $3 billion each year in the U.S. There is a need for this product to allow physicians to confidently use whatever lock therapy is clinically best on a per-patient basis. The catheter system will enable for the development and FDA approval of new, non-antibiotic antimicrobial agents, which have been unable to gain/maintain approval due to concerns of leakage. The device has the potential to be a market leader in the $3 billion U.S. market for vascular access devices and accessories. The proposed project shall improve and further evaluate a Distal Locking Hemodialysis Catheter System. Over 400,000 Americans undergo hemodialysis annually. Common complications are catheter-related bloodstream infection, thrombosis and thrombotic occlusions, each of which can be fatal. The primary solution to these complications is the use of heparin and antimicrobial lock solutions. However, existing catheters present the possibility of accidental infusion of these highly concentrated solutions into the circulation during the locking procedure or during the locked period between uses of the catheter. These leakages increase the risk of toxicity, and FDA-approved anticoagulants that leak into the systemic circulation can cause minor or major bleeding. The catheter system being developed in this project will significantly decrease complications tied to the loss of lock solutions, such as life-threatening infections, toxicity and bleeding events. The research shall include refinement of the catheter?s design (material selection and mechanical tests); ensuring that manufacture of catheters is consistent; and additional testing in vivo. The project is expected to demonstrate that the catheter system is compatible with lock solutions, shows adequate flow rate, has sufficient mechanical integrity, can be manufactured consistently, and is demonstrated to be biocompatible with an in vivo model.",

The overall objective of the program is to improve the strength and consistency of thick C-C laminates used on large scale, load bearing airframe structures. With strength properties as the focus of improvements, improved properties will give more analytical confidence during the design phase of programs.   In this program, we propose to leverage our past experiences and to develop new class of C-C composites that meet the overall objective of the program.

Operation of these sources is supervised by a miniature power management unit. POC has experimentally analyzed the efficiency of each harvester power source and selected a PV structure as the most efficient source. The Phase I prototype integrated PV modules with LC-based variable lens eyewear and demonstrated the feasibility of POCs approach. In Phase II POC will advance the Phase I prototype composed of PV and thermoelectric generators, and an inductive charger integrated into military certified eyewear. The Phase II prototype will be tested to ballistic/fragmentation standards, and its performance (power capacity, lifetime, and cost) will be experimentally confirmed.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The proposed SBIR Phase II program will develop a thermally enhanced, separable thermal mechanical interface (STMI) that significantly enhances heat transfer by providing a direct thermal path from the high power density components to the heat sink. In the current commercial off-the-shelf STMI multiple interfaces significantly increase the thermal resistance resulting in marginal heat transfer. The need for improved thermal performance is required as power densities of electronics increase. The Phase I program modeled and developed a functional prototype STMI demonstrating the feasibility and potential thermal performance improvements compared to current state-of-the-art solutions. The thermal performance of the STMI was enhanced by: (i) increasing the bulk thermal conductance of current state-of-the-art STMI, (ii) reducing the contact resistance by optimizing the clamp design, and (iii) integrating an innovative card lock mechanism to increase the contact area. A reduction in thermal resistance as compared to a COTS retainer of 57% was experimentally illustrated. In Phase II, ACT will further improve the design of the Phase I prototype to achieve an overall reduction in thermal resistance of 90% as compared to current retainer solutions. This will be accomplished through mechanical and thermal optimization of the STMI component and thorough testing of prototype devices. A design for manufacturability study will also be performed and a technology transition plan will be developed. BENEFIT:At the end of the Phase II program, ACT will have designed, fabricated, and demonstrated a STMI that is thermally and mechanically superior to the current state of the art. This thermally enhanced STMI will increase the conduction cooling capacity of current, as well as future, electronics systems used in the aerospace, defense, and commercial sectors. ACT has a strong grasp of the customer base due to the synergy between this technology and current product offerings. The proposed STMI solution is a direct replacement for current cardlock solutions and is well-suited for space and avionics systems as well as terrestrial applications. The ubiquitous usage of STMIs in military and commercial applications makes the proposed concept a widely versatile solution to a long-lasting problem in electronic system thermal management. ACT will protect any further developments or combinations by patents.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Electronic devices have permeated almost every aspect of modern society. Because of our ever-increasing dependence on the services they provide, we expect future electronic products to have improved reliability and increased performance. Microelectronic devices, an essential component of modern electronic systems, are subject to heat generation as a direct result of electric to thermal conversion. This inevitable by-product of their use results in elevated temperatures which are amplified by non-uniform distribution of power. Power non-uniformity leads to regions with heat fluxes several times higher than the overall average. Hot spots result in localized high-temperature regions which significantly impact microprocessor performance, maximum allowable power of a chip/package, and reliability of the chip and ultimately the assembly and device. For spacecraft thermal engineers and integrators who contend with concentrated high heat fluxes on electronics, the LoadPath Flexible and Enhanced Active Thermal Strap (FEATS) is an advanced thermally conductive path that provides a reliable means of mitigating hot spots while reducing integration overhead. Unlike traditional thermal straps that utilize a purely passive conductive path, our modular approach utilizes solid-state active thermoelectric devices (TEDs) and an advanced thermal transport technology to provide improved performance over existing state-of-the-art technologies.  BENEFIT:  As satellite functionality increases, site-specific cooling will play a crucial role in future payload thermal management. While terrestrial systems can sometimes use fluid based cooling systems, reliability concerns drive future cooling designs towards solid state approaches such as the proposed active thermal strap. The immediate targeted application of the proposed innovation is site-specific cooling of geosynchronous earth orbit military satellites. In addition to electronics hot spot cooling, other spacecraft applications include coupling radiator panels in a deployable radiator.  Beyond satellite uses the proposed active strap is germane to any cooling application where device size, weight, and reliability are important concerns.",

During the Phase I program we utilized UV extinction data, Mie Scattering calculations and cloud radiance models to optimize both the chemistry and particle size for the UV absorbing material. We have demonstrated chaff cloud formation using both a Capco pyrotechnic burster and a PSI designed and built burster that uses compressed CO2 driven dissemination. The Capco pyrotechnic and PSI CO2 gas driven bursters yielded clouds of comparable area during field testing.   During the Phase I Option and Phase II Base efforts, PSI will utilize hydrocode simulation to design and optimize the burst performance of the CO2 driven chaff cartridge. We will build and test a series of prototype cartridges, deliver 3 lots of five cartridges to NSWC/Crane over the course of the base program and deliver 75 devices to NSWC/Crane at the end of the Phase II Base program. At the end of the Phase II Option program, PSI will deliver 240 devices to NSWC/Crane for testing.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  With the objective of developing validated bearing performance software, this proposed development focuses on several technical areas. First, the generalized life models developed in Phase I shall be extended to include elastic property variation with depth for improved modeling of case hardened materials such as M50 NiL. In addition rolling elements shall be modeled as separate elements to better define the composite bearing life. Secondly, analytical formulations and computer code shall be developed for more complex traction models based shear thinning. The models shall be validated against available experimental data, and compared with the current Newtonian and visco-elastic models. Thirdly, lubricant churning and drag models shall be validated against the large amount of experimental data collected in Phase I. The resulting churning and drag coefficients along with the improved traction models shall provide validated bearing heat generation prediction. Finally, parametric evaluations shall be undertaken to develop time-averaging guidance to efficiently integrate the greatly different thermal and mechanical time scales for reliable prediction of bearing element temperatures, which will link life models with thermal interactions. The overall software development shall include a graphical user interface to efficiently process all inputs and outputs for practical bearing design and performance diagnosis.  BENEFIT:  1. Modeling of elastic property variation for case hardened materials, such as M50 NiL, will significantly extend the practical significance of the already proven and validated generalized life models developed in Phase I.   2. Implementation of  shear thinning effects and further development of visco-elastic models to predict lubricant traction in high-speed heavily loaded bearings in turbine engines will have significant practical benefit in improved prediction of both heat generation and bearing stability.  3. Extensive validation and correlation of empirical churning and drag coefficients over the large experimental database, developed in Phase I, will provide greatly improved bearing heat generation capabilities for rolling bearings operating in any arbitrary environment ranging from cryogenic conditions of space applications to high loads and high temperatures of gas turbine engine bearings.   4. Prediction of validated temperature fields by carrying out numerically complex and compute intensive heat transfer analysis will for the first time permit materials property variation with temperature to closely integrate the thermal and life models.  5. In addition to greatly improved performance diagnosis and simulation of current rolling bearing applications, the integrated thermal and life model, will provide viable guidance for materials and design development for applications of the future.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to accelerate the pace of research and development to enable more rapid deployment of technologies into commercial / industrial contexts. In many fields, information is expanding at such an exponential rate that finding relevant results to technical knowledge searches is increasingly difficult. Further, content is expanding so fast that most fields are rapidly forming sub-disciplines, leading to the ?silo-ing? of different knowledge sub-domains, a clear challenge to both academia and industry. We need ever better ways to organize and present information to users. There are disadvantages of the current search engines, mostly relating to excessive similarity in search results. Further, while these engines present information relating to a known search target, they are less effective at presenting unexpected results for information that a user has never heard of but that would be useful. What is therefore needed is an exploration system giving searchers a strong serendipitous element with a maximum likelihood of results from diverse, unexpected, and potentially provocative sources. This will break down silos by providing a rapid, relevant means for knowledge-transfer between different disciplines, fostering interdisciplinary innovation. This system has been designed to provide a means for systematic, automated discovery. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is focused on optimizing and scaling a serendipitous document search system for repurposing technologies by analogy into lateral fields. Both by sub-parsing discrete content into ontologically separable entities, such as capability, characteristic, and composition, and by comparatively assessing certain of these attributes between such entities, the attribute relatedness of these entities can be used to drive their self-assembly into related attribute networks. This approach provides a significant value proposition for drug repurposing, which is the current focus of this project. To scale the pair-wise comparison and network assembly of millions of documents, a map-reduce based text-processing framework will be developed so that massively parallel computations can be carried out in a time- and costefficient manner. A distributed search engine technology will be deployed to enable rapid querying of the emerging document relationship network. A series of machine learning algorithms will then be used to determine potentially hidden structural architectural features within the document relationship network. Machine learning will elucidate the nature of the relationships in drug networks through analyses of inter-node relationships and sub-graph motifs (termed ?innovation motifs?). Documents including U.S. patents and scientific papers will be processed in the system.",

The radiometer section of WAXRR is suitable for measuring total path attenuation under clear or nearly clear sky conditions, while the dual-frequency radar is intended for measuring loss in the presence of stronger clouds and precipitation. The WAXRR system is readily transportable and hosts its own website for remote instrument control and display.  BENEFIT:  Atmospheric loss statistics generated over a two-year time period in Phase III will be used by the Air Force in evaluating the satellite link budget and potential outage rates at potential sites for satellite ground stations.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In order to prevent loss of sensitive data, organizations need to be able to tag data with classification and releasability metadata.  Currently classification is a manual and labor-intensive process, which slows the dissemination of sharable data.  ATC-NY will develop DocMark, a product to automatically determine classification and dissemination metadata and record it in standard formats for review by a human subject matter expert.  DocMark will perform both file marking and portion marking (e.g., frames in a video stream).  It will provide graphical front-ends for configuration and review, and APIs for marking individual data objects or collections of them.  By automatically performing many of the steps that human beings now perform manually, DocMark will dramatically improve the speed at which data can be marked.  BENEFIT:  Many legacy military and intelligence sensors produce data objects that are not marked with the classification and releasability metadata needed for secure sharing.  Marking is required both for newly created data objects and for repositories of unmarked objects.  DocMark will convert marking from a manual process to a semi-automated one, in which the job of the human being is to review and occasionally correct a marking provided by DocMark.  The first target markets of DocMark are the intelligence and military communities, who have an urgent need to disseminate data to the personnel who need it.  The business community is now discovering its own need for classification, which helps prevent data loss by clarifying the difference between highly sensitive objects and those that can be freely disseminated.  DocMark will be available as a commercial product; ATC-NY will also provide training, support, and integration/customization services.",

        "abstract": "Surface vessel detection and classification from airborne platforms relies heavily on radar at operationally useful stand off ranges. Upon detection the radar search waveform may be used to accrue additional information about the surface contact for classification but confidence is likely to be insufficient. Improved classification confidence can be gained by follow-on contact interrogation with high range resolution (HRR) waveforms from different look directions. However, the use of HRR waveforms requires increased processing and possibly increased dwell time depending on the HRR waveform characteristics, and how it is integrated with the search function. If HRR interrogation of the contact cannot provide the desired classification confidence, the radar can employ inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) operation at favorable geometries to further improve classification requiring additional increases in dwell time and processing, and the likely interruption of the search operation. In addition to the stand-alone radar sensor products for classification, EO/IR imagery can be used to augment and possibly improve ISAR imagery, subject to suitable geometry and atmospheric conditions. This process of surface vessel classification consumes increasing radar resources, and traditionally takes place with an operator in the loop commanding the radar modes and using visual tools to perform the classification. The functional integration, capability and sophistication of the operator interface and the associated toolset is an important area of increasing development and critical to the successful use of the suite of sensors available to the operator. NAVSEA has recognized the importance of this interface and associated tool set, and they have funded the development of a powerful capability under the Ocean Surveillance Initiative (OSI). OSI is a capable modular architecture with multiple operator-in-the-loop interfaces implied throughout the architecture, and multiple displays to provide an integrated tactical picture of the maritime environment. However, there is virtually no automatic mode or sensor resource management (RM), and no automatic maritime classification aids (MCA). The objectives of this SBIR effort are the integration of RM and MCA capabilities with OSI as a software demonstration fabric to further evolve the integrated capabilities of RM and MCA for use with the AN/APS-153 and AN/ZPY-4 radars. OSI, as originally developed has been considerably improved and enhanced under the Phase 2 of this effort and will be advanced further as required under this Phase 2.5 effort for transition.",

        "abstract": "ATA Engineering, Inc. proposes a project to extend an existing technology for calibration of strain sensors on-board the F/A-18 fighter aircraft. These sensors, typically installed at production, are used to measure and track the loads experienced during the service life of an individual aircraft and, in doing so, evaluate the current structural health of that aircraft. However, small discrepancies in sensor installation and aircraft build can lead to nontrivial inaccuracy in the predicted remaining fatigue life, requiring either potentially unwarranted conservatism or unnecessary risk in the calculation. ATA's strain sensor calibration system (SSCS) technology provides ground-based calibration of these sensors in lieu of intensive full-scale rig calibration and potentially inaccurate flight-based calibration. ATA seeks to advance the technology to TRL 8, by adapting the system design from a prototype to a production system by incorporating further ruggedization, addressing applicable equipment standards, evaluating use of the system by Navy artisans, assessing implementation across the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft fleets, and incorporating lessons learned in the initial development program.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Braxtons primary goal is to leverage our Phase I prototyping and continue research to evolve the ACE Premier Intelligent Distributed Scheduler (AceIDS) products capability to automatically optimize AFSCN and non-AFSCN (commercial provisioning) resource allocation. We fuse electronically-generated routine and real-time priority access requests with real-time space and ground resource status within a service-oriented, distributed architecture. In preparation for mission adaptation, our Phase II research includes the following objectives: continue to integrate and test our Genetic Algorithm, and to validate our intelligent scheduling engine and its capabilities for multi-objective optimization. With our experience in cross-domain solutions, conduct research to evaluate and implement methods to handle scheduling data of diverse classification levels, whereas the current scheduling system operates at the unclassified level only. Lights-out operations remains an AFSCN goal, therefore, we identify candidate scheduling functions for automation and apply the automation within AceIDS. Using operational and simulated data, we validate the ability for AceIDS to converge on an optimized schedule, while satisfying all objectives, constraints and rule sets. We also continue our research and increase the complexity of scenarios used to validate the ability of the scheduling system to handle ground resource and satellite anomalies, including schedules exceeding AFSCN capacity.BENEFIT:Braxton anticipates several benefits of a scheduling system capable of automatically optimizing satellite ground resources, and fusing electronically-generated routine and real-time priority access requests against multiple objectives simultaneously. First, a reduction in the number of personnel required to schedule AFSCN resources and the corresponding time to train the scheduling team. Second, an improved real-time scheduling interface allows Space Operations Centers (SOCs) to intelligently plan and adjust their missions in significantly less time. Third, improved utilization of AFSCN resources could reduce the required number of antennas driving a potential reduction in AFSCN sustainment costs. Finally, the proposed automated intelligent scheduling system could be applied to optimize resource allocation for multiple military applications to include: military satellite communication transponder scheduling, scheduling orbiting space object tracking on the Space Surveillance Network, and TRANSCOM aircraft and cargo scheduling. A marginal one percent increase in utilization of resources for any of these systems would generate savings in the tens of millions of dollars. Braxton envisions numerous commercial applications for an automated intelligent scheduling system and has already received inquiries from multiple commercial operations. There are several commercial applications similar to the proposed military applications including scheduling antenna resources for commercial space operators and satellite communication transponder scheduling on commercial systems as well as foreign sales within similar markets overseas. By separating the algorithm from the domain knowledge, Braxton has simplified the process to adapt AceIDS to any resource scheduling domain, or any resource optimization problem. For example, hospital resource scheduling is very dynamic, complex and directly impacts patient care and cost. By adapting our domain translator, Braxton will be capable of using the evolutionary algorithm within AceIDS with minimal modification to optimize hospital resource scheduling for multiple, competing objectives such as maximizing patient treatment options while minimizing cost. The hospital resource scheduling market is likely larger than the Military market and we have already had our first inquiry related to adapting AceIDS for this market.",

Aurora will size a high-efficiency motor matched to a novel, optimized propeller design which will ensure efficient operation across the range of EMATT operating speeds. Improvements in motor efficiency and power density will be achieved through novel thermal management techniques.   Bench-level testing will be performed to validate the performance of the motor, propeller, and battery. Risk reduction activities, such as shaft-seal design and testing will be performed.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to significantly reduce the development effort for continuous sensing applications and to enable deploying them in a wide range of battery-constrained sensing devices, including personal mobile devices like smartphones, tablets, and smart watches; wearable health monitoring devices for tracking EKG/EEG and other vital signals; and remote sensing devices for monitoring structural integrity, emission levels, pollutant concentrations, or seismic data. In these applications, continuous sensing triggers context- and location-aware computation or communication in response to sensory stimuli in the device?s environment. Without dramatic innovations in the development of ultra-low power sensory processing, continuous sensing will remain a niche application limited to environments with a stable and plentiful power source. In contrast, this project will demonstrate the viability and potential widespread deployment of continuous sensing in mobile and remote environments. The ability to flexibly deploy continuous sensing for these and other applications has the potential to revolutionize these markets and create entirely new and unforeseen application domains, dramatically altering the extent to which cyber-physical systems can interact with their physical environments. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will develop a complete software and hardware platform for developing and deploying applications that identify and respond to spatial and temporal trigger signatures (events of interests) in continuous sensory data streams. Current sensory processing platforms rely on a power-hungry application processor to analyze continuous sensory streams of real world phenomena to identify trigger signatures, and application development is cumbersome and requires significant domain expertise. The proposed approach offloads continuous sensing and trigger signature detection from the power-hungry application processor to a recognition engine deployed either in firmware on a low-power microcontroller or as a custom hardware accelerator. Furthermore, an integrated software development toolkit will be provided to streamline implementation of sophisticated sensing applications, leading to widespread adoption and future availability of always-on, sensor-based applications. The result of this project will be a software implementation of the novel neurally-inspired algorithm/firmware optimized to be deployed on currently available smartphones, a software toolkit that enables easy and rapid development of always-on sensing applications, and a novel ultra low power, neurally-inspired sensory data preprocessor.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to provide researchers and educators a powerful device to monitor biochemical reactions and physical conditions inside living cells in real time. The probe, which is microscopic in size and powered by incoming light, will be inserted into living cells and will report parameters such as pH and concentration of selected molecules via radio transmissions to a nearby receiver. The transmission will contain both the identity of each cell and the parameter(s) being recorded-hence it will be possible to monitor many cells simultaneously. The ?radio p-Chip? will greatly advance the science of probing cell physiology and create a new area in basic and applied research by providing scientists the ability to study localized functions within living cells. As such, it will be a powerful new tool for advancing knowledge in the fields of mechanisms of disease, drug discovery, and control of biochemical functions, metabolism and other areas. The radio p-Chip and receivers are projected to be low enough in cost that they will also become scientific tools for students to study cell physiology and thus become incorporated into educational curricula. The proposed project will result in a system that will, for the first time in history, allow scientists to monitor conditions in a living cell with a device that will not interfere with normal functions including movement. The system will be based the current p-Chip, the world?s smallest microtransponder that continuously emits a radio signal with an identification number (ID) when illuminated with light. The p-Chip is used today to tag, track and authenticate a wide variety of objects. In order to realize the radio p-Chip, the current version of the chip will be shrunk by a factor of 10, and a variety of sensors will be added to its surface. Once complete, the radio p-Chip will be able to alternately transmit its ID and sensor value continuously to a nearby receiver. The receiver will process the signal for further use by the operator. In parallel, a series of tools will be developed to reliably implant the chips into living cells. In order to accomplish the goals of the project, PharmaSeq will combine leading edge technologies in semiconductor device design and fabrication, advanced sensor technology, digital and analogue electronics, optics and software.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that it will generate new live cell assays for the discovery of new drugs. Roughly half of the drugs sold today target G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the body, so finding better drugs that target these receptors, with fewer side effects, is an important societal goal. Many of the GPCRs, in many different organs of our body, signal through changes in cyclic AMP (cAMP). Indeed cAMP signaling is used in the brain to form memories, it controls the excitability of our hearts, and it plays an important role in diabetes. Our goal is to develop a genetically encoded, fluorescent biosensor that can be used in living human cells to report when a drug is activating a GPCR and causing changes in cAMP. These new biosensors will enable drug discovery teams to search for new drugs in the context of the very living, human cells that they want influence. Being able to screen for drugs in the most relevant biological context will make it possible to find better drugs with fewer side effects faster. The proposed project will generate genetically encoded fluorescent sensors for cAMP signaling in living cells. Traditionally, cAMP signaling has been measured with single, destructive end-point assays. These assays ignore the fact that cAMP signaling is tightly controlled in time and space within a cell: simply measuring total cAMP accumulation over an extended time period can miss important signaling events. Worse, there are many different signaling pathways that can change the levels of cAMP, and single end-point assays cannot distinguish among them. In Phase I, we created a series of green or red fluorescent prototype cAMP biosensors that demonstrated it is feasible to create robust cAMP sensors for use in automated screening platforms. The goal of this proposal is to 1) optimize the brightness and signal produced by our green fluorescent sensor by screening ~2,500 variants for optimal properties, 2) create analogous red fluorescent sensors based on what we have learned from the green sensors, 3) combine these red and green sensors with color complementary diacylglycerol sensors to create multiplex sensors for distinguishing signaling pathways and 4) package the genetically encoded sensors for viral delivery and expression in automated drug screening facilities in a variety of human cell lines.",

        "abstract": "The broader impacts/commercial potential of this project both stem from the need to understand the post-application spatial distribution of nitrate below ground. Simply put, the market pull for fertilizer management tools stems from the amount of nitrate fertilizer applied annually (~59% of all applied fertilizer, 12.29M tons domestically), and the estimated waste rate of >30%. This lost input over 442M acres of US farmland results in huge operational expenditures with little to no correlation to yield or profitability increase, and is responsible for the degradation of waterways and groundwater both in the US and abroad. Increasing our food production capacity by two-fold in the next 30 years while concurrently decreasing the environmental impact of agricultural nonpoint-source pollution has been identified as one of the ?Grand Challenges? facing the chemical and engineering sciences. On a global scale the development of a low-cost and universal probe for soil quality would offer developing areas a novel method for optimizing yields and enabling self-sufficiency in food production, regardless of remoteness or laboratory availability. Additionally, a tool for in situ nitrate measurement will offer an important tool for tracking and mapping organic contaminant plumes during groundwater remediation activities. This Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Phase 2 project will enable wafer-level processing and pilot-scale production of chemically modified field effect transistors (CHEMFETs) containing a novel molecular receptor for nitrate anion. These sensitive components will be incorporated into patent-protected modules that achieve direct, in situ measurement of nitrate in soils without sample preprocessing. Current methods for measuring nitrate anion in soil all require on-site or in-lab preprocessing of the samples due to limitations of the ionophore in competitive media, especially in the presence of common chloride anion. Phase I development showed that by incorporating a molecular receptor with high sensitivity and specificity for nitrate, systems comprised of CHEMFETs containing these molecular receptors yield sensors capable of reporting nitrate concentration at single digit parts per million (ppm) resolutions in the presence of >3 orders of magnitude greater chloride concentrations. Phase 2 will develop a wafer-level deposition process that is compatible with the molecular receptor while avoiding incompatible mask/de-mask processes. Ultimately, this development process will prove the manufacturability of these sensors, and provide the foundation for large-scale distributed beta testing by customers and end-users at the completion of Phase 2.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Research (SBIR) project is to develop and prototype a novel magnetic sensor capable of continuous detection of the small magnetic signals generated by the human heart. The proposed technology enables heart-rate and heart waveform detection without any contact to the skin, contrary to standard electrocardiograph (ECG) based devices that require uncomfortable electrodes, adhesives and chest straps to operate. Furthermore, this technology can be manufactured at low cost and easily miniaturized. The goal of the project is to provide a contactless, unobtrusive and comfortable way to evaluate the heart condition, to be used by sports enthusiasts for fitness heart monitoring, and for heart disease patients that require an accurate, continuous and long-term heart monitoring solution. The proposed technology is designed to be easy integrated with bracelets, smart-watches, or simply placed in a pocket, while constantly measuring the heart function. Its small size and low cost enables the broad use of this technology and easy integration with available wearables. Moreover, knowing that heart disease is the main cause of death in developed nations, we believe our low cost and easy to use device will have positive impact on public health, and on preventive medicine. Better preventive care will consequently help to lower healthcare costs. The proposed project will focus on the development of a novel magnetic sensor for continuous and portable monitoring of the human heart, based on magnetocardiography (MCG). Portable cardiography has been limited to electrocardiography (ECG) sensors for decades. ECG is not suitable for continuous heart-rate monitoring (e.g. for in-home use by elderly patients) since it requires conductive (adhesive) electrodes on the patient?s chest. In contrast, MCG can accurately record the human heartbeat non-invasively and contactless. We propose a novel, chip-scale, highly sensitive magnetometer that can enter and expand the portable ECG heart-monitoring market. The goal of this Phase II project is to continue the optimization of the magnetic sensing technology, and start the development of prototypes and demonstration units that can record the heart signals in real time, providing a new and contactless way to measure heart-rate and heart waveform for medical diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in detecting sepsis early in its course, before end organ damage when it is most treatable. Sepsis, an uncontrolled systemic response to local infection by bacteria or fungi, is responsible for more deaths than prostate cancer, breast cancer, and AIDS combined and is associated with ~$17B in annual U.S. healthcare expenditures. We anticipate that providing emergency department physicians with an earlier diagnostic will profoundly influence clinical outcomes (currently ~40% mortality), costs (>$22,000/case), and the quality of life for survivors and their families. Accumulating evidence connects systemic immune activation ? a key process in sepsis ? with single-cell architectural changes that are mechanically measured by high-speed mechanical phenotyping technology. This technology is well-suited for adult sepsis screening in the emergency department (market size of $1.5B) due to: (1) the functional analysis of cell state the mechanical measurement provides, (2) its high achievable throughput and therefore statistical accuracy, (3) exceedingly short turnaround time, (4) low cost of goods, and (5) the clinically-actionable information it provides. Beyond the adult sepsis screening market, several additional indications include neonatal sepsis, bladder cancer detection, academic research tools, and drug development. The proposed project brings an innovative new class of biomarkers to bear on a problem that has been intractable with current biomarkers. Briefly, the physical properties of cells have been known to be important for decades, but only with the advent of breakthrough microfluidic technology have we been able to measure these parameters in a high-throughput manner capable of diagnosing disease. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II award will be used to develop and validate innovative sample preparation and image analysis modules for a sepsis screening technology as well as performance of proof-of-concept clinical studies that would be a flagship offering in using biomechanical biomarkers to diagnose disease. The technical objectives are designed to improve sensitivity to white blood cells, activated during sepsis, by microfluidic automation of sample preparation and optimization of the microscopic imaging optics. In addition to preparing the test for practical implementation in the emergency department, the test will be validated with a proof-of-concept clinical study, and a clinical scoring system will be devised.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  U.S military logistics fuels such as JP-8 and JP-5 are used across the full range of its IC engines, from those adapted from Avgas to Remove Piloted Aircraft (RPA) applications to heavy duty compression ignition engines.  Yet unlike commercial diesel fuels, these distillate fuels have no cetane specification, and so vary widely in this key measure of ignition delay.  The result can be substantial variation in fuel efficiency, engine operability, mission range, and maintenance requirements, a problem that could be helped by an inexpensive cetane sensor suitable for use on military IC engines.  Using the measured cetane number to modify engine parameters such as ignition timing could notably improve the performance and capability of military IC engines.    PCI has developed and in Phase I demonstrated an ultra-compact simple cetane sensor that directly measures ignition delay and offers to fill this need as well as some others.  In Phase II, we will develop the sensor for military application, further improving miniaturization, performance and stage of development, while delivering a TRL-6 standalone prototype capable of field operation.  BENEFIT:  Anticipated benefits of knowing the cetane number would be information that could be used in an engine controller to improve engine performance, efficiency and life, which in turn could extend RPA range and capability while extending maintenance cycles.  Similar benefits could accrue in larger engines, plus in such engines fuel efficiency gains could also become significant.    Commercial applications include for RPAs and other unmanned vehicles, for small and large compression ignition engines (including for cases with diesel fuel where further cetane information could be helpful even with a specification), and for refineries, where a real time sensor may aid in improving yield.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a cost-effective mechanical ventilator designed specifically to address the need for pandemic stockpiling and surge capacity use. The output of this Phase will be a new ventilator ready for FDA clearance and market entry in 2017. US government planners have described a need for many thousands of additional ventilators in the event of a pandemic influenza or other large-scale medical emergency. Severe influenza often leads to respiratory distress which cannot be dealt with in the absence of mechanical ventilation. Given some time and a mechanical ventilator, the human body can often clear the infection on its own. Without help from the ventilator, patients may die. Manufacturers of current ventilators have attempted to reconfigure their existing offerings to meet the stockpiling demand. Unfortunately none of these devices are able to match the price/performance ratio needed to make stockpiling in large numbers economically feasible. Building upon an innovative platform for mechanical ventilation developed in Phase I, the project intends to develop a ?gold standard? device for pandemic preparedness and emergency use. The proposed project is to develop a novel and much needed medical device ? a mechanical ventilator suitable for pandemic use and emergency stockpiling. If a severe pandemic were to strike the United States, the number of patients in need of mechanical ventilation has been estimated to be over 700,000. Of these, the most severe cases are often in the very old and the very young. There are currently 62,274 ventilators in use in the United States, of which only 23,485 are capable of supporting pediatric patients. Research and development activities will provide opportunities for creating new intellectual property, new technology, and new clinical methods for managing respiratory distress. This research and development project is divided into two Aims. In the first, the company will conduct extensive design research to analyze and understand the clinical need and all product requirements. We will then design, build, and test a series of prototype concepts using sophisticated software modeling, benchtop test platforms including mechanical and electronic lung simulation, and real-world user feedback. In the second Aim the company will address manufacturing and supply chain requirements, integrate design for manufacturing, and build and test a final series of near-production prototypes. These late-stage test procedures will include clinical performance and accuracy in accordance with regulatory standards, electromagnetic interference, and mechanical durability including vibration, noise, and water ingress in preparation for FDA regulatory clearance.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to more effectively treat serious, infectious corneal ulcers by delivering antibiotics directly to the eye?s surface via a novel, biodegradable flexible polymer film. The platform will deliver drug continuously, thereby eliminating the need for hourly eye drops. This product can be administered immediately, at time of injury, allowing health professionals to ensure best treatment and outcomes. The platform solves immediate unmet medical needs in corneal infections, which are a result of improper contact lens wear, as well as increased incidence of eye trauma in the US military. Worldwide, corneal ulcers commonly result in blindness due to difficulty in obtaining and applying medication. These antibiotic-containing films ? which combine polymer science, chemical bioengineering, and drug pharmaceutical formulation innovation ? will bring improved commercially available solutions to vision-threatening conditions far beyond corneal ulcers by employing this novel platform, which provides an effective, easy-to-administer, broad application of sustained, local ophthalmic drug delivery. Broader societal impact lies in the scientific and technical discoveries and innovation, as well as the ability to educate/train others on advances in polymer drug delivery science. The proposed product is based on a proprietary, cross-linked hyaluronic acid (HA) polymer technology, formulated with antibiotics to deliver drug locally and continuously to the ocular surface over multiple days. The well established healing effects of HA, combined with continual-release antibiotics create a novel product that fulfills a significant unmet medical need. Current topical ocular antibiotics require round-the-clock dosing. In addition to being inconvenient, if administered incorrectly, today?s eye drops can lead to continued eye trauma/damage, less-than-optimum outcomes, and considerable waste. The cross-linked, ?tunable? film ? applied by a medical professional ? contains a commercially proven antibiotic that is released over multiple days in precise quantities to the ocular surface with no further patient self-dosing required. In the grant?s Phase I, prototype HA films containing antibiotics were produced, sterilized, and successfully tested in vitro and in vivo for drug release and tolerability. Phase II will include shape development, formulation/drug-release optimization, drug content release confirmation in vivo, and development of a reliable manufacturing process for sterile shelf-stable films. The objective of this Phase II proposal is to continue to optimize and develop sterile antibiotic-releasing cross-linked HA films to be applied locally to the ocular surface to treat sight-threatening corneal ulcers.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to increase the efficiency of identifying, mapping, and remediating water sources contaminated with chlorinated solvents. Chlorinated solvents are used in vast quantities as solvents and degreasing agents, and in the dry cleaning industry. The necessity of monitoring chlorinated solvents in water will continue for many generations due to their widespread occurrence in water sources around the world, their toxicity, and their high stability. A significant need exists and will grow for devices that can continuously measure the concentration of chlorinated organic chemicals in water, and that can do so accurately and inexpensively. Continuous in-situ data production in the field of environmental sensing will greatly increase efficiency in all processes that require a measurement of these chemicals, having a significant impact on the costs and timelines associated with remediation of contaminated sites. This sensor will allow for continuous monitoring of possible contamination sources in the case of a contamination event. Also, it will afford easy profiling of contamination plumes in aquifers. This technology will replace the current laboratory-based measurement protocols, which are not readily adapted for in-situ, on-line, or in-the-field measurements, and cannot produce data continuously. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop an optical enzymatic biosensor for continuous, quantitative monitoring of chlorinated solvent concentrations in water. Chlorinated solvent contamination of groundwater is a widespread ongoing issue around the world. The biosensing concept will be implemented in an optical fiber format, in which optical biosensor tips are linked to a small electro-optical unit. Analyte detection takes place on biosensor tips that are coated with enzymes and fluorescent chemicals. The scope of the research includes two parallel strategies for obtaining highly stable detection enzymes such that long lifetime sensors are achievable, development of a system to deliver required reagents to the sensing tip, development of signal processing algorithms to enable high accuracy measurements in variable environmental conditions and speciation of chlorinated compounds within mixtures, a manufacturing study for high throughput fabrication of the sensors, and field testing of the device at multiple contamination sites. Attainment of these objectives will advance the sensing technology to a robust and readily manufactured system for chlorinated solvent monitoring with low detection limits, high accuracy, and reliability.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Desired tactical requirements for unmanned aerial systems (UASs) exceed current capabilities for performance, reliability, maintainability, cost and supportability. Mission requirements such as extended endurance, increased power for auxiliary/sensor systems, and low altitude, low speed maneuverability are becoming paramount, specifically, in the 10,000 lb class of vehicles. These desired capabilities are not currently optimized with present engine-based propulsion systems. Engine Research Associates, Inc. (ERA) developed and manufactures the Migrating Combustion Chamber (MCC) internal combustion engine, which has the potential to be the next generation quiet, reliable, low weight heavy fuel engines that will meet the desired next generation UAV mission requirements. It operates on a new cycle of operation that offers a very quiet and cool exhaust (without the need for a muffler), high efficiency, low vibration, reduced weight, low manufacturing costs and is simple to service. The MCC engine is scalable from 0.4 HP to well over 1,100 HP. The overall objective of ERA's proposed Phase II program is to develop, fabricate, test and optimize a prototype 550 HP MCC engine system.  The 550 HP MCC engine will consist of two stacked 275 HP combustion block modules that are connected to a common crankshaft.  BENEFIT:  The overall DOD and commercial market need for such an advanced MCC engine is considered to be substantial in supporting the next generation UAS missions and filling various enhanced commercial market needs. The direct benefit of this development would be the next generation of high power-to-weight, quiet, compact, heavy fuel engine for various military markets. Such a system does not presently exist in the military or commercial market place. Key markets include UASs, large automotive and marine engine applications, large back-up power grid systems and various vehicles that desire a smooth, quiet and light weight heavy fuel engine. Variants of this MCC engine configuration would also provide the capability to operate on other fuels such as gasoline, Biofuels, propane and natural gas which will create additional commercial opportunities. There is also a large demand for this type of engine system in other Federal and State Agency applications such as law enforcement, Homeland Security, emergency service, RPA performing intelligence, surveillance, search and rescue, and disaster relief missions. In the international market diesel fuel may be the only fuel available and could cost substantially less than gasoline. There is a great demand for diesel engines in many countries and this will be a growing market in the future.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that more patients will benefit from minimally invasive surgery, in which operations are completed through tiny incisions. In addition to patient benefits of less postsurgical pain, less scarring, and quicker recovery, minimally invasive surgery also reduces healthcare cost due to shorter hospital stays and lower risk of post-operative complications. Minimally invasive surgery impacts all surgical specialties, including gynecology, general, bariatric, urologic, and cardiothoracic. Although more than 1.5 million such procedures are performed in the US each year, wider adoption is limited by the high cost of current surgical robots, training burden of traditional hand-held instruments, and complexity of certain minimally invasive procedures. The technology developed via this project will enable surgeons to perform complex minimally invasive procedures such as hysterectomy with minimal training and at a fraction of the cost of surgical robots. Surgeons will benefit from this ergonomic design that will significantly reduce the incidence of workplace related injury associated with many laparoscopic instruments. This development effort will lead to a versatile platform technology that can impact nearly all kinds of surgeries enabling a wider adoption of minimally invasive surgery. The proposed project aims to complete the design, development, verification, validation, regulatory clearance and commercial launch of a laparoscopic articulating needle driver. This novel low-cost minimally invasive surgery technology provides enhanced dexterity and intuitive control that is seen only in multi-million dollar surgical robots. Minimally invasive surgery is performed through small holes on a patient?s body to minimize trauma, blood loss, and recovery time, and generally involves suturing, knot-tying, and fine dissection, all of which would benefit from enhanced dexterity in the surgical instrument. Currently available low-cost mechanical (non-robotic) instruments either lack dexterity or are counter-intuitive to operate, resulting in surgeon fatigue and significant training requirements. Robotic instruments provide exceptional dexterity and intuitive control, but are costly and beyond the reach of many hospitals and patients. The proposal minimally invasive surgery technology platform overcomes this affordability versus functionality tradeoff via a novel forearm mounted tool configuration and innovations in parallel-kinematic virtual center mechanisms that makes the tool input joint coincident with the surgeon?s wrist. This results in a natural and intuitive motion transmission from the surgeon?s hand to the tool end-effector via a low-cost design that does not require any sensors, actuators, or computer-control.",

        "abstract": "All military and many commercial aviators are required to undergo periodic hypoxia training to recognize the onset of hypoxic conditions and practice recovery skills. Current training is performed with the Reduced Oxygen Breathing Device 2 (ROBD2) which mixes oxygen and nitrogen to produce reduced oxygen concentration air mixtures representative of hypoxic conditions. However, the ROBD2 requires bulky compressed gas cylinders which decrease the mobility of the device and increase usage logistics. Additionally, the device delivers a continuous flow, increasing the risk of air starvation.  Lynntech has developed an electrochemical oxygen separator to directly reduce the oxygen concentration of the air delivered to the hypoxia trainee. The device accurately removes a variable amount of oxygen from the air stream to produce the required oxygen concentrations, simulating hypoxic conditions from sea level to beyond 30,000 feet. The device will deliver pressure-on-demand flow to a flight mask to avoid air starvation, accurately simulating flight systems. A pulse oximeter, flow meter and oxygen sensor will be integrated into the unit to provide biometric monitoring. The mobile system will weigh less than 40 lbs and operate on 110 VAC. The only consumables will be electrical energy, atmospheric air and liquid water.",

Real-world Mission data is identified by analysts, who in the standard course of doing their job, fulfill Request for Information (RFI) Essential Elements of Information (EEI) responses.  Our objectives are to provide the capability to evaluate a wide variety of GMTI exploitation algorithms; provide the capability to either evaluating the performance of a single algorithm or the evaluation of a collection of algorithms to determine the relative performance; provide a variety of event modification tools (such as, move events to other missions, align tracks to roads, and create synthetic events); provide statistical significance and evaluation of the algorithms performance, and use an automated machine learning approach of Relevance Vector Machine to provide a characterization of correct detections, missed detections, and false alerts.    BENEFIT:  TBDAnalysts are skeptical of automated tools that typically are tested on simulated data and lack the real world characteristics of vehicle motion, the interaction between vehicles, and the interaction of the sensor with the environment.  Furthermore, special data collections are costly and are limited in scope and variety.  Testing the algorithms with events contained in real world mission data, as well as performing statistically significant testing, will provide a realistic evaluation of the algorithms true performance under operational conditions.",

The Bus Characterization and Integrity Toolset (BCIT) was a successful series of Phase I, II, and III SBIRS from 2004 onwards. BCIT was the first of its kind to offer dynamic testing of bus operations and physical cabling by combining a 1553 Monitor/Probe with a Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) in a single chassis. Leveraging on the original BCIT, the plan is to expand the functionality using a follow-on Phase II SBIR to realize a new test tool; BCIT2GEN. The BCIT2GEN, a reduced footprint design with a rugged enclosure, will be fabricated that will serve as the new baseline BCIT Test Tool capability which incorporates the capability enhancements (DVI and RF Phase Matched Cable Tests) with reduced Size Weight and Power. A complete existing BCIT functionality is preserved with the advantage of a smaller, lighter test tool that can be carried up gangways and into tight cockpits. The plan is to combine as many test capabilities, into the smallest, ruggedized chassis and evolve a one-box tester that will reside on the AF Table of Allocation and the Armys Mission Equipment List.  BENEFIT:  Additional test capabilities will enable the new test-tool to be a cross-platform, cross-service all-in-one avionics bus tester and will also open up the commercial market, heretofore closed to us.",

Recognizing that new semiconductor physics is unlikely, this proposal describes a new technical path to SWIR photonic oscillators capable of covering contiguous tunable NIR/SWIR bands with narrow linewidth and high power.  This document details the specific technical path that will lead to an operational SWIR oscillator prototype capable of simultaneously generating: tunable SWIR oscillation in the contiguous, extended-SWIR band (1800-2200nm); >3W and >250mW in quasi-CW and strictly CW regimes, respectively; and tunable SWIR emission comparable with the current state-of-the-art NIR devices with 100Hz linewidth and better-than state-of-the-art 30Hz linewidth performance.

The technology developed in this project is aimed at improving the effectiveness of existing therapeutic drugs while facilitating their use by patients in need of treatment, as well as enabling the development of promising new therapeutic agents and regiments that otherwise would not be useful due to the required frequency or complexity of their administration. As an example, if successful this technology will take a drug requiring daily injection (or multiple injections every day) and convert it to a form that requires injection only once-weekly. The anticipated societal impact is increased patient compliance together with an improvement in the effectiveness of the treatment, and thus an overall improvement in patient quality of life. The replacement of existing treatment regimens by more convenient and effective ones is expected to have a substantial commercial impact, as is the enablement of new therapeutics to treat currently untreated or ineffectively-treated conditions. The proposed project is aimed at developing a platform technology based on the controlled release of drugs, particularly peptides and proteins, from an injected depot. Current methods are either incompatible with peptides and proteins due to their mode of manufacture or chemical reactivity, or do not provide the precise control over release and degradation rates that are needed for optimum therapeutic efficiency. The methods proposed will develop a biodegradable hydrogel matrix that is readily injected, that releases a bound drug in a highly controlled manner, and which subsequently dissolves in a highly controlled manner. The hydrogel matrix provides a protein-friendly environment, and use of ?\u00d2-eliminative linkers results in precise control of release and degradation kinetics. Technology development will be focused on the chemistry of drug attachment for generalized peptides/proteins as well as the chemistry for the hydrogel matrix itself, but will be exemplified using specific therapeutic peptides having existing therapeutic applications, such as exenatide and GLP-1 that are of immediate applicability to the treatment of Type 2 diabetes and obesity. Concomitantly, methods for the in vivo analysis of hydrogel behavior will be developed, and tolerability of the hydrogel matrix will be assessed.",

Yeast offers high value production capabilities; however, engineering new strains is very complex and expensive - costing approximately $75-100 million, and requiring 7-10 years for development with current engineering methods. This project will develop a genome engineering technology for yeast that can substantially reduce the cost and time for developing new strains for industrial biotechnology applications. This technology will increase the ability of companies to use yeast to efficiently produce high-quality products from renewable feedstocks, and help grow the overall industrial biotechnology market. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop the ability to perform rapid whole-genome engineering in industrial yeast strains. Current technologies to engineer cells for specific functions (e.g., chemical or fuel production) are inefficient, expensive and extremely time consuming. Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) is a disruptive technology that provides a powerful platform to engineer microorganisms at tremendously reduced cost. Until recently, MAGE was limited to a laboratory strain of E. coli, possessing key genetic features that enable MAGE. Recent advances have allowed us to port MAGE to yeast, and the goal of this project is to increase efficiency of the system and endow existing industrial yeasts with the capacity to undergo MAGE. The goal is to improve MAGE efficiency in yeast by developing a high-throughput system to rapidly create and quantify strain variants for their capacity to undergo the MAGE process itself.

This technology is truly enabling for peptides, a short-lived but potent class of compounds that in their current state are not useful as a treatment for chronic diseases. This technology has significant commercial potential in that it can be broadly applied to numerous emerging and existing drugs in the $140B global biotherapeutics market. Use of our technology will have a significant societal impact by providing more efficient medicines delivered in a more patient-friendly way that could reduce healthcare cost and increase patient compliance. This will significantly impact the health, recovery and quality of life for patients with chronic diseases. Development of this technology will further scientific understanding of drug delivery. This technology will advance the field in that it has significant advantages over the current state-of-the-art, including the ability to allow for less frequent dosing, and by increasing the amount of drug available to the body. These beneficial effects are obtained with one simple modification that does not interfere with the function of the drug. The proposed project is to develop a platform technology that improves the delivery of therapeutics. Peptides and many other types of drugs require frequent dosing because they do not last long in the body and/or require delivery via a needle into the vein because they are not available to the body when given as an injection into the skin. We are developing a way to modify peptides so that they can last longer in the body. As an example, current treatments for a cardiopulmonary rare disease only serve to alleviate symptoms. In this project, a novel peptide that has the potential to be a breakthrough therapeutic for this rare disease will be modified to improve the delivery profile. Current data suggests that the new therapy will be multifaceted and would treat the underlying disease. The objective of this study is to advance the platform technology by exploring other types of modifications, then test these modifications in vitro and in vivo to compare which modifications confer the best delivery profile. A lead compound will be chosen to explore efficacy in animal models, and to examine the immunogenicity and toxicity in rodents to generate critical early safety data. The outcome of SBIR Phase II will be a long-acting peptide therapeutic with strong in vivo preclinical efficacy data for the treatment of a rare disease that has an acceptable safety profile and is ready for further preclinical development.",

Over 600,000 total knee replacement procedures are performed annually, comprising 8% of all Medicare spending. Total hospital charges for this procedure approached $40 billion for 2012. The revision rates for this procedure are significant: 10% at 10 years and 20% at 20 years. Considering the aging population of the United States, the number of total knee replacements and revisions are steadily increasing and the majority of these will be completed under Medicare coverage. The primary cause for revision surgery is loosening of the implants. This innovation aims to develop an anchoring method for implantable orthopedic devices that will reduce the total number of revision procedures performed by creating a more stable interface between the bone and the device, and therefore enhance the scientific and technological understanding of orthopedic implants in general. The proposed project is a device that utilizes structural engineering principles such as load transfer and truss design to improve osteo-incorporation of a total knee replacement implant; such a device is likely to be more efficacious than current designs. Currently available systems suffer from significant revision rates after being implanted only a short while. With younger patients receiving these implants, devices need to be developed that will give the mobility and quality of life required by these patients. The novel web structure fixing the tibial tray of a total knee replacement into the bone should provide improved initial fixation, reduce micro-motion, and eliminate aseptic loosening, all of which contribute towards a reduced revision rate and improved patient comfort. After using the information gained from the Phase I SBIR investigation to inform computational models, the design of this device will be finalized. The device will then be subjected to rigorous mechanical testing to investigate its performance in vivo, while simultaneously serving to satisfy the testing requirements mandatory for FDA approval.",

An approach enabling low acuity care that provides effective symptom control in the patient?s home can reduce Medicare hospice benefit costs by over $500 million annually. More importantly, it would enable patients to remain in their homes, with dignity, during the last precious days of life. Successful execution of this project would also result in a viable medical device business that would create dozens of new jobs supported by multi-million dollar revenues. The proposed project is directed toward developing an optimized version of a rectal medication administration device that can be placed by a layperson and is comfortable for the patient. The rectum is highly vascularized for rapid and effective absorption. The distal 1/3 of the rectum partially bypasses the hepatic portal vein allowing medication to enter the central venous system without a first pass effect through the liver. The rectal route does not have the complication risks or the cost of percutaneous medication administration. A pharmacokinetic study will be performed to compare the systemic absorption of palliative medication administered via micro-enema to the absorption via suppository. Suppositories are an undesirable way to administer ongoing medications rectally due to the discomfort and embarrassment of repeated insertions, as well as the wait time and cost associated with procuring medications in suppository form. Upon successful completion of Phase II work, prototypes of optimized devices will be complete and validated for ease of use in a usability study with layperson volunteers. The aim of the proposed project is to make the rectal route of medication administration practical, and thus set the stage to introduce its benefits to a broad segment of the patient population.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The past decade has seen dramatic improvements in miniature electronic cameras, and materials science enables commensurately small, lightweight flying vehicles. These enhancements have made small UAS viable and delivered increasing value to the military, but weight and power remain key limiters; it is well known that total aircraft size and cost are multiplied by payload mass fraction, so payloads must be reduced. Barriers to continually improving ISR vehicle performance in the immediate future lie in two principal areas: propulsion and electronics. A substantial fraction of the electronics are dedicated to collecting, processing, interpreting, compressing and telemetering the acquired mission data, especially video imagery. Advances in computation, software, and in the science of video data interpretation are all needed. This is a dual-use program which offers a 17-fold increase in video processing performance over existing gimbal processors. The benefits will apply to both military and commercial UAV payloads.  The SVP program aims to deliver significant improvements in the first two aspects: computation and software. This will enhance the effectiveness of scientific development efforts in video processing, and provide better technology with lower Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) to improve the performance of todays systems.  BENEFIT:  The Small Video Processor (SVP) is a dual-use program which offers a 17-fold increase in video processing performance over current chipsets used in gimbal processors. The benefits will apply to both military and commercial UAV EO/IR payloads that perform onboard video processing.  This benefit equates to higher resolution of multiple imagery streams for improved identification, tracking and data fusion when performing DoD missions.  For commercial users, the improved performance equates to greater efficiency, improved confidence in analysis, and new applications that leverage the higher resolution and onboard processing power. Following Phase II prototype development, work will be focused on creating a commercialized Small Video Processing (SVP) module that will essentially update Adsys Controls existing XSight product.  Adsys Controls plans to incorporate the resulting next generation module into both our commercial FalconVision and Arrow EO/IR payloads for improved performance and increased market share. Our commercial and government contracts will be fully leveraged to bring this technology to a marketable configuration.",

Tele-operation technology is used to maneuver the UGV, and is also used by the vehicles payloads to perform their mission function. Radio functions, video format, resolution and compression routines are utilized to provide the operator streaming video for tele-operation. The challenge of dynamically and efficiently integrating the data related to building configuration, building materials, foliage and vegetation data into simulation framework has been identified.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Military sensor systems making use of the Common Data Link (CDL) are generating more information, thus taxing the capabilities of available spectrum for the relay of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) data and information. We will define new network interface models, control use-cases, and link commands using behavioral VHDL.  We will also model required performance of the RF output waveform to generate a baseline for quality assurance.  Interface models will provide the capability to perform what-if analysis in a graphical environment on parametric models impacting latency and bandwidth. These models will support multiple data rates for Bandwidth Efficient (BE) rates, multiple streaming channels, and segregated control and data channels. With the control and data channel models developed, a comprehensive tool set will be created that provides the simulation, analysis, and documentation. The development tool for creating, managing, and executing the test benches will also be developed and refined thus providing the capability to completely simulate the BE-CDL specification. The resulting capabilities will result in more efficient and effective methods for contractors to develop and validate hardware implementations of the BE-CDL specification and allow the Air Force to continue to expand and improve its global sensor network with confidence.  BENEFIT:  The need for delivering a comprehensive and accurate simulation model of the data handling and control of the CDL is critical to the success of the Air Force.  Any solutions that can aid in this goal will offer tremendous benefit to the Air Forces objectives.  Models will enable rapid simulations and analysis of the trade-offs among multiple parameters of CDL component interfaces and different protocol configuration options by providing controllability and observe-ability of the key parameters and status of the interfaces. Using the BOBBIN product, the Air Force can continue to improve their ability to accurately simulate and predict the bandwidth, data rates, and latencies when increasing the complexity and size of their sensor constellations and utilizing different vendors hardware. The results of our successful technology transition will also be usable for designers and integrators of CDL assets. The developed models will allow for a greater degree of confidence in specification and design of CDL-based interfaces. By combining an intuitive visual modeling framework with reusable and customizable models, our solution will improve the Air Forces ability to capture information about its CDL specifications, sensors, and platforms and transform this information into useful knowledge.         The BOBBIN product will be of value wherever there is a need to test and validate BE-CDL hardware, sensors, or other interfacing resources for compliance with the BE-CDL specification. We intend to focus our Phase II commercialization efforts on Air Force ISR applications.  Our first targets after the Air Force will be to introduce the BOBBIN product to the rest of the DoD community, as well as to contractors that manufacture BE-CDL compliant equipment.  BOBBIN will have significant industry applicability in the test, simulation, and validation of BD-CDL compliant hardware and software, and we will pursue licensing opportunities in these markets upon product maturity.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Data integrity is essential for accurate and deterministic decision making in diverse military and commercial digital systems, and the most common cause of electronic data corruption for many of these systems is electromagnetic interference (EMI). Unexpected and unmitigated EMI, especially from high power systems (HPEMI), can cause deleterious effects ranging from subtly incorrect calculations to catastrophic systems failures. To reduce overall design cost due to re-spins, design tools are required to support HPEMI immunity studies at the initial stages of the design. We propose to develop a cable and printed circuit board (PCB) design and routing tool coupled to multi-transmission line (MTL), circuit, and EMI field simulation tools to model the effect of HPEMI on system designs. Our tool will enable end-to-end analysis within a graphical computer-aided design (CAD) tool, and will provide rapid, interactive feedback about routing choices during the design process. Coupling fast simulation and analysis tools with an interactive graphical interface will reduce the time spent in design while increasing the overall accuracy of the resulting model.  BENEFIT:  This project will develop a fast high power electromagnetic interference (HPEMI) multi-transmission line (MTL) simulator with a seamless interface to the Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE). The system will include a computer-aided design (CAD) interface capable of editing the designs mechanical properties and displaying simulation results in near real time. This tool will benefit the military by enabling accurate prediction of electromagnetic interference (EMI) and HPEMI effects on foreign or domestic electronics systems, and will benefit military as well as civilian system designers by guiding them to appropriate levels of shielding and protection to avoid undesired EMI/HPEMI effects. Having an interactive design tool to predict effects in near real time will shorten development times and reduce the costs of the resulting systems.",

Precision efforts, minimal collateral damage, rapid response, and nearly unlimited ammunition are compelling advantages to laser weapon systems.  Among the primary challenges to development and deployment is beam control, identified in the 2007 report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on Directed Energy Weapons and the more recent 2010 US Air Force Chief Scientists Report on Technology Horizons as a necessary focus for science and technology research.      Based on the success of our Phase I proof-of-concept study, we propose to develop and test a software application for aimpoint maintenance for advanced laser weapons.  We will perform extensive simulation studies and collaborate with AFRL to integrate the software into hardware systems of interest.  BENEFIT:  Potential commercial applications will primarily be of a military nature, as the effort proposed herein is heavily focused toward advancing strategic and tactical laser system capabilities.

The system that arrests the aircraft, the Arresting Gear system, utilizes slippers or bearing materials between moving components. A major shortcoming of the current slipper material is its swelling when exposed to ethylene glycol, which causes clearance issues in the operating equipment, resulting in replacement outside of scheduled maintenance, which is undesirable due to the labor-intensive nature of some of these replacements. In Phase I, Composite Technology Development (CTD) demonstrated new composite bearing materials comprised of either glass or carbon reinforcing fibers and a benzoxazine resin chemistry with nano-scale additives incorporated to improve the wear resistance and friction characteristics of the resulting composites. These materials showed significantly reduced swelling in ethylene glycol and excellent wear resistance compared to the current slipper material. During the Phase II program, CTD will optimize the Phase I materials for performance and cost, will develop cost-effective methods of slipper manufacturing, will develop methods for qualifying new slipper materials for arresting gear applications, and will develop a preliminary performance specification that can be used to qualify future slipper materials for the Navy.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The annual cost of corrosion for Air Force aircraft and missiles is estimated to $5.4 billion with corrosion accounting for 32.2% of the maintenance budget.  Besides these costs, corrosion also adversely impacts safety and readiness.  In large part, corrosion control is achieved through materials selection based on accelerated laboratory corrosion and service environment testing.  Although advances have been made in the development of more representative accelerated corrosion test cycles, similar advancements in test coupon design and instrumentation have not been realized.  To address this need, Luna is developing a reliable measurement system that improves the corrosion evaluation of aircraft materials to achieve design life requirements.  The measurement system will be useful for materials development, materials substitution testing, and establishing performance requirements during acquisition.  The system will include a module for testing corrosion fatigue susceptibility of alloys with protective coatings.  The measurement system will support risk mitigation associated with new coating introductions.   Within the aircraft structural integrity program (ASIP), this measurement system would support technology and system development, demonstration, and be useful for surveying usage environments.  BENEFIT:  The initial CorRES system application is Air Force coatings research, test, and evaluation.  The most immediate market opportunities will be within the coating research and qualification communities.  Market focus will be organizations that develop and specify civil and defense aerospace coatings.  Potential customers include: PPG (Deft), Akzo Nobel, Hentzen, Boeing, Air Bus, Lockheed Martin, Sikorsky, Bell Helicopter, ARL, NAVAIR, and AMCOM.  Beyond specific dual use aerospace markets, other more general markets for the CorRES system would include corrosion cabinet manufacturers and service test laboratories.  The measurement system is a wireless sensor network and data acquisition system.  It was projected that more than half a billion nodes shipped for wireless sensor applications in 2010 for an end-user market worth of at least $7 billion, according to ON World.  The wireless sensor market is fragmented and relatively small, but poised for rapid growth, with annual growth rates of 40 or 50% expected.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a technology to accurately measure small RNA expression. This is an enabling life science research tool. Small RNAs are ubiquitous gene regulators found in the body. Products of the same microRNA gene that vary in length by one or two nucleotides may be involved in a host of diseases, including cancer. The value for developing a method to measure the true profile of microRNAs in a sample would be immense for the research community studying transcriptional regulation, and would open the doors to those interested in drug development and diagnostics. The goal of this proposal is to develop a library preparation kit for non-biased small RNA libraries for Next Generation sequencing. These kits will increase the quality and rate at which global microRNA profiles may be determined for research and clinical applications. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop next generation sequencing technology for small RNA more quantitative and less biased. High throughput sequencing has transformed the landscape of genomic research with its ability to produce gigabases of data in a single run. This has enabled researchers to perform genome wide and high depth sequencing studies that would normally not be possible. Despite this capacity, amplification artifacts introduced during polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays increase the chance of duplicate reads and uneven distribution of read coverage. Accurate profiling using deep sequencing also has been undermined by biases with over- or under-represented microRNAs. The presence of these biases significantly limits the incredible sensitivity and accuracy made possible by next generation sequencing. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel bias-reducing technology for making small RNA libraries. The proposed kits and protocols will increase the rate at which global microRNA profiles can be determined, and between-sample and within-sample differences (as well as newly discovered small RNAs) can be subsequently validated. This product will result in a major shift in the way small RNA sequencing is performed, and will pave the way for the discovery of new small RNAs.",

This objective includes developing a 463L pallet solution with fewer environmental consequences and which is cost effective to produce and reduces total ownership cost through longer life and reduced maintenance and disposal, to be used by the Air Force and other Department of Defense DoD organizations.    BENEFIT:  Develop a new 463L composite pallet which is field repairable and lighter in weight.",

        "abstract": "The CommLift Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is an alternate and novel approach to providing long range, over-the-horizon, communications for surface vessels; it uses a tethered electric UAV to carry a radio payload to suitable altitude, rather than an aerostat. The tether provides power from an unmanned surface vessel (USV) to the UAV and also bi-directional communications between them. Since electric power is supplied from the surface, the UAV endurance is unlimited. The essential innovations are (1) an autonomous UAV to be tethered to takeoff, follow above, and land on, a USV, (2) to provide UAV power and communications over the tether, and (3) paired UAV autopilots (one at the surface and one on the UAV) to allow the UAV to follow USV movements and to control UAV takeoff and landing. The Phase I performance metrics are demonstration of suitable power and communications over a >525 ft. tether, tethered takeoff and landing of a multirotor UAV from a 30 knot moving vehicle and control of a high voltage brushless DC motor's speed and design of tether control system and surface based support package.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The current AF aircraft maintenance system has a high operational cost of unplanned, premature, and missed maintenance.  The&quot;red&quot;operational anomaly detection thresholds are not adaptive to individual aircraft history nor to changes in operations causing&quot;ringers&quot;and missed detections. Abnormal correlations in aircraft health sensor data that can be precursors to catastrophic failures are not automatically looked for. The proposed Data-Driven Condition-Based Predictive Maintenance (DCPM) system will be developed based upon a proven data-driven abnormality detection system, ANOM, for spacecraft that is operational at Schriever AFB and at TRL 6 at National site. This system learns normal and detects unknown-signature abnormal behavior for thousands of variables in real-time.  ANOM provides context for abnormal clusters with characterizations to which recommended responses can be tagged for historically detected abnormal behaviors.  ANOM is affordably adaptive via retraining for changing operational states with automated cluster specified new training sets over time. The abnormality detections from each source will be fused for each aircraft and across aircraft using our Bayesian Fusion Node (BFN) proven software.  The BFN will also be used to detect and track relationships amongst these events across the fleet. Our Performance Assessment and Process Management software will evaluate DCPM performance.  BENEFIT:  The key competitive advantages of the technology in this proposal are affordability, effectiveness and rapid deployment all made possible via a data-driven approach.   DF &amp; NN&quot;s Data-Driven Condition-Based Predictive Maintenance (DCPM) technology leverages pattern learning software to automatically discover, detect and characterize unknown abnormal signatures.  The technology is extendible and reusable because it is based on the generic Dual Node Network (DNN) DF &amp; RM technical architecture. The data-driven core of the DF &amp; NN ANOM software enables it to be easily applied to detect, recognize, and track abnormalities in any commercial or government system.  Operational prototypes of this capability are already operating on-line at to 2 satellite operations (SOPS) sites and these ANOM tools have been applied off-line to over 100 varied and massive data sets for over 200 combined years of data. DF &amp; NN has a pending patent on the ANOM technology and plans to commercialize ANOM to support many DOD and commercial systems in collaboration with our Commercialization Pilot Program team member Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMC) for Space Operations Squadrons (SOPS), cyber, Remotely Piloted Aircraft, and other LMC products.",

        "abstract": "Composite materials, widely used in aircraft, reduce manufacturing cost, improve structural performance, and boost fuel efficiency. However, composites are susceptible to hidden heat damage, which may occur from fire, exhaust impingement, overheating, or during repairs. The earliest heat damage stage, referred to as incipient heat damage, may reduce upper use temperature, cause matrix mass loss, and reduce mechanical flexural strength. We propose an innovative approach that detects this very early matrix damage via changes in the mechanical flexural response of a structure. We use a small lightweight optical imaging detector that can rapidly monitor large structures and identify regions exhibiting incipient heat damage. We combine small mechanical excitation of the structure under test with a lightweight camera that images the surface resonant frequency, directly probing the local flexural strength of the composite material. This technique, called the Fast Imaging Non-Destructive Inspection Technique (FINDIT), can directly and nondestructively test the mechanical flexural properties of composite material. Flexural damage has been shown to provide a first warning of incipient heat damage before visual manifestation. FINDIT quantitatively measures the associated tilt-tip surface changes, and may be automated, removing subjective judgment factors, rendering the approach fully functional under adverse circumstances.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The DOD needs a multiple pulse X-ray imaging system with high frame rate capability to measure the motion of the target ballast and characterize the debris cloud generated during hypervelocity impacts. Such imaging capability is of vital importance for designing new long-range missile systems with improved accuracy, for assessing damage to the target upon impact to determine its lethality, and to design armors/armored vehicles to protect military personnel and material from enemy attacks.  The proposed effort will transition the ultra-fast X-ray imaging technology, developed by Radiation Monitoring Devices (RMD), Inc., under Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR), into greater capability for the warfighter by enabling dynamic imaging of denser hypervelocity objects and impact analysis. The key component of such a system is a fast scintillation screen with enhanced absorption of high energy X-rays, and high spatial resolution.  We will focus on developing and delivering scintillator screens that can perform at high X-ray energies desired for testing.  The scintillator screens will be integrated into high performance imaging detectors that will permit imaging at the desired high frame rates. This research will be carried out under the SBIR Technology Transition Plan (STTP/CRP) over a period of two years.  BENEFIT:  In addition to the aforementioned DOD application, the proposed scintillation imaging system would find widespread use in applications where high resolution, fast readout x-ray detectors are used.  These include numerous other defense applications, medical functional imaging, structural biology, microtomography of teeth and bones, polymer processing, x-ray astronomy, nondestructive testing, and basic physics research.  Ultrahigh frame rate detectors are also of vital importance for dynamic compression studies which are of critical importance for developing advanced materials to effectively withstand shockwaves.

Unscheduled maintenance, due to issues uncovered midway into the maintenance work, introduces the most delays that negatively impact HVM turnaround time.  To increase the predictability of the actual maintenance required, we propose to develop an Automated Maintenance Prediction System (AMP) that leverages our core analysis algorithms designed in Phase I and our patented Automated System Test and Repair System (A-STAR) developed for the Navy to achieve similar fault prognostic objectives.    At the end of Phase II, the Sponsor will possess the first implementation of the Automated Maintenance Prediction System (AMP) that will enable automated root-cause analysis and risk assessment of repair actions.  We plan to mature and evolve the AMP functionality to suit the target aircraft application, beginning with basic functionality and adding more sophisticated root-cause analysis and risk-based maintenance capabilities with each development milestones.    BENEFIT:  The major goal of this project is to develop an Automated Maintenance Prediction System (AMP) to provide enhanced root-cause diagnostics and optimized, risk-based maintenance assessments.  We will extend the work performed during the Phase I to create a fully functional AMP system that accelerates the determination and execution of flight line maintenance actions.  The prototype delivered to the Sponsor at the conclusion of this Phase II will show we have developed effective techniques for an enhanced diagnostics tool approach that has the capacity to assess the most effective maintenance path considering history, likelihood of success, and time constraints to determine the optimal corrective actions.  This will result in the development of a flexible toolset of algorithms for enabling just-in-time aircraft maintenance.    Some of the main tasks include interfacing with the on-board computing and diagnostics systems data and the continued development of maintenance prediction algorithms.  Additionally, Cybernet intends to leverage its A-STAR technology to design and develop the fault detection and maintenance capabilities of the AMP system.  This will also aid in the process of generating a more multi-purpose prediction system for fault detection, isolation, and repair.  The Phase II effort will focus on the development of AMP system capabilities and an integration plan for the Air Force Logistics Center at Robins.  Phase II will also provide the opportunity to present the technology to commercial users, such as GE and other aircraft systems manufacturers.

Besides these costs, corrosion also adversely impacts safety and readiness.  In large part, corrosion control is achieved through materials selection based on accelerated laboratory corrosion and service environment testing.  Although advances have been made in the development of more representative accelerated corrosion test cycles, similar advancements in test coupon design and instrumentation have not been realized.  To address this need, Luna is developing a reliable measurement system that improves the corrosion evaluation of aircraft materials to achieve design life requirements.  The measurement system will be useful for materials development, materials substitution testing, and establishing performance requirements during acquisition.  The system will include a module for testing corrosion fatigue susceptibility of alloys with protective coatings.  The measurement system will support risk mitigation associated with new coating introductions.   Within the aircraft structural integrity program (ASIP), this measurment system would support technology and system development, demonstration, and be useful for surveying usage environments.  BENEFIT:  The coating and corrosion evaluation system has the potential to: support high throughput characterization for coating development, improve coating qualification processes, support accelerated test method development, validate usage environment assumptions, and improve monitoring systems for individual asset tracking and fleet management.

Multi-technique extraction and fusion algorithms are leveraged from the AFRL Multi-Technique SEI Test-bed (FPGAs and C/C++) and now in transition to Navy EW programs.  New and existing concepts were investigated in Phase-I and performance assessed for resolving same-type emitter ambiguities operating at the same RF and Mode. Modern agile-agile, narrow, long pulse, and intentionally modulated signals are addressed.  Automatic feature extraction and match algorithm selection, tracking and updates minimize operator interaction and provide high confidence reports.     A Phase-II demonstration concept for testing and characterizing the performance was developed after reviewing and assessing the feasibility of implementing SEI/SET technology into legacy EW systems.  An approach was formulated with emphasis on a particular EW system of interest.  In Phase-II the COMOPSEI prototype is developed, integrated with a candidate EW system, and demonstrated in laboratory environments using real-world emitter data to show increased identification performance.  After Phase-II, RAS will work with EW system primes and the government to transition and demonstrate the technology in the operational EW system of interest.    BENEFIT:  The key benefit provided to the government by this SBIR is improved situational awareness and thus enhanced survivability by addressing several pulse-processing deficiencies identified in current operational Electronic Warfare (EW) systems. Examples include real-time ambiguity resolution between same-type emitters at the same RF, PW and PRI; enhanced threat warning and self-protection against radar-guided airborne and ground-based threats; reduction in lost and fragmented tracks; proper correlation of RF agile emitters; and proper assessment of raid count thereby providing more efficient allocation of resources to counter the threat. Improved Emitter ID is obtained with the proposed approach as automatic intentional modulation on pulse (IMOP) measurements, shown on other programs to reduce emitter ID ambiguity, is provided.  Other benefits include tracking platforms suspected of carrying contraband or WMD, enhanced spectrum knowledge and management, identifying particular platforms (air and surface) from day-to-day and enhancing real-time EOB update accuracy, and in supporting kill removal and damage assessment,    Initial military commercialization applications are sustained operational EW airborne platforms; for example the F-15C, B-1 or B-2 (and perhaps the AF B-2 Defense Management System Upgrade). Other possibilities include the NAVY F-18E/F digital receiver upgrade ALR-67(v3) and NAVY surface and sub-surface applications.

Another possible application is the NAVSEA NSWC Surface EW Improvement Program (SEWIP) Block II. Out technology is readily inserted into the COTS NDI, FPGA based digital receiver.  Algorithms from this SBIR would have direct application in future upgrades.  RAS will explore, with the COTR, applications to these programs as well as others recommended by the government to transition Phase II technology into a Phase III.    The concepts to be demonstrated have numerous military and commercial applications. They can be employed in a wide variety of tactical and strategic operational missions encompassing Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Support (ES), Radar Warning Receivers (RWR), and Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) systems where multiple same-type signals must be rapidly intercepted, characterized and countered.     Potential applications in the private sector include passive tracking of RF devices such as cell phones and wireless waveform characterization, RF identification verification, and spectrum assessment and (re)allocation. These will be explored in more detail during the Phase II program under RAS business development funding.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The proliferation of digital hardware and high performance amplifiers has resulted in a high degree of signal similarity among radar systems. As a consequence, modern electronic warfare systems are facing a signal characterization and specific emitter identification problem using traditional methods. Under Phase I, ISL identified a novel multidimensional feature that is generally independent of the emitter waveform parameters. This new feature has allowed us to develop a novel solution to the problem of jamming advanced radar emitters. The overall objective of the Phase II program is the insertion of new electronic warfare (EW) techniques based on the new multidimensional feature into existing and planned EW systems including the ALQ-161.  BENEFIT:  The proposed SBIR program will provide the Air Force with the capability to identify and engage emerging advanced digital radar systems in complex RF environments.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  With the roll of UAVs becoming more complex, and their use more widespread, tactical requirements for performance, reliability, maintainability, supportability, and most recently low cost, have created the need for an advanced cycle propulsion system. Such an engine, must address the conflicting requirements, of large amounts of electrical power generation, while producing substantial increases in power-on-demand at both low and high altitudes.  Addressing these requirements, Spytek was able to build and initially test its FI304 500lbt, advanced cycle, turbo-fan engine, with 2 ITBs in Phase 1.  Leveraging substantial IRAD assets, Spytek was able to complete the integration of a 2 ITB engine, complete with variable turbines and flow control, in the scope of the Phase 1.  Cycle analysis indicates a 600% increase in electrical power generation capability and a 25% in thrust available to altitudes of 60000ft, over similar non-ITB engines.   In Phase 2, Spytek will continue characterization tests of the FI304, implement modifications to match cycle predictions and lower SFC, while repackaging fuel, oil, and systems control elements to make the engine flight demonstration ready in Phase 3.  Electrical power generation equipment including the generator will be evaluated and run on the engine in Phase 2.    BENEFIT:  Benefits of the FI304 Dual ITB engine include a 600% increase in electrical power generation, and a 25% thrust increase over comparable engines, all as power on demand. Thrust and electrical power generation are not relative and can be produced to a large degree independently.  Performance increases include operations up to 60000ft, due to lower fan lapse, and a high degree of electrical power generation capability available at altitude.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The biggest demand on a military receiver has been from the time required to search and acquire for the military signals when an accurate internal time reference is not available. Prior research by NAVSYS into network assisted GPS approaches used the JTRS network itself to transfer time from another GPS receiver to reduce the initial time uncertainty and speed the acquisition time. This required at least one receiver on the network to have already acquired and tracked the GPS signals. Under this SBIR, we shall develop and implement methods to reduce the direct P(Y) acquisition time under situations where no unit on the network has yet acquired a GPS solution.    The cooperative signal acquisition algorithms shall use shared data between network participants to speed direct P(Y) and direct M-code acquisition by distributing the search space between network participants reducing TTFF and allowing for longer correlation times for weak signal and high interference environments.  This will be demonstrated under this effort using Software Defined Radio Testbeds to process the received GPS signals and also provide intra-network timing observations for the cooperative GPS signal processing.  We shall use a combination of simulated and live satellite signals to show the improved performance.  BENEFIT:  The NAVSYS cooperative networked GPS signal acquisition technologies will provide reduced TTFF (Time to First Fix) initialization among a networked user groups as well as improved ability to acquire in weak signal or high interference environments. Military applications will be pursued in all major DoD branches by tailoring the implementation of this technology to their specific needs for assured PNT in their networked operations.",

Florida Turbine Technologies, Inc. (FTT) is developing the Advanced Recirculating Total Impingement Cooling (ARTIC) technology to enable a revolutionary leap in gas turbine efficiency. During Phase I, the ARTIC cooling technology was demonstrated as feasible at small scales. The primary Phase II objective is to test the ARTIC technology in a subsystem test rig. The test rig will utilize hardware and facilities from the Core Demonstrator Engine developed by FTT under joint Air Force SBIR and FTT Internal Research and Development funding. The ARTIC vane will be tested in a relevant environment, using the original Core Demonstrator Engines test conditions as well as elevated temperatures to demonstrate the cooling and performance benefits of the ARTIC vane; successful testing will advance the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) to 6.

This project addresses this problem by offering a paper-like interface to create machinable drawings while retaining the creative and cognitive advantages of freehand sketching. Moreover, the software's innovative interaction paradigm has broad applications in every domain where people sketch or make diagrams, and will enable people to design and prototype more productively. The project goal is to provide an effective, intuitive design application for tablet computers to make it easier for students to engage in engineering design as they invent and build physical constructions. The innovation combines sketch recognition (that enables freehand input) with geometric constraint management (that enables the software to maintain as much precision as the user needs).

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW) promises low-cost communications for dismounted forces who have a critical need for secure, anti-jam (AJ), and low-probability-of-intercept (LPI) satellite communications (SATCOM).  To allow dismounted forces to leverage the benefit of PTW requires very low size, weight, and power (SWaP) PTW modems capable of operating at up to 256 kbps.  Unfortunately, current protected SATCOM modems use power hungry Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).  As a result, modems are heavy and consume several Watts.    ORB Analytics proposes the use of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) for modem processing to provide an order of magnitude reduction in modem weight and power.  ORB Analytics Phase I work yielded a PTW modem design with low implementation loss.  The company quantified the complexity of this design and identified a low-cost path to an ASIC that can achieve the 1W PTW modem power consumption target.  In collaboration with Raytheon, we propose to leverage this Phase I foundation in Phase II to develop and demonstrate a PTW modem prototype.  This work will then well-position ORB Analytics with Phase III funding to migrate the design to an ASIC and integrate the ASIC into protected SATCOM terminals.    BENEFIT:  The AEHF constellation has cost more than expected and the program has incurred significant schedule delays.  This coupled with the declining defense budget and limited AEHF capacity makes it highly likely that the DoD will elect to offload most tactical communications to a lower-cost, next generation, protected SATCOM system making use of PTW.   The proposed research promises PTW terminal designs with low SWaP as needed in many applications such as manpack terminals.  The developed technology also has application in DVB-S2 and wireless backhaul designs.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) represents the nation&quot;s largest aerospace ground test facilities and includes several wind tunnels that are unlike any other in the world.  AEDC routinely provides aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic ground testing to evaluate aerodynamic and propulsion system performance under hypersonic conditions.  Its facilities are used to test the flight and materials behavior of all atmospheric reentry vehicles, trans-atmospheric interceptors, and access-to-space flight systems.  One of the more aggressive AEDC facilities is Hypervelocity Wind Tunnel No. 9 (Tunnel 9) located at White Oak, Maryland.  Tunnel 9 provides aerodynamic simulation critical to hypersonic system and vehicle technologies. The Tunnel 9-unique storage heater supplies working fluid at pressures up to 1900 atmospheres and temperatures up to 3650\u00b0R.  The fluid can be used in four axisymmetric, contoured nozzles that operate at Mach 7, 8, 10 and 14 enabling test times on the order of seconds (0.5-15sec).  The combination of operational range and large test cell results in the highest Reynolds number, largest scale ground test facility in the world.  Tunnel 9 is capable of simultaneously collecting continuous force, moment, pressure, and heat transfer data during each run.  Having the ability to test at flight matched Reynolds numbers provides a significant risk reduction for the design and evaluation of hypersonic systems.  Because of the short run times, Tunnel 9 does not employ active cooling in the supply and throat area.  Instead, it relies on high temperature materials and the heat sink capability of the design to survive the extreme pressures and temperatures.  Additionally Tunnel 9 uses nitrogen as the working fluid to minimize oxidation and corrosion of hardware.    The harsh environmental conditions in Tunnel 9 cause performance issues in the throat that are very similar to those found in rocket nozzles, so recently developed missile propulsion technology can be exploited. Based on a Missile Defense Agency (MDA) SBIR in which high temperature materials, fabrication technologies, and design methodologies were developed and demonstrated, the proposed program will develop Tunnel 9 components with improved performance and extended life capability, while also reducing facility operational cost. The overall goal of the program is to develop a prototype Mach 18 throat section for use in Tunnel 9 that incorporates improvements gained at Mach 14.  The transition effort includes tasks of analysis and component design, fabrication, laboratory scale testing, and delivery of prototype throats that will continue to mature state of the art nozzle technologies.  Materials Research &amp; Design, Inc. (MR &amp; D) and its team of Plasma Processes, Inc. (PPI), Exothermics, Inc., and Southern Research Institute (SoRI) proposes to develop these extended life, high Mach throats for AEDC wind tunnels.  This technology will reduce facility costs, improve flow quality, increase service life of the throat hardware, and expand Tunnel 9 testing capabilities.    BENEFIT:  Based on the success of this program, the materials and design technology can be transitioned to other high energy wind tunnel hardware including AEDC facilities (arc heaters, ATPU, etc.) and the GASL hypersonic air breathing propulsion test cells.",

The transition activities address five needs. A new more compact optical probe for 16T will be enabled by leveraging coherent laser behavior to obtain three-velocity component measurements with excellent spatial resolution through a single transceiver lens design. Second, to avoid the long fiber optics cables required for the SM3LDV for use in the 16T wind tunnel exhibit non-linear phenomena that significantly degrade probe performance, an environment chamber will be constructed to house the photonics cart within the pressure vessel of 16T and reduce test times in  the 16T when using the SM3LDV. Third, the AUR Studio software, largely developed through AEDC SBIR funding, will be upgraded for more ease of post-processing, saving the customer significant labor time for preparation of final test results. To address other needs of the US Air Force, a novel compact probe and linear/rotary traverse system will be developed under this effort for low speed wind tunnel applications at AFRL at WPAFB. Finally, the photodetector package will be improved for immunity to radio frequency interference and for response beyond 500MHz.  BENEFIT:  The SM3LDV implemented into the PWT 16T wind tunnel is a new capability not available at any other facility at the Reynolds number and Mach number conditions achievable. The improvements proposed would greatly improve the reliability of the current technology as well as reducing costs by reducing the amount of time required to analyze test data.",

Most of the suppliers of analog ICs for strategic hardened systems are no longer supporting the parts and processes developed for those programs. Virtually all U.S. strategic assets are faced with such electronics obsolescence problems. Our approach to solving this problem is based on an IC retargeting model which applies Radiation Hard By Design (RHBD) principles in commercial semiconductor foundry processes. This model has gained considerable traction for natural space radiation hardened IC development; we advocate the extension of RHBD and the fabless semiconductor model into the realm of nuclear weapons effects (NWE) hardening. Key elements in the approach we are developing include the enhancement of commercially established EDA flows with radiation effects awareness and rules for hardened by design, and also the use of technology characterization vehicles for extracting radiation-specific effects models and design rules from commercial processes.  BENEFIT:  Our approach will enable reductions in the cost and time for replacing obsolete radiation-hardened parts. In addition to solving obsolete part problems for currently aging systems, our approach will enable obsolescence-resistant approaches to procuring electronics for new space and strategic systems.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  When the inner diameter (ID) of a landing gear aluminum alloy outer cylinder is damaged or worn there is very little that can be done to restore the ID of the cylinder. Consequently, the outer cylinder has to be condemned and taken out of service.   A coating repair for aluminum alloy cylinder IDs that builds thickness, which can be machined to size, would be of great value to the United States Air Force (USAF).     ES3 has completed a considerable amount of testing in both Phase I and II to develop a Magnetron Sputtering System (MSS) process for use in repair of the ID of aluminum landing gear outer cylinders.  Results of testing have shown the MSS performed very well in all of the testing and has great potential to be used in repairing oversized aluminum alloy landing gear outer cylinders.    Phase II.5 will include additional ID wear and load testing, a complete update of prototype equipment, installation cost study, sputtering specification draft as well as initiate performance tracking of sputtered components.  This Phase II.5 effort will prepare for Phase III activities that will focus on the implementation of the MSS process.    BENEFIT:  ES3 expects Phase II.5 tests and PTP to show that ID sputtered aluminum alloy is a perfect material for rebuilding inner diameters of cylindrical aluminum alloy aircraft parts.  The Plug &amp; Coat Deposition device, however, is not limited to applications of aluminum alloys.  Almost any metal or alloy may be deposited on the internal diameter of cylindrical parts.  This ability allows a number of important applications in the civilian sector to be commercialized.  The magnetron sputtering process can also be used to sputter chrome onto the ID of steel outer cylinders.  Sputtering can be used to apply coating of several metallic materials such as nickel, titanium, aluminum, steel, etc.   Chromium replacement is even more important now, as the EPA significantly reduced the hexavalent chrome personal exposure limit (PEL) in January 2006 to a level that requires the hexavalent chrome plating process to be replaced or drastically reduced.  With little alteration, the coating equipment built in Phase II.5 can be used to demonstrate ID chromium replacement for numerous products in numerous arenas.    Oil well sucker pumps have cylindrical pump barrels that historically have chromium plated IDs.   A ceramic chromium material can be sputtered on the pump barrels ID in lieu of chrome plating.   Use of such an ID material is expected to increase oil well sucker pump lifetime by a factor of 5 or more.  This is important to oil well production economics because the removal and replacement of sucker pumps, many times from more than 10,000 feet in depth, is an expensive operation.  Increased lifetime for these pumps lowers the cost of oil from well production.",

Typical panels are constructed with one of several joint types mated to the adjoining panel with through bolts, causing a need for installation and maintenance crews to be both inside and outside during initial assembly and periodic maintenance of the radome. Therefore, the Air Force requires innovative solutions through advanced materials, durable rapid connect fasteners and improved material interface configurations, to reduce the cost and risk associated with the legacy approach.  The results of this effort have addressed these needs and met as well as exceeded the expectations of the user community.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Phase I effort has developed the framework of Assured Vision-Aided Inertial Localization (AVAIL) and demonstrated its feasibility with simulated and experimental data. Phase II will extend AVAIL into a Geo-registration and Image-Aided Navigation Technology (GIANT). The ultimate goal of Phase II is to implement a real-time breadboard prototype of GIANT and demonstrate its operation on a ground vehicle and a small unmanned aerial system. GIANT will maintain consistent observability properties by utilizing a batch-based multi-pose constrained estimation (MPCE) that 1) separates ownship and landmark navigation states via a null-space projection; and, 2) uses the inverse depth parameterization of landmarks to significantly increase the linearity region. Outliers in vision measurement will be mitigated with probabilistic data association filtering (PDAF). PDAF takes into account non-perfect detection of outliers by adaptively computing a probability that an outlier is undetected by statistical gating and weighting vision measurements accordingly. For the extension to geo-registration, MPCE will be augmented with an unscented transform that estimates landmark states using a robust cost function for mitigation of outliers. Phase II will fully develop the GIANT technological approach, will evaluate its performance with experimental data, and will demonstrate system functionality in representative GPS-denied ground and flight environments in real-time.  BENEFIT:  When successfully demonstrated, GIANT has a significant potential for both DoD and civilian markets. For military applications, GIANT technology is directly applicable to precision guided munitions and autonomous aerial vehicles by enabling accurate and robust navigation and guidance capabilities for GPS-denied scenarios.  In addition, accurate characterization of navigation and geo-location uncertainty will enable deployment of computer-vision based algorithms for civilian applications that require known uncertainties. One particular application is the vehicular collaborative navigation for the intelligent transportation systems.  For this application, GIANT will produce the vehicle position estimates and in particular their uncertainties that are critical parameters to generate driver-alert messages and directives in order to avoid property damages and injuries from collisions.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The semiconductor pumped fiber laser has generated considerable interest for High Energy Lasers (HELs)  in a number of BMDS applications including long range sensing, communications and missile defense.  The potential efficiency, compact size and low weight, reliability and ruggedness are attractive for these and other directed energy applications.  A key requirement is the creation and demonstration of all-fiber semiconductor pumped fiber laser designs that in a single gain stage can produce narrow linewidth amplified signals at the multi kW power level with near diffraction limited beam quality.  Central to the creation of these sources is the all fiber pump power combiner.  Reliable operation at multi kW power levels and the need for efficient multi kW pump integration requires the use of active gain fibers with large pump cladding diameters.  These large pump cladding diameters in turn require the combination of several pump fibers with an even larger input bundle diameter.  In addition the core must be transferred through the combiner, adapting to the larger core of the active fiber while preserving the polarization extinction ratio of the input signal.  Finally the combiner needs to be integrated with advanced gain fibers in a near diffraction limited counter pumped configuration, and packaged in a robust manner that is thermally robust and stable.  While all-fiber combiners exist commercially, they are of low input bundle diameters, are co-pumped, cannot provide the mode adaption necessary for large gain cores, and cannot handle multi-kW power levels.   What is truly needed is a systems approach to DE fiber laser pump integration that seamlessly integrates multi kW levels of pump light simultaneously in both the co and counter pumped directions in both LMS step index fiber and  Photonic Crystal Fiber  Optical Engines has accomplished many different things during the phase 1 program including delivering 2 counter pumped fiber combiners and has made numerous improvements to the underlying processes and materials.  This effort has created a foundation to develop a counter pumping combiner efficiently interfacing to high performance advanced PCF gain fiber.  BENEFIT:  Creating a counter pumped combiner for PCF fiber will improve the SBS and MI performance of a kW amplifier by over 3dB for both cases.  This will allow for higher powers to be achieved per channel, lowering the number of channels required by the system and greatly reducing the complexity of the system resulting in substantial SWaP reductions and cost savings.",

Our Phase 1 Generalized Phased Array Weapon System Beam Director Development (GPAWS-BDD) program completed a detailed optical and mechanical design for a conformal phased array laser weapon system based on requirements developed for the Nutornics High Energy Laser Phased Array System (HELPAS-N) design.  In addition we completed environmental temperature/pressure analysis, power handling thermal analysis, and vibration analysis for up to 10 g RMS vibration environments.  Through this design process Nutronics identified critical risk areas that limit continued development of a conformal phased array laser weapon system.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The concept of fully adaptive radar (FAR) seeks to exploit all available degrees of freedom on transmit and receive in order to maximize radar system performance. Of key importance is the concept of closed loop radar operation via feedback from the receiver to transmitter for guiding the next illumination.  The first goal of this project is to develop a cognitive radar system definition that identifies key components of cognitive radar, provides formal definitions for those components, and relates them to concepts in cognition.  The second goal is to develop a theoretical framework for a FAR system that includes specification of the feedback mechanism from the receiver to the transmitter and specification of performance metrics to assess FAR system performance.  The third goal is to develop application-specific models, simulations, and analysis methods to demonstrate and measure the performance improvement achieved by FAR systems over standard feed-forward radar systems.  The fourth goal is to demonstrate the real-time operation of a FAR system on a cognitive radar testbed in a laboratory setting.  BENEFIT:  Radar systems are crucial for robust surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance in all weather conditions and over wide ranges of interest. Most radar systems employ a feed-forward processing chain in which they first perform some low-level processing of received echo data and then pass the processed data on to some higher-level processor, which extracts information to achieve a system objective.  The concept of fully adaptive radar seeks to exploit all available degrees of freedom on transmit and receive in order to maximize radar system performance. The application of artificial cognition to radar systems thus offers much promise for improved sensing as well as the creation of new sensing modalities.  Research into cognitive systems is currently in its infancy and the results of this project will help define the field.  The modeling, simulation, analysis, and experimentation tools developed under this project are quite general.  As such, they can be applied to a variety of radar systems for a variety of missions, and can be translated into other domains such as computing, autonomous vehicles, and perhaps even neuroscience and evolutionary biology.  The project will develop the fundamental tools necessary to design and analyze a cognitive processing system, and will enable further research in the abovementioned diverse fields.",

The central tenet of the proposed approach will be formation of a graph where the nodes will be a group of images and these nodes will be connected to each other if there is a spatial or temporal connectivity. Furthermore, the development in Phase II will leverage Phase I develop-ments, specifically the robust online SFM system, which was successfully tested on multiple da-tasets such as CLIF 2007, MAMI and synthetic datasets, and (ii) the demonstrated feasibility of the dynamic graph- representation to handle large amounts of image data and variable camera geometry constraints. The proposed system is a plugin-based framework which will allow each of the components to be replaced by different implementations or algorithms to allow the system to work flexibly under different operating conditions.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  In recent years, diversification of energy dependence on foreign oil has attracted the use of alternative fuels such as the Fischer-Tropsch jet fuels and hydro-treated renewable jet fuels.  However, there are combustion stability issues with alternative fuels in the aircraft engines including augmentors.  In addition, the U.S. military has been using JP-8 as the single battle field fuel to power both diesel engines and generators for electricity. However, operating compression ignition engines with JP-8 have encountered various technical and performance related issues.  Therefore, it is important to study the effect of chemical and physical properties of JP-8 and alternative fuels on combustion at conditions relevant to augmentors and diesel engines.  Combustion Science & Engineering, Inc. (CSE) has developed a detailed surrogate kinetic mechanism to model the combustion characteristics of jet fuels including alternative fuels.  In the current work, CSE will acquire new experimental data at low pressure augmentor conditions as well as high pressure diesel engines conditions with jet fuel and it surrogate components.  These experimental data will be used to improve and validate the CSE surrogate kinetic mechanism for wide range of conditions including augmentors and diesel engines with vitiation.  BENEFIT:  The ultimate result of this research will be a comprehensive chemical kinetic mechanism that can be used for predicting combustion properties of petroleum-based jet fuels as well alternative fuels.  CSE has developed a four-component surrogate kinetic model for augmentor conditions with vitiation in an earlier SBIR.  This model will be improved and validated against the experimental data obtained in the current work at low pressure augmentor conditions as well as high pressure diesel engines conditions.  This detailed surrogate mechanism will benefits U.S. Military to evaluate the combustion properties of various jet fuels where experimental data are not available. In addition the detail kinetic model that will be developed in this work will be incorporated into the rkmGen software, which has been under development through an Air Force funded SBIR with CSE.  rkmGen is a GUI-driven chemical kinetic software that can be used for various chemical kinetic computations including the development of reduced kinetic models. Therefore, outcome of this work will benefits the OEMs as well as CFD users and vendors.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI), in collaboration with F-35 Prime Contractor Lockheed Martin Aerospace Corp. (LM Aero), proposes to build, develop, test, and evaluate a sensor system for measuring and reporting in real-time the oxygen concentration in the fuel tank ullage of advanced tactical aircraft such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Previously, PSI developed, and advanced to TRL 5, an ullage O2 sensor designed for use in transport aircraft. Based on that design, in Phase I, PSI, with LM Aero and Air Force guidance, developed requirements, a system architecture, and a design concept for adapting the sensor to deployment in tactical aircraft. Because the size, weight and configuration requirements for tactical aircraft installation are significantly more stringent than for transport aircraft, novel advances in key components of the sensor are required. These components are now at TRL3. They are supported by other commercial industrial components (TRL 9 for their industrial applications). In the proposed Phase II project, PSI intends to advance the O2 sensor system technology to TRL 6 for tactical aircraft applications by fabricating a sensor system and subjecting it to intensive performance and validation testing at the LM Aero F35 Fuel System Simulator Test Facility.  BENEFIT:  The real-time O2 sensor resulting from the proposed R&D will: a) improve aircraft safety by providing continual pilot awareness of fuel tank inerting status; b) enable closed-loop feedback control of NEA thereby enhancing efficient use of engine bleed air for cooling aircraft systems, c) increase the mission readiness rate and reduce flight preparation costs by informing ground crews when inerting service is needed or not; and d) provide early indications of maintenance requirements or OBIGGS system malfunction. An oxygen sensor system meeting Air Force and Prime Contractor specifications will be the first product resulting from this project. A similar product will also serve: a) the civilian aviation market, where inerting systems are now required to be installed in several new construction civilian aircraft, ranging from jumbo to regional jets, and retrofitted to much of the existing airliner fleet; and b) non-aviation markets where oxygen is monitored to preclude explosion of fuel and other hydrocarbon storage tanks. Within military aviation, it is estimated that at least 2000 sensor units will be needed. Markets of similar size are likely for non-aviation applications.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  A robust back-up navigation alternative is needed to continue to provide accurate PVT data when GPS is denied.  Navigation solutions can be enhanced by utilizing existing networked communications for dismounted forces operating in small platoons.  When some of the forces lose their GPS signals, traditional GPS-denied network positioning techniques such as Time of Arrival (TOA) or Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) have been employed previously.  Unfortunately these techniques require extremely tight time synchronization among the sensor nodes; and such a synchronization requirement has previously been too stringent to be reasonably met by man-portable hardware due to SWaP constraints.     Under this effort we shall build a prototype Distributed Networked Opportunistic Positioning system (DiNO-Pos) using a network or Software Defined Radios (SDRs) that can create TOA and TDOA observations from signals of opportunity (SoOP).  We shall collect live data in a GPS jamming environment to demonstrate the ability to perform back-up navigation, geolocate SoOPs and also maintain tight time synchronization between reference nodes in a GPS denied environment.  The expected performance of an operational DiNO-Pos system, providing the capability to provide assured PNT under GPS-denied conditions, will be included in the final report with transition opportunities into tactical SDR operations.  BENEFIT:  The NAVSYS DiNO-Pos (Distributed Network Opportunistic Positioning) technology will achieve high PNT assurance in GPS-denied environments that will increase military operational effectiveness and save lives.

As demonstrated by the Geodesic Dome Phased Array Antenna (GDPAA) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) effort, the success of this endeavor rests heavily upon the development of a low cost subarray architecture. Under this proposed effort, Alpha Omega Electromagnetics (AOE) will demonstrate, with hardware, a very low cost planar subarray architecture that will provide equivalent performance to the current state-of-the-art L- and S-band subarray developed by AOE under the GDPAA ATD program and the Advanced Electronic Components for Sensor Arrays (AECSA) program. The results of this demonstration will yield a subarray architecture with a very high readiness level that will be suitable for use in a GDPAA for AFSCN as well as many other phased array applications.

This array will be capable of providing multiple links to simultaneously support several control operations ranging from low altitude to geostationary satellites at different directions.  The resulting subarray technology should have far reaching applications including serving as a basic building block of an ESA for the air and space traffic control as well as satellite communication. An additional application of the aperture technology developed under this SBIR will be for mobile applications where the subarray (or groups of subarrays) alone will serve as the complete functional antenna.",

Antennas included controlled radiation pattern antennas (CRPAs) consisting of four to seven elements, plus a distributed aperture array with four asymmetrically arranged elements. The distributed array provided the best accuracy because it provides the largest effective aperture.    The proposed Phase-II effort will design, build, test, and deliver distributed aperture arrays with up to 12 GNSS-band elements, off-the-shelf 12-channel digital receivers covering the GPS L1 and L2 bands, and a data processing/display/user-interface system to DF one or more jammers and to display and track the jammer location through a Windows based GUI.    The array and receiver system will be suitable for testing on a UAV or ground vehicle. The system will be tested in Toyons anechoic chamber, but will ultimately be field tested at Government sites such as White Sands Missile Range. We also plan to test CRPA antennas from Phase I, since they will be plug compatible with our receiver and processing system and may be useful themselves as anti-jam GPS antennas in conjunction with jammer-location platforms.  BENEFIT:  Toyons approach to this SBIR focuses on developing a distributed aperture array, an accompanying set of receiver and signal processing electronics, and a user friendly GUI to display the estimated jammer locations. Toyons distributed aperture array has the potential to provide geolocation estimation accuracies that are higher quality compared to if a conventional CRPA were used. Toyons multi-channel electronics system is compatible with both distributed aperture arrays and conventional CRPAs.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  The development of weapons that can travel at hypersonic speeds is becoming a high priority to the US Air Force.  A key technology needed for the continued development of these propulsion systems is the ability to cool the combustor by flowing fuel through channels machined in the walls.  Currently, the cooling capacity of kerosene-based fuels is relatively low even with endothermic cracking reactions, and this limits the Mach number that can be achieved.  Moreover, increasing the fuel cooling capacity by allowing the fuel to reach higher temperatures is not feasible because coke formation could lead to heat exchanger failure.  Therefore, there is a strong need to develop new endothermic fuels that can deliver substantially higher heat sink capacities.  In the Phase I project Reaction Systems identified a fuel and catalyzed endothermic reaction that produced a high chemical endotherm at high temperature with no measurable coke deposition and showed that high heat fluxes can be obtained in the catalyzed heat exchanger.  The goal of the Phase II project is to measure and refine the design of the fuel/catalyst heat exchanger performance under more representative conditions and demonstrate that the system can be used effectively in hypersonic vehicles.  BENEFIT:  The US Air Force recognizes that developing weapons that can cover 600 nautical miles in 10 minutes or less (speeds of Mach 5 and greater) is essential to its war fighting capabilities and that reliable scramjet propulsion systems are needed in support this objective.  A critical technology required in the continued development of scramjets is obtaining the required cooling in the combustor.  The endothermic fuel system being developed in this Phase II program provides higher heat sink capacity to sustain higher flight Mach numbers while also providing improved ignition and flameholding properties compared to JP-7.  This technology can be used to develop a new class of weapons and aircraft with global reach and game-changing capabilities that include precise targeting, rapid long range response, and better survivability against ballistic missile and space defenses.    Initially, the technology developed in this project will be particularly well-suited for the new Air Force High Speed Strike Weapon (HSSW) missile program, and this will probably be the first product to incorporate this new fuel system.  There are also additional research programs being started, such as a new Navy sea-launched hypersonic missile study and Lockheed-Martins SR-72  an updated SR-71 for a Mach 6 dual ISR (Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance) and Strike aircraft that could also lead to the implementation of our high performance endothermic fuel blend.",

        "abstract": "Significant controversy exists among the scientific community and industry specialists as to whether mouth guards help mitigate concussive forces in impact events. To this end, a standardized methodology for testing mouth guard material solutions will be developed and presented to the Government. In Phase I, the benefit of employing a material solution between the upper and lower dentition in a specific blunt impact scenario was validated. This was accomplished by testing selected materials in a blunt impact scenario which was limited to a direct impact to the bottom of the chin. In Phase II, a wider range of impacts  including blast events  will be added to the testing scenario to examine a more generalized case. A process of design, engineering, prototyping and simulation to develop a mass-producible mouth guard product suitable for military use will also be undertaken. This product will be fine-tuned based on advanced materials and anthropomorphic research as well as results from physical and analytical testing. In addition to the military arena, such a product would have widespread suitability in various sports applications.",

There is also an emerging need for improved EES technology in the commercial electric power industry, where it is needed for integrating with variable output renewable sources such as wind and solar, and for both distributed and centralized siting in support of a more efficient and smart electricity generation and distribution grid.

TIAX has already demonstrated the inherent ability of advanced active materials to deliver the levels of performance required in such a hybrid device, and the proposed program will demonstrate feasibility of developing an energy storage device that incorporates these materials to deliver that performance, and to do so with technologies that will yield manufacturing cost of less than $500 per kWh.",

The UNTRAS mechanical and electronic design developed in Phase I comprises two battery-operated units: a diver operated handheld detector (HHD) and a beacon ELF transceiver (BETR) that is placed inside the standard beacon housing. The BETRs receiver remotely receives command signals from the HHD in order for the transmitter to emit optimal ELFs/ELF combinations for drill head tracking. The HHD incorporates an ELF receiver based on POCs magnetic field processing modules and an ELF command transmitter to remotely control the BETR to generate frequencies required for tracking. Phase Is electronic design and ruggedized, watertight packaging for underwater usage allows UNTRAS compatibility with standard horizontal directional drilling (HDD) systems. In Phase II, the UNTRAS design will be further refined and optimized, and POC will build a full-scale system engineering prototype to test in a near-relevant environment. Based on test results, the system prototype will be modified for a final test and evaluation at near-relevant environment to demonstrate its readiness for field testing.",

Innovations in durable air muscles enable realistic repeated body movements in a flame-filled environment to accurately test the functionality of protective clothing under thermal and mechanical stress. As a result, this innovative technology will allow accurate testing of the functionality of protective clothing under thermal and mechanical stress, directly addressing platform requirements. In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of ARTHESEMA by fabricating a partial prototype, consisting of an articulated thermal sensing arm. This arm is currently in use at the Navy Clothing and Textile Research facility in Natick, MA.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Nanohmics proposes to develop the FlashLED, a reusable extended artificial light source. Using commercial off the shelf (COTS) light emitting diodes (LEDs) and custom optics, it is possible to create a lighting system that matches the luminous output of the flash bulb with triggerability and intensity rise-time on the nanosecond timescale. The complete system will be expandable and offer synchronization between the flash units via both wired and wireless pathways. COTS white LEDs are tightly binned for spectral output in a wide variety of color temperatures, including 3800K, and monochromatic versions are available for special imaging applications. The reusable nature of the system combined with the fast rise times of LEDs also allow for the flash to fire multiple times per test in synchronicity with the image acquisition. The solid state nature of the LEDs and their drive electronics allow them to withstand high mechanical shock values induced by passing rocket sleds or explosions. Additionally, each unit will have an easily replaceable sheet, constructed from impact resistant polymer, to protect the custom optic from damage by shrapnel generated from a test event. BENEFIT: Flash illumination is a complex and varied market with hundreds of use cases and almost as many ways to create flashes, whether the lamp is dedicated to a single task or multiple tasks in a single device. Frost & Sullivan put the strobe illumination market at $2.25 billion in 2009. This includes all major uses from personal and commercial to scientific and filming. The scientific and technical markets are likely between $100M-200M per year. Markets for flash illumination include Military, Automotive, Industrial/Environmental, Food Industry, Manufacturing, Filming and Medical.\n",

        "abstract": "\"ABSTRACT: Modern electronic and opto-electronic devices are predicated on controlled deposition and patterning of functional material layers (e.g. semiconductors, conductors, and dielectrics).  A handful of techniques, including vacuum epitaxy and chemical vapor deposition, in conjunction with lithographic micromachining methods, have long dominated the manufacture of these systems, particularly as feature critical dimensions are driven further into the nanoscale.  While these techniques are well-established and routinely deliver reliable and excellent performance, they are expensive to operate and maintain and are relegated to the processing of rigid, planar substrates.\nA host of new integrated optics and photonics technologies stand to benefit from transitioning the successes of vacuum thin film deposition and lithographic patterning to a mass-producible, conformable optoelectronic device manufacturing platform. Critical to this transformation will be the ability to use low-cost conventional printing technologies to pattern precursors of active-layer materials (e.g. semiconductors with high refractive indices) onto a variety of substrates and subsequently \u201cconsolidate\u201d the precursors into photonic circuit components (waveguides, splitters, modulators, amplifiers, filters) and electro-optical devices (energy harvesting devices, conformal antennas, and infrared emitter and sensor arrays, for example).  In some applications, a small performance tradeoff may be acceptable for a significant cost savings, but the patterned and consolidated end product performance ultimately must be comparable to its high-cost, traditionally-manufactured counterpart.\nTo enable high-throughput, low-cost manufacturing of photonic circuitry, Nanohmics, Inc., an electro-optics and early-stage-technology development company based in Austin, TX, working in collaboration with industrial and academic partners have formulated a class of high-refractive-index-material inks and developed methods for in-line, direct-write printing and consolidation of the inks into photonic circuit components on large-area, continuous webs.\"\n",

        "abstract": "\"ABSTRACT: Bioassays employed to evaluate the diverse range of biomarkers associated with organ injury are time-consuming, costly and require multiple instruments/testing formats to reach a diagnosis (i.e. fluorescence-based capture, ELISAs, PCR, etc.). Individually, these platforms are incapable of predicting the onset of irreversible organ tissue injury (e.g. kidney, liver, heart and lung). If a single multiplexed screening bioassay could be fabricated to assess multiple, pre-clinical biomarkers that are predictive indicators of systemic toxicity, it would significantly reduce the complexity, expense and turnaround time associated with injured soldier diagnostics.\nOne barrier to transitioning microarray technology into multiplex medicinal diagnostics has been the limitations imposed by fluorescence/optical-based labeling and endpoint detection. To overcome these limitations, Nanohmics Inc., an early-stage biotechnology and sensor development company (Austin, TX), working in collaboration with commercial and University partners is proposing the continued development of a multiplexed diagnostic platform based on direct electrical detection of pre-clinical and eventually clinical toxicity biomarkers for predictive organ tissue injury. The overall goal of the program is to develop a tissue injury diagnostic platform that can assess biomarkers originating from diverse biospecimens (e.g. urine, blood plasma) in a single compact detection system.\n\"\n",

The two key attributes of the proposed novel GaN growth technique (a bulk crystal growth technique) are: a high growth rate and an ability to achieve a superior crystal quality.  The novel GaN crystal growth technique can achieve a growth rate significantly higher than that can be achieved using any existing GaN crystal growth technique, including a state-of-the-art hydride vapor phase expitaxy (HVPE) technique.  As a result, GaN single crystal boules and wafers will be produced at a low cost and at a high throughput.  The novel GaN growth technique, by design, has the capability to reduce dislocation densities to less than 10E4 cm-2 in GaN crystal boules, which enables fabrication of high-performance GaN high-power devices.  In addition, the novel growth technique is scalable to produce GaN single crystal boules and wafers of large diameters.  Fairfield Crystal team will grow GaN single crystal boules and then fabricate GaN wafers.

The proposed concept improves the overall system PGE over state-of-the-art SI gensets due to (1) SACI combustion of NG with limited flame propagation at high compression ratios (CR), increased specific heat ratios due to dilution with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), reduced cylinder heat transfer losses by ensuring lower combustion temperatures and by avoiding flame quenching in the cylinder walls, ICE downspeeding (also increases component life) to operate at higher torques for a given power, (2) WER from the ICE exhaust using an ORC with a positive-displacement scroll expander (SE), specially designed for a thermodynamically optimal working fluid (WF), and (3) an induction generator with >95% efficiency. A liquid-cooled Spark Ignition (SI) ICE modified for SACI operation will be the first-choice prime mover for this concept. Salient features include: high CR~12-14, dilution and thermal stratification with EGR, optimized intake passages and piston geometry from CFD studies. The proposed ORC WER system utilizes a regenerator for preheating the WF before superheating it in an ICE exhaust heat exchanger to maximize ORC system efficiency and to increase SE power output. With this surplus power compounded to the ICE crankshaft, the overall fuel conversion efficiency (FCE) to mechanical power can be dramatically improved even with NG operation to produce a robust 1 kWe electric power generation system. The proposed system utilizes the excess energy of the coolant exiting the engine cylinder block/head to provide hot water on demand.

        "abstract": "Recent research suggests there are opportunities to enhance driver hazard anticipation and avoidance,\nwhich could in turn dramatically impact public safety. For example, the fatality rate per 100 million vehicle\nmiles among 16 year old drivers is some ten times higher than it is among those between the ages of 45\nand 55. However, hazard-related training has traditionally been difficult to accomplish, with classroom\nexercises lacking impact and experiential components, and real-world driving experiences hard to\nconstrain and keep safe.\nThe purpose of LookOut is to create a real-time, scenario-based desktop/handheld driving simulator that\nhelps drivers with differing backgrounds (e.g., age, experience) gain greater awareness of hazards and\nsafely avoid them. A simulator, an underlying training paradigm for hazard anticipation/detection and\navoidance that is implemented in the simulator, and a database of hazards/scenarios that will be used in\nconjunction with it are being created. The system will leverage video game technology and realistic\nvehicle models/physics, and run on standard PC computers (and handheld tablets) using very low-cost\nsteering controllers, and, optionally, a low cost eye tracker.",

        "abstract": "Welding of HPS70W is well understood when using submerged arc welding (SAW) and shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) techniques. A Welding Advisory Group (WAG) which consisted of technical advisors from the Navy, AISI, and FHWA, major filler metal manufacturers, and steel producers determined the guidelines for welding HPS70W. As a result, comprehensive guidelines and welding procedures exist for SAW and SMAW methods. While SAW methods produce high quality welds in high performance steels, innovative welding methods are being sought in the marine, transportation, oil and gas industries to replace SAW due to the extensive time required to weld thick joints. For example, in bridge fabrication butt splices between standard mill plates with plate thickness greater than 3 inches can take up to 15 hours to weld depending on the length of the girder flange. The overall objective of Phase II is to demonstrate that the HLAW cost benefit related to the reduced labor, welding consumables, and distortion merit investment in high capital cost HLAW equipment.",

        "abstract": "This effort is advancing the development of a nondestructive evaluation (NDE) tool for quantitative assessment of highway bridge coatings, the Infrared Coating Inspection System (IR\u2010CIS). The IR\u2010CIS can be used to improve decision\u2010making regarding over\u2010coating or recoating of bridges, by better and more fully quantifying the current condition of coatings in ways not possible using only visual assessments.  The tool can provide critical data regarding the need for and anticipated benefit of spot\u2010coating strategies intended to extend the life of coating systems by only recoating critical portions of a bridge.\nSuch spot\u2010coating strategies can be ineffective if the degree and extent of existing damage is not properly identified, and the IR\u2010CIS tool can greatly improve this process. The tool can also play a role in quality control testing for field\u2010applied coatings, detecting early on\u2010set of corrosion resulting from ineffective surface preparations. This project will refine the IR\u2010CIS instrument to make a smaller, more efficient design that is easier to setup and use. Collaborative work with State DOTs will result in procedures for implementation. The measurement capabilities of the instrument will be extended by extensively quantifying thermal properties of bridge coatings and adding the ability to measure coating thickness.",

        "abstract": "With this research, we would like to provide new materials joining methods to the DOT.  This will be achieved with a pulse energy store that has already demonstrated game changing capability in welding a wide variety of metals and alloys.  The process we are proposing is known as Homopolar Welding.  The weld is created by a solid state fusion welding process whereby high current is passed through the weld interface until the metal reaches forging temperature and then an upset force is applied to the weld interface to complete the process.  Some of the steels welded with this process are API 5L Grade X52, X60, and X65.  Although they are pipeline steel, they meet the requirements of high performance steel and give confidence that bridge steel will also be welded with good results with this process.  Typical test results analyzed from welds of the Nippon X65 series material include tensile yield strengths between 71 and 81 ksi with ductile fracture location predominantly in the parent material.  Hardness test results in the heat affected zone demonstrate minimum values ranging from 163 to 175 HV10.  In Charpy V notch testing, a mean value of 91 ft-lb was recorded.",

        "abstract": "A key capability of Intelligent Transportation Systems is communications between the vehicles and the infrastructure and between the vehicles themselves. In particular, vehicles on the roadways carry a wealth of information on their position and velocity that, when aggregated with that from many other vehicles, provides a rich resource for traffic management. The key component is accurate vehicle position at speed. In this study, we will show that accurate position is achievable via mobile devices. \n\nWe propose to implement a mobile application on an Androids phone that will enable the application to compute vehicle positions, while the vehicle is moving at 65 MPH, with accuracy of 10 feet or less. This implementation will be based on formula and finding from DTR57-12-C-10019, FHWA, SBIR Phase 2, 10.2-FH3-001 study. The key to this implementation is obtaining vehicle speed and heading in real time. We propose to obtain this real-time data via OBDII device connecting to the vehicle OBD port sending out data wirelessly via Bluetooth communications. We propose to record the vehicle position in longitude and latitude together with UTC time and store the data locally in the mobile phone, and at user request, send the data to online server for analysis.",
